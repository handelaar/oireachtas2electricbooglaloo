    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the representations he made to the Senate of the National University of Ireland, concerning the possibility of conferring an honorary degree on President Reagan; if he will indicate the reasons for the representations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following consultations between interested parties, my Department, in accordance with precedent, conveyed a request from me to the Registrar of the National University of Ireland asking that the NUI consider the granting of an honorary degree to President Reagan during his visit to Ireland in June.  In view of the close relations between Ireland and the USA, the large Irish ethnic population in the US and the very active role played by US investment in the Irish economy, I am pleased that the NUI has decided to mark this important occasion in such an appropriate fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach tells us that this decision follows consultation <Col N="270" /> between interested parties and is in accordance with precedent but can he tell us what is the precedent involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of precedents for such awards.  Between the years 1963 and 1982 there were a number of such occasions, namely, the conferring of honorary degrees on the late President Kennedy of the US, on President Kaunda of Zambia, on President Radhakrishnan of India and on President Reddy, also of India.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach adopting exactly the same procedure in this case as the procedure adopted on these other occasions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information at my disposal relates most immediately to the last occasion which was the conferring of an honorary degree on President Reddy. The others relate to 20 years ago.  In the last case the arrangement was similar in that there was a request from the Taoiseach to the NUI.  That has been the procedure adopted on this occasion also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Newspaper reports seem to indicate that the Senate of the NUI did not have this matter on their agenda.  Consequently, I am wondering why this was the case if, as the Taoiseach says, the precedent being adopted on this occasion is similar to that adopted on other occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be a separate question and one that does not arise here.  I am calling Question No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely inquiring&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if the Taoiseach would give an indication of the specific policy on which he considers the awarding of an NUI honorary degree to be merited in the case of President Reagan. Can the Taoiseach tell us what degree is <Col N="271" /> to be awarded to the President of the US?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would regard that as a matter for another forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant to the question which relates to the awarding of an honorary degree.  I am anxious to find out what degree will be awarded to Mr. Reagan and on what basis it is being awarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given reasons for this course being considered to be appropriate and I would add from my personal knowledge, though perhaps it is not for me as Taoiseach to say so, that frequently it is the case that an honorary degree is awarded to honour the position that happens to be held by the person concerned at the time while in other cases the award is made on the basis of the personal achievement of the person concerned. However, these are academic matters which should not disturb the equanimity of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the action, if any, the Government propose to take to implement the recommendations of the National Planning Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have initiated an intensive review of all of the proposals of the National Planning Board covering their strategic validity, feasibility, costing and employment implications. They will in the very near future initiate consultations with the social partners on the board's recommendations. Based on both, the Government will take the decisions necessary to meet their economic and social objectives especially that of reversing the rise in unemployment. <Col N="272" /> They will publish those decisions as a national plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering the title of the proposals &mdash; proposals for a plan &mdash; and that more than 18 months ago the Government promised immediate and effective action to deal with unemployment and also in the light of our having had a plethora of reports, analyses and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting a question. We have had these various reports and analyses from the ESRI, from sectoral committees, from the Committee on Taxation and from Telesis as well as White Papers on industrial strategy, but is there any possibility that the Government will do as the members of the Board ask them to do in very clear language, that is, to get up off their posteriors, take action and introduce a plan as was their obligation 18 months ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that our intention is to do so, having considered the recommendations of the board, but we are concerned to produce a plan that will be realistic, serious and decisive and not to replicate past efforts by other Governments, efforts which had the most damaging effect by setting imaginary targets, misleading people into investment plans at a cost of perhaps some hundreds of millions of pounds and otherwise disrupting the economy.  Neither do we propose to produce a plan which will have the word &ldquo;envisage&rdquo; five times on the one page.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect that either the House or the nation will be reassured by the Taoiseach's reference to a plan that will be realistic, serious and decisive.  He is hardly expected to produce a plan that will be unrealistic, frivolous and indecisive.  This Government have been marked by such characteristics in any event.  Does the Taoiseach not recognise that it is a fundamental role of Government to have a plan from day one <Col N="273" /> for dealing with the issues facing the nation?  These issues were underlined clearly in recent indications where, for instance, it was revealed that the numbers claiming unemployment benefit are now 20,000 more than the number engaged in manufacturing industry, where those employed in manufacturing industry are now fewer than was the case in 1966?  Does the Taoiseach not recognise that the fact that there is no plan after the Government have been in office for two years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We must have a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is a total abrogation of their responsibility in terms of what must be their most fundamental task, that is, the creation of a climate for investment activity and employment?  All the time the unemployment problem is worsening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would emphasise that in advance of the publication of any plan the Government have restored confidence in the economy and in the financial viability of the State, confidence that had been gravely undermined by the previous administration in both of their incarnations. It is on that basis and the restoration of confidence that we have a solid foundation upon which to build in the plan which we are now preparing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not recognise that one of the differences between his party and ours in Opposition is that when the Taoiseach was in Opposition he and his Ministers travelled outside the State in an attempt to undermine confidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Taoiseach said the State was being undermined. Does the Taoiseach not recognise that there is very serious concern here because of unemployment, falling investment and the inability of the Government to reach agreement to bring forward a <Col N="274" /> comprehensive plan which should have been there from their first day in office? When are we going to see such a plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the imputation that I or any member of the Government of either party at any stage travelled outside the country with a view to undermining the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to these questions I will deal <Col N="277" /> with short rotation forestry for energy purposes as it relates to my Department.</P>
    <P>The available evidence suggests that forestry for energy purposes may have economic potential on land which is marginal for conventional agriculture.  There are extensive areas of such land, but before promoting large scale afforestation for energy purposes, it is necessary to demonstrate in practice that energy crops are an economic proposition.</P>
    <P>There are at present two projects underway, both with the object of testing the economic practicality of short rotation forestry.</P>
    <P>The larger project is being conducted by Bord na Móna, the Forestry and Wildlife Service and the ESB, under the coordination of the National Board for Science and Technology.  This project aims at planting various species of trees on 600 hectares, mainly of bogland.  The cost was estimated in 1979 at £9.21 million, of which the EEC agreed to contribute up to £3.15 million.  In the event, expenditure to date has been £3.36 million, of which the EEC have paid £1.28 million. The project is now in its fourth year. Growth to date is very disappointing and well below the projected economic level. Studies are being made to find the reasons for the poor performance.</P>
    <P>The second demonstration project is being conducted by An Foras Talúntais, with assistance from the National Board for Science and Technology.  This project aims at developing private plantations on the wet mineral soils of County Leitrim. Results to date have been mixed on this project also, although it is as yet too early to assess its long term prospects.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these two projects cover a wide range of the tree and soil types most likely to offer good prospects for energy crop development.  Until they are completed and assessed, I do not propose to establish any further forestry biomass projects, as it is not yet certain what commercial future exists for energy crops in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to private afforestation, £18 million was allocated over a ten year period.  However, during the last two years a sum of £61,000 was <Col N="278" /> taken up one year and £74,000 the following year.

If the present attitude of the ESB is continued we will have nowhere to burn them.  The Minister for Energy has a duty to answer the question which I put to him in all good faith.</P>

      <P>The questions relate to energy crops.  As I said in my reply, there are at present two projects under way, both with the object of testing the economic <Col N="279" /> practicality of short rotation forestry for energy purposes.  I indicated in my reply that to date the results have been disappointing.  I must explain to the House that we are in the experimental stage only with regard to biomass production. Until such time as the results of these projects are fully assessed and their economic viability from an energy point of view fully understood, I cannot explain their relevance to the power stations.</P>

I have answered the questions asked and I have expressed a certain amount of disappointment.  Perhaps we are starting on the wrong premise.  Perhaps we should be experimenting by growing biomass on very good land to see what the results would be.  As I have emphasised in my reply, we are in the experimental stage only and until the two projects are fully assessed we will not be able to approach the matter from a commercial point of view.</P>

      <P>Yes.  There are three main reasons why we have not had the success we expected.  One is the poor growth rate.  That is the main reason. Expenditure on these projects has not reached the expected level because of the poor growth rate and a decision by the ESB to convert an existing boiler rather than to build a new one.  There was a failure to develop a harvest machine. These are the reasons why expenditure on the biomass projects have not reached the estimates made some years ago.</P>

The Minister says he is not responsible. If he is not, he should at least consult with the Department of Forestry or transfer the question to another Minister. We are now told by the Minister about poor growth.  Is he aware that we had two very costly studies carried out <Col N="281" /> with EEC funds, both of which indicated the benefits which could be derived in the disadvantaged region of Leitrim-Cavan-Monaghan because it is a high growth area for forestry and biomass, especially biomass, and we are now told that is not the case.</P>

      <P>The wind machine on Inis Oirr is the largest of six machines, the purchase and installation of which were funded by my Department, to investigate the wind potential in a number of locations and the suitability of particular machines for Irish conditions.</P>
      <P>The purchase cost of the Inis Oirr machine was £95,513 and the engineering design and installation cost a further £77,220.  The cost of maintenance and data monitoring since installation has also been funded by my Department.</P>
      <P>The machine has not operated efficiently other than for short periods.  The basic objective of the experimental demonstration project on Inis Oirr was to test the feasibility of providing up to onethird of the island's power requirements by a wind machine of this size and design. So far the machine has not maintained a level of performance which would justify the conclusion that this objective can be achieved, within reasonable limits of reliability, by current wind machine technology. The remote location of this machine and the fact that many repairs cannot be carried out locally has added to the maintenance problems.  Faults arising have, of course, been repaired under the manufacturers guarantee.  Since completion of the project in February 1982, our engineers and the suppliers have been continuously improving the control mechanism of the machine with a view to obtaining greater reliability.  The project has been very materially assisted by the help and understanding afforded by the people of Inis Oirr and the co-operative there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An experimental demonstration programme such as this is, by definition, intended to test the feasibility of the concept and the suitability of equipment and to that extent significant and recurring problems may be expected.  However, even allowing for this, it is clear at this stage that there must be significant question marks about the suitability of available wind machines for the conditions which obtain in exposed, isolated locations in Ireland.  Any proposals for the installation of further wind machines <Col N="283" /> must await more experience of the existing demonstration programme and, I believe, further research, development and perfection of the available machinery. I intend, however, to pursue the present demonstration programme for which a grant of up to £158,000 has been awarded to my Department by the EEC towards the cost of continuing the programme for the next two years.</P>

      <P>My Department have spent over £900,000 over the past three years on a number of alternative energy projects.  In addition, approximately £1 million has been spent by the ESB, and £1.7 million by Bord na Móna and the Forestry and Wildlife Service, with EEC assistance.</P>
      <P>The principal lesson which has been learned so far is that, however attractive they may be in theory, the practical harnessing of renewable energy sources is by no means simple.  The engineering and economic risks are high, and it is likely to be a considerable time before they are reduced to an acceptable level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> In view of the uncertainties attaching to renewable energy economics, and in view of the need for careful control of Government expenditure, it would not be appropriate to embark on a more expensive renewable energy programme. I intend, however, to complete the projects which are already underway in order to get the maximum amount of information from them.  We are linked with technology research abroad and will continue to keep abreast of developments elsewhere to learn as much as possible about the suitability of alternative energy sources in Irish conditions so that we will be in a good position to take advantage of new developments as soon as they arise.

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he noted in the study &ldquo;Irish Energy Policy&rdquo; by F.T. Convery, S. Scott and C. McCarthy, prepared for the National Economic and Social Council, the finding (page 74) that &ldquo;the public sector has been the least active participant in conservation measures&rdquo;; and if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the statement to which the Deputy refers.  It would appear that there is little to support the allegation that conservation effort in the public sector is lacking.  The NESC, in their own comments on the report, did not indicate that they were in agreement with the consultants on this issue, while at the same time expressing the view that the public sector must lead in matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>Within the limits of available resources for energy conservation, the public sector has been singled out as an area for particular concentration in recent years.  The main efforts are directed at central Government Departments, schools, local authority and health board offices and institutions.  The IIRS since 1980, have included a public buildings advisory service in their work programme and have thereby helped to achieve considerable savings.</P>
      <P>I am not complacent about these results and recognise that all concerned can take many actions to save energy in the public as well as the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what the Minister has said about the report, it clearly stated that the public sector was the least active participant in conservation measures. The public sector should be showing an example rather than the reverse.  What does the Minister propose to do?  Has this situation arisen because the Department of the Public Service are involved?  Is that why the Department of Energy did not accept the accuracy of the report?</P>

      <P>The report was prepared for the NESC by independent consultants and the NESC in their comments <Col N="290" /> on the report did not indicate they were in agreement with the consultants.  There are two separate questions in this.  There has been activity in the public service aimed at energy conservation.  I agree there is need for care in the public as well as the private sector.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if, in view of the huge amounts of raw ore exported from this country, any studies have been undertaken on the cost of processing lead, zinc and copper ore in this country; by whom such studies were carried out; the results; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A detailed investigation of the prospects for establishment of an Irish zinc smelter was carried out by the Industrial Development Authority in 1976 and 1977.  An American company indicated positive interest in the project but due to a serious downturn in the international zinc market they did not maintain their interest and withdrew from the project.</P>
      <P>There has been some recovery in the zinc metal industry during recent months and the IDA recently up-dated their earlier studies.  However the IDA have concluded that the commercial prospects of a smelter are now no better than previously indicated.  Continuing over-capacity in the industry, high energy costs and inadequate metal prices continue to be serious adverse factors militating against successful establishment and operation of a zinc smelter in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision on the question of establishment of lead smelting capacity cannot be taken until firm decisions in favour of a zinc smelter and on the smelting process <Col N="291" /> to be used, are taken.  If a process involving joint production of zinc and lead was decided on, there would be no necessity for a separate lead smelting facility.  The question of establishment of lead and zinc smelting facilities in Ireland will continue to be kept under review.</P>
    <P>Since the closure of the Avoca copper mine in August 1982 there has been no production of copper concentrates in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

      <P>The Deputy is misinformed. No lead, zinc or copper ore are exported but rather concentrates.  It is not raw ore.  It is a stage in between raw ore and smelted ore.  In 1982 the export of lead concentrates was 49,383 million tonnes.  Zinc concentrates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The total State investment in Bula Limited to date is £10,205,000.  I have been informed by Bula Limited that the <i>in situ</i> geological ore reserves owned by the company range from 20 million tonnes, grading 8 per cent combined lead and zinc at a 2 per cent cut-off, to 10.5 million tonnes, <Col N="295" /> grading 13.9 per cent combined lead and zinc at 5 per cent cut-off.  The value of the ore reserves would depend on a number of variable factors at time of extraction such as metal prices, smelter treatment charges, operating costs and exchange rates.  It is not possible to say at this stage when extraction of ore from the mine will commence.  The company is engaged in discussions at present with certain interests with a view to agreeing on mine development and on elements of major financing arrangements.  It is expected that these discussions will be completed in the near future and the outcome will then be reviewed in conjunction with my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that a sweet factory in Foley Street, Dublin, has been convicted of serious breaches of the hygiene regulations; that evidence was given in court of the discovery of food poisoning organisms in samples taken from the factory; that the justice in convicting the firm involved recommended the closure of the factory; if the Minister will indicate what steps he intends to take to protect consumers from this firm, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the circumstances of this case.  The provisions of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950, have been fully applied by the Eastern Health Board and they are maintaining constant surveillance of the premises which are currently closed.  The regulations provide that these premises must be registered by the Eastern Health Board if they are to operate as a food business.  The health board refused an application for registration on 10 October 1983.  Should the proprietors seek to re-open, they will be in further breach of the regulations and will be liable to the penalties provided: these include fines as well as imprisonment of up to six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the closure taken place as a result of an order by the Minister or was it a voluntary closure?  Does the Minister consider that the powers under the regulations are adequate to protect consumers in this situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The condition of the premises, known as Irish Sweets Limited, 17-23 Foley Street, Dublin 1, has been a matter of great concern to the Eastern Health Board for some time.  Contaminated products were seized by the board &mdash; these products had rat droppings and <Col N="299" /> various other organisms, cigarette butts and so on &mdash; were destroyed by them and court proceedings were instigated against Mr. Nolan.  He applied to the Eastern Health Board for registration but was refused on 10 October.  He did not appeal the health board's decision and the prosecutions were heard in the Dublin District Court on 27 April.  The proprietor admitted to the summons and was fined £1,700.  I have ample powers under section 34 to insist on the closure of these premises in the event of their re-opening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that the present closure is voluntary and that the Minister has not exercised his powers to ensure that the firm does not re-open in its present condition?  Have any steps been taken to ensure that no products of this firm are at present in shops in the Dublin area or any other part of the country?  Would he consider placing an advertisement in the newspapers warning traders and the public about these products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The factory premises were precluded from operations as they were not registered.  I am not in a position to close a factory which was never opened.  In the event of this factory being re-opened I have ample powers, and the Eastern Health Board have been keeping the closest scrutiny on the area.  Where products have been seized they have been destroyed.  I am sure the chief health inspector of the health board will keep the matter under the closest observation and will act accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give the shopkeepers the names of these products and say the type of packaging used because nowadays sweets are not very well packaged and it would be very difficult to identify whether they came from this factory.  As Deputy De Rossa suggested, would the Minister run an advertisement in the newspapers alerting shopkeepers, particularly small shopkeepers, who are still selling these products?</P>

      <P>It is reasonable to assume that some products of this factory are still in the shops and, because of the nature of the products, will be sold to children.  Can the Minister give some assurance that the public and the shopkeepers concerned will be warned of these products so that the public can avoid buying them and the shopkeepers who have these products can destroy them?  Can he do that by way of advertisement or other appropriate means?</P>

      <P>There has been widespread publicity about this company, Irish Sweets Limited.  The health board have taken action and the premises are under full surveillance.  Any products which could be obtained were seized and destroyed and any further action needed will be taken.  I can assure the Deputy that I have kept in very close contact with the health inspector about this matter and if newspaper advertisements are required, I will have them inserted. Meanwhile, the health board have the responsibility to implement the food hygiene regulations, not my Department, and the health inspectors are keeping in close contact with me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. a26a:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (1), lines 42 to 44, to delete the definition of &ldquo;associate&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Associated&rsquo; has the same meaning in relation to a person as it has by virtue of section 103 (3) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, in relation to a participator except that &lsquo;relative&rsquo; in that subsection shall not include a brother or sister;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of debate on Second Stage, I put forward a number of amendments with a view to clarifying the regulations introduced in this new scheme and <Col N="362" /> also to ensure that they could effect the purpose of maximum participation in new share issues under the scheme.  As I indicated on Second Stage, this amendment is one which would allow brothers or sisters to participate who, under the proposal, are automatically excluded from participating in the taking up of shares in this new investment scheme.  I indicated that there could be no basis for excluding a brother or sister, as such, who would have no association with the company other than that relationship.  A brother or sister carrying on business or living in another part of the country should not be implied to have such an association within the meaning of this Bill.  Otherwise a concept could be introduced into this provision which will be unduly restrictive, like so many others to which I shall be referring in the course of this debate.  In this amendment I have not asked that this exemption apply to sons or daughters, fathers or mothers, or any lineal ancestor or descendent such as grandparents and grandchildren.  My only reason for not doing so is that it would involve a complex amendment and would add to the unreasonable and unnecessary complexity of this Bill and of this section.  At the time available to me I was not able to formulate an amendment to exclude parents or great-grandparents. These people should not, by definition, be prevented from participating in the scheme which may be promoted by a company with which they are only associated by their relationship to the promoter.</P>

      <P>I would like to indicate to Deputy O'Kennedy why I oppose the amendment.  While I can understand the point he is making, section 14(2) of the Bill specifies those groups of people who would not be entitled to the tax relief provided for in this part of the Bill.  The purpose of Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment is to exclude a brother or sister from that list of associates and consequently to enable those people to invest in the firm and to get the tax relief.  The difficulty is that, were we to act in the way in which Deputy O'Kennedy suggests we act, it would be possible for an individual to channel investment through his brothers or sisters and thereby gain a relief on investment of an amount that would be considerably in excess of that for which we have provided in the Bill.  For that reason the excluded persons are as they are in the Bill.  I have given this a good deal of thought and I find that, given the kind of scheme it is, given our intention that we want to get new capital into companies and given that the relief is, I believe, rather generous, I could not accept the Deputy's amendment because it would open up too many possibilities and, let us say, exploitation of the relief in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be possible for any individual to channel investment through any person if that was his intention. Brothers or sisters as such should not be excluded.  I do not think that any <Col N="365" /> of us is unaware of the fact that many brothers and sisters have no association, good, bad or indifferent, with what their brothers or sisters are promoting.  I think it is an unreasonable restriction, but if the Minister cannot see his way to accepting it then I must accept that as being the case.  However, I think it is to be regretted and that it is extending a principle which does not apply elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26a:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (1) (c), line 37, to delete &ldquo;, and it appears&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Here we are dealing with three amendments together and I would like to outline briefly the intention here.  These amendments relate generally to the role of the Revenue Commissioners and again it is an attempt by us to make this scheme workable without undue interference, so to speak, or unnecessary inquiry on the part of the Revenue Commissioners.  Let me deal with each of them in turn.  The first one is to delete the words &ldquo;and it appears&rdquo; and each amendment refers to section 12 (1) (c) which at present requires that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> (c) the company provides satisfactory evidence, and it appears to the Revenue Commissioners after such consultation, if any, as may seem to them to be necessary with such person or body of persons as in their opinion may be of assistance to them,...</P>
    <P>I am proposing that all of those words go out, and we will be left then with a provision of the following nature: &ldquo;and the company provides satisfactory evidence to the Revenue Commissioners that the money was being used or is being used or is intended to be used with a view to the creation or maintenance of employment in the company&rdquo;.  In amendment No. 26c, which is included in what we are taking together, I am proposing that all of the other unnecessary qualifications which are included here, and which are very complex, should be excluded, and we would wind up on my proposal, the proposal of Fianna Fáil, with a very effective, simple, transparent provision which would read as follows, and I will read it finally on the basis that anyone in or outside the House will understand, which is in sharp contrast to the position at the moment: &ldquo;that the company provides satisfactory evidence to the Revenue Commissioners that the money was used, is being used or is intended to be used with a view to the creation or maintenance of employment in the company.&rdquo; That is the purpose of the scheme, to create and maintain employment.  All of those other qualifications introduced at this stage by the Minister, like many other qualifications he has introduced elsewhere in the Bill, make it so unnecessarily complex as in our view to defeat the very purpose for which the Bill was intended.</P>
    <P>The need to maintain or create employment has never been so obvious than it is at this stage.  We have just seen reports from the Central Statistics Office that indicate the level of job losses up to September last year.  We have had 30,000 redundancies notified to the Department of Labour.  The number of people unemployed increased by 33,000 in the last 12 months and we have had forecasts that it will be up to 20 per cent of the labour <Col N="367" /> force at the end of, say 1987 if this Government were to last their full term. Incidentally we have also clear indications of something about which we will hear a great deal more very soon, that something that we thought was a historical characteristic in this country is now a matter of very pressing concern.  I am referring to emigration.  The unemployment figures today would be much worse were it not for the fact that emigration, unfortunately, has started again as is evidenced from reports from the Irish Centre and Irish communities in England and elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I wonder what connection the statements by the Deputy have with the amendments we are looking at.  We have agreed a series of timings for the consideration of different sections of this Bill and I am quite anxious to facilitate the Opposition in every way in dealing with those amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of order is accepted.  I ask the Deputy to confine himself to the technical aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of any Bill, even the technicalities, is to have an effect.  The effect of this scheme should be to encourage investment for the creation and maintenance of employment. I want to see it as simple and transparent as that and I am giving the reasons why that is absolutely essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to go into great detail but these figures are important to underline the need to promote investment which is falling dramatically and is now at a level of about 22 per cent of GNP, the lowest it has been for about 15 years.  In view of those factors, rising unemployment, falling investment and the surveys from the Department of Labour and the Central Statistics Office, which underline that the manufacturing industry particularly is at the lowest level of employment, even lower than it was in 1966, it is essential that we make this scheme work.  I welcome the scheme.  I called for <Col N="368" /> it throughout the last 12 months but I wanted much more than the Minister has seen fit to introduce.  I called for it without restrictions of a kind which will make it ineffective.  It is for that reason that I am proposing at this stage that we should not have the restrictions which are introduced here in relation to consultation with the Revenue Commissioners and also all of the other qualifications that are in subsection (1) on pages 16 and 17.</P>
    <P>I would like to say in relation to the consultations with the Revenue Commissioners, which I propose to delete, that if I am requiring that the company provide satisfactory evidence to the Revenue Commissioners is that not enough?  They already have a function.  It must be satisfactory evidence.  The Minister wants to have it that &ldquo;the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; I am trying to delete this as well &mdash; after such consultation, if any, as may seem to them to be necessary with such person of body of persons as in their opinion may be of assistance to them&rdquo; ... We can all see what will happen there.  If it is written into the Bill public servants, particularly the Revenue Commissioners, feel that means they should get in contact with AnCO, the IDA, SFADCo, the local development authority and the local county development team to really feel they have had the consultations which the Minister provides for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that is necessary.  I have enough confidence in the Revenue Commissioners normally without requiring them by implication to engage in all these consultations.  I believe that what will meet the needs of this section is simply that the company provide satisfactory evidence to the Revenue Commissioners, that the money was used, is being used or is intended to be used for the creation or maintenance of employment in the company.  Even the most ill-informed potential investor will know exactly what that means and will not have to go through all types of channels and consult with professionals to find out if his particular idea can be implemented.  I did not go through all the details the Minister has in this section because if I did I would <Col N="369" /> only confuse the issue.  I believe that what I have suggested will meet the needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be interesting to hear what the Minister has to say about this particular suggestion.  I do not believe it will make a great change on the practical implication of this suggestion. In view of the fact that this is a similar scheme to the business start-up scheme of 1981 in the UK, are such words and such terms included because there has been a lot of abuse particularly in the earlier years in relation to the scheme in the UK?  Has the Minister taken the necessary steps to ensure that the amounts so used are for the purposes for which the section wants them to be used, that is to create investment and employment? We should be careful that we are simply not opening up an avenue for people who have been considering their bond-washing activities to reinvest their funds somewhere else.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this is very clear and I presume the proposed wording is to ensure minimum abuse.  Will the Minister ensure that where employment and investment is achievable the Revenue Commissioners will take a positive view and that we will not be putting unnecessary obstacles in the way of people?  If we can get people to invest their own funds through the section in employment and in necessary investment in business it will be a very welcome thing.  Will the Minister ensure, while we have the necessary restrictions to stop loopholes and abuses, that we do not through the implementation of the scheme, put unnecessary obstacles in the way of such people?  It can take from the whole scheme if that happens.  It is really a question of balance. The Minister's comments on the words &ldquo;as it appears to the Revenue&rdquo; will be very interesting to hear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Acceptance of our amendment would involve simple and straight-forward legislation whereby people would be encouraged to invest for the reasons for which the Bill has been brought in, in the first place.  If too many qualifications, restrictions and verbiage are put into a Bill you create more traps <Col N="370" /> for the unwary.  What about the situation under subsection (3) on page 17 where one of the purposes is to enable the company to identify new markets.  Suppose the company identify new markets which subsequently turn out to be unsuccessful because they cannot sell to those markets. There are various traps like that for the unwary in the Bill which may result in the relief being withdrawn.  I would like to ask the Minister a question in relation to lines 13 and 14.  The investment must take place with a view to creating and maintaining employment in the company.  What about the situation where the company use the money so invested to maintain half their labour force if they are contracting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual Deputy Mitchell has hit the nail right on the head.  The intention of the scheme as it is drafted in the Bill with the amendments which I have to other sections, which I do not intend to go into at the moment, is to have a scheme that will assist us in giving an incentive to people to put new capital into developing companies with a view to the overall expansion of those companies without running the risk of seeing some of that new capital made available as a result of this relief being frittered away into unproductive activities or activities which do not create employment.  As Deputy Mitchell said, we have had before us the experience of the UK system where a very broadly written system, and one that was possibly far too simple in its original expression, proved over the time to be subject to abuse and also proved in some instances to be simply a vehicle for giving tax relief to people who were involved in activities, while they were legal, economic and all the rest of it, which did not have the effect we are trying to get here, of increasing employment and improving the situation in the firms concerned.  That has been my main concern.  As I said on Second Stage, we are aiming to target this measure very precisely in order to get the effect we want.  That is the intention of the drafting of this particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Deputy O'Kennedy's amendments are concerned, the first two <Col N="371" /> amendments have to do with subsection (1) (c) of section 12.  We provide there that the Revenue Commissioners, who are the people who have to decide at the end of the day on a day by day basis, if a given application for relief is admissible, should be able to get advice.  That is why we provide for the consultation.  The Revenue Commissioners are not investment analysts.  They are not people who can say whether any firm will succeed but they are the ones who must say that relief in the case in question is either appropriate or otherwise.  It is only reasonable that in the event of the commissioners having any doubt as to a firm complying with the criteria, they should be in a position to get advice from an outside source on a matter that is not properly within their remit but which must be decided before a decision can be made on the making available of relief.  This is not intended in any way, nor would it be used, as an obstacle to the operation of the scheme.  It is intended to give the commissioners the opportunity of informing themselves so that the scheme can be operated as it is intended to operate.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea raised a question in relation to line 7, paragraph 3, which is on page 17.  This relates to the provision to enable companies to identify new markets and to develop new and existing markets.  The question of what happens in the event of a bad debt and a company finding that they are not able to sell applies to the whole scheme.  In the nature of things, we would have investments in the companies that do not pay off but we cannot know that in advance. What we are looking at here is what the intention of the investment is.  We are not legislating for the success of the investors though we would hope that the maximum possible proportion of the investment would bring about the result we want.  It is not in any sense a trap for the unwary in this tax year.  We are not inciting people to make bad investment decisions. If people have funds to invest we are trying to encourage them to put these funds into companies that are involved in these kinds of activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> In the light of experience with another scheme of this kind, it is reasonable that we should specify the purposes for which the investment should be used.  Deputies will note that in that part of section 12 beginning on line 43 and continuing to the end, there are two conditions that must be satisfied simultaneously.  One is that the money be used for one of the three purposes set out and at the same time that the investment take place with a view to the creation or maintenance of employment in the company.  The kind of activities that we want companies to engage in seem to me to be reasonable in definition, to be reasonable and logical expressions of what we want companies to do and by extension to exclude those kinds of activities for which we do not consider this tax relief to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>The fact of defining the activities excludes all others.  In this we are building on the experience of the UK scheme where the investment funds were used for a number of purposes that did not add anything to the level of economic activity. We do not wish that to happen here because we want to mobilise available capital into productive activities that will increase output and employment.  It is for those reasons that we have drafted the measure in this way.  If we were to accept Deputy O'Kennedy's amendments, we would simply open up the possibility of a leakage from the scheme thereby rendering it less effective than we would wish it to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three points arising from the Minister's remarks.  First, acceptance of my amendment would not, as I thought I made clear, prevent the Revenue Commissioners from obtaining necessary advice or from having consultations or discussions that would appear to be reasonable. My proposal is that a company provide satisfactory evidence to the Revenue Commissioners that the money was being used, is being used, or was intended to be used with a view to the creation or maintenance of employment in the company, whereas putting in the sort of details as set out in the Bill might lead to a potential investor, even if he has nothing <Col N="373" /> to hide, saying this seems to suggest that the commissioners will consult with bank managers and with others in relation to the matter.  Anything that seems to the potential investor to be an unnecessary restriction will be likely to damage the effectiveness of the scheme.  That is why we must endeavour to concentrate on the position of the potential investor in terms of how he reads the legislation.</P>
      <P>My second point is that my proposal would not prevent the commissioners from having consultations.  Thirdly, what I am trying to achieve is that the scheme works effectively and transparently.  I am not trying to encourage tax evasion.  This should be clear from anything I have to say during the course of this Bill but we had better acknowledge from the start that one of the consequences of this scheme will be that a bona fide investor within the terms of the scheme will, by investing in companies such as the ones we have in mind, be in a position to reduce his tax liability.  To that extent the provision is a means of avoiding a heavier tax liability.  Therefore, we must acknowledge that a scheme introduced with a view to attracting people to invest so as to reduce their tax liability should not be so circumscribed by all kinds of restrictions that it would mean they have not the means available to them to invest because reducing a company's tax liability is something the Revenue Commissioners want to avoid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain sympathy at least with the consistency of Deputy Mac Giolla, for instance, who opposes every section of this Bill.  It seems from what Deputy Taylor has said that this would be his view also.  The view that I think Deputy Mac Giolla has is that either we go all the way and say there will be nothing to encourage people to reduce their tax liability although they may invest in business or industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I, too, recognise that the scheme should not be abused.  I do not wish the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to be limited but neither do I wish that unnecessary provisions be written into legislation which is already far too complex.  The Minister referred to the experience in Britain where he says it was found there was an avoidance which was not intended.  Consequently, we have here a lot of gobbledegook.  The trend in this Bill has been to control and direct to such an extent that the child is being suffocated before it begins to grow. That is my concern.  I hope the Minister can accept the amendments, as it is as much in the Government's interest as in the interest of the Opposition that the scheme should work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is killing a good case by exaggerating.  We are not suffocating anything.  The scheme is designed to do something specific.  The objective of the scheme is not to encourage people to invest in order to reduce their tax liability.  It is to reduce people's tax liability in order to encourage them to invest.</P>

      <P>That is not so.  Deputy O'Kennedy, because of the way he makes the point, is contributing to giving to the scheme a flavour that I do not wish it to have.  Basically, the Deputy's heart is in the right place even if it is difficult to accept that on some occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the relative degrees of stoniness and he is miles ahead <Col N="375" /> of me in that regard.  The Deputy spoke about putting himself in the mind of the investor when looking at this section. However, in relation to this section, he should put himself in the mind of the company because the company have to give assurances to the Revenue Commissioners that their activities properly qualify for relief.  The company want to attract funds and to show potential investors that they are a good proposition and that they think about the markets and so on.  For that reason, the prescriptions we have in the Bill for the company are precisely the kind of things which the company would want to show potential investors whether they are getting tax relief or not on the money they invest. The Deputies opposite seem to be confused regarding complication on the one hand which they see as something which makes life difficult, and simplicity on the other which they see as something that facilitates operations.  The provisions in this part of the Bill are not all that complicated when you read through them.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  In any of the discussions I have had &mdash; and I have had many &mdash; with people who are interested in this scheme and have spoken to me about it, I have not found any great clouding of their minds with detail or a feeling that it is unnecessarily complicated. I found considerable anxiety on the part of a number of those people to ensure that the scheme did not make the same kind of mistakes as were made in the UK scheme.  We must target it properly so that we get full value from it.  I am sure we all have the same objective in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the effect of the Bill will be that amounts subscribed by a wife are deemed to have been subscribed by her husband.  Could the Minister say whether subscriptions made by a husband and wife will be treated in the same way as they are normally treated for income tax where their <Col N="376" /> allowances can be apportioned equally? The section says there must be investment in the company for research and development or various other matters and employment.  I hope the Minister will lay greater emphasis on employment and that employment on its own will be sufficient for this section.  I know Deputy O'Kennedy has an amendment of a technical nature and I am just making a very general point which the Minister might consider on Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If, for example, a company with the assistance of investment made available under this scheme were able to maintain only a reduced workforce but conformed to the other criteria here, that investment would qualify under the scheme.  With regard to Deputy Mitchell's questions, in relation to a husband and wife the maximum allowable subscription under the scheme of £25,000 applies to each spouse separately so that there could be two subscriptions of £25,000.  Of course, the amount of tax relief they would get depends on the total income against which the allowances could be set.  Deputy Mitchell also asked whether employment on its own would be sufficient.  The answer is no because we want to ensure that the other things also happen and that the investment undertaken by the company would enlarge their capacity to undertake qualifying trading operations and enable them to engage in research or development, technological acquisition or to identify new markets.  We are essentially talking about the development of either new companies or new activities in a company and all these other things must be essential parts of the activity we are trying to promote.</P>

      <P>It appears that the Revenue Commissioners are given a judicial function here to receive and consider the <Col N="377" /> evidence and make a quasi-judicial decision on it.  Would the Revenue Commissioners do that or would it be a delegated function to an inspector of taxes?  Is it envisaged that there could be any appeal against that decision from a disgruntled applicant for approval of a scheme?  In section 12 (a) from the point of view of the investor, there is a limitation to an individual as distinct from a company whereas, from the point of view of the recipient, there is a limitation of a company as opposed to an individual.  Is it intended that a company which might wish to invest pursuant to this chapter would be debarred from so doing having regard to the fact that it is confined to an individual?  With regard to a partnership, would the fact that they had not put the cloak of limited liability on themselves mean that they would be debarred from availing of any funds which might improve their business under this proposal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably going a bit far to say that the Revenue Commissioners would have a judicial function in this respect.  In this instance, as in any other, the Revenue Commissioners have to make up their minds whether a given claim for a tax relief is admissible under the terms of legislation.  They have to make up their minds whether a particular application conforms to the conditions for the granting of that relief for individuals who invest funds in companies or, as we will see later in the Bill, through funds into particular companies.  It is a relief designed to encourage individuals to invest in companies.  The reason for keeping it like that is that we want to mobilise new investment.  Normally, when we speak about companies that have investable funds, they are already looking around to make investments and are in a different situation from individuals. We want to draw forth from individuals funds which might otherwise be used for other purposes.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any objection in principle?  Supposing a small <Col N="378" /> company is doing well but, within the limits of its operation, it cannot find scope to reinvest for the development of employment within its own activity.  The Minister is preventing such a company from investing in another company with which it has no association.  He is distinguishing between an individual and a corporation, or a corporation sole for that matter, simply because it is a company. That is what I understood him to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not at all.  There is nothing in these sections of this Bill that prevents a company which has profits and cannot develop within its own activities from investing in another company.  The very framing of the Deputy's question leads me to remark on something which is fairly common when we talk about a Bill like this.  We are providing a new means to encourage individuals to invest money.  We are not doing anything to change the situation of other sources of investment.  A company that is now making profits and cannot find a way within its own activities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is what I did ask. The Minister cannot attribute to me a need to understand something I already understand.  I read this in great detail and I have heard from people who are concerned to make the scheme work.  Is the Minister excluding companies from investing in other companies where it would be helpful for the development of a second company to gather investment funds from whatever source, or is he distinguishing between investment funds of companies and individuals?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to probe this a little further as the person who first raised the point.  From a logical point of view it is difficult to see the reason for drawing the distinction and the limitation of it to an individual.  If the intent of the section is to turn non-productive funds into a productive purpose which will provide employment and the other things specified, what difference does it make whether the source comes from an individual or from another company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is true that a company has open to it the whole gamut of investment opportunities on the market place, they are all open to an individual also.  A company might be very well endowed with funds which it uses in a non-productive manner by using bank deposits, or something of that nature.  It might well be pleased to avail of the facility which is being thrown open by this section.  It is difficult to see the logic of drawing a distinction and in leaving this investment opportunity open to an individual as opposed to a company if a company has non-productive funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not deal with my second congruent point that from the receiving end of the investment it is limited to a company.  The logic of that is equally difficult to see.  Why debar from the benefit of this opportunity a business which is being run and built up by a number of individuals who have not decided to put the cloak of limited liability around themselves? On the wording here they would <Col N="380" /> be debarred.  It must go into a company. A partnership of two, three, four or five people working away and making furniture, or whatever, would be debarred. There may be a logic in that but, if there is, it escapes me.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify it.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied to the point I made about the Revenue Commissioners making a judicial decision by pointing out that it is comparable to other decisions the Revenue Commissioners make all the time on tax reliefs.  That is correct, but when they make those decisions on tax reliefs and so on a person who is aggrieved by their decision may appeal to the Appeal Commissioners and in some circumstances to the Circuit Court.  I wonder whether a person aggrieved at being refused this relief by the Revenue Commissioners would be entitled in like manner to appeal to the Appeal Commissioners or the Circuit Court as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of why limit the receipt of these funds to a company, it is part of the conventional wisdom &mdash; and perhaps we could analyse whether or not there is a good reason for it &mdash; that the development we are trying to encourage here is normally carried out by new companies starting up.  The simple answer to Deputy Taylor's example of four or five people working together and making furniture, or whatever, is that if they want to have the benefit of investment funds made available under this scheme, they have only to incorporate. That is not very difficult to do.  The advantage from the point of view of administering a relief scheme is that when it is a company it must comply with the various conditions and criteria set out here.  There are the various relevant periods as described in the sections which we will be discussing later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It allows us to construct a scheme <Col N="381" /> which gives some reasonable framework for the investor to make up his mind as to whether this venture is one in which he should invest.  If we were to apply the benefit of this to individuals, it would be far more difficult for the investor to make up his mind because he would not have the same controls, to use the word so beloved of Deputy O'Kennedy.  He would not have the same controls and he would not be able to track it through in the same way as we do with a company.</P>

      <P>On the question of whether there is an appeal from a decision made by the Revenue Commissioners, if someone feels he has not been allowed a relief which he should have been allowed under the terms of the scheme, he can always have a further discussion with his inspector of taxes.  I might add in passing that the other controls written in here would have to be looked at and would make it easier for the Revenue Commissioners to apply whether the relief should be given. They have more points of reference to use in order to judge the scheme.  As to whether we should provide a specific appeal in relation to the reliefs, I should like to tell the Deputy that it is something I will have to consider a little more.  If it appears to me that there is a lack in the provision here in relation to the appeal, I will come back to it on Report Stage.  It is something I will take up with the Deputy between now and Report Stage to see if there is such a lack in the provisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not tell the House why he had excluded companies <Col N="382" /> from investing.  He indicated why he was confining it to qualifying companies to be in receipt of investment funds but he did not reply to the point made by Deputy Taylor and I as to the distinction that justifies preventing small companies investing in other companies in the same way that individuals can.  I asked the Minister to explain the logic of that limitation but, as far as I know, the Minister did not refer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was deliberate that we wanted to provide here a relief to individuals to invest money in companies who might not otherwise do so.  That seems to be a source to be tapped for investment funds that could be made available for companies.  Taking the case quoted by Deputy O'Kennedy, if there is a company making profits that cannot find use for those profits in its own business there is not anything to stop the owners or shareholders of that company from drawing funds from it &mdash; by way of dividends, for example &mdash; and then individually investing that money with the benefit of the scheme.  Equally, there is not anything to stop the company from making a bid or acquiring part of the shareholding of a qualifying company but without getting the benefit of the relief. I intend this quite simply to be a means under which we can attract individuals to come forward with investment funds.</P>

      <P>I received a lot of representation from small companies who feel they could make a contribution through other companies because there is a limit to the development that can take place within their own companies. Some of the companies are family concerns. They want to participate, although maybe not to the same extent as individuals. The case made by Deputy Taylor and I is a reasonable one and I do not know why the Minister should for the first time make a distinction or impose a disability on companies that does not apply to individuals in terms of their right to invest in the scheme.  However, if his mind is made up on that I will not argue any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a point on the section.  On the question of giving relief, I should like to know if the Minister has considered the fact that because the relief is confined to the year in which the shares are issued a certain black market or trading in this type of relief is likely to grow up in the latter half of the year.  There will be pressure before 5 April each year, perhaps in the last few weeks leading to that date, for funds to get the shares issued and tucked away and have the taxation concession nice and neat before the end of the tax year. Other provisions in the taxation law allow reliefs like this to be carried forward against income the previous year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to make the point to the Minister that a certain black market may arise unless he allows the relief to be carried forward.  The attention given to projects when there is only ten days to go and an investment has to be made will be quite shabby because it will be very late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem to which the Deputy has referred is more likely to be one that will arise in the first year of operation of the scheme.  I have considered it in detail and with people who intend to manage funds dealt with in the scheme.  I am not so sure that it is as great a problem as some people believe.  I think it is an initial problem.  There is a provision in the way the scheme is written to provide that the funds invested should be invested as quickly as possible.  There would always be a tendency for funds, other things being equal, to wait until late in the tax year for a few different reasons which will be dealt with in different sections of the Bill.  In fact, there are some provisions in the Bill that would not be in it if we were not trying to deal with the problem raised by Deputy Brennan. Some complications inevitably will arise. It is not enough to say that this is too complicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point of the carry forward I would be against it because we want to ensure that we give a relief when entitlement to it arises.  Entitlement to it is defined as the issue of shares.  The event that gives rise to the entitlement is the acquisition by a company of the new capital and that does not happen until the shares are issued.  If we are talking about funds investing, to make a decision on a fund there would have to be a closing date for the formation of the fund.  A fund manager will decide how much he or she is going to get into the fund and by what date.  Apart from the initial period, that will be decided by the fund manager on the basis of the experience he has had with the market and investments.  The manager will be left with enough time during the currency of a given tax year to <Col N="385" /> make decisions without them having to be rushed in the way Deputy Brennan feared.</P>

    <P>This is a drafting amendment and I will not press it if the Minister does not wish <Col N="386" /> to accept it.  I am seeking to delete the word &ldquo;Chapter&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;section&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a recommendation that amendments Nos. 26e, 26f, 26g and 26h be taken together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is agreed.  I move amendment No. 26e:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (3), line 24, after &ldquo;deduction.&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;However in case of a designated Fund as provided for in section 27 of this Act subscription to the Fund shall qualify the individual for the relief.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When a person has invested, the proposal in this amendment is that he should not be deprived of relief.  It takes time to place a fund in investment because the fund manager must have an opportunity to look around to find an outlet for the fund.  This will involve inquiries and professional advice in order to ensure that the fund will be placed effectively in the interests of the investors.  Those studies are being made on behalf of the investment but the investment has not been placed yet &mdash; in other words, the fund has not gone into effective investment &mdash; and the fact that the moneys are made available and deposited should not disqualify the investors from getting interest relief pending actual investment.</P>
      <P>I am suggesting that before any such scheme could operate the fund manager would have to say that he already has an investment organised, even before he has any money with which to organise it. There would have to be consultation and the investors would have to respond to suggestions about schemes.  Then they would put their money forward on that basis.  Pending the placing of the fund, once the money has been made available by the potential shareholders it should qualify for interest relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the second amendment, the proposal is to delete subsection (4) which provides that the relief shall be given on a claim and shall not be allowed unless and until the company has carried <Col N="387" /> on the trade for four months, and if the company is not carrying on that trade at the time when the shares are issued, unless the company begins to carry it on within two years after that time.  I want to encourage investment not just in existing companies or those that have been carried on for two years.  I want to allow people to research programmes for investment, to do a market analysis of outlets.  These days many people promoting companies will look at what the market prospects are and should be.</P>
    <P>My point is that people should be doing such market research.  This is a desirable thing because after 12 months or so it could lead people to decide not to proceed further.  People should be encouraged to ensure the maximum rate of success and therefore encouraged to do a market analysis of likely successful outlets. If it transpires that people decide not to go ahead the Minister should take that into account and at that stage he should not exclude a company that did not actually trade in view of analysis information.  In the private sector there is always a risk element &mdash; some companies succeed and some do not, and if people do research they should not be penalised for not proceeding.</P>
    <P>The third one of my proposals is that if there is an issue of shares it should not be left at large all together.  I am going along with what the Minister has in mind in the two-year limit but I am suggesting that the relief should not be withdrawn unless the company does not carry on the trade within two years after the time of issue of the shares.  The Minister and I are not too far away from each other.  I am looking for the relief to apply in the meantime&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there is a distinction if the Minister approaches it on the basis that every investment can be legitimised on the premise that the company will be launched successfully.  A company's success cannot be guaranteed in advance.  One will not invest unless he <Col N="388" /> has some kind of insurance, and I want such people to be excluded.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 26h is consequential. It provides that people should not be excluded from tax relief simply because actual trading had not started.  People would be investing in something new and should be encouraged to do so to maintain and to create employment.  In all these cases the intention is to maintain or to create employment, and the fact that a company does not do that should not mean that investors should be penalised. They should be allowed to do full market research into the likelihood of success.  If people decide after doing that research not to go ahead they should not be penalised for their prudence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments put forward by Deputy O'Kennedy are interesting but I have not heard anything which would convince me that there is a strong case for what he is saying.  The date of issue of the shares rather than the date of payment determines the year of assessment in which relief is granted.  If the shares are issued in 1983-84 the relief is granted in 1983-84.  The other requirement is that relief shall not be given unless the company has been carrying on trade for four months.  That is a reasonable provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy O'Kennedy's suggestion was to apply and the four month period was extended to two years people could automatically invest £25,000 without having any concrete evidence that what they were putting forward was a viable entity. Yet they would get relief for two years. They would have two years in which to dream something up and if the investment did not mature we could claw it back, presumably without getting interest on the amount allowed for tax purposes. Sixty five per cent of £25,000 is £16,250.  It would not seem reasonable for a person to have the use of that money for two years at the expense of the taxpayer unless we could be sure that at the end of the period the money would be refunded to the Exchequer with interest, in which case the Exchequer would not <Col N="389" /> be at a loss, or we could be certain that some business would materialise.</P>
    <P>We do not know what the economy will be like in two years time or what our needs will be in terms of employment. Presumably our long-term employment difficulties will still be with us.  It would be possible to go along with Deputy O'Kennedy's suggestion if we were sure that it would not be used to avoid paying tax.  I did not hear anything in what he put forward to suggest that it would not be used as a loophole.  Perhaps if we could incorporate a section which would allow the State to recoup the amount due with interest that would discourage people from trying to avoid paying tax.</P>

      <P>There is no way in which we can be sure.  I am not suggesting that we can be sure that some people would not use this as a means of avoidance. The day we try to guarantee that some small minority will not use it for the wrong reasons we will be living in an unreal world.  What I am trying to ensure is that we will not penalise people who are going to start.  At present, it is confined strictly to people already engaged in manufacturing industry.  If the company do not carry on business within two years of the issue they are out.  People who are investing do not know that. People who invest for the purpose of launching a new company should be helped to launch it rather than prevent it from doing so.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to a clawback.  The amendment put forward by Deputy O'Kennedy does not refer to any clawback.  It is very general and states that the relief shall not be withdrawn.

We need more than that to make sure that the money will not be invested by unscrupulous investors who could dress up a company and make it seem as if they were doing market research and so on. They would get two years of a tax incentive and then they could move on and do the same thing elsewhere.  This amendment is flawed.  It does not mention clawback.</P>

It is a major concession and would enable people who use it skilfully to achieve, in many cases, massive reductions in their tax liability.

      <P>It is intended that this section will give a benefit to people who start and not to people who may start or intend to investigate starting.  It is time enough to give them the concession when they have started, are seen to be in operation and achieving what is intended in the section before we give them a relief of something over £17,000 off their tax bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Owen is well taken.  One could visualise a situation where it would be open to gross abuse.  A person could become involved in the idea of a scheme rather than the practicality of a scheme. While the research is being carried out he has tax relief based on his input of £25,000, or more if his wife is included, for six months, one year, 18 months up <Col N="392" /> to two years.  The company may never see the light of day.  It may be nothing more than a twinkle in the eye; it may be nothing more than, for want of a better word, a ready-up situation.  This is a very major serious concession under which a person with a large income can write £25,000 off his tax, or £50,000 if he brings in his wife.  This means a major loss to the Exchequer and a massive reduction in this person's tax bill for something which may not get under way.  This is a surprising amendment; it is not well taken and should be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment is very logical.  The purpose of the amendment is to allow companies to acquire finance to start an operation which will lead to the creation of employment. As regards the two year provision, under our amendment, if accepted relief would be granted immediately; but if the company fail to commence trading after two years the relief will be withdrawn. The whole thrust of the legislation as drafted is to delay the relief.  The Revenue Commissioners can consult with one or any number of people they like in order to be satisfied that the company and the individual meet the qualifications necessary.  No claim for the relief is to be allowed before 1 January 1985.  In later sections of the Bill there are provisions for the granting of certificates by companies to individuals to submit to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>If somebody wants to invest £20,000 in one of these companies he will do so at a net cost of £7,000.  It is essential that that person get back his £13,000 as quickly as possible.  Nobody wants to be without that money for any period of time.  I want to ask the Minister if it is not true that many of the claims under section 23 of the 1981 legislation have not yet been processed by the Revenue Commissioners.  Therefore, it is possible that a person who invests £20,000 in one of these companies on the basis that it will cost only £7,000, may have to wait several years to get back his money under the legislation as drafted.  That cannot be the Minister's intention.</P>

A married couple could invest up to £50,000 &mdash; earlier I gave a figure of £17,250 but it should have been £16,250 multiplied by two, which gives a sum of £32,500.  This couple could have £32,500 invested, on deposit or in a building society for two years, without any intention of creating a business. After two years they may decide to set up a business but in the meantime they have Revenue's money.</P>

The objective of the legislation is not to provide an incentive for people to avoid tax but to create employment.  We suggest that instead of giving the person the benefit which accrues to him from the date of the issue of the shares provided the company trades within four months &mdash; we extend that period to two years &mdash; there is no reason why the company engaged in research&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This scheme lacks a lot of courage.  On the other hand it says we want venture capital and seed capital to get businesses started, but there are so many barriers here that people will not avail of this scheme.  The reaction I am getting to this scheme is that it is an exciting scheme; but there are too many barriers, and one of them is this four months provision.  I take Deputy Mitchell's point that you have to see the shape of the company for four months before relief is allowed, but if we are genuinely interested in seed and venture capital to get businesses started, it has to be taken into account that the business may never trade.  The Deputy asked why give relief to a firm which may never trade, but if you do not give relief the company may never trade because the funds will not be available.  In other words, we are saying that we want to see the firm running and then the State will pitch in.  I am not saying that is unreasonable; I am just saying that the Government are not biting the bullet.  If they want venture capital they have to stand up and say so.  If a person goes to the IDA with a good idea and says he wants money he will get it immediately.  Nobody is saying they are a crowd of gangsters or that it is a ready-up situation.  It is not unreasonable to suggest that a similar IDA operation <Col N="395" /> be practised here; the day I invest the money, before we start producing, the relief should be given.</P>

      <P>He has even raised a most extraordinary question about section 23, but I do not have here the information to answer that.  Even if I had, it would not be relevant on this Bill.  The intention of this scheme is not to delay relief.  I am bringing in a scheme which provides a tax relief.  We shall see the shape and direction of the scheme far more clearly if we get hold of one simple idea.  The event which gives rise to the tax relief is the capital passing into the hands of the company. That is what we want to get companies into a position where they can get their hands on capital to carry on business. The capital passes when the company issue shares.  That is our central intention.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy said very reasonably that in many cases people get an idea but must carry out some market investigations. There is nothing in this proposal to stop them from doing so, or to stop people saying that they will make capital available, or from giving capital to the company during that period.  It is reasonable that before one gets relief one must show that the capital is actually producing the kind of results wanted from the scheme.  That is what the provisions of this section are aimed at bringing about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>We must be clear. The Minister is against any relief for people who are prepared to invest seed capital in a company that does not actually get off the ground.  In that case, we are at two different levels in this argument. It is not venture capital.  What the Minister wants is guarantee.  Before the Government invest, they have to know it will succeed in making a profit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <P>The event that gives rise to the relief is the acquisition of capital by a company.  That is what we want to happen &mdash; the transfer of capital from subscribers to companies or indeed, through funds.  It is that which gives rise to the relief.  The first amendment says that simple subscription to a designated fund under the terms of the scheme would give rise to the relief.  That would not really be in keeping with what we want to happen.  People could subscribe to a designated fund and the money could sit in the fund indefinitely without any investment in seed capital or venture capital taking place on the part of the fund.</P>

The amendments put forward here would distance the relief from the transfer of capital to the company.  It is for that reason that I oppose them.  It is not all that relevant for Deputy Brennan to say that we are looking for an absolute guarantee or that we are being too careful. Of course, it is possible that people may invest funds in a company which never trades.  If the company never trades, or goes out of business for a bona fide commercial reason before the event can arise, no relief is given.  We have not had the event which is the cause of giving relief, which we want to provoke and which will have the wished for results.  Of course, there is no guarantee that every one of these ventures will succeed, not by any means.  Neither is there any requirement for a guarantee that the event should succeed before relief is given. That would be totally unrealistic.  On the other hand, we must be sure that before the relief is given the happenings which we want to provoke have actually taken place.  That is why I suggest to the Deputy that this group of amendments are a little out of keeping with his own view as to the necessity for the scheme.</P>

      <P>I want to ask a question which is not on the lines of what we have previously discussed.  It is in connection with the requirement of trading for four months.  If a company are engaged in research and development, which is a qualifying factor under paragraph (II), with a view to create or maintain employment, if that research and development programme goes on for four months is that sufficient, or does the relief come into operation only when actual trading is being carried on, as distinct from research and development?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The company must be trading for four months.  It is not enough for a company to say that they are thinking about a new product.  One of the <Col N="399" /> activities covered here is a company engaging in research and development, acquisition of technological information and data and the development of new or existing products or services or the provision of new products or services.  These are what the extra capital is to enable the company to do, but the company must be trading in whatever one of the qualifying trades they are engaged in.</P>

We would like to encourage an investment awareness throughout this community from the lowest worker to everyone else, to give that feeling of cohesion and involvement and to help to generate employment.

For some people the difference between £300 and £500 is a good deal of money.

      <P>This is the section that limits the figure to 30 per cent.  Has the Minister considered very carefully arriving at that figure of 30 per cent?  In this country, generally speaking, companies tend to be tightly held.  Would he not feel that a figure of 40 or 50 per cent would be more reasonable?  In some other country where shareholdings tend to be small <Col N="404" /> 30 per cent might be reasonable, but in Ireland where a vast majority of small companies are 80 to 90 per cent owned by a family or a handful of people, perhaps 50 per cent would be more sensible.</P>

The more successful a scheme like this is the more that would be the case.  I have talked about that and thought about the figure of 30 per cent, and on balance I think it is a reasonable threshold to apply.</P>

      <P>In page 20 subsection (2), line 44, to delete &ldquo;unquoted&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to deal with this one separately and again it cannot be misunderstood and certainly will not be misrepresented in view of the Minister's comments on my previous amendments.  This <Col N="405" /> is to allow quoted companies to be included in the scheme in addition to those unquoted companies to whom the scheme is confined at the moment.  I think the Minister will have received numerous representations, as we have, to include publicly quoted companies in the scheme.  They need participation through a new scheme of equity and a new shares issue as much as anyone else does.  We should be encouraging development of the Stock Exchange.  The view generally, even from the Stock Exchange themselves, is that the Stock Exchange is not at all as effective an avenue for capital and seed capital as they would wish to be themselves.  I think that all of the arguments to be made on this have been sent to to the Minister as they have been sent to me.  I have been convinced by those arguments that we should not exclude the few &mdash; they are very few &mdash; publicly quoted companies from the scheme.  For that reason I ask the Minister to accept this amendment or, if he cannot, to explain why.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of this section is that throughout the relevant period a company must remain an unquoted company.  I do not know what the thinking behind this is.  I can understand that the whole idea is for new venture capital and seed capital, but where a company gets off the ground, causes employment and becomes a worthwhile venture and perhaps after a period of 18 months or two years decides to seek a quotation on the Stock Exchange or perhaps decide to trade in unlisted securities why would these provisions not apply to them at that stage?  What is the thinking behind the company having to remain an unquoted company for the whole of the period?  I can understand why that would be the case at the beginning.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us why the requirement is that the company should be an unquoted company for the whole period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell has hit the nail on the head in this regard. The key question in section 15 has to be that under this scheme a company will not be able to go public within a three <Col N="406" /> year period.  If I put my £25,000 into a company which do extremely well and within a three year period they decide to go to the Stock Exchange to seek further funds by way of public quotation, the way I read this scheme I very likely would lose my relief.  It is a direct disincentive to companies who are successful to go to the stock market and seek support.</P>
      <P>Another point I want to make is that unless Irish companies are encouraged to seek Stock Exchange quotations the ownership of public quoted companies in the future is likely to stay in the hands of institutional investors rather than go into the hands of individuals.  If a quoted company are allowed into the scheme individuals will be brought into control and ownership of quoted companies more and more.  If they are excluded and that trend continues and the scheme is successful, institutional investors will more and more be in direct ownership of the companies.</P>
      <P>Many companies on the Irish Stock Exchange are smaller in lots of ways than a lot of the unquoted companies.  Some of those presently on the Irish Stock Exchange are much smaller than many of the companies that can now take the investment.  I do not want to name any company &mdash; I am sure the Minister has some in mind &mdash; but very large companies will now be able to avail of this scheme while much smaller struggling companies on the Stock Exchange, who got funds there, cannot get this.  That seems to be discriminatory and not very helpful.</P>
      <P>There are very limited funds available for investment in Irish companies.  Those who are presently on the Stock Exchange need funds also.  On the other side of the scale, there will be a channelling away from them into this new scheme.  That is not very fair to the companies who need funds in that regard.  I do not believe it is appropriate in the Irish context to make this enormous distinction between a quoted company and an unquoted company because at the end of the day in terms of operation there is really not an enormous amount of difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment and allow companies on the Stock Exchange to avail of <Col N="407" /> this.  The Minister can still keep the provision that a person would have to leave his money in for five years.  Whether I put my money into a designated fund or whether I go down to the Stock Exchange and put it into a company which is publicly listed there, as long as I leave it in for five years what difference does it make to the State?  One could argue that the Stock Exchange being more public one would see a lot more and a lot more would be disclosed.  Would the Minister not have another think about this and allow in certain quoted companies or perhaps those on the unlisted stock market or some variation of it?  It is discriminatory to totally leave out quoted companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy O'Kennedy a while ago and accepted by the Minister reducing the minimum that might be invested from £500 to £200 now embodies the concept that a large number of small investors could be participating as contributory shareholders with their venture capital in unquoted companies.  This is as the section stands at present.  I cannot remember exactly but I believe there is an upper limit on the number of shareholders who are permitted under the Companies Act in an unquoted company.  I believe a private company may not have more than 50 shareholders.  If I am right about that it means that if there were a large number of small investors, if you had 50 people putting in the minimum now of £200 each, you could not raise a vary large amount of venture capital for that company. The questions then arises, if the Minister is not prepared to go so far as to meet Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment, of making provision under which a larger number of small shareholders would be permitted in an unquoted private company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the disincentive effect of how the section may operate?  If somebody invests under this scheme in one of the qualifying companies and after a couple of years' operation the majority shareholders, <Col N="408" /> who may not have invested under the scheme, decide it is time to go public, the people who have invested in all good faith will lose their relief.  That is a powerful disincentive and I certainly feel that I should discourage people from investing under this scheme.</P>

      <P>This question of unquoted and quoted could be disposed of by saying that the whole purpose of the scheme is to encourage people to invest money in the company for a long period whereas the purpose on the Stock Exchange can be for people to dispose of shares very quickly and make a profit in that way.  In any event they would not get the proposed benefit.  In anticipation that the Minister might say that, I would like him to consider the case of a company, being an unquoted company, becoming very successful and after 18 months or two years seeking a quotation.  Surely the shareholders in the company who do not dispose of their shares but continue to invest on the original basis should be given some special consideration?  I can understand that there may be some difficulty where a company are quoted at the moment.  Surely there is a different case where a company start off as an unquoted company but because they become successful and because of this injection of venture capital they later come to the stage where they can expand and go to the market for funds?  Surely there is a different case to that in which the original investors do not dispose of their shares?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this scheme is to encourage people to invest in ventures which will add something to the level of activity and the level of employment. We want to get people to put their money there.  The Deputies opposite, I believe, have this very much in mind. Part of what we want to do is to see if we can alter the balance in relation to risk and in relation to taking risks.  That is essentially what this scheme does.  It is an encouragement to people to take a risk. We give them a tax break in order to encourage them to take a particular kind of risk.  We are deliberately setting out to <Col N="409" /> affect the climate in which people take risks.  That is the kind of scheme it is and is a legitimate kind of thing to do.</P>
      <P>In doing that, we are in some sense changing the balance between less risky and more risky investment.  We are putting in another ingredient into the more risky investment that makes it a bit more attractive.  That is one part of it.  The other part is that, while we would be talking in many cases about companies that exist already, we wish to provide also for new companies that are being set up in terms of seed capital, as Deputy Brennan referred to it, or venture capital. Of its nature that is the kind of operation that takes some time to show its pace. Deputy Brennan is at least as familiar as I am with the developing theory of what happens to seed capital companies and the stages they go through in their development. We want to ensure that a company have that amount of capital available to them for a period and that is why we say the investor must leave this money in for five years.</P>
      <P>A company will build up a record over a period of years.  A company who are already publicly quoted have a track record.  Therefore, the risk an investor takes in buying shares in a publicly-quoted company is somewhat different from the risk involved in buying shares in a new company.  The publicly-quoted company can indicate their ability to manufacture or to provide services and to make profits whereas the company only setting up do not have that sort of track record.  Neither do a company becoming involved in new activities and who are not quoted have that kind of track record.  Therefore, we are altering the balance in favour of that company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  As is outlined in the guide issued by the Stock Exchange, one of the conditions of admission to the unlisted security markets is that a three-year trading history is normally necessary.  It is no accident that there is a similar provision in this Bill. The Bill provides also that a company <Col N="410" /> may seek a public quotation after three years without the investors suffering any diminution of their tax relief.  In terms of the Stock Exchange rules, if the company are a new one, they can then become eligible to apply for a quotation on the unlisted securities market and they can go further than that if they so wish.  Those different pieces of the jigsaw then are together.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea asked about the position of a small or minority shareholder if within the three-year period the majority shareholder decided to go public.  In that case the consequences would flow from the provisions of the Bill except to the extent that the majority shareholders had an entitlement to tax relief within the terms of the Bill.  In that case they would not decide to go public until such time as they could do so but the company could do so without affecting their own tax relief position.  I doubt that there would often be situations in companies where none of the majority shareholders had entitlement to tax relief within the provisions of this Bill while the majority of the smaller shareholders had that kind of tax relief.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;, save shares issued to employees of the company under a profit sharing scheme.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This amendment is to provide an exception in the case of party paid up shares in a profit sharing scheme.  As the Bill stands, shares in order to be issued must be paid up in full, but I think all of us would recognise that if there is to be an exception it should be in respect of an improved profit sharing scheme for employees.  If we wish to encourage a commitment from the workforce we should first encourage profit sharing schemes.  All of us would be anxious to promote profit sharing, worker participation and industrial democracy at every level.  It is the purpose of this amendment to do that.  If the Minister is not disposed to accepting the amendment, perhaps he would give his reasons.</P>

      <P>I am not disposed to accepting the amendment.  There are two different operations envisaged here.  It would not necessarily be the case that employees benefiting from a profit sharing scheme would be issued with new ordinary shares.  One of the conditions of this scheme is that the shares which create the qualification for relief must be new ordinary shares.  That would not necessarily be the case under an employee participation scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 29b:</P>
      <P>In page 22, subsection (2), to delete lines 39 to 44, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) be carried on by a body corporate and must not wholly or mainly consist of any of the following trades:</P>
      <P>(i)  distribution trades,</P>
      <P>(ii)  professional services, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> (iii)  banking, financial, insurance and services ancillary to any of the foregoing:   </P>
    <P>Provided, however, if in the case of (i) to (iii) above the service qualifies under Chapter VI of Part I of the Finance Act, 1980, or the rendering of services in the course of a service&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a substantial and important amendment and it represents the reason for our having to rush through so many other parts of the Bill.  It is a great pity that, although we are working to an arrangement to deal with all parts of the Bill, we must rush through a Bill as detailed as the one before us and have merely one-line replies which do not do justice to what we are supposed to be doing here, that is, legislating.</P>
    <P>The Committee Stage of any Bill is hardly exciting.  It is never very sexy from the point of view of public presentation. However, our job is not to entertain.  It is to deal with matters of substance and argument.  If detail is not very entertaining, that is too bad; but we must do our work.</P>
    <P>The Minister is confining the scheme as outlined in section 16 to manufacturing industry.  I am glad he has met the argument we made some time ago and has not confined the scheme to new manufacturing industry.  He is now extending it to manufacturing industry and to certain international trading services, namely, consultancies and the IDA and SFADCo recognised services.  That is as far as it goes.  To put it simply, our amendment &mdash; and this is the most important we will be making on this Bill &mdash; proposes that this provision for investment should not be confined to manufacturing industry.  A job is a job wherever it is created.  From the latest trends in unemployment we see the need to maintain and generate employment at every level.  Our amendment would have the effect of enabling this scheme to be operated through a service sector, with the exception of distribution trades, which we understand should not be included for many reasons, professional services and banking, financial, insurance and services <Col N="414" /> ancillary to any of the foregoing.  With those exclusions only, we see no reason why the other services such as those in the construction and tourist industries, which have a capacity to generate much more employment than the manufacturing industry, should be excluded.  It is essential that the Minister should adopt our proposal.  The IDA project that we will create 1,000 new jobs in the manufacturing industry this year but that will not be nearly enough to meet our employment requirements.  From the figures issued by the Central Statistics Office we can see that the numbers employed now in the manufacturing industry are fewer than they were in 1966 and falling.  It is regrettable but true.</P>
    <P>The numbers unemployed at present are about 20,000 more than the numbers employed in the manufacturing industry.  A recent report issued by the ESRI suggests that, on current trends, unemployment could rise to 325,000 by 1991. This indicates that we must do something radical and positive and give clear signposts for investment in any area which will generate and maintain employment. Having regard to the experience in the United States, Japan and other countries which have developed economies, it is obvious that the service sector is the engine of growth for employment, and that is not denigrating the contribution of the manufacturing sector.  The numbers employed in the manufacturing industry in the United States are nearly the same now as 20 years ago.  Nonetheless, they have witnessed an increase of 2 per cent in each year of the 20 years in the service sector of their economy.</P>
    <P>If we look at the trends in the manufacturing industry here we must recognise that they are very discouraging.  As the IDA have limited their projections to 1,000 new jobs this year, do we really think that this scheme is going to be a signpost for new growth and development of employment on a major scale?  I have not had time to argue about the impact which the scheme will have because of the unnecessary complexities but I believe that all but the most technically illiterate will be discouraged from <Col N="415" /> investing because of its complexities. However, it is important to realise that, if we want to generate employment, we cannot confine it to the manufacturing industry.  On that basis, we are proposing that this scheme would allow participation and we have done it in a very simple form which is not particularly characteristic in the sense of some of the definitions in the Bill.  We say it should be applied to all trades except distribution, professional services and banking, financial, insurances and services ancillary to any of the foregoing.  Is there any reason why jobs created in the hotel industry should be distinguished from those created in the manufacturing industry?  Are they not as valuable?  Is the same amount of employment not involved?  Is there any reason why jobs created in the construction industry should not be as important in terms of critical unemployment?  Is there any reason why agricultural developments, where three young farmers form a company and need capital for development purposes but cannot afford it because of high bank charges, or perhaps because of inherited charges, should be excluded?</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that this scheme is desirable and we have been calling for it for the past 12 months.  The Minister should take his courage in his hands and promote investment right through the corporate trades with the exception of those I have mentioned.  Nothing short of that will make any impact on the drop off in investment here, especially over the last couple of years.  We have heard of black holes and investment leakages and we have seen the increase in the rate of unemployment.  We must create a better climate for investment in every area.  For that reason, this amendment is vitally important.  If the Minister could give some indication of his readiness to extend the scheme beyond the limited areas to which it applies at present we would have achieved something.  If it is confined to the manufacturing industry basically, with the constraints and technicalities involved, it will not make an impact.</P>
    <P>At an investment conference recently I was asked by a pessimistic if not cynical <Col N="416" /> businessman how long it would take to get the country moving if the right climate and encouragement were there.  It did not take very long to do this some time ago. In 1957 and 1958 the change was dramatic because the right signals were given and the proper signposts were erected on the basis that investment was welcome. Work will be rewarded.  Achievement will be honoured.  Above all else the confidence to achieve it will be promoted in every direction.  It did not take even six months to bring about that dramatic change.  That can be done now by the Government, provided they put up the right signposts and signals.  What I have suggested is the kind of thing that is required.</P>
    <P>It would not cost very much money. Deputy Taylor may have asked about this earlier.  In the UK where it extends to the services sector in some areas, the evidence is that the cost to the Revenue is relatively very little.  If we were to extend that scale over here, or even with a full-blooded application of the scheme, in initial terms we might be talking of a loss of £10 million in one year, but there would be a much greater benefit to the Revenue in a very short time through all of the increased investments in activity and jobs which would be created.</P>

      <P>The consequences of Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment would make the mind boggle.  He is proposing that virtually any kind of investment would accord the investor tax relief on the amount of his investment, no matter what he put it into, bar the professional services and the limitations in his amendment. That must be one of the most ill-thought out proposals to come before the House for quite some time.  One would find it hard to imagine what the effects would be on the income tax revenue to the Exchequer were this amendment to be implemented.

      <P>Even granting those, they are pretty limited in the spectrum of economic activity.  To say any person who makes any investment in anything bar those can take the amount of his investment off his income tax returns I can only <Col N="418" /> describe as unreal.  I cannot believe Deputy O'Kennedy could put that forward here on any realistic basis.  We want to see jobs provided and economic activity generated, but not financed by reducing the income tax bills of the wealthy. That is what it amounts to.  That would be a licence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The result would be indefinite in the extreme.  The whole scheme has a question mark over it.  It is new.  It is tentative.  I have reservations about the concept behind it.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the amendment is irresponsible because Deputy O'Kennedy is excluding a large number of the difficult areas.  Deputy Taylor should remember that in the United States some 60 per cent of people employed are employed in service industries. Throughout Western Europe generally manufacturing is not growing; if anything, it is in a decline.  More and more jobs are being provided in service industries.  If one were to take seriously the economic analysts in this and other countries, one would see that the greatest scope for future employment in most of the western world appears to be in the service areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is manufacturing that needs a boost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole economic <Col N="419" /> thinking that only manufacturing is of use is being questioned increasingly.  In our small country we have two enormous assets.  One is our land from which we can have agricultural production, and the other is our people, neither of which we import.  In so far as people can be developed, they can be developed without being imported as service people providing service industries.  The whole trend towards grant-aiding capital machinery increases imports.  As against that, it must be attractive to grant-aid a little labour and try to remove and reduce taxation on employment, for example, the PRSI levels. I would not be as black and white as Deputy Taylor about the usefulness of tackling unemployment by providing service type industries.  It might be appropriate for a small country like ours. If we want to have employment in that area, I do not see the difficulty in extending the scheme to the labour intensive industries, the service industries.</P>
      <P>I have to make the point that, almost by definition, not quite, the service industries are labour intensive.  Because of that, if the idea behind the scheme is to create employment, the thrust of the scheme should be in the areas which are labour intensive, and not in the areas which are necessarily capital intensive.  I put that forward as one argument.  The restriction is contrary to Government policy which is to create employment. This would appear not to be tackling an area which is the fastest growing area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to put on record that the food processing industry is deemed to be manufacturing and, therefore, will qualify.  I believe that is the position.  If the Minister cannot accept Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment &mdash; I have no doubt he has his own strong reasons for not accepting it, if that is his decision &mdash; he might consider the spirit of it.  The Bill states that an employment grant has to be paid under section 2 of the Industrial Development (No. 2) Act, 1981.  In other words, the IDA, under the 1981 Act, will have to deem the company to be eligible for an employment grant. To take account of what will be in the industrial White Paper will the Minister <Col N="420" /> not consider including &ldquo;IDA approved services&rdquo; without stating specifically that it must be paid under the 1981 Act?  I can see a position arising, after much discussion on the White Paper on industrial policy, when we may decide that services are not on the backs of industry but are good in themselves.  We may decide to broaden the range of services which are respectable, as it were, economically.  If we did we would be tied by this legislation which states that an employment grant has to be paid under the 1981 Act.  If the Minister cannot accept Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment he should insert the wording I have suggested so that the IDA can be flexible.</P>
    <P>Recently the Government announced that they were allowing the computer software industry to be considered as a service industry so that it could qualify for the 10 per cent.  That was a good decision and I compliment the Government on it.  Overnight it brought that industry into the 10 per cent area and deemed it to be manufacturing.  If the change we have suggested is not made and if the matter is not left to the IDA on a day-to-day basis the Minister will be unduly restrictive.  The Minister should consider changing the wording to allow flexibility so that if the IDA decide next year that a different type of service company was interesting, and equally as exciting as the computer software industry, they could say that it qualifies without it being necessary for us to legislate for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The manufacture of goods within the meaning of the 1980 Finance Act is the term that applies here. That includes certain non-manufacturing services at Shannon and other items such as fish produced within the State, cultivated mushrooms, or repairs carried out to a ship within the State and design and planning services in certain circumstances. As Deputy Brennan mentioned, there is also the question of the IDA under the 1981 Act.  Quite a number of concerns already qualify under the section proposed by the Minister.  Before Report Stage I should like the Minister to consider the fact that because a company <Col N="421" /> must make a claim for manufacturing relief it cannot at any time in the future become entitled to export sales relief.  I do not know if the Minister intended that to happen but perhaps he will discuss it with his advisers to see if it is likely to occur.</P>
      <P>It is my belief that if on a cost-effective basis the State would be better off in terms of what it will not have to pay out in unemployment benefit and so on and what it will get in in the form of PAYE and PRSI by people being employed and having a better way of life we should decide to encourage this investment in a wider range of activities.  It would be going too far for the Minister to accept the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Kennedy because it is very wide. Under our existing system I do not have any difficulty in supporting a broadening of the scheme if (a) there will be an improvement in the number of people employed and (b) it will be cost-effective for the State.</P>
      <P>Before we get carried away about the State encouraging people to invest in employment we should look at the other tax incentives given by the State.  For instance, the State gives capital allowances to many companies that are outside the limitations expressed by the Minister. With regard to the tax advantages to individuals we might just as well ask why the State should give tax advantages to banks in so far as they allow companies to deduct bank interest against tax thereby encouraging them to take loans from banks.  The same thing applies here. We are saying that if people take the risk we will give them a certain tax advantage and that may encourage more to take risks which in turn may lead to more employment.  We should not have any ideological hang-up about this.  If at the end of the day the cost-effectiveness of this is sufficiently advantageous to the State I would welcome the widening of it. It may be that when the scheme is in operation the Minister may decide to broaden it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we accepted Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment we would be taking too broad a sweep all at once.  However, for the future I hope the Minister has an <Col N="422" /> open mind on this.  We must be serious about our intentions.  Different points of view are being put forward about employment in the future.  According to one economic report we should consider whether the public service should be a vehicle for employment while another report suggests that it should be the manufacturing area.  It appears to me that in the area of leisure time development there is potential for the future.  After the scheme has been in operation for a while the Minister might consider broadening it.</P>

    <P>In page 22, subsection (2), to delete lines 39 to 44, and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a) be carried on by a body corporate and must not wholly or mainly consist of any of the following trades:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not outlined our reasons for opposing various sections in this Chapter.  We are opposing this Chapter and the various sections in it because of the principle of tax relief for the wealthy.  When we give tax relief to someone, somebody else has to pay more.  Tax relief for people with wealth means less well off people have to pay more.  Payments to the Exchequer must be kept up.  The more relief we have at the top the more must be paid at the bottom.  That is a simple fact of life.  The principle of tax relief has been opposed by the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was supposed to bring in a tax credit system this year but did not do so.  Tax relief in such a broad chapter would lead to more loopholes and tax evasion.  I am sure there are hundreds of loopholes in these sections.  They are wide open to tax evasion.  Deputy O'Kennedy's amendments only extend the scope for tax evasion.  Every amendment he put down opened up further scope for tax relief for those with wealth. They would also open up further loopholes for tax evasion and tax fiddling. <Col N="424" /> There is no indication in this or any of the other sections that the number of jobs created will relate to the loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  The appropriate action the Minister should adopt is to take full tax from those with wealth and incomes which can produce money for investment and provide the IDA, the National Development Corporation or whatever other agencies for job creation the Minister has in hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Various agencies have been set up by various parties over the years.  These agencies or semi-State bodies are constantly short of money or are taxed to bring in revenue, such as the ESB.  This is because tax relief is given to those who have money to pay tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to hold up the business of the House because, if the Bill is to be rushed through, it may as well be rushed through.  If the tax relief system is the one to be adopted &mdash; this is most favoured by the Government and Fianna Fáil &mdash; the relief should be related to the number of jobs created.  In that way the loss to the Exchequer would be directly related to the number of jobs created.  While various sections attempt to make sure that they are engaged in job creation there is no guarantee that this is so.  They will give all the reasons in the world as to why it is not possible to create employment.  All they have to do is maintain the existing number of jobs and say that the money was used to hold on to them.  If we are intent on job creation the relief should be related to the number of jobs created.</P>

      <P>In view of Deputy <Col N="425" /> Taylor's comment that the scope of my amendment is so broad as to allow all kinds of loopholes, I would be disposed to add in addition to &ldquo;distribution trade&rdquo;, &ldquo;distribution and transport trade&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla's view is that we should take the tax but put it back into all kinds of agencies and development corporations.  Our approach is diametrically opposed to that.  It is fine if you take tax from everyone and put it into the maw of the State to spend on agencies and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to spend less money and the Minister is aware of that. If Deputy Mac Giolla had been present for all of the debate he would have noticed that I proposed my amendments on the basis of guaranteeing employment for workers.  That is the only interest we have on this side of the House.  If Deputy Mac Giolla cannot recognise that obvious fact, too bad for him and those he claims to represent.  If one is against the private sector, in Deputy Mac Giolla's world, there are places where one can go, but an entirely different system is in operation. If one wants full-blooded socialism one can go and get it, but one will not get it in a democracy such as ours.  In other places everything is done by Big Brother. If that is the way The Workers' Party want it, let it be.  At least they are consistent. We are not for Big Brother who controls everything.  We are for every individual, whether worker or business man, being encouraged and rewarded for effort.  We have not done anything other than promote the interest of the worker. The Minister agreed to reduce the minimum qualification from £500 to £200.  Is it a wealthy man who puts in £200?  Will we use emotional arguments about only the very rich investing in these schemes? We are not concerned with them but rather with the very poor.  We will not be misrepresented.</P>

If a person with an income of £50,000 invests £20,000, he will not really be investing £20,000 because he would be paying £14,000 or £15,000 in tax.  That is money he owes the Exchequer.  In reality his £20,000 investment is costing him about £5,000.  That is the situation that will be seen by the man in the street.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that the scope of the scheme is a good deal wider than some people seem to think.  I thought Deputy Mitchell was going to elaborate on this a little but he left a bit of the nail for me to hammer home.  We have already included in the 10 per cent scheme &mdash; that is, in the definition of manufacturing processes &mdash; a number of things like making movie films, developing and printing films, engineering services for projects carried on outside the EEC and so on.  The services we are adding include data processing services and software development, technical and consulting services, research and development services, publishing services, international financial services, health care services and a number of others.  We are not talking about a scheme which covers only a very small part of our industrial or service base, quite the contrary.  We are talking about a scheme which will cover a fairly substantial part of it.</P>
      <P>The corresponding scheme in the United Kingdom is not confined to manufacturing and a restricted number of services, there is no limitation on it, but 38 per cent of the funds were invested in computer-related business, which would be covered by our scheme.  In the United Kingdom scheme agriculture was originally included and it was found that some of the most undesirable abuses came about because people used the scheme simply to finance purchases of agricultural property under the guise of getting involved in an agricultural business.  They did not add, as is our intention, to the total level of activity and employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not be over-impressed by reference to the United Kingdom scheme but I find no difficulty in looking at what happened to similar schemes in other countries and learning from those lessons to ensure that we get the results that we want from this scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been delimited to get the best results and the best multiplier effect we can from the application of investment to the kind of activity we have talked about.  We could spread the net wider.  There would be no difficulty doing that.  It would require no imagination whatsoever.  We could spread the investment jam a little more thinly and get a lesser result, but we are talking about a sensible balance between the requirements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In short, I do not accept the Deputy's amendment because I do not think it is necessary to go that far to get the effect we want from this scheme.  I will leave it at that because we could talk about this for quite a long time. I did not expect that this modest section of my Bill would be the occasion for a major philosophical debate between the proponents of Deputy Mac Giolla's philosophy and Deputy O'Kennedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 48a:</P>
      <P>In page 52, before section 44, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;44. &mdash; The Finance Act, 1983 is hereby amended by the substitution of the following section for section 52:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;52. &mdash;Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter the amount of advance corporation tax which a company shall be liable to pay shall be the lower of the following two amounts:</P>
      <P>(a) in respect of distributions made by it in an accounting period ending on or before the 31st day of December, 1984, shall be one half of the amount of advance corporation tax which apart from this section the company would have been liable to pay in respect of those contributions:</P>
      <P>Provided that where part of an accounting period falls before the 1st day of January, 1985 and the other part falls in a period beginning on that date this subsection shall apply as if the part ending on the 31st day of December, 1984 and the part beginning on the 1st day of January, 1985 were two separate accounting periods:</P>
      <P>(b) in respect of any distribution made by a company after the 8th day of February, 1983 (not being a dividend to which section 49 applies) an amount equal to:</P>
      <P Just="Center">A &ndash; (B&ndash;C)</P>
      <P>where:</P>
      <P>Ais the amount of advance corporation tax which would have been payable apart from the provisions of this section;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bis an amount obtained by applying the rate at which the advance corporation tax is calculated in A to the aggregate amount of all deductions obtained by the company under section 14 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, in <Col N="433" /> respect of all accounting periods ended on or before the 31st day of December, 1983;</P>
    <P>Cis an amount obtained by applying the rate at which the advance corporation tax is calculated in A to the amount of all distributions made by the company since the 5th day of April, 1976.</P>
    <P>Provided that for the purposes of paragraph (b) of this section all distributions made by a company and allowances under section 14 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976 shall be deemed to be distributions or allowances of the parent company in the case of all its 75 per cent subsidiary companies within the meaning of section 107 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, but so that any distributions paid by a company to its said parent company shall be disregarded for the purposes of this proviso.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to try to alleviate the difficulty that has been created for a number of Irish companies by the imposition of advance corporation tax associated with the dividend payment by these companies where, in particular, they have a very substantial amount of capital allowances due to them in respect of heavy investments that they made in this country in recent years in the not unreasonable belief that the circumstances under which they raised substantial finance at the request of the Government in some cases would be continued to be honoured by the Government and would not be changed, and would not be changed in effect retrospectively.  The amendment is a complicated one and I am not going to go through all the detail of it, but the net effect of it would be to enable companies who made very substantial investments here in recent years to utilise in full their capital allowances and not to find themselves in the situation now that they are in effect, paying tax on the double by having to pay advance corporation tax as well as having borne tax already on the <Col N="434" /> profits which they generated last year and this year.</P>
    <P>The very fact that this whole problem relates to something with a name like advance corporation tax suggests to many people that it is some form of taxation on enormous companies that do not matter tuppence to the man in the street and, therefore, something like this should be nodded through as being pure and ideologically a good thing and its consequences for the country and the credibility of the country should be ignored.  I do not look on it in that fashion.  I have a particular interest in this which I do not deny, a personal interest in this limited sense that I was a member of the Government who gave certain assurances to one company in particular and who gave general assurances to companies generally in terms of encouraging them to incur capital investment in this country.  I feel that, through no fault of mine or of any of my colleagues in Government, those companies have been misled.</P>
    <P>It is not just my view.  I can produce for the Minister, if he wants it, a long list of views from stockbrokers and from the representatives of various financial institutions who habitually have invested in this country and who, in all our interests, should continue to invest in this country. They take a very jaundiced view indeed of the arrangements that have been made here in relation to advance corporation tax.  Most of the views are expressed on behalf of institutions by stockbrokers. People here like Deputy Mac Giolla and others will make out that if stockbrokers are complaining about something that is being done, therefore it is almost axiomatic that it was the right thing to do, and some of the latter-day socialists in the Labour Party who are still adhering or pretending to adhere to those views say the same thing.  That is childish and immature.  In this country we want more and more investment and we are frightening off the very people who can give it to us and the very sort of people who have given it to us in the past.</P>
    <P>I will take at random the published views of the Life Association of Scotland, a large UK financial institution with heavy investments here.  They say: <Col N="435" />&ldquo;What concerns us is the retrospective aspect of advance corporation tax and its consequential inhibiting influence on dividends, in effect clawing back something which had been previously given.&rdquo;  The Friends Provident Life Office, a similar type of institution, say: &ldquo;We are very disappointed at the retrospective way in which this tax has been done.  The element of retrospection is unfortunate, a retrograde step, leaving the distinct impression on external investors at least, although it applies also to domestic investors, that the republic is an unreliable high risk investment area.&rdquo;  Goodbody and Wilkinson, the Dublin stockbrokers, say: &ldquo;As investment advisers our strongest objection to the ACT legislation is its retrospective effect on companies who have substantial undistributed revenue reserves which have already borne tax and have invested heavily and may now find themselves facing major unbudgeted and retrospective tax outlay.&rdquo;  The Stock Exchange, Dublin, generally state that: &ldquo;ACT has brought a retrospective change in tax.  It takes away what had been for good reasons given.&rdquo;  Bailey, Gifford and Co., Investment Managers, Edinburgh, state: &ldquo;We are a firm with funds under management of some £650 million sterling.  We have quite sizeable investment in Ireland and we, accordingly, take a close and active interest in developments in your country which might affect companies operating there. We now find that one of the main planks on which our investment case was based has been removed by the introduction of ACT.  In the circumstances it appears to us that what has been done is tantamount to retrospective legislation&rdquo;.  I have about six more of these but to a great extent they are saying much the same thing in different ways.  It is fair to say that it is the universal view of the investment community that this is an unfair, penal and retrospective act of double taxation which has seriously affected the credibility of this country and put in jeopardy future investment by people who were advised by people like these, who control insurance, pension and other major funds of that kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> I believe this is the first instance of retrospective taxation where taxation already existed.  A distasteful aspect of it is the fact that it has introduced this concept of retrospective taxation.  It is now to be borne on the distribution of accumulated profits which have been fully charged to tax on the day ACT was introduced. As such, it is in effect a levy of 54 per cent with retrospective effect on past tax profits.  I know that in reply the Minister will say that cash did not actually pass in respect of the previous tax profits but we know that those companies were availing, as they were entitled to do, of their capital allowances.</P>
    <P>It is not normally the practice to refer in the House to the affairs of an individual company but in the particular circumstances it is appropriate and necessary to refer to the affairs of one large Irish company because on 2 July 1980 I, as Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, with the agreement of the Government and of the Minister for Finance of the day, wrote a letter to the chief executive of Cement-Roadstone Holdings Limited giving them certain assurances in exchange for their assurance that they would undertake without delay certain major investments in the country which they did on the foot of the assurances I gave.  They expended over £100 million on one project.  That company feel aggrieved.  They are entitled to feel aggrieved and many other companies, Irish and foreign, will look with some scepticism, cynicism and considerable reservation in the future at any such assurance given by any member of an Irish Government if this particular procedure is persisted and if this amendment is not accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the course of that letter I said:</P>
    <P>I have accepted the National Prices Commission's recommendation that the Carsberg method of calculating depreciation and interest be applied to claims from Irish Cement Limited using a percentage cost to capital of 13 per cent.  The working of this methodology will be subject to periodic review by the Commission with an initial <Col N="437" /> review after five years and thereafter three year intervals.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on at some length on the question of prices and in particular on the question of this Carsberg methodology. That Carsberg methodology which was approved by the National Prices Commission, which I accepted and the Government approved of, takes into account, in making the calculations on which this agreement was based, the fact that if this company spent £100 million they had corresponding capital allowances and that they would get value for those capital allowances.  Does the Minister or anybody seriously think that that company would have invested in the country over £100 million if within a few years of doing so and at the very time they came on stream, the whole basis on which they had financed that project would be swept from under them?</P>
    <P>I am not saying anything that the company have not publicly said.  They will clearly be in a very difficult position in endeavouring to arrange any such future financing of any major project in the country if they ever intended to undertake it.  It is very unlikely that that particular company will ever undertake again in the country anything of that magnitude. There are many other companies who might have under consideration the building of projects which would be of that magnitude or of a greater magnitude. Are they likely to do it in these circumstances in the light of what they have seen happen?</P>
    <P>It would be easy, in reply to all this, to paint this as somebody making a case on behalf of large, rich companies and so on.  The Minister should face up to the reality, which is that the two largest Irish manufacturing public companies are rapidly disengaging from the country.  The largest of them have now more than 70 per cent of their assets invested abroad. They generate 100 per cent of their profits from abroad.  The company of which I have spoken, who have very heavy investments here, have a substantial part of their assets abroad and most if not all of their profits are generated from abroad.  When we see the views that are <Col N="438" /> taken about their situation in the country by some of the largest indigenous manufacturing companies here it will not be long until other smaller companies begin to take the same view.  There was a tradition in the country of honouring agreements, of not changing the law retrospectively and of not changing the rules after companies had committed themselves to a particular course of action.  It was one of the strengths up to very recently of the country that that was the situation and that people could be confident that things which might happen to them in certain other countries unexpectedly would not happen here even if there were repeated changes of Government as we have had over the years.</P>
    <P>I often recall being able to give assurances in the United States in relation to the provisions of the 1980 Finance Act relating to the new corporation tax rate brought in at that time that in my view it would continue to be honoured by all Irish Governments up to its expiry date of 31 December 2000, because I was able to point to the fact that the earlier incentives, which were introduced in 1958, had been honoured without exception by a long succession of Governments of different political parties from 1958 up to the time I was talking in 1980 and 1981. I could no longer give that assurance.  In all honesty I would have to say to companies now: I am very sorry, nothing happened between 1958 and 1983 but it did happen in 1983 and I cannot say that you would have the certainty now you would have enjoyed in the years between 1958 and 1983.</P>
    <P>Briefly the effect of this amendment is not to seek to change the principle of what is involved here.  It is simply to seek to remove the penal, unfair, retrospective aspect of it and allow companies which have incurred heavy capital expenditure here &mdash; and which are not entitled to capital allowances &mdash; to continue in that situation until the capital allowances they enjoyed up to last year have run out fully.  In the case of some companies with very big capital allowances that may be as much as five, six or seven years.  In the case of other companies it may be a question of only six, 12 <Col N="439" /> or 18 months.  As far as I can see the amount involved for the Exchequer is negligible.  It has often been very difficult to ascertain exactly what net extra money the Exchequer reaps from this in the longer term.  But it has had a fairly catastrophic effect on some companies. Because of their experience it has at least equally seriously called into question the validity of a lot of potential investment in this country that is more necessary today than at any other time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief to enable the Minister to reply, I hope positively, to this amendment.</P>
      <P>Very quickly I want to support my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, in everything he has said.  I have not the detailed knowledge of this matter that he has.  The Minister will have gathered that Deputy O'Malley feels very strongly about this. Deputy O'Malley was personally very deeply involved in encouraging a major investment by an indigenous Irish company, by one of our best, native companies, and there is a great deal at stake in this matter.  It is very technical and complicated and might appear to some to be an accountancy matter only but it is more than that.  What we are concerned with here is to endeavour to ensure that this company which in all good faith &mdash; at a time when it was very badly needed &mdash; made a major investment in this country in a very sound, productive enterprise project be allowed use up its capital allowances as long as they continue to subsist deriving from this major investment. In putting down this amendment we had in mind one particular company but, of course, it affects many others and the principle is of general application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one respect the Minister is on very weak ground here, that is that he has to some extent admitted the validity of our argument when, last year, he agreed that half only of his provision in regard to advance corporation tax would come into <Col N="440" /> operation: in other words, he postponed the full implementation of the new provision in regard to advance corporation tax.  I hope the reason he did so was that he saw the validity of the argument we were then advancing.  Having done that he is now in a very false position in not accepting this amendment because it has been very tightly drawn.  Because of the way it has been drawn I am assured by experts that it will obviate the difficulties and problems which the Revenue Commissioners feared in regard to our proposal last year.  In other words, I am led to believe that it will not result&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <P>If the Minister's experts examine it carefully I can assure him that this amendment will ensure that nobody who is not entitled to it will be able to gain at the expense of the Revenue.  That is what we have tried to achieve in this amendment.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I want to fully support Deputy O'Malley in what he has said. We believe that a serious injustice is being done to this company but that it is more than that.  Because of the manner in which advance corporation tax has been introduced something is happening here which is to the detriment of investment by indigenous Irish companies in Irish enterprise.  That is what we are concerned about.  On this occasion I appeal to the Minister &mdash; because of the very restrictive and limited way in which it is drawn &mdash; to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed a similar proposal on Report Stage of last year's Finance Bill.  I said then, and it is still the case, that a proposal of this kind would very substantially reduce, if not entirely eliminate, the amount of advance corporation tax which a company with a large volume of capital allowances would pay. Of course it is the case that many companies have large amounts of capital allowances, so to speak, still unused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of advance corporation tax obviously means that the payment is made by companies which are paying out <Col N="441" /> dividends.  It is only right that we reflect on the system with which advance corporation tax is intended to deal.  In the situation as it obtained before advance corporation tax, a company that paid dividends of, say, £2 million, carrying tax credits of £1 million, would pay no tax if it had an appropriate amount of capital allowances unused.  Under advance corporation tax, as the scheme obtains at present, such a company would pay £500,000 to repay to the Exchequer, in effect, the tax credit that is given to the people who receive those dividends.  An advance corporation tax is in fact a payment by the company of the amount of the cost of the tax credit that is given to the people who receive dividends in advance of the company's own payment of corporation tax.  The system is designed to avoid a situation in which the Exchequer, the Revenue, taxpayers, pay out the tax credit &mdash; as was the case up to now &mdash; without ever getting any matching tax revenue from the people who benefited from the tax credit.  That is the logic of advance corporation tax.  That is what the system is intended to bring about.</P>
    <P>In equity I cannot see any argument against doing that.  If a tax credit is given there should be no net cost to the Exchequer, there should be no net burden to be carried by the general body of taxpayers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the advance corporation tax system avoids.  It avoids a situation in which one pays out a tax credit in the confident knowledge that one is never going to collect that corresponding amount of taxation.  The continuation of the 50 per cent base for advance corporation tax which we have at present will involve a cost to the Exchequer in 1985 of approximately £5 million.  That represents the amount of tax credit which would otherwise be paid out by the Revenue without any corresponding tax being paid on it by the company concerned or by the people who receive the dividends at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed a similar amendment this time last year and the situation has not <Col N="442" /> changed in any respect since then.  I am afraid I must say that the justification for the system remains exactly the same now as it was then.  The arguments against it remain exactly the same.  I cannot find a reason for taking a different view from the one I took last year.  I do not intend to make a reply along some of the lines Deputy O'Malley indicated.  I will not make a reply to the effect of denigrating in any way the investment activities of any Irish or non-Irish company setting up here.  That is not my business.  The suggestion that in some way the operation of ACT is designed to stop people investing is absolutely nonsensical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of ACT simply means that the Exchequer and the taxpayer do not bear the burden of a tax credit in cases where no tax is paid.  The effect of the amendment would be largely to take away revenue from advance corporation tax in 1985.  The situation has not changed in any respect since this time last year.  I continue to take the view I took then and I oppose this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A company which is now suffering losses and is therefore not liable for tax but which has built up revenue reserves which have been fully taxed over the years may feel it necessary in order to retain shareholder and institutional confidence to pay a dividend this year.  Does the Minister consider it equitable that a company which pays a dividend in that situation should also bear on that dividend, paid out of already taxed revenue reserves, advance corporation tax of several million pounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it entirely equitable that a company which pays out a dividend to which a tax credit is attached should make a payment of advance corporation tax.  If that company subsequently has a liability for corporation tax, the amount of ACT paid is offset against that corporation tax.  If the company subsequently does not have a liability for corporation tax I see no reason why the Exchequer <Col N="443" /> should make a present on that distribution of the amount of the tax credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 50:</P>
      <P>In page 60, lines 14, 15 and 16, to delete &ldquo;issued by An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann and guaranteed by the Minister for Finance as it applies to the forms of security specified in paragraph (d) of that section.&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;issued&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in the State, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, by the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Atomic Energy Community or the European Investment Bank as it applies to the forms of security specified in paragraph (a) of that section, and</P>
      <P>(b)  by An Post or Bord Telecom Éireann and guaranteed by the Minister for Finance as it applies to the forms of security specified in paragraph (d) of that section.&rdquo;.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to extend to securities issued by the European Coal and Steel Community, the <Col N="444" /> European Atomic Energy Community and the European Investment bank the exemption from capital gains tax granted to Government and other public securities by the 1975 Act.  I have been approached this year by the European Investment Bank with a request that they be allowed to raise certain amounts on the Irish market and I have approved an issue of £10 million to be made by that institution.  What I want to do is to extend to the securities of the European Investment Bank and the other bodies the same capital gains tax treatment as is now accorded to Government and other public securities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not oppose this amendment.  I would point out that the Minister's view in this matter is in sharp contrast with the view he took on the amendment of which we have just disposed. Here he is prepared to facilitate the raising of capital on our rather meagre domestic market by these institutions of the Community when, despite the very cogent argument put forward by Deputy O'Malley, he refuses to facilitate the raising of capital by indigenous manufacturing industries.  The Minister is adopting a very mixed approach to different areas in this Finance Bill.  In this amendment he is facilitating the raising of capital on our market by outside institutions whereas he resisted an appeal from us to help investment in Irish companies by institutions in the same domestic market.  That being said, we have to play our part in Community affairs by facilitating this proposal from the European institutions, although, having regard to the relative state of development of respective economies throughout the Community, it is somewhat ironic that these large Community institutions should be coming to our capital market and raising funds there.  It is not a point we would wish to press very strongly. One imagines that there are other markets in the Community where capital is much more freely available and in much greater amounts than is the case in our market.  However, if we have to do this as part of our contribution to the Community and its operation, so be it.</P>

The particular question of the European Investment Bank has arisen only this year.  It is all very fine for Deputy Haughey to make his rather opportunistic and irrelevant points when he knows very well that the European Investment Bank has been a major source of funding for a number of projects in this country.  As a prudent banker, if no more, it would wish to have a certain component of our currency in its funding resources because of the kind of lending it undertakes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposed to the section because we see it as illustrating once again the way this Government are attacking private residences and the security in which every citizen invests, that is, the security of his own home.  In the course of the debate on the Finance Bill last year we witnessed an example of the Government's determination to introduce an income-related property tax.  During this discussion I should like the Minister to disclose the amount that has accrued to the Revenue as a result of that tax so that we might contrast the <Col N="446" /> small amount it has produced with the amount that may have been taken out of the economy as a result of it.  The Government's position on that tax was taken to accommodate the Labour Party. Despite all the cogent arguments we put forward last year against the imposition of the tax, the Government proceeded with it.  I understand that something of the order of £700,000 or £800,000 gross has resulted from the tax.  Allowing for the fact that our whole taxation system is already much too complex, the introduction of a scheme to attack private residences or income related to them commended itself to the Government.</P>
      <P>In a sense, the Government are being consistent this year.  They are being consistent with that unreasonable stance taken last year.  This year they are proposing in this section to apply capital gains tax to residences which up to now would have been exempt, on disposal, from capital gains tax.  I am talking of a residence that is on a site of up to one acre.  The Government are proposing that on the disposal of such a residence capital gains would accrue on that portion of the proceeds of the sale which can be attributed to what one might call the development element in the sale cost.</P>
      <P>There are a number of anomalies in that approach.  One might ask how long is a piece of string or what part of the string contains different elements within it because the Government propose now to enable the Revenue Commissioners to conclude that when a house is sold, a certain amount of the proceeds would have been got as being the value of the residence for residential purposes, that so much more apparently is to be free from capital gains tax but that there is another element in the sale price of a house and one acre which embraces an enhanced value element attributable to speculation or development potential on the site and that that element is to be made liable for capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is importing into the legislation another attack on the principle of the private residence.  We must encourage investment and activity that will generate employment but we must face the fact that regardless of what people do in the <Col N="447" /> course of commerce, investment or anything else, if they are successful they will invest some of the profit in their homes. They may buy bigger or better homes for their families.  This is totally commendable in a society that has always encouraged home ownership.  On the one hand the Government may be pretending to encourage that but on the other hand they are attacking the concept very severely.</P>
    <P>In addition to my question as to the return last year from that ridiculous piece of legislation to which I have referred, one might ask also what the Minister expects to get from what he is proposing here.  The amount of money involved would need to be considerable to justify a proposal of this nature which of itself will signal further to people that if by any chance they come into a more secure way of life and if by way of reward for their work they earn money they would like to invest in their homes, they had better think twice.  Those are the kinds of signals that this Government are putting out all over the place.  They may talk as much as they wish about trying to create a climate for what the Minister calls competitiveness &mdash; that is so that we might somehow minimise the effect of the lack of policy on the part of the Government &mdash; but signals such as the one we are addressing here and such as the one I have referred to in relation to last year's Act indicate clearly that if a person happens to have a house on one acre and intends selling it, he will be caught on that, too.</P>
    <P>The level of taxation in this economy has reached intolerable proportions.  One would wish to see a balance within that range between income tax, capital taxation and the various other forms of taxation but the level of our total taxation is now at about £6,125 million.  That is a huge increase since the coming into office of this Government, an increase of the order of almost £2,000 million.  However, the appetite has not been satisfied and there are other areas one can point to. No doubt, the Government will attack some more areas.  All this means that we will only succeed in telling people that if they work they will be penalised, that if <Col N="448" /> they invest, they will be penalised and that if they buy a house that is a little better than the one they have and then sell it, they will be penalised also.</P>
    <P>I do not see the reason for continuing with that kind of approach apart altogether from the fact that sections of the Revenue Commissioners are already unable to cope with the whole taxation system.  For evidence of that we might only inquire about the number of people who are waiting for tax rebates that are theirs by right or inquire about the number of people who are waiting for subcontractors' certificates.  Indeed, there is a suggestion that that section of the Revenue Commissioners are not even answering the telephones.</P>

Perhaps I should not have mentioned it.  The Minister was touchy on that.  I merely made the point about people waiting for tax rebates.

      <P>That may be so but instead of introducing measures of the kind proposed here which require new forms and more manpower, we should use the means and the manpower that exist to work the system as it is.  For that reason, although with very slight confidence, I appeal to the Minister to drop this section.  I am sure the Minister knows that the value of a private home on the open market is now about the same in money terms as it was three years ago. There is a slump in the market and people who invested in a house to live in as being the safest and most desirable investment now find that if they had put it into pension bonds they would have done much better.  It is time we asserted that the private residence is something which the Government are not going to attack at every opportunity.  We strongly oppose this section.</P>

      <P>If we were to follow some of the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation perhaps we would do just that and indeed we have been berated for not doing so.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  It is not the Government's intention to take something away from people.  This legislation is to introduce equity and it is only intended to take something away from someone who makes a development gain over and beyond the normal capital gain. It is equitable between capital gains taxpayers and income taxpayers and it is also equitable between capital gains taxpayers.</P>
      <P>Why should someone who has a house on one and a half acres of land pay tax on a half acre when disposing of the capital asset when perhaps a neighbour has a development gain but because his house is on a acre of land he does not pay? There must be equity and I agree with the suggested taxation of the development portion of capital gain.  It is not fair to say that there is a significant change for nearly all taxpayers because most taxpayers who dispose of their houses are not involved in capital gains because they are on less than an acre and are not being disposed of for development purposes. They are buying another house in which they will be living.  It only applies to people whose houses are going to be knocked down to build a roadway or a block of offices and who will make a development gain.  That is the only portion of the gain which is taxable.  If, for instance, a person sells his house on an acre of land at the price which other houses in the area were selling for he would not have to pay any tax.  I do not think it is unreasonable to tax the development gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to compulsory purchase orders, Dublin Corporation will be laying many new roadways in the inner city and the city generally, which will mean many CPOs.  The amount which the local <Col N="451" /> authority, and the Exchequer, will have to pay will be increased because of the tax element to the beneficiary.  Someone who has a CPO served on him and receives compensation of £120,000 might find that because of the tax involved the State may have to pay him £150,000 to enable him to pay tax.  For that reason, compulsory purchase order cases should be exempt from this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>I support Deputy O'Kennedy.  This section reflects and is further evidence of the anti-private home ownership attitude of the Government which is manifested by the restriction of mortgage relief for tax purposes and the threats of further restrictions to come.  It is also envisaged by this abominable property tax which has made us the laughing stock of the civilised world.  It takes away the one concession an individual has under our capital gains tax legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>A person's home was protected from the impact of capital gains tax.  That is no longer the position.  It would be helpful if the Minister were to give an example of how this legislation will work because, like the residential property tax, it will give rise to a great deal of confusion and many court cases. My understanding is that the development element of the gain is taxable; in other words, if you acquired property before April 1974 it has a certain market value but, if the current use value is less <Col N="452" /> than the market value, part of the market value is attributable to development potential.  The current use value is deducted from the market value which, in turn, is deducted from the same sum when the property is disposed of.  If property on 6 April 1974 had a market value of £30,000 and a current use value of £10,000 we presume the £20,000 extra is due to development potential.  If the property is sold after the Bill becomes law it may be sold for £100,000 but if it did not have development potential the value would be £30,000 and, therefore, the increase in value due to development potential is £70,000.  In that case you deduct the original increase in value due to development potential from the £70,000 and take 50 per cent.  That is how the calculation is worked out.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give us an example of how it operates when he is replying.  If that is correct, the Minister is leaving out of account the fact that part of the increase in the development value will also be due to inflation and should therefore be indexed in the normal way. I should like the Minister to tell us why he proposes to tax this increase in development value at 50 per cent, without providing appropriate indexation for that part of it which is due to inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The reaction to this section of the Bill on the other side of the House is like the reaction to some other sections. It is grossly exaggerated.  For Deputies opposite to make long Second Stage speeches, if I may say so, about taxation generally on this section seems more than a little inappropriate.</P>
      <P>It is very clear from the way in which the section is written that it in no way constitutes an attack on a person's home or residence.  If Deputies look at the provisions of the section they will see exactly what is involved.  It is not by any means intended to attract the tax inspector's attention to somebody who gets a good price for his house.  It is not intended to stop people from trading up.  It is not intended to stop people from buying a better house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It applies capital gains tax where a <Col N="453" /> substantial gain is arising in comparison with the current use value of the house at the time it is sold.  It covers cases where there is a development gain and where we are not talking about somebody selling his house in order to move to another one and trying to get the best possible price on the market for his house.  In deciding whether or not a particular sale of a particular house fell to be examined under the sections of this Bill, three factors will be taken into consideration. Obviously the first is the price.  If the price is far above the current use value of the house in question, it would fall to be examined by the inspector of taxes.  I am not speaking about somebody who gets a good price for his house, somebody who would normally expect to get £60,000 for his house and gets £65,000, or £70,000, or £75,000.</P>
    <P>The second factor would be the purchaser. Who is buying the property?  Is he a developer or somebody who wants or intends to take up residence in the house?  If you have a house which would normally be valued by the market at £60,000 and you get somebody to pay £70,000 for it and move in, that is not a case where there is a development gain and, therefore, the capital gains tax provision set out here would not apply.</P>
    <P>The third factor which will be looked at is the planning situation in the area. Was there an application for planning permission to change the use of the house or of the site either just before the sale or after the sale which would have materially affected the price of the house? This measure will not be of any relevance to the 90 per cent of people who sell their houses every year and promptly move into another, having sold it to a person who is moving in with his family.  That is not what is intended.  I am not at all convinced that Deputies on the other side of the House believe for a moment that is what is intended.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If all of those factors together indicate that there is a change in <Col N="454" /> the use, that there has been a very substantial increase in the value of the house, and that the person who bought the house intends to make a different use of the property, it will fall to be looked at for the purposes of this section.</P>
      <P>Of its nature it is not the kind of measure that will be applied very frequently and it will not be terribly difficult to implement.  It will arise only where you have a conjunction of factors such as the ones I have outlined.  If they do not exist, or if that conjunction does not exist, the question does not arise at all.  Where it does arise, it seems to me to be the kind of case where the tax inspector will have to discuss the matter with the potential taxpayer.  As in most cases of that kind, they will probably reach agreement as to what the figures are on which they had to work.</P>

      <P>On Deputy Mitchell's question about compulsory purchase orders I have to point out that the 1982 Finance Act, section 36 (3), made special provisions for compulsory disposals of development property owned for over three years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me to be reasonable in the case of compulsory disposals where the people who made the disposals did not voluntarily decide to dispose of the property themselves in order to make a gain, but found themselves obliged to dispose of the property. It seems reasonable that we should make some distinction between that kind of case and the case where people voluntarily dispose of land.  I have no difficulty whatsoever in commending one of my predecessors for what seems to me to be a sensible measure, just as I would find no difficulty in castigating him retrospectively for another measure which he took <Col N="456" /> and about which Deputy O'Kennedy did not seem to have many critical remarks to make at the time.  It has created a few problems in our tax system ever since then.</P>
      <P>In relation to the method of operation of the system, I would like to be of assistance to Deputy O'Dea who raised a question in regard to that.  In my brief I have a number of examples of how the tax will work in different cases.

      <P>Equity seems to be so much in the Minister's mind that he ignores reality.  It is not something I would commend to any Minister.  It is clear from the Minister's reply that Deputy Mitchell, and his constituents, will find that when the compulsory purchase order is made on their plots &mdash; we are not talking about wealthy people and I presume he is not &mdash; they will be caught. A house and up to one acre when sold <Col N="457" /> are caught now.  They have always been exempt before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not find that very reassuring.  If the value that accrues is in the judgment of the Revenue Commissioners above the normal use value and has a development element in it, it is caught, and Deputy Mitchell should recognise that.  We are talking about people to whom if there is a road development programme &mdash; it could be in Inchicore or anywhere else &mdash; it is open to the Revenue Commissioners in view of the enhanced value for the development purposes to say that that element of it is above the normal use value allowing for an inflation index and on that capital gains tax will have to be paid.  When Deputy Mitchell votes on this he should know that that is what he is voting for. There is no point in making all the precise realities we are facing in this proposal. The explanatory memorandum is very honest on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum refers back to main residence and grounds not exceeding one acre and that includes every house and back garden from south Kerry to northwest Donegal and around this city.  The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... where consideration for a disposal on or after 25 January 1984 of <Col N="458" /> such property is significantly inflated because of development potential. </P>
    <P>It does not have to be a price that is realised at all on the actual development but development potential.  The reassuring words are:</P>
    <P>In effect, only such part (if any) of any chargeable gain which reflects a real increase (i.e. over and above the rate of inflation) in the current use value of the property disposed of will be relieved from tax.</P>
    <P>In other words, the rest is included.  The Minister in his calm style told us reassuringly that he envisages a certain conjunction of factors applying, price, purchaser, and planning situation.  I should like to tell the Minister that his reassurance is not of any consequence to us.  The Minister is only Minister of the day and when he departs the legislation stays after him. It will not be too long before another Minister will be in his place and he will be stuck with this legislation until he introduces measures to get rid of it.  Even allowing for the examples given by the Minister I do not think he believes the reassurances he has given.  It is obvious that anybody with any experience of the human condition &mdash; the Minister must have some &mdash; does not believe this.</P>

      <P>People cannot be tidied, packaged, regulated and controlled as if everything was going to work out as systematic and precise as the Minister is presenting this in the House.  We are dealing with humans and he wants to operate directly and control them in such a way that their previous habits will not operate.  According to the Minister's example the factors are the price factor, the purchaser and the planning situation. We have this tidy approach from this tidy ministerial mind.  Over and above the value in the open market this comes into play and, therefore, we are dealing with a mathematical slide rule on open market values.  The Minister must be aware that <Col N="459" /> open market value is held in law to be what a willing purchaser is prepared to pay and a willing vendor is prepared to accept.  It varies according to what is called the market demand.  For instance, one might find a purchaser in one part of the town of Ennis who is prepared to pay because he wants a house now more than a person paid one month earlier for a similar house in another part of the town. It happens all the time.  A person may pay a greatly enhanced price because he or she wants a house now.  That is open market value but not necessarily use value.  The Minister is referring to a use value.  A new concept is being introduced in that somebody will determine a use value, allow for inflation and anything over and above that can then become the part that is liable to tax.  The only way one can find a market value is by putting a place up for sale.  That gives a market value and that has been held in law.</P>
      <P>The Minister is being so precise and tidy but so unreal in this an in other ways. Those tidy definitions do not equate to reality.  They may be represented here in a calm reassuring way but that it not reality.  One may get an enhanced price for reasons other than development potential, but if one does what is to stop the Inspector of Taxes saying that the price is because the property has a development potential, that the person who bought it had something in mind and thought that in about five or ten years time he would sell it for a better price, or that part of town is popular and perhaps something will happen there?  Look at the purchaser.  Will people selling their homes shy away from potential purchasers who happen to be associated with the building industry?  What about auctioneers? Will there be a difference in approach by the tax inspector if the purchaser is an architect or surveyor to what it would be if he was a doctor or a lawyer? The Minister mentioned that as being one of the conjunction of factors, as he so tidily put it, in this tidy world where everyone behaves as if they were robots. People do not react that way.  One of the mistakes the Minister makes is assuming that they do.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell might as well know now that the question he asked has not been answered satisfactorily because it cannot be.  The only concession made was in the year before the Minister came to office.  It was in respect of people who as a result of a compulsory acquisition got an enhanced value for their property. The application of a capital gain was reduced.  It only applied to houses on sites of over one acre.  The present Minister is not prepared to follow that path. He has decided that if as a result of a compulsory acquisition a person gets an enhanced price he will be caught.  When the development plan for arterial roads and so on goes through there will be many people who will be caught.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla is not here now but he pretends to be concerned for workers. If they get an enhanced value for their property, their one-eighth of an acre or one-quarter of an acre will be liable for capital gains tax.

      <P>I do not have the same nervous approach to this as Deputy O'Kennedy.  There may be some properties in my constituency where there will be CPOs.  People will be obliged to pay tax only on the development gain if it arises and not on the capital gain.  Previously if the house and site was in excess of one acre one had to pay tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How will indexation affect the development gain?  Will it take the development gain into account or will that be <Col N="461" /> disposed of in the capital gain?  If a person is caught for tax on that portion of the capital gain which is development as a result of having a CPO served on them, will there be roll-over relief if they invest in a similar type property?  What do the provisions of the new legislation state in relation to that?  As this will not bring in any income this year and in a full year will only bring in £¼ million, it does not justify the kind of comments made about it.</P>

Full indexation will apply to the current use value for the purposes of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975.  There is no roll-over relief on private residences.  To the extent that it applies it is only to business premises.</P>

      <P>The only proposal received in my Department from Dublin County Council is in respect of a ten pitch halting site at Ballycoolin, Blanchardstown.  This was approved last February, subject to certain modifications.  These were considered essential because the council's estimate of cost, together with an allowance for items such as land, landscaping and design services would have resulted in an overall cost of about £40,000 per pitch. This figure far exceeds the cost of providing comparable facilities by any other local authority and compares unfavourably with the cost of conventional housing. Last month, the council sent a revised estimate to my Department but this suggested that there would be a significant increase in costs although the community centre which formed part of the original proposal was not included. The increased costs now indicated are being examined by my Department's technical advisers in conjunction with those of the local authority.</P>

      <P>In general, valid comparisons between road accident rates in different countries are difficult to make because of differences in the stages of development in motorisation, the degree of urbanisation, density of population and the ratio of road mileage to population. Furthermore, it is not possible to make a meaningful comparison of road accident injury rates in different countries because of the considerable variations which exist in the level of reporting of injury accidents.</P>
      <P>Subject to these limitations, road accident rates are probably best compared internationally by reference to the number of deaths per 100 million vehicle kilometres and deaths per 10,000 population. A comparison of road accident fatality rates in EEC countries in 1981 (the latest year for which comparative figures are available) as supplied by An Foras Forbartha, is set out in the Table below.</P>

      <P>A list of 55 environmental improvement proposals costing £546,000 was received in my Department on 30 March 1984 from Galway County Council.  As the Government have decided to discontinue the Environment Works (Youth Employment) Scheme, no allocation can be made by my Department for any new works and the council was informed accordingly on 4 April 1984.  However, information on a number of youth employment and training <Col N="306" /> schemes which are operated by the Department of Labour, the Youth Employment Agency and AnCO has been sent to the county council and it is open to them to consider whether some of their 1984 proposals could benefit under these schemes.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that, in addition to his earnings from employment, the taxpayer has, since June 1979, been in receipt of disablement benefit from the Department of Social Welfare.  The amounts received by way of disablement benefit are, under existing law, chargeable to income tax.  In accordance with standard practice the tax is collected by restricting the taxpayer's tax-free allowances (required for use in connection with his other earnings) by the amount of the disablement benefit thus enabling it to be paid in full without deduction of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that inadvertently the taxpayer's tax-free allowances under PAYE were not restricted to take account of the disablement benefit paid for any year <Col N="311" /> prior to 1982-83.  In consequence, the disablement benefit was not charged to tax for those years.</P>

      <P>The Interpretation Committee for the Common Contract for Consultants last met on 18 March 1983.  The chairman of the committee resigned in February 1984. Officials of the Department of Health had a meeting with representatives of the Irish Medical Union on 4 May at which the appointment of a new chairman was discussed.  I hope to announce the name of the new chairman in the near future and I expect that a meeting of the committee will be called by him for the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>Fixed appliance orthodontic treatment is normally provided by dentists in private practice on behalf of the health boards. Since July 1981 the Department has been endeavouring to get agreement with the private orthodontists on a scale of charges for this expensive treatment and pending the conclusion of such an agreement the issue of authorisations to proceed with treatments was suspended. Discussions are continuing between the Department and the private orthodontists and I am hoping for an early settlement <Col N="315" /> of the issue so that treatments can again be proceeded with.</P>

      <P>The claim to deserted wife's allowance/benefit to the person concerned is at present under investigation. The claimant has been visited by a local officer of the Department but it is also necessary to have her husband interviewed in order to obtain his version of the circumstances which led to the break-up of the marriage.  A number of unsuccessful efforts to do so have already been made and the officer will call again to his address inside the next few days.

      <P>It was decided by an appeals officer on 19 August 1983 that the person concerned is entitled to an old age pension at the weekly rate of £32.45 plus £16.30 adult dependant allowance and £7.30 dependent child allowance from 29 October 1982, which increased to £36.60 plus £18.40 and £8.20 from 1 July 1983.</P>
      <P>This is the rate to which he is entitled having regard to the assessment of his means consisting of half the weekly value of a holding.

      <P>The Deputy may have in mind the recent adjustment of the rate of allowance from 80 per cent to 70 per cent of reckonable weekly earnings in the case of the maternity scheme for women in employment.  This scheme was introduced in April 1981 as part of the Second National Understanding for Economic and Social Development.  The purpose of the scheme was to ensure that women would be fully compensated for loss of earnings after all deductions from wages or salary.  The formula devised at that time, following discussion with representatives of employers and employees, allowed for payment of an allowance amounting to 80 per cent of reckonable weekly earnings.</P>
      <P>Because of changes which have occurred in the meantime in tax and other deductions, the original formula was providing levels of benefit very much higher than was intended.  By September 1983 the continued use of the 80 per cent factor meant an effective replacement rate of take-home pay of 110 per cent.  Therefore, the anomaly was corrected by altering the rate from 80 per cent to 70 per cent of reckonable earnings with effect from 2 April 1984.</P>
      <P>The effect of this change is that women benefiting under the scheme will receive the equivalent of their net take-home pay as originally intended.  The table following illustrates the replacement ratio as it has varied since the scheme commenced:</P>

      <P>The person concerned exhausted his entitlement to unemployment benefit on 21 April 1982 when he received 390 days benefit and in the absence of employment he has no requalifying contributions paid.  He claimed unemployment assistance but his claim was disallowed on the grounds that the means assessed against him £33.65 weekly derived from the value of board and lodging in his parents house, exceeded the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable to him.  He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him but an appeals officer also assessed him with means at £33.65 weekly.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 27 February 1984 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work. She appealed against the disallowance and was examined on 13 April 1984 by a different medical referee who also considered her to be capable of work.  Her case has been referred to an appeals officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing of her claim.  She will be notified of the time and place of the hearing as soon as the arrangements have been made.</P>
      <P>According to the records at her local office she last claimed unemployment benefit on 31 May 1983 and her claim was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for employment.  She appealed against the decision and the appeals officer also decided that she was not available for employment.  She ceased to sign the unemployed register on 21 September 1983.  If she re-applies for unemployment benefit her case will be referred to a deciding officer and she will be advised of the decision in her case.</P>

      <P>Children's allowance at the monthly rate of £73.75 in respect of six qualified children is being paid to the person concerned.  His eldest son reaches age 16 on 18 May 1984 and his allowance will automatically reduce to £56.25 in respect of five qualified children from 1 <Col N="347" /> June 1984.  The allowance will further reduce to £45 in respect of four qualified children from 1 July 1984 as the certificate of full-time education furnished in respect of his eldest daughter only covers the period up to 30 June 1984.</P>
      <P>An extension of children's allowance in respect of both these children may be claimed, if they are continuing in full-time education.  Application forms for this purpose have been issued to the person concerned and when these are returned his entitlement will be reviewed.</P>

      <Col N="348" /> The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed after extensive inquiries on the grounds that she was not available for work.

His application for a transfer to invalidity pension in November 1983 was held pending the result of a medical referee examination to determine if he was permanently incapable of work.  Due to an oversight the examination was not arranged at that time but one has now been fixed for 17 May 1984.  His entitlement to invalidity pension will be reviewed in the light of the report of that examination.</P>

He <Col N="349" /> appealed against the amount of means assessed against him.

      <P>The person concerned claimed the living alone allowance on 10 February 1983 and her application was refused by the local pension committee on 28 May 1983 on the grounds that the conditions for payment of the allowance were not satisfied in her case.  She was living as part of the same household with <Col N="350" /> her son, his wife and family.

      <P>According to the Department's records the person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 10 January 1984 after being on holidays.  His claim was allowed at the maximum flat-rate unemployment benefit payable to him, £34.80, and weekly payments are being made to him as they become due. He is not entitled to pay-related benefit with his flat-rate unemployment benefit as he had insufficient earnings during the relevant income tax period 6 April 1982 to 5 April 1983.</P>

He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and an appeals officer also assessed him with means at £55 weekly in May 1983.  He is at present in receipt of unemployment assistance at £0.55 weekly being the maximum weekly rate payable to him, £55.55 less £55.  He was recently furnished with an application form to enable him to have his means reinvestigated.  When he returns the form his case will be referred to a social welfare officer for an investigation after which the assessment of his means will be reviewed and the rate of unemployment assistance payable to him will be determined accordingly.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of the maximum rate of flat-rate unemployment benefit at £74.85 weekly with pay-related benefit at £4.78 when he exhausted 156 days benefit on 16 February 1984.  To continue to receive benefit at the maximum rate he would need to have had 280 contribution weeks of employment in the preceding seven years.  He did not satisfy this condition and accordingly the weekly amount of flat-rate benefit payable to him was reduced to £65.15.  His rate of pay-related benefit was, however, increased to £11.85 weekly with effect from 17 February 1984.  Combined payments of flat-rate unemployment and pay-related benefit at £77 weekly continue to be made to him as they become due.</P>

      <P>It was decided by the local <Col N="352" /> pension committee on 2 February 1984 that the person concerned is not entitled to an old age pension on the grounds that she failed to establish that she fulfils the statutory conditions as to means.

      <P>An appeal against this decision was made on 28 February 1984 and the case was referred to an appeals officer who required further information before giving his decision.
