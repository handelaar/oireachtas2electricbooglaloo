        <i>(Limerick West)</i> asked the Taoiseach if he will give the House a report on his discussion with President Mitterand in Dublin on 21 February; and if he will indicate the position in regard to the proposed milk super-levy following the statement of the French President.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is not the practice nor would it be appropriate for me to disclose details of confidential discussions at the present stage of intensive and critical negotiations in the Community in the period between now and the meeting of the European Council in Brussels next month.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House if the French President accepted that the compromises proposed at the Athens summit would form the starting point of negotiations on Ireland's demand for exemption from the super-levy or does Ireland now have to go back to square one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's stand is what <Col N="720" /> it has been throughout, namely, that we seek an exemption from the super-levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Will the Taoiseach state if the French President indicated that France was prepared to support Ireland's case for exemption from the super-levy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The French President speaking at a press conference here gave an indication of the necessary distinction between his position as President and his position as head of the French State and Government.  I have to say that throughout the various negotiations France has been helpful to and supportive of us in relation to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should answer the question.  Is the President going to support our case for an exemption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered that question.  The President was asked a question and he gave an answer appropriate to his dual role at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> In view of the Taoiseach's reluctance to state one way or another whether the French President indicated his attitude has he any proposals to undertake any diplomatic initiatives of his own to secure Ireland's exemption from the super-levy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken the necessary diplomatic initiatives and I have maintained contact with the situation as it has developed since Athens.  I am now prepared for the meeting of the European Council on 22 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>From the reluctance of the Taoiseach to answer a straight question from my colleague, Deputy Noonan, it would seem to me that the French President did not indicate any support for Ireland's position with regard to the super-levy and our exemption therefrom. In view of the very serious position that obtains generally in relation to the Community, its development, its financing, the super-levy, the Common Agricultural <Col N="721" /> Policy generally and other issues, will the Taoiseach consider having a debate or a discussion of some kind in the House before the Council meeting takes place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said twice already, at a press conference the French President made a distinction between the French position of sympathy with the Irish position and the necessity for the Presidency of the Council to hold a position of neutrality on this point.  With regard to a debate, in view of the nature of the negotiation and its vital importance to the country, I doubt if a debate at this stage would be helpful or necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will understand that a small farmer in west Limerick producing milk would find it very difficult to distinguish between the French President speaking as President of France and speaking as President of the Council of Ministers, and in the interests of the farming community the Taoiseach might be a little more forthcoming. He must be as aware, as I and all my colleagues are, of the serious worry among the farming community about the future not alone of the dairy industry but also for the entire Common Agricultural Policy.  I am not speaking in terms of debating the matter fully, although I have seen occasions in the past when a debate of that kind was of help to the Government in strengthening their hand in going into meetings.  Does the Taoiseach not consider that this House, the public and particularly the farming community are entitled to know the present state of play in regard to some of these fundamentally important issues and the general attitude of the Government in regard to them, without necessarily disclosing any particular bargaining position on any issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a debate here before the Athens summit and it was helpful to have it at that time, but I doubt if a debate at present would strengthen our position any further and possibly it could operate the other way.  Our position is now well established and it is well understood by our partners.  I think we should proceed from where we are, to <Col N="722" /> seek exemption from the super-levy and to ensure preservation of the Common Agricultural Policy.  There is fundamental agreement in this House on these matters and I think it might be better to leave it at that at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Does the Taoiseach believe that the reported shift in our negotiating position, namely, that instead of being against the super-levy in principle we favour imposing a milk super-levy on all countries except Ireland, strengthens or weakens our negotiating position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made it quite clear that we regard the super-levy as being an inappropriate method of dealing with the problem.  We indicated other means by which the matter might be better pursued.  Developments at Athens suggested that there is a measure of consensus among other members that the super-levy may be the best way to tackle the problem.  It is essential for us that we be exempted from its operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the present arrangements available to people living in the Inishowen Peninsula who are the holders of free travel passes and who wish to travel by public transport through Derry to Dublin; if he will explain how such people can make arrangements with the Lough Swilly Bus Company and Ulsterbus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>A free travel recipient who wishes to travel from the Inishowen Peninsula to Dublin via Derry may travel to Derry on the services provided by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company on production of his free travel pass.  On presentation of a special social welfare travel warrant at the Ulsterbus depot in Derry, a ticket will be issued to him in respect of the Derry <Col N="723" /> to Monaghan town portion of his journey. The remainder of his journey may be completed on presentation of his free travel pass.</P>
      <P>The special travel warrants for use on the Derry to Monaghan town portion of the journey are available on request from my Department's offices in Townsend Street, Dublin.</P>
      <P>The question of making travel warrants available locally in these cases is being considered with Ulsterbus and CIE and I hope to be in a position to make suitable arrangements at an early date.  The Deputy will be advised of the outcome in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that these figures, caused by rising unemployment, are alarming figures to produce in the House &mdash; 14 per cent as <Col N="724" /> against 7½ per cent ten years ago?  What action will the Department take to reduce these figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I do not think they are alarming.  The increase represents not only improving rates of benefits but the expansion of the schemes in the past ten years.  The increase in those years has been due largely to the policies of successive Governments to provide real increases in payment rates and other major developments, like the introduction of the pay-related scheme in April 1974, the introduction of three new assistance schemes such as the unmarried mother's allowance in July 1983, the prisoners' wives' allowance and the single woman's allowance in July 1974, the reduction in the old age pension age to 66 years between July 1973 and October 1977, and the substitution of a new scheme of supplementary welfare allowances. Therefore, the increase is fully justified to cover all those schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is any element of that increase due to the increased numbers unemployed, and what is that increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question. The question refers to the expenditure on social welfare as a whole and it is not broken down into the various schemes.  I reiterate that the increase is largely due to the policies of successive Governments during the years in increasing social welfare payments and introducing new schemes.  The increases since 1973 in the rates of payment and the increases in the number of schemes have been enormous.  They have resulted in increased spending on social welfare.</P>

    <P>(a) Based on provisional returns, <Col N="725" /> the amount expended by my Department on unemployment related payments in the year to November 1983 amounted to £479.7 million.</P>
    <P>(b)  If unemployment had remained at the November 1982 level, it is estimated that expenditure for the period would have amounted to approximately £437.9 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason the minimum allowance for unemployment assistance was granted to a person (details supplied) in County Roscommon who has no income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 7 June 1983 and was assessed with weekly means of £23.60 derived from the maintenance portion of a student grant and from the value of board and lodgings in her parents' home.  She asked for a <Col N="726" /> review of her means, and following further inquiries her weekly means were reduced to £4.35 from 7 June 1983 and to £2.30 from 28 September 1983, derived from the value of board and lodgings in her parents' home.  Unemployment assistance was authorised accordingly at £21.10, that is, £25.45 less the £4.35, from 7 June 1983, increased to £23.65 from 29 June 1983, and £25.70 from 28 September 1983.  All arrears due will be paid to her this week.  Further weekly payments of £25.70 will continue to be made when they become due.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the question refers to smallholders whose means for unemployment assistance were previously assessed on a notional basis but were reassessed on a factual basis arising from the provision in the Social Welfare Act, 1983.  The reassessment of means of smallholders under this provision commenced in May 1983 and the number whose unemployment assistance payments ceased following factual assessment between May 1983 and December 1983 was 101 in the case of Listowel employment exchange and 105 in the case of Tralee employment exchange.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>To be entitled to unemployment benefit a person must be unemployed and, generally speaking, where any work is done there is no entitlement to benefit.  An exception to this is that a person can be engaged in a subsidiary occupation and remain entitled to benefit. A subsidiary occupation is one which can ordinarily be followed in addition to the usual employment and outside the ordinary working hours of that employment. A person engaged in a subsidiary occupation can be entitled to unemployment benefit provided either the remuneration from that occupation does not exceed £2 a day, or he has not less than 78 contributions paid in respect of the previous three years.</P>
      <P>The principle of the limit on earnings from a subsidiary occupation is a sound one and the limit now in force is not unreasonable in present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>There are fundamental differences between the British invalidity pension scheme and the Irish scheme.  A person must be regarded as permanently incapable of work to qualify for Irish invalidity pension.  This does not apply in the case of a British pension.</P>
      <P>The overall cost of extending the allowances to British pensioners, including the extension of the associated free television licence scheme and the free telephone rental scheme, which would also be necessary, would be substantial.  There are no proposals for such an extension in present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State not accept that the difference between our invalidity scheme and that of the UK is technical?  One must be permanently incapable of work to receive our invalidity pension whereas that is not the case in the UK.  Surely the Minister would accept that anybody who is in receipt of a UK invalidity pension is incapable of work at that time and that the vast majority of them are permanently incapable of work?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">

      <P>One of the problems is that there are fundamental differences between the scheme operated by our Department of Social Welfare and that of the UK Social Security Department. To qualify for the Irish invalidity scheme the claimant must be regarded as permanently incapable of work.  In the UK, invalidity benefit is payable automatically to a person who has been receiving sickness benefit for 28 weeks, irrespective of whether the incapacity is likely to be short-term or permanent.  That is a major difficulty.</P>

      <P>If the UK invalidity pensioners were to receive the free electricity allowance they would automatically be qualified for free television licences under the provisions of that scheme.  It is reckoned that there are about 30,000 UK invalidity pensioners living in this country. Based on the average annual value of existing allowances, the cost of the estension would be: for free telephone rental allowance, £357,000, for free electricity allowance £357,000 and for free television licences, £102,000, giving a total of approximately £800,000.</P>

He was paid in error as a short-time recipient at the weekly rate of £18.00 from the commencement of his claim, but this matter has been adjusted and arrears due have been paid. The means of the person concerned were assessed from the value of board and lodgings in his mother's holding.  It is understood his mother died recently and the case has been referred to a social welfare officer for a reinvestigation of means.  When the inquiries in the case are completed means will be reassessed and the rate of unemployment assistance payable will be reviewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum means limit for entitlement to unemployment asistance is the maximum rate of assistance applicable to a particular applicant taking account of his family circumstances. The rate of asistance payable is the difference between the limit in a particular case and the means assessed against an applicant.</P>

    <P>The entitlement limits will be increased automatically from July next, when the increase in rates announced in the budget come into effect.  Smallholders whose means are assessed on a factual basis will benefit from the increased limits in the same way as other applicants for unemployment assistance.  Those smallholders <Col N="731" /> who have been receiving unemployment asistance on a long-term basis will also benefit from the higher rates of increase being paid to the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The notional method of assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes has been discontinued and no increase will be made in the rates of assistance being paid to those remaining smallholders whose entitlement is based on the notional system.  The means of those smallholders are at present being investigated and as they become entitled to unemployment assistance on a factual assessment of their means, they will benefit from the general increases provided in the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department have never entered into agreements with non-medical persons over whom they have no sanction in the matter of certification. About 15 years ago the then medical adviser in the Department agreed to accept certificates from a bonesetter and over the years the practice evolved of accepting certificates from a number of others.  For some years past a considerable number of claims, estimated to be 400 or 500 a year, were based on the certification of one of these bonesetters but there never has been an agreement entered into with any non-medical people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point in the whole exercise is that the patient gets paid.  It is extremely difficult to draw up guidelines for acceptance of certificates from non-medical practitioners.  There is a whole new range of non-medical practitioners, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, not alone in bonesetting but in all other types of medical activities. That is one of the reasons which prompted a review of the situation some months ago.  A number of requests came in from additional people who claimed to have some healing and remedial powers. It became extremely difficult to draw the <Col N="736" /> line as to who should and who should not be recognised.  A decision was taken to accept only the purely medical certifiers and this resulted in understandable hardship in a number of cases, particularly for the long established bonesetters and their patients.  This has been rectified for the time being.  If there is to be a change I assure the House that it will be notified to all the people concerned in ample time so that they will know exactly what their position is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the decision should have been notified at the time but so far as it has been possible to remedy that situation it has now been remedied. I understand that the claimants for disability benefit, whose payment was delayed, have since been paid.  If there are still any outstanding cases who have not been paid in respect of this kind of certificate and they are brought to the notice of the Department they will be attended to.</P>

The figures quoted by the Deputy appear in the Department's report but it transpired that in the case of one local authority the number of meals to be provided in 1981 was considerably overestimated.  The total actual number of meals provided in 1981 was 59,741 daily.  The average daily number receiving meals in 1983 was about 63,500.</P>

      <P>That is an extraordinary answer.  There is a difference of over 20,000 between the figure estimated by the local authority and the actual figure.

      <P>The figures quoted by the Deputy are those referred to in the departmental report in relation to the urban scheme for 1981-82.  These figures are based on the schemes submitted by the local authorities prior to the commencement of each year's scheme requesting the Minister's approval for them.  Local authorities are required to furnish to the Department the estimated daily numbers who will receive meals in a given calendar year.  These are the only numbers of recipients which are supplied. Dublin Corporation, who accounted for 80 per cent of the scheme, submitted details of their scheme for 1981 on 10 December 1980 and estimated the number as 65,000.  They now state that the figure supplied was in respect of the average number of children in attendance at schools which operated the meals scheme in the corporation area in 1981. Not all the pupils received meals.  It is now estimated that only 44,000 children received meals in the Dublin area in 1981. The higher figure of 65,000 recorded in the statistics and payments ledger was supplied for the departmental report 1981-82.  As a result of the revision, the average number of pupils who received meals in the country as a whole for 1981 was 59,741, a decrease of 21,000 on the 80,443 shown in the report.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is becoming curiouser and curioser.  Can he explain how an estimated figure given by Dublin Corporation in 1980 for 1981 was not found to be inaccurate until the end of 1983?  Surely by the end of 1981 Dublin Corporation must have advised the Department that their figure was wrong.  The estimated figure for 1980 was 21,000 more than the actual figure for 1981.  When was the Department informed of the corporation's inaccurate figure?</P>

      <P>In 1979 an interdepartmental working group in a review of the school meals scheme considered, <i>inter alia,</i> the adequacy of the content of the meals.  In considering this question, the group pointed out that it was only intended as a means of restoring children's energy at a time when it was inclined to flag.  It was never intended to take the place of meals provided at home. The group drew attention to the lack of current data regarding the nutritional state of the children.  A survey carried out by the Medical Research Council concluded that the proportion of all children examined who were in a poor nutritional state was less than 2½ per cent.  It can reasonably be assumed that the situation is now better.  There are indications that the towns dropping out of the scheme are doing so because of lack of demand in their area.  The school meals scheme was formerly under the general control of the Minister for Local Government and was transferred to the Department of Social Welfare in 1947.</P>

      <P>The report referred to in the Deputy's question covers not alone the year 1981 but also 1982.  Preparation of the report commenced, therefore, early in 1983 and arrangements for printing <Col N="740" /> were made with the Stationery Office in accordance with normal procedure. Material for printing was supplied in May 1983 but final production of the report took longer than normal because of difficulty in establishing some figures and because of an industrial dispute which delayed the despatch of printing paper for the report from the Stationery Office to the printers.  The report finally became available at the beginning of February 1984.</P>
      <P>Figures for the number of persons in receipt of supplementary welfare allowances are provided in table 35 of the report.  The figures are, however, estimated because final figures were not available from some health boards at the time of printing and, in the case of one health board, because some records were destroyed by fire.</P>

He also failed to explain why figures were prepared up to May 1983 and why there was a long delay in printing. Could the figures not have been updated by the time printing took place at the end of 1983 to ensure that at least figures for 1981 were accurate and complete?

That applies to the reports from 1979 and 1980 and 1981 and 1982.  The two-year report is, therefore, an improvement on what had been the case for a number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated in the statement I made to the Dáil on 8 February the Government's concern about the deterioration in the situation in Lebanon and in particular in Beirut in recent weeks. Since that statement and the withdrawal of the bulk of the multinational force, the situation in the city has not improved and no progress has been made in the direction of national reconciliation in Lebanon.</P>
      <P>Lebanon was discussed at a Ministerial meeting of the Ten in Paris yesterday after which an agreed statement was made by the Presidency.  Copies of the statement will be made available in the Dáil Library.  The statement emphasises the Ten's concern at recent developments in Lebanon and appeals to all parties to agree on a durable and effective cease-fire. It urges the international community to fulfil its responsibilities for the maintenance of peace in particular by establishing in Beirut, with the agreement of the parties concerned, a United Nations force which would take up positions on the departure of the multinational force on the basis of a mandate to be decided on by the Security Council.</P>
      <P>The Government believe that a UN presence in Beirut could have a useful role to play.  But the precise mandate for such a force is a matter for the UN Security Council.</P>
    </Speaker>

This is a resolution going before the Security Council of which we are not a member.

Would he indicate whether a meeting of that committee was held recently and, if not, would he consider it advisable that a meeting should be held at an early date to consider the position in the best interests of the forces of the countries at present participating in UNIFIL?  Could I further ask him if he will insist that, before any decision is taken by the Security Council with regard to further UN participation in Lebanon, and in view of the important repercussions it will have on the position of the existing forces there, our views are fully taken into account by the Secretary General and the Security Council?</P>

      <P>In answer to the first part of the Deputy's question, no actual formal committee was established.  The members of the contributing countries came together informally and, while that process was not a meeting of the members, it has been continuing.  When I was in New York last year I asked the other <Col N="747" /> contributing countries to send representatives to meet me and we had a very useful discussion at that stage.  We have a very direct interest in what is happening with regard to the UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.  Any decision as to what we might do in a particular set of circumstances would have to wait until we saw the precise mandate the Security Council decided on.

      <P>I am a little disconcerted to find that, through our permanent representative there or otherwise, we are not participating in or at least being consulted about these discussions which are going on at present.  Could I ask the Minister to keep two things in mind?  The first is the predominant importance of the safety and security of our troops who are in the Lebanon and the other forces who are joined with them in pursuing our mandate there.  Will he also bear in mind, now that this ill-conceived and disastrous multinational force has turned out to be the failure most of us knew it would be, the importance of the type of mandate which the United Nations force should have?  Because it has had a particular type of mandate to which it has adhered faithfully, the present UN force in Lebanon has built up the trust and confidence of the people of the area in which it is based. That type of mandate should form the basis for any further extension of UN participation in Lebanon.  In other words, I am asking the Minister to differentiate clearly between the type of peace-keeping mandate which UNIFIL in Lebanon <Col N="748" /> now has and the peace-enforcement mandate which the disastrous multinational force apparently had.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not be disconcerted, because in reply to his first supplementary I said we are not a member of the United Nations Security Council.  Of course we make known our views to the members of the council and we expect them to bear our views in mind in their discussions.  We have no direct say in what the United Nations Security Council does at the moment.  With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, that is a point which I made a number of times in the past week or ten days. We distinguish very clearly between peace-keeping and peace-enforcing.  I do not want to pre-empt any decision the Government may arrive at but, before we would agree to participate in another force we would have to have a very precise and clear mandate as to what the force are expected to do.  Following on that, before we could agree to send a further contingent or operate under a different mandate, that matter would have to come before this House and be discussed here and every Deputy would have a chance at that stage to make his contribution.</P>

      <P>I was informed by Avair on the afternoon of Thursday, 23 February 1984 that the financial circumstances of the company were such that, without a commitment from the Government to provide Exchequer assistance of about £400,000 over a very short timescale, the airline would have to cease trading almost immediately.  I was further advised that Avair's bankers had been informed of the financial crisis and that it was Aviar's intention to notify their staff of the position and to hold a press conference announcing a cessation of services within a matter of two hours. Avair also made it clear that, in addition to financial aid, they would require me as Minister to grant them additional traffic rights to make their operation viable. After careful consideration of the position within the limited time that was available to me, I advised Avair that I was unable to provide them with the financial assistance required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of my policy in regard <Col N="751" /> to the development of air services by Irish independent carriers, I have made my position clear both inside the House and elsewhere on a number of occasions.  In March of last year, and within a short period of taking up office as Minister, I broke with long-established precedent and authorised private Irish carriers, including Avair, to provide services to mainland Britain.  I might add that this policy initiative was taken despite strong opposition from Aer Lingus and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Despite the difficulties which Avair have encountered, my policy initiative was taken in the best interests of developing civil aviation within Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the cessation of services by Avair has implications in terms of both internal operations and services to mainland Britain.  The position at the moment is that a receiver has been appointed to Avair and, while I am keeping in close contact with the situation, I do not wish to do or say anything that might pre-empt his scope for action.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would wish to state that I fully appreciate the difficulties involved in successfully mounting international scheduled air services and it is a matter of great regret to me that the efforts which Avair have made to build up a highly professional airline are now in jeopardy.  At the same time, I must state that many of the statements made by the managing director of Avair do not accord with the facts and do no justice to the exceptionally favourable treatment which I, as Minister, have given to that airline and other private airlines since I came into office.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that his refusal to grant licences to Avair to fly into certain areas and to provide certain services both internally and externally contributed to a great degree to the demise of this company?  Will he also put on the record of the House that he brought this matter before the Government before he took the stand he took?</P>

On the applications which were presented to Deputy Wilson six months before he left office I decided in a matter of ten to 12 weeks.  There was no discussion on this matter at Government level before the matter was brought to my attention.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The only international route for which Avair applied and did not get was Dublin-Leeds-Bradford.  In March of last year I granted them the Dublin-East Midlands route, the Dublin-Blackpool route and the Cork-Jersey route.  In September of last year they applied for the Cork-Isle of Man route and a decision in their favour was made by me at the beginning of this year. In November of last year they applied for two other routes, Cork-Manchester and Cork-Birmingham, on which a decision was imminent.  This is in contrast to the delays which Avair endured during the time Deputy Flynn's party were in Government.  I should also say that last March, within three months of coming to office, I granted also extensive rights to Aer Arann Teo.  within Ireland and between Ireland and the UK.  Earlier this year I granted a freight service route to Shannon Executive Aviation Ltd.  The House should welcome this new initiative in aviation policy to open up aviation to independent carriers because I believe that it is in the interests not only of the country but also of the consumer and even of Aer Lingus.</P>

Before pulling the rug from under this essential internal and external service, did he consider providing them with a small subsidy to keep them in flight and would he consider, in view of the 80 jobs of which he has now brought about the termination and which normally would cost in the region of £800,000 to create, that it is worth while reviewing the situation and allowing Avair to continue the services they have built up?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flynn is correct that during the term of office of the Fianna Fáil Government developments in internal air services took place and credit should be given for that.  It should also be said that Avair only approached this subject with the Department throughout its developnment as an internal service and never was the question of external services raised at any stage until July 1982 when Deputy Wilson was Minister. A decision was not taken on that until I became Minister at the end of that year.</P>
      <P>In relation to services vacated by Avair I have been making contingency plans but it would be improper of me or my Department to develop on those plans or announce them until such time as the receiver's intentions are clear.  It would be very wrong of me to pre-empt his actions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the adjournment of the debate, I had been outlining the general case for increasing fines for road traffic offences, this being the main purpose of the Bill. But, as the Minister emphasised in his opening speech and as a number of Deputies have also pointed out, the apparatus of traffic law enforcement and penalties is only one element, although a necessary one, in securing the safe and efficient use of our roads.  The regime of penalties now being updated must be accompanied by a range of positive measures to provide better or alternative facilities for motorists and to promote good road behaviour voluntarily from the public at large.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure Deputies that the Bill's concentration on penal measures is not preventing the ongoing development on many other fronts of measures to improve roads and traffic systems.  A total of £123.5 million is being provided in State road grants this year compared with £117.5 million in 1984.  Of this, some £98 million is directed towards enlarging and improving the capacity of our road system as well as eliminating accident black spots and the balance of £25.5 million is being applied to road maintenance.</P>
      <P>Deputies Fitzsimons and David Andrews argued that common sense and courtesy should prevail in the administration of road traffic law.  I fully support this view.  The Bill provides a framework for enforcement, but I am sure that all concerned with implementing it will continue to respect the ultimate purpose of road traffic law, which is to promote voluntary observance of the rules of the road by all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several suggestions have been made for improving present road traffic legislation beyond the simple updating of penalties with which the Bill is concerned.  In general it must be said that the framework <Col N="826" /> of controls provided by the major Road Traffic Acts, those of 1961 and 1968, has proved a very adequate and comprehensive one.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, a number of constructive suggestions have been made on matters which would require amendment of the Road Traffic Acts and these are certainly entitled to closer examination.  I explained to the House earlier and the Minister did in his Second Reading speech that we have in mind several legislative improvements which I hope to bring before the House in a further Road Traffic Bill later this year.  I will have full regard to the debate which has just taken place in preparing this second Bill.  In the meantime, however, my general view is that the contents of the present Bill are suitably self-contained and urgent.  I would not wish the Bill to be delayed by consideration of proposals which might require further detailed examination at this stage.</P>
    <P>One matter referred to by several Deputies was the introduction of mandatory display of insurance discs on vehicles. The Government have already put on record their commitment to this in their statement of October 1983 on the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Report.  Consultation with the insurance companies must be completed however before the new system can be put into operation.  I would hope to be able to include an enabling legislative provision in the Road Traffic Bill to be introduced later this year.</P>
    <P>Deputies addressed themselves both to the specific content of the Bill, the revision of penalties, and to a variety of wider issues affecting road traffic, motor insurance and road safety.  A concern expressed by a number of Deputies was that the increases proposed by the Bill in the maximum fine under the general penalty might be excessive in relation to certain relatively minor offences, such as illegal parking.  I would like to stress first of all that the amounts of £150 for a first offence or £350 for certain second and subsequent offences are maxima only. They represent the upper limits within which the District Courts will have to <Col N="827" /> work in dealing with the vast range of road traffic offences, nearly 500,000 in 1982 coming before them each year. What we are fixing here is the framework for enforcement rather than the fines which are actually going to be applied in particular cases.</P>
    <P>That said, there are a number of good reasons in favour of the increases being proposed in the general penalty limits. They are still less than what would be strictly justified to restore 1961 money values to those of 1984.  They are needed to allow the amounts prescribed for on-the-spot penalties to be fixed at more realistic levels; at present the maximum general penalty of £20 means that on-the-spot fines, normally £5, have to be set at a level insufficient to deter drivers from inconsiderate parking.  We see that all over the city.  Some drivers take a chance and run the risk of having to pay a fine of £5.  If this fine were fixed at a much higher figure, they would think twice about illegal parking.  It is hoped that the present Bill will stand for some time.  It is only sensible therefore to set new maximum limits at a level which will maintain a reasonable deterrent for some years to come.</P>
    <P>In this last connection, Deputy Molony made the suggestion that the amounts of fines in legislation generally should be automatically index-linked to rising prices.  No doubt the Attorney General will look at this suggestion but I am not sure that Deputies generally would welcome it.  The present debate has elicited a number of genuinely held differences among Members of the House as to the appropriate level of increase for certain penalties, and not all Deputies may be disposed to waive their right of comment on those matters in favour of an automatic mechanism.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have urged the case for a more extensive use of mandatory minimum penalties in dealing with road traffic offences.  I might mention, that in so far as people choose to avail of it, the system of so-called on-the-spot fines represents a fixed payment in respect of certain road traffic offences, and I will be reviewing the scope of this system following <Col N="828" /> the enactment of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>But on the substantive question of mandatory minimum fines, the Minister touched on the difficulties involved in the course of his Second Reading speech.  In 1982, road traffic offences represented 74 per cent of all prosecutions brought to the District Courts and by their number and diversity present a wide variety of different circumstances.  The administration of justice is the constitutional prerogative of the courts and applying minimun penalties across a wide or numerous range of offences would not seem consistent with this principle.</P>
    <P>Mandatory or, as they are legally known, consequential disqualifications from driving are a different matter.  The courts have held that the holding of a driving licence is a privilege rather than a right and that disqualification from driving is not therefore in the strict legal sense a penalty.  Mandatory disqualification from driving applies across a considerable range of serious road traffic offences; most drunk driving offences attract it upon first conviction as does dangerous driving resulting in death or serious bodily harm to another person. Uninsured driving, driving a dangerously defective vehicle, and a number of other offences involve mandatory disqualification upon a second or subsequent conviction for that offence within three years. In addition, it may not perhaps be widely appreciated that the courts have discretion at all times to impose a disqualification from driving in relation to any offence which involves a mechanically propelled vehicle or the driving of such a vehicle.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Doyle mentioned the possibility of a points system of disqualification from driving such as operates in the United Kingdom.  A computerised system of driver licensing is a necessary pre-condition for this kind of system and I now have such computerisation under consideration.  It would be clearly premature, then, to speculate just yet on the feasibility of a points system here.</P>
    <P>Finally on the question of penalties, some confusion has arisen both in this debate and in the public comment on the Bill regarding the relevance of on-the-spot <Col N="829" /> parking notices to the determination of whether a first or subsequent traffic offence is involved.  If a person pays the so-called fine on-the-spot, there is no prosecution and therefore no court proceedings. Should the person be brought before the court on some other parking offence, any offence in respect of which a fine on-the-spot had been duly paid would not come into the reckoning in determining whether a first or subsequent offence was involved.</P>
    <P>Deputies commented widely on matters connected with, but not arising directly from, the present Bill.  Both Deputy Gay Mitchell and Deputy Briscoe suggested the establishment of special traffic courts and Deputy David Andrews argued for a special traffic corps within the Garda Síochána.  Responsibility for both the administration of the courts and the organisation of the Garda rests with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, and I will bring these and all other relevant points arising from this debate to his attention.  As I understand it, however, two special traffic courts &mdash; one for parking and one for non-parking offences &mdash; already exist for Dublin city, where a great number of offences take place, and a traffic corps does exist within the Garda organisation.  Indeed, despite the obvious and unfortunate demands being placed on Garda resources by serious crime, Garda involvement in the road traffic area is still considerable, with an estimated 25 per cent of all Garda time being devoted at present to road traffic enforcement.</P>
    <P>Deputies had many valid points to make about the general road safety position in this country and about particular measures which might be developed to improve it.  Deputy Molony quoted extensively from the Motor Insurance Report of December 1982, action on many of those recommendations is now being prepared by the Ministers concerned. Deputy David Andrews called for a special inquiry into the causes of road accidents, whether by way of a commission or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I fully share Deputies' concern in this vital matter.  However, without wishing to relent in the slightest from the on-going <Col N="830" /> road safety effort, I feel that certain general facts should be placed before the House to balance some of the more extreme indictments of Irish motoring which have been made.  The rate of fatal and serious injury accidents in Ireland is now below what, based on an objective internationally accepted statistical formula, one might expect from our present degree of motorisation.  In terms of road deaths per vehicle kilometres travelled, our record is bettered at the moment only by two countries within the EEC, the United Kingdom and Denmark.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molony, and the recent motor insurance report from which he drew, rightly identify better road behaviour and a decreased rate of accidents as an important means of abating motor insurance costs.  Unfortunately, the road accident rate is not the sole determinant of these insurance costs.  Indeed, a question which remains to be answered, notwithstanding the valuable analysis of the motor insurance report, is why with the rate of fatal and serious injury road accidents per registered vehicle having virtually halved over the past 12 years, motor insurance costs have continued to escalate.</P>
    <P>I fully respect the intention and concern reflected in Deputy David Andrews's suggestion for a comprehensive inquiry into the causes of road accidents.  However, through the on-going work of An Foras Forbartha, in particular, as well as of other agencies, the general patterns of accident casualty and location in this country are already well understood.  The real priority is to implement effective road accident counter-measures all over the country.  In this connection, detailed investigations of high-accident locations, such as the on-going work conducted by An Foras on rural sections of national roads and the excellent study recently completed by them for Dundalk, may be of more practical benefit than the kind of formal and generalised inquiry which Deputy David Andrews seems to be advocating.</P>
    <P>I fully endorse the support for the campaign of arm band wearing by pedestrians expressed by Deputies Enright and Noel Treacy.  The year 1982 saw a remarkable reduction of 65 in the number of adult <Col N="831" /> pedestrians killed in road accidents and shows the enormous potential of measures aimed at precautionary behaviour on the part of pedestrians.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molony raised the possibility of reinstating, by means of a suitable amendment, section 57 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 which the High Court found repugnant to the Constitution in 1977.  I am advised that the simple grounds of the High Court judgment &mdash; that the section exceeded the local and limited jurisdiction of the lower courts &mdash; make it impractical to think of reinstating it.</P>
    <P>Deputies Taylor, L. T. Cosgrave and David Andrews all mentioned the role of public transport.  As the Minister responsible for roads and traffic administration, I do not see the needs of roads and of public transport as being in conflict with one another.</P>
    <P>Rail has been meeting a diminishing proportion of transport needs in most countries.  This is so to a marked degree in Ireland where it now carries 4 per cent only of inland passenger and 10 per cent of freight traffic.  However, road needs are so far from being adequately served by our present system that whatever contribution rail still can make must be more than welcomed.</P>
    <P>But public transport itself is now using roads predominantly in its passenger operations and, in general, stands to benefit from the systematic programme of road improvements being developed on our national and major urban routes. Traffic management measures can also as a matter of policy be developed in support of public transport.  Bus priority measures are being implemented to good effect in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Deputies L. T. Cosgrave and David Andrews raised a matter not strictly comprehended by the road traffic code in their calls for a motor tax office for South Dublin and, if possible, for Dún Laoghaire.  I have previously made it clear that the establishment of a further motor tax office is being studied by Dublin Corporation as a matter of urgency.  I will keep the House in touch with any such developments. <Col N="832" /> Finally, Deputy David Andrews asked me to comment specifically on suggestions he made for improving the flow of traffic on commuter routes at peak times, known in traffic engineering terms as the tidal flow concept, this would involve using, say, a third lane of a four lane road for the benefit of town-bound traffic during the morning peak time and reversing it to the normal direction thereafter. This kind of tidal flow adjustment has indeed been used satisfactorily abroad as a traffic management measure.  Unfortunately, it requires roadways either without junctions or with junctions different in level to the main carriageway.</P>
    <P>The source of congestion on the Blackrock to town route mentioned by Deputy David Andrews is at its junctions.  Tidal flow could not cope with these since the removal of right-turn lanes, islands and traffic signals ahead signs would be required each time the third lane flow was to be changed.</P>
    <P>This has been a wide and detailed debate.  I have been able to respond to it generally and selectively.  I would like to assure Deputies, however, that I will be looking more closely at all of their suggestions, particularly with the prospect of the further Road Traffic Bill which we hope to introduce later this year.  In the meantime, the present Bill will provide a strengthened framework to which the Garda, traffic wardens and the courts are entitled, for enforcing existing road traffic law.  I thank Deputies for their constructive contributions and suggestions.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes which was signed by us in June 1978.  The convention has already been ratified by all other member states of the European Community with the exception of Italy and Greece.  The convention was approved on behalf of the Community in 1978 although the Community has not yet become a party to it.</P>
      <P>The convention contains 18 articles of which Articles 1 to 7 deal with general principles, and Articles 8 to 13 with detailed implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general principles, which cover housing, feeding, watering and care, set out the requirements necessary to safeguard the welfare of animals kept for farming purposes, in particular those kept in modern intensive stock-farming systems.  Article 1 defines &ldquo;animals&rdquo; as animals bred or kept for the production of food, wool, skin or fur or for other farming purposes and &ldquo;modern intensive stock-farming systems&rdquo; as systems which predominantly employ technical installations operated principally by means of automatic processes.  Article 2 imposes an obligation on the contracting parties to give effect to the principles in the convention. Article 3 requires that animals be housed and provided with food, water and care appropriate to their needs. Article 4 requires that the animals have freedom of movement and Article 5 requires that the animals are kept in physical conditions appropriate to their needs.  Food and liquid may not be provided <Col N="834" /> so as to cause unnecessary suffering according to Article 6.  Article 7 contains the convention's main specific provision, that is that animals and technical equipment used in modern intensive stock-farming systems should be thoroughly inspected at least once a day.</P>
    <P>The detailed implementing provisions of the convention provide for the establishment of a standing committee representative of the contracting parties.  The standing committee shall be responsible for the elaboration and adoption of recommendations to the contracting parties in conformity with the general principles of the convention and based on scientific knowledge concerning the various species. These recommendations shall become effective six months after their adoption by the standing committee.  As from that date each contracting party shall either implement them or indicate why it cannot do so.  The standing committee are empowered to act in order to facilitate the friendly settlement of any difficulty arising between contracting parties out of the execution of the convention. At the request of a contracting party they are authorised to give an advisory opinion on any question concerning the protection of animals.  Each contracting party may appoint advisory bodies to facilitate the work of the standing committee.</P>
    <P>By our signature of the convention we gave consent to the principles enshrined in it.  Since then there has been an increasing realisation of the importance of animal welfare.  Indeed, I think that this is a very worthwhile development.  We, in Ireland, must not lag behind in our concept of the necessity for animal welfare and this Bill will enable us to keep step with our partners in Europe.  Even from an economic point of view, animal welfare is very desirable.  I hardly have to say that animals which are well cared for thrive and give better production returns.</P>
    <P>Our existing national law relating to the protection of animals is contained in a number of enactments including the Cruelty to Animals Act, going back as far as 1876, the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1935, the Dogs (Protection <Col N="835" /> of Livestock) Act, 1960 and the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.  None of this law enables me to legislate by order for the promotion of animal welfare or in particular for the requirements of the convention.</P>
    <P>You will note that the main purpose of the convention and, indeed, of the Bill is to look after the welfare of animals in intensive units.  There has been over the years a lot of criticism and comment on these units but they are nowadays a fact of life, particularly as regards hen and pig rearing and poultry generally.  The convention, as I have mentioned, required that animals kept in these units must be inspected at least once a day and appropriate steps taken to ensure that the animals are not caused any unnecessary suffering. Similarly, the equipment used in the unit must be examined and repaired if any defects are discovered.  I think it will be accepted that this is at least some progress towards looking after the welfare of these animals and it ties in with good husbandry.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us today brings those terms of the convention into effect here and I am sure that animal lovers will welcome it as well as those farmers who think about animal welfare as well as the economics of raising animals.  In the case of animals not kept in &ldquo;intensive units&rdquo;, their inspection will be necessary at intervals sufficient to avoid their being caused unnecessary suffering.  The Act will require simple records of these inspections to be kept.</P>
    <P>A person will also be prohibited from feeding to an animal or causing to be fed to an animal to which the Act applies, any food or liquid in a manner or of a kind which may cause it injury or suffering.</P>
    <P>The Bill also gives the Minister power to make regulations in relation to the care and welfare of animals, particularly as regards providing a proper supply of food and water, adequate space and legislating for the construction and layout of housing for animals covered by the Act to ensure that there are proper facilities by way of lighting, ventilation, drainage and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be able to appoint <Col N="836" /> veterinary surgeons to be inspectors for the purpose of this Act and they will have powers to enter premises or land, to inspect, examine or test animals, food or liquid and equipment, as well as to take samples from animals, food or liquid and examine, test or analyse any sample so taken.  They will also have power to inspect records.  Officers of my Department who are not veterinary surgeons may also be given such of the inspectors' powers as I specify, while a member of the Garda Síochána shall have all the powers of an inspector other than the power to examine, test or take samples from animals.</P>
    <P>There are safeguard clauses contained in the Bill to give farmers a defence in certain cases.  In order to remove any doubts, certificates relating to examinations, tests, analyses purporting to be signed by the State chemist <i>et cetera</i> will be accepted as such by the courts unless the contrary is shown.</P>
    <P>This Bill, therefore, is a relatively simple but very important one as it marks a stride forward on the road to improved farm animal welfare, an area which, I fear, has probably been neglected in the past but which I feel certain will become more prominent in the future.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House and am confident that it will secure the approval of all Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> As the Minister of State said, the main purpose of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes which was signed by us in June 1978.  Apart from that purpose one would question the need for such a Bill because many of the items contained in it are part and parcel of good farming. We have certain reservations with regard to certain sections and subsections of the Bill and we shall deal with this on Committee Stage when we will have an opportunity to table some amendments.  I suggest that it might be appropriate to refer this Bill to a special committee of the House to ensure that matters of agricultural and farming interest may be considered. <Col N="837" /> This Bill might be considered to cast a slight on the capacity of farmers to do their job.  One might also question the necessity of having the regulations prescribed by statute apart from the necessity of conforming with the Convention. I agree that in certain cases there is cruelty to animals but this is rare.  In most modern farming operations and in the intensive farming units safeguards with regard to size, ventilation and the provision of food and water are provided.  In this connection one questions the advisability of having this Bill and we hope to table quite a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  A number of sections could be considered hostile and not in the interests of the farming community and of good farming husbandry.  In addition, there is not adequate protection for farmers and this must be considered.  There are strong powers under certain sections with regard to entry onto farms by officials of the Department of Agriculture, by members of the veterinary profession and, in certain instances, by the Garda Síochána.  It may be possible to amend this on Committee Stage and it is something we shall consider.</P>
      <P>The provisions of certain sections, in particular section 3, are far-reaching.  The Minister may by regulation make such provision with regard to the care and welfare of animals as he thinks fit.  I hope the regulations will be made in consultation with the relevant farming organisations. Have consultations been held with them or will consultations be held before the Bill goes through the House?</P>
      <P>The provision in relation to the supply of food and water for animals is far-fetched. Surely all farmers know about this and will ensure that they will have proper supplies of food and water?  There are other provisions for the care and welfare of animals such as section 3 (1) (b) which is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of ensuring that, having regard to their physiological and ethological needs, there is as regards such animals adequate space for their free movement or other needs, provisions specifying the housing <Col N="838" /> space to be provided in relation to them;</P>
    <P>Such matters also seem far-fetched for inclusion in legislation and we on this side are concerned about it.  However, this can be gone into more thoroughly on Committee Stage.  Section 4 provides for inspection of animals and equipment as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  The person who is the owner of or for the time being has under his control animals to which this Act applies shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) in case the animals are for the time being kept in an intensive unit, not less than once per day,</P>
    <P>(i)  thoroughly inspect the animals' condition and state of health or cause their condition and state of health to be so inspected,</P>
    <P>(ii)  for the purpose of ensuring that the automatic or other technical equipment used in the unit is free from defects either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  if he is competent so to do, thoroughly inspect such equipment, or</P>
    <P>(II)  cause such equipment to be thoroughly inspected by a competent person,</P>
    <P>All these things have to be done by farmers, as if farmers have not enough work to do already in the matter of keeping records.  These records must be kept for two months and I suggest that this is going too far, that there is no need to have such detailed powers and regulations in the form of legislation.  Section 8 deals with powers of entry, inspection and so on.  Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) provide as follows:</P>
    <P>An inspector may at all reasonable times&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  for the purpose of exercising any of the other powers conferred on him by this section enter any premises or other land,</P>
    <P>(b)  inspect, examine or test&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  any animal which he reasonably <Col N="839" /> believes to be an animal to which this Act applies and which is found by him in or on any premises or other land so entered,</P>
    <P>(ii)  any food or liquid so found and which he so believes is used or is to be used to feed animals to which this Act applies,</P>
    <P>(iii)  any equipment so found,</P>
    <P>A garda will have the right of entry.  I hope the persons entering farms for the purpose of inspection and for the taking of samples will be properly qualified.  I suggest that the Garda Síochána are not trained and therefore have no qualifications to carry out inspections of animals and machinery.</P>
    <P>I question the need for this Bill at all because it only puts into legislative form practices farmers have been engaged in already.  Section 4 provides that there shall be inspection of animals and machinery for the purpose of ensuring that automatic or other technical equipment used in a unit will be free from defects.  The section is rather vague and I hope the Minister will give us details of what is involved.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should take another look at the need to keep records because this puts an extra obligation on farmers.  If such records are necessary they should be kept simple and should not be in such detailed form as is specified in the Bill at present.</P>
    <P>Entry into farms should be the function of veterinary surgeons and officials who are qualified rather than members of the Garda Síochána, particularly with regard to the taking of samples.  I hope that there will be an opportunity to bring in an amendment restricting entrance of the Garda on to any farm without prior notice to the farmer.</P>
    <P>One could also question the omissions from the Bill, one of which relates to the question of the transport of animals, where cruelty is being caused to them in transport to and from different farms and to the marts, but perhaps this is covered by other Acts.  The Minister might consider introducing such a section.  It is in <Col N="840" /> the interests of farmers to look into the problems outlined in this Bill, many of which have arisen because of lack of housing, in many cases through lack of finance because of the restriction of the grant system and the suspension last year by this Government of the farm modernisation scheme.  Adequate housing is a prerequisite to the implementation of this legislation.  We must have a farm modernisation scheme which is not too rigid and will give adequate grants for proper construction of housing.  At present many problems affect farmers.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, this Bill must conform to the Convention which we signed in June 1978, but he must ensure that it is implemented in as simple a manner as possible.  I ask him to indicate whether the inclusions in the Bill are necessary to conform to this Convention, or if they have been included by the officials in his Department.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to stray too far from the subject matter of the debate and I am sure the Chair will call me to order if I do so.  We have called for a long time for a proper farm modernisation scheme, with grants which will ensure proper housing of cattle during the winter months, thus saving them suffering.  Certain aspects can be adequately covered by the legislation, but in other aspects cattle can be suffering.  I hope that the Minister will consider my suggestion that the Bill be referred to a special committee of the House, so that it can be considered in detail by people from both sides of the House with a knowledge of agriculture.</P>
    <P>This legislation does not refer only to cattle but to all farm animals.  We must remember the crucially important role of the cattle industry in our economy and this legislation must be simplified to ensure that the already over-burdened farming community will not be further burdened.  I ask the Minister to consult with the farming organisations to ensure that the Bill is acceptable to all interests and, most importantly, to the members of the farming community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this publication and congratulate the Minister and the Government on producing <Col N="841" /> it.  One always wonders why it takes so long to produce legislation in this House on any issue after we have become a signatory to a Council of Europe Convention. One could bring into this debate many other conventions to which we are signatories and with regard to which legislation has been awaited for many years and there is no sign of its emerging from the corridors of the parliamentary draftsmen. The Minister is to be congratulated on bringing forward this legislation to ratify the commitment given by this country to the Council of Europe in the context of animal rights and welfare and in the interests of good farming.  The Convention on the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes was signed by us in June 1978, which is noteworthy.  It has taken almost six years to produce the legislation required to change our signature into a ratification of the Convention.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Noonan appears somewhat confused as to whether or not he welcomes this legislation.</P>

I am delighted that this Bill is now before the House.  Deputy Noonan seems to suggest that we do not need it or that, if we do, we did not have to prepare in this way, that perhaps farmers lying in bed at night might have their knees knocking in anticipation of the local member of the Garda Síochána knocking at the front door at 3 o'clock in the morning to inspect the cattle.  He conjures up wonderful images but nothing which would bear any relation to reality.  Deputy Noonan then went on to criticise the Minister for not including animal welfare in another area.  I hope that nothing I am saying will be taken as a personal comment on Deputy Noonan.</P>

      <P>He engaged in what I would describe as the usual legislative balancing act performed by Members opposite in which they seek to appear to be all things to all men while in the end of the day not making it quite clear what they wish to appear to anybody.  There are a number of comments I would like to make about the Bill.  This is not a criticism of the Government, because they produced this Bill very rapidly in relation to the length of time they are in office.  The Bill is indicative of the slow response throughout the country to mechanisation and industrialisation in any area, but particularly in the agricultural area.  Intensive farming with the type of units we have that are now common all over the country has been with us for many years.  The Minister, quite properly, said that the main purpose of the Bill is to protect the animals kept in intensive units.  One wonders why this was not done some years ago.  I congratulate the Minister for now doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a simple Bill to deal with a simple issue, which is provided for within the terms of the Convention to which we are signatories.  I welcome the Bill in the context of protecting animal welfare and in the interests generally of the agricultural community.  I have no doubt that the vast majority of farmers will not lose ten minutes sleep any night over the provisions of this Bill.  The vast majority of <Col N="843" /> farmers engaged in good farming practice are complying with the provisions of this Bill.  It is as much in the interests of the farming community and agriculture generally that animals kept in intensive units throughout the country are properly cared for, properly fed and looked after, as it is in the interests of the animals themselves.  A well fed and well looked after animal at the end of the day will produce a far greater return for a farmer than will an animal which has been badly treated, as I am sure the Deputies opposite will remind me very rapidly.  I am surprised they have not done so yet.</P>

      <P>I wait with bated breath to hear what the Deputy will say on this very important Bill.  I have no doubt the Deputy has many interesting and original comments to make which, no doubt, will stimulate not merely the members of both parties in Government but will stimulate members of the press who await aghast to hear the riveting and original contributions which may come from Members opposite.  They have been waiting aghast for the last 14 months in anticipation since the Coalition Government were formed but we have not yet heard anything original or riveting from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with the specifics of this Bill and, to say that in a sense it brings our animal welfare legislation partially up to date in an area which has been ignored and which the Minister quite properly stated cannot be dealt with under existing legislation.  I believe the Bill deals with this matter in a sensible <Col N="844" /> way and in a way which is in conformity with the convention to which we are signatories. The Bill ensures that animal welfare legislation can cope with modern farming techniques which certainly were not envisaged at the time the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876 was passed or when some of the other legislation referred to by the Minister was passed.  It is noteworthy that it is a Coalition Government who are introducing this animal welfare legislation because the last legislation we had in this area, which is not an area which the House has been over-concerned with, was the Wildlife Act, 1976, a monumental Bill, which laid the foundation for our modern panoply of legislation for the protection of animals.  I have no doubt that all animal welfare organisations will be delighted to see this Bill enacted and that the vast majority of good farmers will also be delighted to see this Bill implemented.</P>
    <P>It is worth drawing attention to one or two areas which the Bill does not deal with.  I accept, in saying this, that these areas are not necessarily appropriate to this Bill, which has a single function, to enable us to ratify the Council of Europe Convention of 1978.  These matters are worth drawing the Minister's attention to because they indicate the type of split level political thinking or legislative schizophrenia we engage in when dealing with many issues, not just the issue of animals, in which we often willingly and enthusiastically legislate to provide protection in particular circumstances in relation to a particular area or particular problems but in which we tend to have a legislative blank spot in another complementary area in which the same problems exist and which need to be tackled.  I can see the Deputies opposite waiting in anticipation for me to reveal what I am referring to.</P>

      <P>Before I do so and, no doubt, upset them profoundly, I wish to refer to the definition section of the Bill, which is an extremely good one and which defines a number of phrases used <Col N="845" /> in the Bill, one of which is the concept of unnecessary suffering.  The main objective of the Bill is to protect animals against unnecessary suffering.  The Bill states with regard to unnecessary suffering:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;unnecessary suffering&rdquo; means in relation to an animal, pain, distress or suffering that in its kind or degree, or in its object, or in the circumstances in which it occurs, is unreasonable or unnecessary;</P>
      <P>As a general principle I imagine every Member of this House would be united in their view that in the context of animal legislation no animal should endure unnecessary suffering as defined in the Bill.  It is a perfectly acceptable general principle we would all agree with.  It is not a party political principle and it is not an ideological principle.  I would describe it as a principle of agreed social policy that would cut across the party political divide that we would all agree that no animal anywhere should suffer unnecessarily. The problem is to highlight the need to provide animals with protection against unnecessary suffering in the context of intensive farm units.  We still have not been willing to tackle other areas in the context of animal legislation and legislation which seeks to protect animal welfare and to tackle other areas in which unnecessary suffering is caused to animals and in which unnecessary suffering is very much part and parcel of the activity in which it occurs.  I am referring to a matter I raised in this House some months ago: the whole area of hare coursing. There can be no doubt in the public mind that in the pursuit of live hare coursing as it operates at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the context of this legislation it is fair to ask: if it is not permissible, as I believe it must not be, to permit unnecessary suffering on the part of farm animals in the area of agriculture and in the use of intensive units, is it permissible to promote unnecessary suffering for hares in live hare coursing?  I am quite convinced that there is overwhelming public support for the abolition of hare coursing.  I have no doubt, from a great deal of correspondence I have received, that there is a great deal of public support for its abolition.  In fairness to the agricultural community and to farmers, in the context of this Bill probably a great deal more suffering is being caused by the activity of hare coursing than is caused &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will conclude my passing reference to this matter.  I am raising it in all seriousness.  I am laughing because I find very amusing the anger this issue seems to create on the part of Members opposite who, I seem to recall, when I raised this by way of Dáil question verged on a state of hysteria and suggested in a sense that it was totally impudent for any Deputy to propose that our legislation in this area should be changed.  There is overwhelming support for the abolition of hare coursing.  I have no doubt hare coursing causes unnecessary suffering to animals as defined in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Rather than treating this issue as something which justifies roars and shouts and abuse from Members opposite, I would hope that they would look at this issue seriously and be willing to sponsor and support a Bill across party lines which would be uncontentious and would abolish hare coursing in a way which would be an example to many people outside the House of the concern of Deputies for animal welfare and their anxiety to ensure that unnecessary suffering is not caused to animals.</P>
      <P>We are the only country in the EEC to permit a sport of this nature to continue. We are now implementing this convention which we signed in the Council of Europe in 1978.  This is an example of our social policy commitment, our commitment to animal welfare and our comitment to a humane approach to dealing with animals.  Our continued failure to tackle the problem of hare coursing shows a very contradictory image.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am most anxious not to stray outside the confines of the Bill.  I want to come <Col N="848" /> back to another issue which I raised in the House and which I was delighted to see taken up by other Deputies and by a Deputy opposite from my own constituency in a very articulate way.  I am referring to drugs and animals, the use of hormones as growth stimulants in animals and the over use of antibiotics.  I am not suggesting that, as a general issue, this is directly relevant to the Bill, but it is indirectly relevant.  It is part of common farming practice to use automatically a form of hormone treatment as a stimulant to animal growth.  I would be interested to know from the Minister what research has been done in this area on the effects hormone stimulants have on the animals. A great deal of concern has been expressed about the possibility of hormone residue in meat consumed by human beings.</P>

I wait with interest to see what amendments he will propose.</P>
      <P>I conclude by appealing to Deputies opposite in a non-partisan, non-party political way in the context of animal welfare legislation and in the hope that this will be the first of a number of pieces of legislation to deal with anomalies in this area, to join with me and other Deputies on this side in promoting legislation to ban hare coursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the main purpose of the Bill which is, as the Minister said, to ratify the Council of Europe Convention for the protection of animals kept for farm purposes.  I want to raise a few questions to which I hope the Minister will reply.  This Bill contains much comment concerning the provision of water and food for animals.  The sections dealing with those matters state the obvious importance of food and water, but really we should be talking at this stage about the fact that the EEC may not continue to provide money for water schemes. That must concern all of us, particularly those in rural areas who depend on group water schemes.  The Minister should be talking about getting the EEC to continue to provide money for this rather than talking about the obvious importance of water for farm animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill states that animals should be inspected not less than once per day.  Deputy Noonan mentioned that such comments should be taken as a slight on the farming community.  What would other professions think if they were told, for instance in the case of gardeners to inspect their gardens once a day?  Deputy <Col N="851" /> Shatter is not here now.  If he was told that he would have to ring one of his clients once a day what would he think? The section makes a very obvious statement. Anyone interested in farming obviously will inspect his animals more than once a day.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with intensive units.  In reference to adequate space for animals and freedom of movement I ask the Minister to tell us if this refers to an increased floor area per animal in these intensive units.  I understood that when the Farm Modernisation Scheme, which was suspended in February of last year, was restored the Department were to put more emphasis on smaller buildings.  It would be important for all farmers to know, particularly if they were applying for a grant for cattle housing to enable them to get their cattle off the land in winter, that they would not be obliged to put up elaborate structures.  I ask the Minister to clarify exactly what floor area he is talking about for freedom of movement for the animals.  I hope that he is talking about more economical units for any farm buildings that will be erected in future.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the powers of entry and inspection.  Farmers have access to ACOT, to the farm development services and to their own surgeons.  Why are the Garda mentioned in section 8 (2) (b) which refers to a member of the Garda Síochána having the powers of entry and inspection?  I ask the Minister to clarify that.  The relationship that a farmer has with the staff of the Department is very important and it would be unfortunate if the restrictions mentioned in that section were to obtain.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that the Bill, which deals with the protection of animals, does not contain provision for the transport of animals.  Surely we are talking about their safety under transport.  We all should be concerned about various reports of disease occurring.  The lorry which would bring a diseased animal to a factory might be used the next day to bring animals to a mart.  I wonder why this matter is not included under this Bill.  I take it that all other countries in the EEC except Italy <Col N="852" /> and Greece have ratified the Convention. Perhaps the Minister will tell us how this matter is being dealt with in other countries.</P>
    <P>Various sections of this Bill seem to state very obvious facts and of course in that regard we all agree with them.  I would like the Minister to reply to the questions I have posed.  Perhaps I am reading the Bill incorrectly.  Section 6 seems to state that we are dealing with units which are becoming bigger and bigger in the farm building area.  Now that the Farm Modernisation Scheme has been restored I would like to know how that section is to be implemented.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to bring us into line with other countries which have ratified the Convention of the Council of Europe and we on this side of the House welcome that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>For fear there may be a doubt on the other side of the House I should like to reiterate the support of my party for the Bill.  I should like to comment on some of its provisions and, in particular, the speech made by the Minister today.  Having read the speech it is not hard to come to the conclusion that he did not compose it because it does not have the hallmark of a farmer on it.  I know the Minister well and I am aware that he is an excellent farmer.  For that reason I doubt if the speech he delivered contains his views.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>I hardly have to say that animals which are well cared for thrive and give better production returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not necessary to make that statement because all farmers are aware of that.  That is the only sentence that I, as a farmer, support. Later the Minister told the House that there has been over the years a lot of criticism and comment on intensive units but that nowadays they are a fact of life particularly as regards hen and pig rearing.  I am sure the Minister is aware that there are intensive cattle units and it is possible that they are the ones he referred to in his speech.  The trend now is for goodie goodies, such as the one who contributed here a short time ago, who know little about farming <Col N="853" /> or the care farmers give to their animals, to get cheap publicity on matters like this. We have had a degree of scare mongering recently that did not help farmers to any degree.  In fact, it has hurt farmers.  I am referring to milk production and what Deputy Shatter said a short time ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed the view in his speech that animal lovers will welcome the terms of the Bill and so also would those farmers who think about animal welfare as well as the economics of raising animals.  I come from a farming area and I am aware of the views of farmers.  All farmers are aware that the well-cared-for animals will produce more.  Farmers are not fools and they do not need reminding of such matters by the Minister.  On reading the script one would get the impression that farmers were criminals.  I reject that suggestion.  Farmers have always behaved in a reasonable fashion and looked after their animals well.</P>
    <P>The Minister, referring to the inspections, said he would be able to appoint veterinary surgeons to be inspectors for the purposes of the Bill.  That is reasonable enough, but he went on to say that they will have powers to enter premises or land to inspect, examine or test animals, food or liquid and equipment as well as to take samples from animals, food or liquid and examine, test or analyse any samples taken.  They will also have the power to inspect records.  That brings us to a dangerous zone.  I do not object to veterinary surgeons visiting farms to carry out inspections but there is an implication in that statement that farmers are blackguarding animals or keeping food that might harm such animals. Such an implication is bad for farming. I imagine that tomorrow's newspapers will give the impression that farmers are of a criminal nature.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the House that officers of his Department who are not veterinary surgeons may also be given the same powers as the inspectors.  That is dangerous.  I should like to ask the Minister if that makes sense to him, a farmer. Is he giving inspection power to unqualified people?  The Minister told us that there are safeguard clauses in the Bill to give farmers a defence in certain cases. <Col N="854" /> The person who wrote that should have his or her head examined.  That is a disgrace because it seems to indicate that farmers are criminals.  The principle behind the Bill is correct but the Minister in his speech moved far away from that. I am disappointed with his contribution and I hope he makes up for that lapse when concluding.  It is laughable to suggest that gardaí will have the power of inspection because we do not have sufficient members in the force to do the jobs they are supposed to do without getting them to harass farmers.</P>
    <P>The Bill should have dealt with the problem of the slaughtering of sheep by marauding dogs.  We are all aware that thousands of sheep are slaughtered annually by dogs from cities and towns. Some of those dogs come from areas of the city mentioned by Deputy Shatter.  If he paid more attention to the suffering of such sheep he would be doing more for his country than by chasing hares.  Will the Minister outline the suggestions put forward by the inter-departmental committee to deal with such marauding dogs? Is the Minister in a position to give the House details of the number of sheep slaughtered last year and the success, if any, his Department have had in curtailing the activities of marauding dogs?</P>
    <P>I am interested in the quality of silage fed to animals.  I agree that food fed to animals should be of the highest quality. We are all aware that the use of silage equipment has reduced since 1979 because of certain anomalies in our tax system.  The result is that this year the silage harvest may not be finished on time.  That will lead to a deterioration in the quality of silage.  Those with a knowledge of farming are aware that bad silage is worse than bad hay, may cause death and can, certainly, cause suffering.  What does the Minister intend to do in regard to that problem?  If farmers are not given an incentive to buy new machinery the quality of our silage later this year will be the worst ever.  Our farmers can be proud of the fact that they made great advances in providing quality silage but in order to continue to produce good quality silage they need good equipment and they do not have that now.</P>

The silage season lasts for 20 days and if one goes beyond that period the quality of silage lessens.  I am saying that it will go beyond 20 days this year because the machinery being used now is not fit to accommodate the silage crop within 20 days.  If the Minister is serious about this Bill, he will provide an incentive for the farmer to get the equipment which will accommodate the silage so that we will not be feeding cattle bad silage and causing suffering.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened in the Farm Modernisation Scheme will not help farmers under this Bill.  This point was mentioned by Deputy Kitt.  Cow herds walking on bad roads or wet land are liable to get what was commonly known as foul-of-foot and to avoid this farmers would have laid down farm roadways.  In the very recent past the Farm Modernisation Scheme was scrapped and re-introduced <Col N="856" /> without taking farm roadways into account.  Will the Minister include farm roadways in the reintroduced Farm Modernisation Scheme?</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Kitt who called for an incentive by way of farm grants for the provision of water.  Over the years a farmer with a river on his land was regarded as being very lucky, but unfortunately today our rivers and streams are being polluted, I have to admit on very rare occasions by the farmers themselves. Because these rivers are polluted every farmer should do his utmost to keep his animals away from them but the only way he can do this is to provide a clean water supply; but because of the high cost involved the farmer would need support from the Government.  It was very disappointing that no provision was made for this in the re-introduced Farm Modernisation Scheme either.  While this Bill will be welcomed by all and sundry, the Minister can hardly be regarded as being serious about it unless he makes provision for clean water and farm roadways under the Farm Modernisation Scheme.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to learn that provision was made for wintering animals.  This is the greatest area of suffering because animals are left out in the snow, wind and frost.  When there are heavy snowfalls the farmer has no access to the animals and this results in grave hardship and suffering for the animals.  The way to remedy this situation is to be able to winter all farm animals.  Under the Farm Modernisation Scheme there is provision for the housing of animals, but the figure of £23 million for that scheme this year as opposed to double that figure three years ago, demonstrates the Government's interest in wintering farm animals.</P>
    <P>To summarise, if the Minister is serious about this Bill, he will take the matters I have raised here very seriously.  If he does not re-introduce the items I mentioned under the Farm Modernisation Scheme and make some improvement in regard to the slaughtering of sheep, then I have to say that the Bill before us is nothing but hypocrisy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the <Col N="857" /> House but there are a number of points about which I am glad to have an opportunity to comment.</P>
      <P>This Bill relates exclusively to farmyard enterprises which have become an integral part of agricultural production over the past number of years.  We are talking about intensive pig breeding and rearing, poultry production and feeding and fattening cattle in farmyards and covered accommodation.  The importance of these enterprises cannot be overstated because they are an economic lifeline to many holdings.  Prior to this subsistence farming was the practice, but with our gradual development the importance of farmyard enterprise became more relevant.  Without the intensive production in the farmyard many small holdings would have gone to the wall. Family units have become an integral part of rural life.  Farmyard enterprise has provided the extra revenue needed to assist the benefits derived from small holdings.</P>
      <P>This Bill endeavours to ensure that the law in relation to the protection of animals is updated and that there will be proper co-ordination of the relevant Bills.  Most speakers have accepted that the need to protect animals is vitally important, particularly in the context of farmyard enterprise and intensive production. The majority of Deputies will accept that an intensive producer would realise that it would be economic madness not to have proper conditions for his animals.  Not to care for animals properly would be unthinkable in the context of production costs, which are the reality of the day for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of areas in this Bill which need to be examined to a greater extent.  I am referring to the vesting of powers in inspectors and gardaí to inspect these farm enterprises and to see that proper care is given to those animals. Care needs to be exercised in this instance because people should not be able to walk into a farm without the permission of the farmer.  In an era when the rights of the individual are quite rightly protected, people will object when an effort is made to impinge on those rights. Any Bill that gives undue authority to <Col N="858" /> any inspector or garda to inspect a farm without the permission of the farmer would be undesirable.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will deal with this aspect when replying.  I foresee a situation arising in which many farmholders will object vigorously to these inspections. I do not accept that they could object to efforts being made to protect the rights of the animals contained in the units on their holdings.  If there are to be undue powers vested in veterinary inspectors or in the Garda they could constitute a very dangerous development. Perhaps the Minister would elaborate somewhat on this point so that people in general will know exactly what are his intentions.</P>
    <P>Some speakers quite rightly referred to the importance of the farm modernisation scheme with regard to the protection of animals in these units.  There was also the expansion of the farm buildings programme in recent years, a programme which ground to a halt within the last 12 months primarily because of the suspension of the farm modernisation scheme on 9 February 1983.  This constituted a grevious error on the part of the Government, contending that there was economy involved &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant to the Bill we are debating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>But a detailed discussion is not relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the building regulations that will apply to the farm modernisation scheme will ensure that the farmers in question will have proper buildings to accommodate the animals for which such buildings were intended. It would be sheer economic madness for any farmer or food producer not to think in terms of properly looking after the animals on such units particularly when one considers present production costs. <Col N="859" /> Indeed the pig industry, which is going to the wall at an ever-quickening pace, is doing so because of the increased production costs applicable to that industry in general.  The capacity of that industry to generate employment, whether at the servicing end or the processing end, is much underestimated.  Accommodation for pig production purposes has been enormously expanded in recent times under the farm modernisation scheme. The standard of the buildings is geared at maximising the output on these units, where weight losses and so on are minimised and where the creation of the best possible environment is the goal of the various farm building plans for pig production available from the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some speakers have referred to the importance of water supply.  It is, of course, vital to any animal.  Without it animals will quickly become dehydrated and die and the economic loss to the herdowner will be enormous.  With the development of the various group water schemes the vast majority of counties now have a fairly adequate water supply. I do not perceive any great fear that there would not be an adequate water supply available for these units.  The great problem with regard to water supply is that of pollution which has become of increasing importance with industrialisation and the intensification of production methods on farms.  Therefore the risk of pollution has become much greater than heretofore. Indeed this is an aspect primarily for the Minister for the Environment rather than the Minister for Agriculture.  I foresee difficulties arising in this area in the not too distant future.  If there is to be a polluted water supply to animals in these intensive units obviously its implications will be enormous.  It must be remembered that the producers of barley and other cereal crops find a great outlet in these intensive units whether they be in poultry or pig production.  Therefore the great interdependence between the various facets of our agricultural industry can be clearly seen.  Any difficulties arising in intensive pig or poultry production <Col N="860" /> immediately has implications for our cereal growers, as also for meal compounders.</P>
    <P>This might be an opportune time to refer to the number of animals being wintered out.  Given the severity of our winters there is a great economic loss to farmers simply because they are not in a position to provide the necessary buildings to house their animals during the winter, creating obvious problems for those animals wintered out.  If we could ensure that all our animals were properly housed during the winter period this would be a very desirable target for, say, the next five years but, unfortunately, we are a long way from achieving that target. Such is the case in many parts of the country particularly where the traditional production of store cattle is practised, where the cattle still traverse the ground during the winter months.  In some cases farmers do well in keeping them alive and, at best, having them maintain their weight, full feeding counteracting weather conditions at that time.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister has pinpointed the many problems existing in this area I hope he will ensure the necessary financial input for the farm modernisation scheme at this juncture so that farmers will find the various grant schemes sufficiently attractive to provide the necessary accommodation for animals in order to keep them inside in the winter months.</P>
    <P>These intensive farming enterprises constitute a source of tremendous employment.  With our predominance of small farms these intensive farm enterprises have meant that such farms have been rendered viable.  Without such aid many small farms would have gone to the wall long ago, along with the social implications involved.  The services area, whether in the provision of feed, meal or anything else is also very important for our economy and our agricultural industry generally.  It may not be sufficiently recognised that there is an enormous amount of money tied up in these enterprises, tens of thousands of pounds in some of the more humble ones is not uncommon.  Therefore the larger pig producers could very easily go to the wall if <Col N="861" /> disease were to strike because of the enormous amounts of money involved in feeding costs and so on.</P>
    <P>Certainly I agree with the general principle that animals should be protected and the provisions of the Bill would seem to do that.  However, I am very concerned about the rights and powers of inspectors. I hope the Minister will deal with this and will reassure farmers that they have nothing to fear as a result of inspectors going into their farms.  It would be most undesirable if the inspectors could walk in at will and dictate to farmers as to how they should run their enterprises.  The economic considerations of the day give sufficient guidance to farmers in this regard. I broadly agree with the Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the provisions of the Bill which I consider to be non-contentious.  The main purpose of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes.  I expect that this matter will be debated extensively in the Council of Europe by our members.  It is my opinion that we were often very slow to sign and ratify conventions and I felt that matter should have been brought to the notice of this House on many occasions.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister of State referred to modern intensive farming systems which predominently employ technical installations that are operated principally by means of automatic processes. I do not think there should be any concern with regard to intensive units because they are sophisticated and do not present any technical difficulties or dangers with regard to feeding and cleaning. In fact, most of the units are air-conditioned and are much better than many rural dwellings.  However, it is important that regulations be laid down to cover all aspects of feeding and the care of animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us accept that animals that are well cared for thrive and give better returns.  A farmer cannot afford to keep an animal that is not thriving and it will not thrive unless it is in a comfortable environment.  Any animals, whether it be <Col N="862" /> pigs, broilers, duck or turkeys, must be well and comfortable if maximum production is to be obtained.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have 50 per cent of our stock in the fields throughout the year.  Some 50 years ago Paddy Kavanagh spoke about a farmer going up the hills with a bundle of hay for a few perishing calves but this applies even now in respect of many farmers.  The withdrawal of the Farm Modernisation Scheme was a major hardship.  We must try to reach the point where farmers can take their animals from the land and house them in suitable indoor accommodation from the month of November to April.  Until we can have this we need not talk about modern farming techniques and farm development. Each year the weight animals gain during the summer is lost during the winter and they end up lighter in weight.  Deputy Byrne spoke about development farmers in County Wexford but in my constituency only one out of every five farmers is in that category.  After the expiry of six years farmers are reclassified and either they move into the development category for eight years or they move down.  In the scheme that has been reintroduced the farmers who move down in the categories will be debarred from receiving grant-aid and this has created a serious situation. Admittedly in the western counties grant-aid is available but that is not applicable to people in milk production and they will not receive grant-aid for housing their stock.</P>
    <P>Water is more important than food for the animals.  A few years ago there were good water sources but because of pollution and other factors people now are dependent completely on piped water supplies from group water schemes or from local authority supplies.  In the measures for the western counties there is provision for a subvention and people get £1,000 for farm and domestic connections and £600 for domestic connections only.  However, in many cases additional supplementary payments will be sought and the Minister will be hearing about many of the schemes that are in difficulties at the moment.</P>
    <P>If we want to develop agriculture to the full extent we will have to give more <Col N="863" /> consideration to intensive units.  I have no fear they will cause any problems so far as this Bill is concerned because they are well-developed and sophisticated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill before the House.  The farming community do not have to fear because of this Bill.  Generally we have been good livestock people and our farm husbandry has been excellent.  We compare favourably with any European country in the care and feeding of livestock.  The safety of animals may have caused some concern to urban dwellers.  Many stories expressing such concern have been published in large cities in Europe.</P>
      <P>I should particularly like to see a change in relation to the calf dehorners which are on sale on the Irish market. From the point of view of safety on the users and the animals we should take some precautions in this regard because at the moment the machines are not properly built and could be a danger to human and animal life.  After only a short time in use there can be burning and exposure of the wires and I suggest that we should have looked at it in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our animal food is of good quality, consisting of good native barley, good grass silage and excellent grass.  I can see no fear in this regard.  We have been able to prove to the Europeans that we are not intensive farmers, and indeed that has been part of our case against the super-levy.  We have not got intensive units with the large production of European countries.  I would be mainly concerned about the right this Bill gives to somebody to come on a farmer's premises at any hour of day or night to carry out inspections.  Such interference with livestock, disturbing and annoying the animals, could be harmful.  That is very important.  We could have some crank veterinary surgeon or garda who would have a chip on his shoulder in regard to animal production and who could make a bloody nuisance of himself and torment every farmer in three parishes.  Because of the ability and the knowledge and <Col N="864" /> farming experience of the Minister of State, I know he will cater for this and protect the farming community.</P>
    <P>In regard to farm equipment, we have quite a few conmen importing equipment for use in intensive livestock production. There is no legislation to cater for this and many farmers have been financially embarrassed and have had their fingers badly burned because of buying inferior equipment.  The Bill provides for equipment but it does not lay down guidelines. Irish farmers are very caring and would not be fooled, but they could be taken in by high-powered salesmen who could sell inferior equipment that would cause many problems for farmers.</P>
    <P>Exposure of livestock on the land is one of our biggest problems.  It was a retrograde step for the Government to have interfered with the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  That scheme provided an incentive to house cattle properly but that grant incentive was withdrawn with the result that at the moment 50 per cent of our cattle are roaming the land in bad, wet, frosty cold weather.  Recently we had a debate on the exposure of sheep on the Galtees with consequent major losses.  If there had been proper grant aid many of our livestock, both sheep and cattle, would be housed and protected from our hard winters.  It is in the farmers' interest that their livestock would be housed properly and that farms would not be over-stocked.  Grant-aided farmers are allowed so much per foot per pig or per cow or per bullock.  In catering for a situation like that the Bill has some merits because it will make for more profit at farm level, and that is what farming is all about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to hare coursing which has been a rural sport in Ireland for a number of years.  I could not let his remarks go without referring to them because it has been a form of Sunday sport in rural areas and a source of enjoyment. We have Deputy Shatter and many others with chips on their shoulders about traditional forms of sport here and other things here.  He spoke about the use of hormones and drug abuse in Irish agriculture. That will do nothing but harm to our great food industry.  Most statements <Col N="865" /> of this kind are inflammatory and we cannot afford to tolerate them.  Deputy Shatter would be better discussing these things in the Fine Gael Party rooms or in some other forum instead of discussing them openly in the House.  At a time when we are trying to expand our food and livestock production we cannot afford to have statements of this nature and therefore I appeal to the Deputy to find some other forum.  By an large we have not been abusive in the use of growth hormones or drugs.  The Italians and the French generally have been instrumental in the production of growth hormones.  I do not think we have anything to fear here in this respect.  Our farmers and our veterinary people are careful and understanding, knowing the harm these things can create.</P>
    <P>We have had too much talk about drugs.  Who wants to do harm in that way?  I am disappointed that this kind of talk has been raising its head continuously, been shouted from the rooftops. We have a very valuable dairying and beef industry and the less we say about those things the better for us.  Basically we are an exporting country and if we continue to talk like this nobody will have anything to do with us.  We have adequate legislation and we have always been able to control the situation.</P>
    <P>The provision of adequate water supplies is a problem at farm level.  Adequate water supplies are very important for good husbandry and many farmers have difficulties in this regard.  In my constituency very few people have a public water supply and many people over Christmas had problems in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the Bill as being unnecessary and this is evident from the non-attendance of many Government TDs.  There is no enthusiasm in Fine Gael or Labour for this Bill.  We have massive unemployment and the Dáil should be engaged in discussing legislation to cater for job maintenance and job creation.  I think this Bill is an infringement of farmers' individual rights.  I suggest that certain provisions are against farmers' constitutional right to individual ownership and control.  The farming organisations <Col N="866" /> should be allowed to express their views on this Bill, but to date they have not done so because the Bill has been rushed into the House in a hasty, ill-considered manner.  Last week on the Order of Business we on this side requested that the Bill would be deferred for examination by Members of the House at party level, but it was published on 20 February and it is before us today.  I would say that is a record.  The farming organisations should have been asked for their advice and guidance on this Bill which is likely to have far-reaching consequences.  I regard the Bill as an insult to farmers because its provisions are a reflection on the integrity of the farming community and their ability to maintain livestock in a proper manner.</P>
      <P>For instance, there are requirements in the Bill for daily inspections of herds. Farmers normally and wisely inspect their herds at least once a day and therefore this legislation is bringing more bureaucracy into their way of life.  The Bill requires farmers to keep records and have them ready for inspection.  At a time when farmers are under major stress in relation to the super-levy, this Bill imposes more bureaucracy on them.  Of course, the super-levy has been extremely badly handled by the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach &mdash; their whole approach to the super-levy has been one of the most disgraceful by any Government at any time.  They have not conveyed total opposition to the super-levy.  They should have been indicating again that they propose to veto any such proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is particularly offensive to farmers because it comes soon after the deferment of the Farm Modernisation Scheme which had been supported by successive Governments, particularly Fianna Fáil.  We brought forward a very attractive package for the improvement of farm holdings.  The provisions of this Bill possibly would require a farmer to improve his or her farm buildings, yet in return the Government are not putting forward proposals to restore full farm modernisation grants.  The Minister must make a clear statement regarding the farm modernisation scheme.  He <Col N="867" /> announced recently that he was restoring the farm modernisation grants, but the EEC in turn stated that they did not approve the return of the farm modernisation scheme.  The Minister now has an opportunity to clarify the position.  Will the scheme be available to the farming community in 1984 or is it being vetoed by the EEC?  That is a very important question because there is concern at present among the farming community in relation to this.</P>
    <P>There are many outstanding claims under the farm modernisation scheme for farm buildings which had been commenced without the written approval of the inspector for the Department of Agriculture or the ACOT adviser, but verbally approved by these officials at the time when the scheme was shelved by the Coalition Government.  Many farmers had embarked on major contract work for the erection of farm buildings, haysheds, yards, silage pits and so forth. They have had major financial difficulties as a result of the overnight decision by this Government to defer the farm modernisation scheme.  It is very important that the integrity of the ACOT advisers and agricultural advisers at all levels be guaranteed by a Government.  These people had given oral approval to the commencement of projects under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Our spokesman, Deputy Noonan, has outlined our exact position with regard to this Bill.  We will be putting forward amendments to many sections.  We on this side of the House feel that the Bill is suitable for consideration by a special select committee of this House who would consider each section in detail. This select committee would have representatives of the farming community from both sides of the House to give their advice to the Minister before Committee Stage of this Bill, which will be very detailed.  Many of the provisions in the Bill are repugnant to our party and to the farming community.</P>
    <P>I quote section 3 (c):</P>
    <P>provisions with respect to the dimensions <Col N="868" /> and layout of housing for such animals, the materials to be used in constructing any such housing and the facilities by way of lighting, heating, cooling, ventilation, regulating the level of humidity, air circulation, drainage, water supply or otherwise to be provided in connection with any such housing.</P>
    <P>These requirements far exceed those of the Department for the Environment in relation to housing for humans.  Many people are living under far lower standards than are outlined in that section. These requirements are practically impossible to attain.  Very few buildings constructed under the farm modernisation scheme and designed by Department of Agriculture advisers would comply with these regulations.  On our farm I have recently constructed quite extensive buildings which, in relation to cooling, ventilation and the level of humidity could not be guaranteed.  These buildings were erected by competent contractors under the supervision of Department of Agriculture advisers.  The Minister will have to review every word and section of this Bill, otherwise he will have a job getting support for further modernisation of farm buildings.  The Minister will have to announce a farm modernisation scheme which allows for the special provisions of this section, otherwise this legislation will be ineffective.</P>
    <P>Also of particular concern is the section regarding records, which I have already mentioned.  These requirements will be very hard to comply with.  The Minister will also have to reconsider this section.</P>
    <P>One section which concerns the farming community and myself is that in regard to entry for inspection, etc.  The provisions of section 8 have far-reaching consequences for the farming community. I hope, through the powers of the media, that the message will be conveyed to the farming community that this Bill is now proceeding through this House.  The provision under this section is that an inspector may call to a farm at all reasonable times.  This could quite easily be abused.  What would a reasonable time <Col N="869" /> be?  Would it be 7 o'clock in the morning or 12 o'clock at night?  The Minister would have to specify exactly the hours of inspection before I would be satisfied. Inspection of that type should require production of a warrant signed by a senior member of the agricultural staff in the area, otherwise any official at any time could inspect anyone's farm.  That is unacceptable to the farming community. I hope that the IFA and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association will convey their opposition to this provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that this will slip through the House, probably unnoticed, but at some stage will create great difficulties for many farmers.  Section 8 is as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  An inspector may at all reasonable times&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  for the purpose of exercising any of the other powers conferred on him by this section enter any premises or other land,</P>
    <P>(b)  inspect, examine or test&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  any animal which he reasonable believes to be an animal to which this Act applies and which is found by him in or on any premises or other land so entered,</P>
    <P>(ii)  any food or liquid so found and which he so believes is used or is to be used to feed animals to which this Act applies,</P>
    <P>(iii)  any equipment so found,</P>
    <P>(c)  take samples from any such animal or of any such food or liquid and examine, test or analyse, or cause to be examined, tested or analysed, any sample so taken,</P>
    <P>(d)  require the production of and inspect, and if he so wishes take extracts from, any record made pursuant to the requirements of section 7 of this Act,</P>
    <P>(e)  require any person who is either the owner or the person for the time being in charge of an animal or equipment referred to in paragraph <Col N="870" /> (b) of this subsection, or who is the owner or occupier of or employed on premises or other land so entered, to give to him such assistance or to carry out such instructions as may be reasonably necessary to enable such examination, inspection, test or analysis to be carried out or to give to him such information regarding such animal or equipment as is within his knowledge or under his control.</P>
    <P>(2) (a)  An authorised person shall have such of the powers given to an inspector by this section as may be specified in his authorisation by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(b)  A member of the Garda Síochána shall have all of the powers given to an inspector by this section other than the power to examine, test or take samples from animals.</P>
    <P>(3)  An inspector or authorised person who exercises a power conferred on him by or under this section shall, if required by the person affected by the exercise, produce to that person his appointment as an inspector or authorisation to be an authorised person, as may be appropriate.</P>
    <P>We have always fought for the individual right of ownership.  Farmers have always been proud to own their land.  This is the first act by a Government which will give inspectors an opportunity to inspect farms without the permission of landowners. I believe a landowner must give permission before an inspector can inspect his or her land.  If an inspector feels that there is something amiss I do not see why he should not go to the particular farmer and ask him for permission to inspect the farm.  If the farmer is not prepared to give permission for the inspection the inspector can take the matter a step further. I believe the right being given in the Bill to inspect a person's holding is repugnant to the Constitution.  No other Act of the Oireachtas has given that power to any Department to allow an inspector inspect an individual's holding.</P>
    <P>Farmers are very proud of their holdings and they would be very concerned <Col N="871" /> that an inspector would have the right to come any day or any night to inspect their holdings.  They would also be concerned that this would add to the spread of brucellosis or tuberculosis in herds.  They would have to get guarantees that such inspectors had not come from inspecting infected farms which had restricted herds.  I would be very concerned about an inspector coming on to my holding if I was not aware of where the inspector came from or if he came from another holding infected with disease.  I would be particularly concerned, having a disease free herd, that an inspector could cause the spread of TB and brucellosis, which have had devastating effects on the farming community.  It would serve the Minister better if he brought in a Bill to improve the control of animal disease. This Bill is repugnant to our farmers as well as being repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (2) (b) states:</P>
    <P>A member of the Garda Síochána shall have all of the powers given to an inspector by this section other than the power to examine, test or take samples from animals.</P>
    <P>Why should a member of the Garda Síochána be given power to come on to a person's holding and inspect the premises? Why would a Minister give that power to a member of the Garda Síochána?  Surely it is an infringement of a person's rights.  Before a member of the Garda Síochána enters a person's premises he must have a warrant.  There is no mention in this section of a warrant being issued to a member of the Garda Síochána by the District Court.  There is need to revise this section in relation to this matter.  In rural Ireland we have great respect for the Garda Síochána.  We fight for their rights at all times.  We are engaged in a campaign at the moment to ensure that we will have our gardaí in rural areas at all times.  They are a most responsible body and are welcome to visit farmers' homes at all times but giving a garda the right to inspect a person's holding is something I do not approve of. <Col N="872" /> What justification could there be for requiring a member of the Garda Síochána to inspect a person's home?</P>
    <P>The last time we had a member of the Garda Síochána on our holding was to examine ewes killed by dogs roaming the area.  We invited the Garda Síochána on to our holding.  We lost a number of ewes and a ram at that time.  We wanted the gardaí to examine the carcasses of the dead animals so that they could try to ensure that the marauding dogs would be apprehended before they caused further damage in the locality.  It is a most retrograde step to give the Garda Síochána power in section 8 to inspect a person's holding.  The farming organisations must indicate their views in relation to this matter in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to penalties, section 9(3) states:</P>
    <P>Any person guilty of an offence under this section shall on summary conviction be liable to a fine not exceeding £500, or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such term of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>This particular matter will cause great concern to the farming community.  The Minister has seen fit to bring in those very severe penalties in relation to the most law abiding citizens one could possibly have so that they will now be deemed to have committed an offence on their own land.  I regard this as offensive.  I ask the Minister to review this matter because the severe penalties could not fit any crime which could take place in relation to an animal on a person's holding.  The Minister must be aware that it is to the farmer's advantage to maintain his or her livestock up to the best quality, to provide the best quality accommodation, feeding and water.  That is the normal business criterion and there is no need to bring in a Bill to force farmers to do what they are doing at all times.  I am aware of the high quality of the husbandry of the farmers in the constituencies of Roscommon and east Galway.  There are outstanding farmers in those constitutencies who would never illtreat their animals. <Col N="873" /> They buy the best quality food for their animals and provide them with the best quality shelter to ensure that their herds are the best turned out.  It is quite evident that cattle from that area are the finest in the world.  We have a very fine record in relation to sheep and lambs.  Our lamb is sought in Europe, particularly in France.</P>
    <P>We are very fortunate to have some of the finest production units.  We have one of the finest lamb factories in Athleague and we have one of the finest factories in Europe at Rooskey, the Handy Meats, where pigs are processed.  In Ballaghad-erreen we have the Halal operation.  We have a fine record in regard to cattle, sheep and pig production.  No farmer in that area would take a chance with his or her livestock.  I do not believe any of the farmers in my constituency will be affected by the Bill unless the inspectors take a particular attitude.</P>
    <P>I believe the Bill is unecessary because of the high standard of animal husbandry throughout the country.  In County Roscommon we have some very fine marts. We have marts in Roscommon, Castlerea, Elphin and we have a very fine mart just started in Tulsk.  Those marts are providing good employment and the finest stock anywhere in Ireland can be seen at any of those marts.  I believe the farmers will generally find this Bill offensive. I appeal to the Minister of State and his officials to reassess seriously the need for the Bill at this stage.  I am well aware that the Government are very anxious to get this Bill through the House.  It is a rushed Bill which will be shown to be unnecessary.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is so concerned about this Bill he will speak about it.  I am sure he is not prepared to stand over this Bill.  I am sure the Clare farmers as well as the farmers of other areas throughout the country will find it offensive that the Fine Gael-Labour Government decided it was appropriate to bring in a Bill to force our farmers to do what they are doing at the moment.  Surely the Government have more on their plate with massive unemployment, rising crime <Col N="874" /> rates and all the other matters.  Even in his constituency, the Minister of State has problems.</P>
      <P>Not one of the rural Fine Gael or Labour Deputies has felt it worthwhile to debate this Bill.  Our party have contributed the majority of speakers because we are concerned about the content of the Bill.  I hope that the farming organisations will come forward with their views at the earliest opportunity and express their concern in relation to many of the provisions.  Our spokesman, Deputy Noonan, has more experience of farming than the Minister for Agriculture or the Ministers of State and we look forward to the day when our spokesperson will be the Minister.  If this Government do not bring forward practical and rational amendments, I hope we will have an opportunity to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes.  The Government in 1978 agreed that the Convention should be signed and this was done on 29 June 1978. That should answer the previous speaker's argument because his party were in Government at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan that good husbandry would dictate that this type of inspection would not cause any hardship or inconvenience to good farmers.  They would have absolutely nothing to fear from it.  The Convention has been available since 1978 and there is nothing in the Bill which is not contained in the Convention.  We must conform to the Convention and ensure that the terms are complied with.  The Attorney General has advised that an Act is necessary. There may be the odd farmer who will not be able to live up to these terms but it will not be a problem for a person who practices good husbandry.  We will be looking at a later stage at the various parts of the Bill and I hope to be able to convince Deputies that they are necessary. The daily inspection of animals and equipment is required by the Convention and must be enshrined in the Bill.  Many <Col N="875" /> speakers thought these matters were unnecessary but the Convention specifies these things and they must be contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The records required by Article 7 are simple and should not be exaggerated. They will assist our inspectors in ensuring that the requirements are being complied with.  The Garda will have very limited powers in order to assist our officers.  I imagine that the only time the assistance of the Garda will be required is following a point blank refusal by a farmer to allow an inspector to inspect his animals.</P>
    <P>Transport of animals was mentioned by Deputy Noonan.  That matter came before the Council of Europe and I spoke on it myself in that forum.  It is not part of this Bill.  The welfare of animals at marts is already being examined and a Government order will be signed in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also mentioned the possibility of this Bill being considered by a committee.  I have no objections to having discussions with anybody, but we have not much time since Committee Stage will be taken next week.  If there are any points which the Opposition spokesman would like to discuss prior to Committee Stage, I will be delighted to facilitate him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter underlined the point that the main purpose of the Bill is to enable us to ratify the Convention. Hare coursing does not fall within the ambit of the Bill, which is <Col N="876" /> intended to cover animals kept for farm purposes.  Hormones and antibiotics are not covered and are a separate question.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt said that the Bill was stating the obvious, but sometimes the obvious has to be stated.  Animals suffer unnecessarily in some instances and the Bill will help to overcome this problem.</P>
      <P>The Bill has nothing to do with the Farm Modernisation Scheme but there will be powers under section 3 to regulate the amount of space required by animals in intensive production.  Basically that is good husbandry anyway.  Details are already well known to farmers through the ACOT advisers.</P>
      <P>I was encouraged by Deputy Byrne's contribution.  Farmers generally are committed to the welfare of animals and there is no intention in this Bill to malign farmers. Deputy Byrne was misinterpreting the situation, although there may be the odd farmer who will have to toe the line.</P>
      <P>I, like other Members, am very concerned about the worrying of sheep and the question was asked as to what progress has been made.  The inter-departmental committee recently furnished a report which is under consideration. When that report is available to me I will have no hesitation in making it similarly available to Members opposite.  This matter has nothing to do with the Bill.  The question of grants for farm machinery, roadways and the supply of water is not part of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kirk mentioned inspection powers.  There is not much point in passing a Bill unless there is power to enforce its provisions.  There is nothing oppressive about it.  I do not know any inspectors who have the reputation of being oppressive.  There will be no witch-hunting. The powers given to the Garda are limited and are intended only as a backup.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leonard is concerned about conditions in intensive units and he also mentioned animals in fields.  The latter question is covered by the Bill but it is not as problematic as the case of intensive poultry units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy O'Keeffe's question, calf de-horning is not appropriate to the Bill.  We are not concerned with <Col N="877" /> the type of equipment being used in various units.  We are concerned with ensuring that it is in proper working order and that it achieves its objectives.  Hormones, and so on, are not covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessary.  It has been agreed by the European Convention and it now has to be ratified by us.  There is no intention to make difficulties for farmers. A good farmer will not be in the least concerned about the Bill.  He will have his ACOT adviser calling on him, and he will be quite accustomed to getting good advice.  It has nothing to do with the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  I cannot understand the so-called misapprehensions.  It is a simple, straightforward Bill.  Most speakers expressed general agreement on it.  I welcome the contributions made on the Bill.  If there are any fears or genuine problems they will be treated reasonably by this side of the House on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I dealt mainly with taxation and what I perceived as the need for tax reform.  I should like now to turn to an issue which is equally important, particularly in view of the report published today on the need for more careful planning of resources in the State sector.  I should like to talk about manpower policy which has become what we might call a large industry. The State is expending about £200 million on various training and employment schemes.  Yet we have no coherent <Col N="878" /> set of manpower policies drawn up by any Government.  The last policy statement made about manpower policy was back in the sixties.  The employment climate in the sixties was entirely different from the one we face today.  If we look at the rationale behind the National Manpower Service we see that it had a very different task from the task today.  The service was seen mainly as a way of easing the time lag between employers identifying potential employees and employment. It was not envisaged that it would have to cope with the huge unemployment problem we now face.</P>
      <P>Apart from the change in the economic circumstances, over the years successive Governments have responded to growing unemployment by adding piecemeal changes to the policies adopted by Governments.  I can cite very many worthwhile schemes, including the work experience programme, the Youth Employment Agency and the recent enterprise allowance scheme.  It must be said that they were introduced individually and without taking a global view of what they were intended to achieve.  A recent OECD report on manpower policy in Ireland drew attention to the fact that many of the agencies charged with implementing these schemes are doing so with less than full commitment.  In effect, they have not seen these schemes as their primary responsibility and, therefore, the operation of these schemes, many of them worth while, has suffered.  This points to the need for the Government to reassess what has been achieved by these programmes, who is doing what, and whether we are getting proper results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another obvious problem which has emerged in the manpower area is the extensive overlap.  One area which I am glad to see being tackled is the overlap between AnCO and many of the VECs and other educational institutes.  Other areas are not being tackled &mdash; for example, the duplication of assessments in Manpower and AnCO when they are addressing the task of finding what opportunities should be offered to young people.  It is quite common that young people apply to Manpower for a basic assessment and interview and, at the <Col N="879" /> same time, apply to AnCO for a basic assessment and interview.  That duplication is wasting public money and creates the more important danger from a young person's point of view that there is a strong temptation for AnCO to go for a creaming process which takes the very best possible applicant, rather than the people the State would like to see being given training opportunities.  It is important that the State should intervene and indicate its idea of where policy should be heading.</P>
    <P>The fundamental task for the Department of Labour is to play a much more authoritative role in deciding who does what and how it is carried out.  I am concerned that the Acts which established the various independent agencies in the manpower area gave them terms of reference which were too broad and were in conflict with those of other agencies. Naturally that has led to conflicts. The Minister for Labour has lacked effective control over the operations of bodies such as AnCO.  In the past year, we have seen evidence of where AnCO have expanded into areas and, at the end of the day, serious concern was expressed by the public.  There had to be some checking on their activities.  There should be a clear policy context within which the various agencies operate and that type of misunderstanding should not occur.</P>
    <P>The role of the Youth Employment Agency needs clarification.  They were designed to co-ordinate the activities of AnCO, Manpower, the Department of Education, the Department of the Environment and many other agencies dealing with employment and training problems. They were not given effective policy authority to enable them to cajole or push those agencies.  It is fair to say that they should not have such authority because that authority should rest with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Youth Employment Agency need to be given more effective power of co-ordination by allowing them to sub-contract to the different agencies the funds they provide.  At present their control is on a rather arbitrary basis.  They get the youth employment levy and they are <Col N="880" /> more or less obliged to subscribe to whatever programmes are being operated by the different agencies which apply to persons under the age of 25 years.</P>
    <P>If the Youth Employment Agency are to be effective in co-ordinating policy, they should hold the purse strings more firmly than that.  I envisage a sub-contracting arrangement whereby the agency were actually stating what they required from AnCO or any other body who were spending their funds.</P>
    <P>A number of detailed points also must be tackled by what I would look for, a White Paper on manpower policy.  The first of these detailed points is that a clear distinction must be made between training for economic development and training and opportunities for disadvantaged groups in the labour force.  Obviously these are very different in the sort of person they deal with; therefore access to those courses is very different in regard to how people should be assessed for qualification for such courses.  Equally, the content of the courses differs very much and the tests of success in these areas are very different.  It is unrealistic to expect AnCO, a body interested primarily in economic development and training for economic development, to be able to give the sort of priority needed in training for disadvantaged groups. Although I am full of praise for their activity to date, I could not but be a little concerned when the OECD report indicated that they thought this sort of activity was not being given AnCO's wholehearted interest.  Therefore, an important distinction must be made there in policy terms by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>The other aspect that must be tackled, a detail arising from that distinction, is that we have an enormous training programme now being carried out by AnCO, but there is very little independent monitoring of what is going on.  In particular, no certification of standards is reached by training courses carried out by AnCO. That is important, because without certification confusion is likely to exist in the mind of the employer about exactly what has been the training and what people who have completed courses are <Col N="881" /> able to do.  In time the standard of the training will suffer and the advantages that a person who has been trained by AnCO has, will suffer if there is not clear certification of the content of the courses to make sure that high quality is being maintained.  That certification must be done by an agency outside AnCO, as it would be done in any other higher education area.  Equally, it is important that AnCO do not judge success entirely as being identical with a high placement rate from their courses.  A high placement rate could indicate that AnCO are substituting the sort of task that employers should take on themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tailor my remarks to that.  I am worried that AnCO put concentration on placement as the sole test of the success of a training course. Placement is important, but it is quite possible that a course would be designed purely to suit an employer and, therefore, would get 100 per cent placement; yet that it would not be in the best interests of this country or provide the sort of skills needed for our labour force.  Therefore, there is a need for the Department of Labour to decide on the type of courses necessary and the sort of skills we must provide for our young people and for our older people.  There is a need for external monitoring of the quality of training and also of the duration and quality of employment that trainees get from their courses.  At present AnCO monitor purely the level of placement &mdash; in other words, whether at the end of the course people are placed and what percentage. From the State's point of view it is equally important that people are placed in proper jobs and not in makeshift jobs that do not last very long.  It is important also that the jobs be valuable and that the quality be high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will mention two problems that again call for a very serious policy statement and examination by the Department of Labour.  Firstly, there is excessive concentration of all our manpower schemes on the needs of young people.  Over 80 <Col N="882" /> per cent of all training funds, employment schemes and so on go to persons under 25, and I do not think it can be said that young people are the sole class of persons facing problems in the employment market at the moment.  In many cases older workers have greater difficulty in that it is longer since they trained, they have family responsibilities and so on.  We must make sure that we do not tip the balance to far in the direction of the under 25s.  After all, the big problems, the big growth in the labour force will be in the over 25s in the next few years and we must have a policy capable of coping with that increase when it comes.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to draw attention to is the problem that has grown in the apprenticeship area.  We have an apprenticeship programme which occupies one-third of all AnCO places throughout the year and that comes to about £10,000 per person on these apprenticeships for the year.  We have now discovered that placement is not high off these apprenticeships and the reason for that is that we have become concentrated in the traditional skills, the construction industry and motor mechanic skills.  These are not the skills that will be needed in the coming decades in order to bring about growth.  The Department of Labour must give serious attention to the problems in the apprenticeship programme that have grown and as a result we are not putting our money in the areas of greatest training need.  Even under the strict apprenticeship heading there is rapid change in the sort of technology needed in the motor mechanic area and the traditional apprenticeship may not be gearing up to that.  I am not knocking apprenticeships, but they are occupying too much State money and we must go for training on the leading edge of technology at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with the budget my preoccupation at present is with the question of unemployment and the creation of employment.  The budget has been described by a number of people as neutral. I do not think there is anything to <Col N="883" /> be ashamed of at a time like this in having a neutral budget because such a budget is necessary this year.  We have had indications in recent months of an upswing in the economy.  Statistics available from the US show that the economy there is continuing to improve.  Assuming that an upswing in the American economy will see an upswing in the economy in Europe and ultimately an upswing in the economy here, I feel that the decisions taken by the Minister for Finance in his budget were correct.  The increase in taxation has been very little.  Any major increase in taxation this year would have had a deflationary effect and would have been a disincentive to industry.  Therefore, we are waiting at present for the upswing in the world economy to have an effect on our economy.  We are still in a type of limbo.  We do not know at this stage how great the recovery will be or whether it will be continuous.  Therefore, we must maintain the industries we have and ensure that the people who have been affected by the problems of unemployment are protected.  Despite what has been said, if we look at the projected inflation rates for this year we will see that the contribution made to the unemployed in the budget will keep the people in that unfortunate position protected against inflation.  The increases may not be as great as many people would have liked but they recognise the plight of such people.  Since the budget many irresponsible statements have been made by Opposition Deputies.</P>

      <P>1.  Inquiring into the following definite matter of urgent public importance:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> the circumstances in which listening devices were placed in a private house in Del-Val Avenue, Kilbarrack.</P>
    <P>2.  Making such recommendations, as the Tribunal having regard to its findings, thinks proper.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for the setting up of a tribunal of inquiry into the placing of listening devices in a private house and that the tribunal make appropriate recommendations.</P>
    <P>We are demanding in this motion that the Government set up immediately an independent judicial tribunal to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the placing of listening devices in a house where the deputy leader of the SDLP stayed while attending the Forum.  We are also requesting that this tribunal make such recommendations as it considers appropriate The events which have unfolded since the disclosure in a Sunday newspaper, <i>Sunday Tribune,</i> 19 February 1984 of the bugging incident, the subsequent statements made by the Taoiseach, by the Department of Justice, and by the Garda, and the personal silence of the Minister for Justice have created such concern and mistrust that only an independent judicial inquiry will restore confidence and order necessary in the handling of these affairs.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Government say that there is no need for an inquiry. The Government have refused to provide time for a debate on the Mallon affair and when we have set aside our Private Members' time for such a debate they have attempted to pre-empt the discussion by stating in advance that no inquiry will be held.  What a stark contrast this is to the manly performance of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, and his Government who, when allegations were made against the last Minister for Justice, approached the President of the High Court to request that an independent judicial inquiry be established and a judge be released to undertake this important function in relation to the administration of the affairs of that Department.  Indeed, the Coalition promised on coming to office that such <Col N="885" /> an inquiry would take place but that has not happened and the initial arrangements fell by the wayside.</P>
    <P>Much has been said in the course of the last week in connection with the Mallon affair and yet because of some initially misleading statements; and a lack of frankness and clarity on the part of the Government, it has fallen to the Opposition and to some investigative journalists in the media to search for the truth and establish the facts.  There have been many false trails laid before us.  Initially we were led to believe that the whole affair was an attempt to burgle the dwelling. Then we were given the suggestion of the family's association with a nephew who was involved in a demonstration outside the British Embassy.  Then we were told that the bugging attempt was the work of the Provisional IRA, even though the Government were admitting at the same time that they had no proof that this was so.  The media and the public were skilfully led up these various culsde-sac and the headlines reflected the desired false leads put out by Government sources.  Indeed, it is regrettable that this long process of investigation and discovery had to take place because it meant that the entire affair since the public became aware of it on 19 February has been drawn out further because of the lack of frankness and forthrightness in regard to it.</P>
    <P>For the Moyna family this saga began on 29 October 1983 when their phone went out of order.  Since this was a bank holiday weekend they reported the fault on Tuesday, November 1 at 9.30 a.m. That was a reasonable approach on their part, because naturally they assumed that they were unfortunate it had gone out of order on the bank holiday weekend.  Mr. Moyna reported the fault from his place of business at 9.30 a.m. on 1 November the first opportunity he had.  At 10.30 a.m. the phone was working again and at 11.00 a.m. three men, allegedly from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, arrived to instal a new wire.  Late on the same evening Mr. Moyna discovered the microphone because he had bored a hole through the main outside wall and <Col N="886" /> wanted to redirect the wire to behind the wall panelling.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about the alleged crudity of this arrangement.  We have heard a lot about this aspect of the matter in recent days.  I should like to make it clear that the only reason the three men who called to this job could not bore a hole through the window was because Mr. Moyna's wife said, &ldquo;No way&rdquo;.  She knew that her husband would be upset if a hole had been bored through the aluminium window and that he would have had other ideas about how to handle the situation.  That was how the wire was put through the base corner of the window rather than through a hole in the framework.  That is a crucial point because it upset what might otherwise have been a reasonably tidy arrangement but not one that would come up to the standards Mr. Moyna would set for himself in his house.  As was discovered later, he is a particularly meticulous type of person and everything about his house and his garden are of that nature.</P>
    <P>Mr. Moyna found that the wire went through his back garden and trees and on to what he thought was a telegraph pole. In fact, it was an ESB cum telegraph pole which is unusual.  We are talking about the dark nights of November when the Moyna's did not have much opportunity to do much more at that stage.  On the following Saturday he took trouble to get up the pole to see where the wire at the top of it went to.  He wanted to see where it was tied into the telegraph system, as he assumed.  It was at that stage that he found that the wires went from the telegraph pole to a hideout in the back behind blackberry bushes in a neat little corner.  Most people would have assumed that when the wire joined the telegraph pole that was the end of it.  Mr. Moyna, being the meticulous type, climbed the pole to investigate further and made the discovery I have outlined.  In the corner he discovered the transmitter and other arrangements for listening.  On Tuesday, November 8 he called to Posts and Telegraphs sections at Distillery Road, Russell Street and Belcamp to see whether his phone fault had been recorded and from whence the three men came.  The <Col N="887" /> same day the senior Posts and Telegraphs man arrived following his inquiry, and later that evening Mr. Séamus Mallon arrived and set in motion the placing of the entire matter in the hands of the Taoiseach for full and immediate investigation.</P>
    <P>People have asked why Mr. Moyna did not hand over the packages to the Posts and Telegraphs official.  I do not think I have to explain to Members of this House why he did not do that.  Obviously he had communicated with Mr. Mallon who had considered how the matter should be handled, at what level and with what confidentiality this matter should be handled because it affected security. Consequently when the official arrived Mr. Moyna showed him the wire but kept the other material until Mr. Mallon arrived later that evening.  Mr. Moyna prepared as full an account as he could of what had happened and this was given to the Taoiseach by Mr. Séamus Mallon. The matter was so sensitive, occurring in the midst of the Forum deliberations, that he considered this to be the only sensible approach since the matter obviously involved security.</P>
    <P>These, very briefly, are the events which preceded the Taoiseach's involvement in the affair.  It has since been confirmed officially that on 16 November the Taoiseach got Mr. Moyna's report, read it and transmitted it to the Minister for Justice.  Questions which still remain unanswered are, first, did the Minister for Justice read the report which contained reference to the microphone and the transmitter?  That report was published in one of the weekend's newspapers, I have a copy here which I can show anyone who wants to see it.  One could not read the two pages without seeing very clearly one-third of the way down &ldquo;a microphone&rdquo; and two-thirds of the way down, in block capitals, &ldquo;a transmitter&rdquo;. Mr. Moyna spelled out in a very simple and straightforward way the events as they occurred.  That report was handed to the Taoiseach and he handed it to the Minister for Justice.  Second, did the Minister for Justice read the report which contained reference to the microphone <Col N="888" /> and transmitter?  Third, when did he pass the report to the Garda Commissioner for action?</P>
    <P>We know that on 6 December, Detective Inspector Hawkshaw called on the senior Posts and Telegraphs technician and took his statement.  This means there was a gap between 16 November and 6 December.  The questions I ask are: did the Minister consider that this delay was warranted?  Is this the way he would normally deal with such a serious security matter?  On 11 January the Minister for Justice gave reports from Posts and Telegraphs officials, plus a covering letter from the Garda, to the Taoiseach.  Here we must ask: had he read these reports? Why did he not question the fact that even at this late date the Garda had not called on the Moynas to collect the listening equipment and investigate the alleged bugging?  Did he tell the Taoiseach he was satisfied that the report was comprehensive? Was he himself satisfied?  In this respect we can refer to the statement issued by the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána which must be regarded as the Minister's official view since it is the view of the Department and the Garda as expresed at that time.</P>
    <P>This statement which was released by the Government Information Services says that it transpired that the Posts and Telegraphs official had already received a complaint from the occupants and that there had been two visits to the house by Posts and Telegraphs officials who had been given what seemed to be detailed accounts of the events.  Statements were taken by the Garda from the Posts and Telegraphs officials concerned.  That was a reasonable thing to do but we know now that those officials came before the case was presented to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The investigating garda assumed that what had been said to the Posts and Telegraphs official was a full account of what the occupant had to say.  The Garda were conscious of the fact that the only allegations the occupants had made at official level had been to Posts and Telegraphs officials and not to the Garda and they had no reason to think that any information had been withheld from those officials. The Garda assumed that an earlier <Col N="889" /> reference to a microphone, etc., must have been due to some misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>The statement said that: &ldquo;the gardaí were conscious of the fact that the only allegations the occupants had made at official level ....&rdquo;  Is the Taoiseach not official level?  Is the Minister for Justice not official level?  What does that statement mean?  That statement cannot be true because we know that Mr. Mallon, recognising the need for confidentiality, had placed the matter solely in the hands of the Taoiseach, who placed it in the hands of his Minister.  It is very difficult to understand how the Garda took that approach to the report.  Somebody at some level in the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice must have had a copy of the report which the Taoiseach received and which he said he gave to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>That statement goes on to say that a report was supplied to the Department of Justice by the Garda and the substance of it was brought to the notice of the Taoiseach.  At that point it was not known that any further investigation would be made and no mention of such a possibility was made to the Taoiseach.  Shortly after that the Garda decided to seek an interview with the occupants of the house. They had earlier hesitated to seek such an interview because the occupants, presumably deliberately, had not raised the matter with them.</P>
    <P>To whom should Mr. Mallon have given the report?  Was he not being responsible and conscientious in the way he handled this matter by presenting it to the Taoiseach and the Minister?  Apparently the view was that since the matter had not been raised directly with the Garda there was hesitation about calling on the occupants of the house.  In evidence of this it was suggested that the occupants, when approached by the investigating Garda inspector made it clear that they were not expecting that approach and he was asked who had sent him, why he was investigating this matter and so on.  The facts are that the Garda officer rang in the morning, asked to come, was told he could come and when he came after tea he met Mr. Moyna who <Col N="890" /> asked him who he was and who had sent him.  That was all.  That was a very reasonable thing to ask given the fact that other people had been there before.  He was entitled to be a little surprised when the Garda inspector arrived on 12 January when the report had been made on 16 November.  Would you not be surprised if a Garda inspector came at that stage? The whole story was given to the Garda at that time.</P>
    <P>Then we go on to other statements dealing with the technical assessment of the matter.  On the last page it says that &ldquo;a Garda report about the matter had not been sent to the Taoiseach before the matter was raised this week-end by a newspaper&rdquo;.  On 12 January, Detective Inspector Hawkshaw rang Mrs. Moyna to ask if he could come out to their home. She suggested he wait until after 7 p.m. when her husband would be home.  This was the day after the report had been given to the Taoiseach.  Is this not very significant?  Why not call before the report was given to the Taoiseach?  Was this a proper way to serve the Taoiseach? The Taoiseach has said in the Official Report of 21 February 1984, Volume 348, column 288 that when the Garda report was received in the Department of Justice:</P>
    <P>... it was immediately sent to me because I was about to meet Séamus Mallon but after that, as a result of an evaluation by the Minister for Justice, it was suggested to the Garda that there could be no real objection to their seeking an interview with the occupants and that it would be better to do so.</P>
    <P>This was a strange time to say that there was no objection to their seeking an interview with the occupants.  It was surprising that it was left until the day after the report had been given back to the Taoiseach, which was 12 January.  The coincidence of those two dates is quite remarkable &mdash; the 11th January, the day on which the report was given to the Taoiseach by the Minister for Justice, and from the Taoiseach it goes to Séamus Mallon.  Then on 12 January the Garda called to the home of the Moynas to <Col N="891" /> collect the equipment and also to carry out an investigation.  Why did the Minister for Justice wait until the Posts and Telegraphs reports had been given to Séamus Mallon before sending the Garda to the Moyna home?  Surely Séamus Mallon could have been expected not to accept the Posts and Telegraphs reports when the Garda had not even called to collect the equipment?  Was it not a case of the Minister for Justice hoping that the matter would rest at that?  It was obvious that the Taoiseach recognised from his statement, as contained in the Official Report of 21 February, 1984 at column 286, the discrepancy between the Minister for Justice's report of 11 January and the original Moyna statement given to him by Séamus Mallon on 16 November which clearly mentioned the existence of the microphone and transmitter.  Surely it was obvious to the Taoiseach at that stage that there was a glaring omission in that report.  Had he looked at the date he would have seen that the Posts and Telegraphs officials had called before he had passed on that document.  It is obvious that the Taoiseach and the Minister either knew that there were clear indications of a cover-up attempt or they were themselves involved in it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement suggests that once Séamus Mallon received the Posts and Telegraphs reports he was satisfied and did not wish to pursue the matter any further.  Clearly this was not the case.  Séamus Mallon rightly regarded the investigation by the Posts and Telegraphs official as being largely irrelevant since it had been conducted on 8 and 9 November before the Moyna report had been given to the Taoiseach on 16 November, before the Taoiseach had promised Mr. Mallon a full Garda investigation and long before the Garda called to the Moyna home on 12 January to investigate the alleged bugging and take away the listening devices which were kept there for them.  I find it very difficult to believe that the Taoiseach was not aware of the representations being made by Séamus Mallon to get a full report of the investigation which he knew to be in progress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> My information on the events is as follows: on 12 January the detective inspector investigating the case called to the Moyna home to get their verbal account of the events and to collect the microphone and transmitter.  On 1 February Séamus Mallon told his direct Foreign Affairs contact that he wanted answers concerning the promised investigation by the Garda of the planting of the listening devices.  This is his direct and immediate line to the Taoiseach.  He expects that his increasing concern and annoyance at the long delay in getting an answer will be conveyed immediately to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice. Naturally he would expect that because that is the reason such a contact is provided &mdash; for immediate and direct contact.  So immediate and direct is this contact in normal terms that the Taoiseach refers to it from time to time as he having received something from Mr. Mallon, or having given something to Mr. Mallon, which in effect is given to the contact who gives it to Mr. Mallon or is received through the contact from Mr. Mallon.  There are a number of errors in that respect which are natural errors in some of the comments that have been made by the Taoiseach and in some of the statements that have been made.  But in effect it is through this direct contact that this is done.  That was 1 February that Mr. Mallon protests that he wants answers concerning the promised investigation.</P>
    <P>On 2 February Moyna's nephew, Donal, is arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act in circumstances which on the information available so far raise questions of a most serious nature.  On 4 February Moyna's nephew is charged under the same Act with an alleged offence.  On 7 February Séamus Mallon tells his official contact that he is still demanding to know what is being done about the investigation by the Garda into the bugging incident.  This is a second instance of Mr. Mallon making his position very clear, that he largely regarded the Posts and Telegraphs report as prior to the items and the Moyna report being handed over and that he was waiting to have the matter cleared up.  He <Col N="893" /> stresses that this is his wish notwithstanding the alleged charge being pursued against Moyna's nephew in a totally unrelated matter.  He believes that his concern is again relayed to the Taoiseach in the normal way as a matter of urgency and priority because that is the normal way any of those contacts are handled and that is the reason for having that arrangement.  At that stage he was becoming particularly frustrated with his attempts to have the matter closed off, concluded and put away, however it was to be put away.</P>
    <P>Then on 19 February the Mallon affair was reported in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> having allegedly been leaked by a &ldquo;confidant&rdquo; of the Taoiseach.  Was this a &ldquo;deep throat&rdquo; or a concerned civil servant?  The Taoiseach claims in the Official Report of 21 February at column 291 that up to that date he did not know that the Garda had made further inquiries after 11 January and that a report of these inquiries existed.  I emphasise: the Taoiseach did not know at that late stage that a further investigation had been carried out after 11 January and that a report of these inquiries existed.  The Taoiseach claims also in the Official Report of 21 February at column 293 that Séamus Mallon:</P>
    <P>...accepted what was in the report</P>
    <P>&mdash; that is, the Posts and Telegraphs report &mdash;</P>
    <P>and that the earlier suggestion</P>
    <P>&mdash; of the existence of a microphone and transmitter&mdash;</P>
    <P>must have been without foundation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach continued to say:</P>
    <P>I presumed if he</P>
    <P>&mdash; that is, Séamus Mallon &mdash;</P>
    <P>felt the earlier suggestion was valid, despite what was said in the report, he would take up the matter further with me.</P>
    <P>It appears that the Taoiseach had in mind that Mr. Mallon might be taking up the matter further with him because, of course, the Taoiseach would have known very clearly from the report he had on his <Col N="894" /> file and desk that these two major items, the microphone and transmitter, were clearly spelled out in the report.</P>
    <P>Again, in a further reference to this central issue the Taoiseach said in the Official Report of 21 February, at column 298:</P>
    <P>... at no stage did Séamus Mallon suggest to me that the original allegation made was substantial or that he was dissatisfied with that report which, on the face of it, showed no evidence of any microphone or transmitter.</P>
    <P>But Séamus Mallon understood that he had taken up the matter further with the Taoiseach via his Foreign Affairs contact. Is the Taoiseach saying that he was not informed of these further representations? Was the Taoiseach not aware of the Garda activity taking place?  Did the Minister for Justice not inform his Taoiseach of these events?  Are we witnessing a saga of incredible incompetence and carelessness on the part of our Taoiseach and Minister for Justice, or is this something more sinister and even more disturbing? That is a question Members of this House must face.</P>
    <P>The next point at which the Taoiseach's approach is highly questionable is when he issued his early morning statement on the Sunday.  His Press Secretary, Mr. Peter Prendergast, apparently informed the Taoiseach that the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> article was coming.  His Press Secretary was always sensitive to the impact of the media.  In my view he panicked and got the Taoiseach to prepare a rebuttal by way of a statement of the facts.  This would appear to have been a cardinal error for two main reasons.</P>
    <P>First by so doing the Taoiseach exposed to the nation the fact that his Minister for Justice had allegedly not bothered to inform him of the visit of the Special Branch to Moyna's home and of the fact that they were in possession of the listening devices.  If the Taoiseach's statement is true, then his Justice Minister was either grossly incompetent or he was involved in a cover-up in concealing this important evidence even from his Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach later said that he was unaware &mdash; this was the Official <Col N="895" /> Report dated 21 February 1984, col. 291 &mdash; that listening devices had been obtained, and that the Moyna report had been correct.  His Minister for Justice can hardly have been so unaware of these facts since on his suggestion the gardaí collected the listening devices and interviewed the occupants of the house &mdash; I refer to the Official Report 21 February 1984, col. 288.  Is it any wonder that the Minister for Justice has been so silent, refusing to be interviewed?</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Taoiseach's decision to open his statement on Sunday 19 February with a reference to a private and confidential request from Séamus Mallon, Deputy Leader of the SDLP &mdash; I quote from <i>The Irish Times,</i> 20 February &mdash; that &ldquo;the application of sections of the Offences Against the State Act that precludes someone convicted under the Act from being in State employment, be lifted in respect of a person (Mr. Moyna's nephew, Donal) who had been convicted of an offence in connection with the British Embassy riot&rdquo;.  This was a clear and very obvious attempt to smear in public the Moyna family and, by implication, Séamus Mallon himself.  This attempted smear was successful in the short term.  I know the community in which the Moyna family live: in fact, they live not very far from me.  I know them to be a very honourable and peace-loving family and I know the impact it has had on them. When someone tries to suggest it has not had this effect, I will bring them to the scene and let them see the effect this smear campaign has had in the short term.</P>
    <P>Is it possible that the Taoiseach inspired such a smear campaign?  If he did not inspire it, then who has the Taoiseach on a string?  Whose grip on the Taoiseach is so strong that he can be enticed to conspire to destroy the reputations of two decent and upright citizens whose only apparent crime was to provide a safe refuge for a man in constant danger of assassination because of his strong defence of constitutional politics? This first statement, apparently made at the request of the Government Press Secretary, represented the worst kind of <Col N="896" /> character assassination in which a Government can be involved.  Séamus Mallon has sought an apology from the Taoiseach.  He deserves at least that.  The Taoiseach betrayed a confidence for shallow political expediency.  Who would now be foolish enough to entrust a confidence to this man?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice showed no respect for the Deputy Leader of the SDLP, or for those who provided him with hospitality and a safe house.  This was a strange contradiction in standards for a man who only a year earlier purported to be so highly sensitive to the tapping of the phones of two journalists. Séamus Mallon asked that the matter be investigated in a secure and confidential way.  For his co-operation he was treated with contempt.  He did not seek publicity or attempt to jeopardise the State's security. Contrast Mallon's statesmanship with the Minister for Justice who just a year previously did not hesitate to destroy the careers and reputations of two senior Garda officers for petty political advantage.  He has now further damaged the morale and reputation of our Garda force, a force of which we can be justly proud, by leaving this cloud of uncertainty caused by his obvious lack of direction in this most serious bugging incident.</P>
    <P>Following receipt of the Moyna report in mid-November, why did the Minister not immediately order the investigation of the bugging incident?  Was it because he already knew all the answers?  Why has the Moyna house to this day not been &ldquo;swept&rdquo; for listening devices?  Does the Minister not consider the Deputy Leader of the SDLP to be worthy of his personal attention?  Had he so little regard for Séamus Mallon's intelligence that he thought he could be fobbed-off with a facile report?  Was he too busy persecuting a hapless member of the force who had already been found innocent by the courts in connection with a car crash in Kerry?  What are this Minister's priorities? The Mallon affair should have been at the top of his list.  Are we now to assume that anybody who makes the Minister uncomfortable or disagrees with <Col N="897" /> his views will run the risk of having his family and friends suffer from the vindictiveness of the Government?</P>
    <P>Did the Minister for Justice authorise the tapping of the Moynas' telephone? Has this tap now been removed?  Can the Minister give me a categorical assurance that my home telephone is not tapped? I demand to know the answer because I also receive communications from &ldquo;deep throats&rdquo; who are concerned at strange happenings in the Minister's bailiwick.  Is it true that having failed to get the information he wanted on Séamus Mallon, the Minister authorised or turned a blind eye to an attempt to plant a listening device under the breakfast table where Séamus Mallon dined?</P>
    <P>This whole saga of the Mallon affair has done much to undermine confidence in the ability of the Government to handle security.  The story being put about now is that this bugging was done by some maverick group within the specialised branches without the prior knowledge of the Minister.  If this was the case, then who is in control of security?  If this was so, then why did the Minister not immediately, thoroughly and conclusively investigate the matter and report, with appropriate assurances, to Séamus Mallon?  All Séamus Mallon wanted was to have the matter investigated and have the appropriate assurances given.  If the Taoiseach and the Minister had done this in the first instance when they were asked to, then we would not be discussing it this evening and nobody would know of it.</P>
    <P>If it was the Provisional IRA, why did he not immediately investigate and provide security for Séamus Mallon and the Moynas?  But then would the Provos be in a position to cut off the phone, fix the fault, supply all the Posts and Telegraph equipment involved, synchronise the arrival of the three men and a Posts and Telegraphs-type van?  This is hardly likely.</P>
    <P>The most likely explanation, given all the information at our disposal, is that Moyna's phone was tapped and this failed to yield the information desired by the Taoiseach and his Minister for Justice.  It was then decided to install a listening device in the House and this job was bungled mainly because of the meticulous <Col N="898" /> nature of the houseowner.  The attempted cover-up failed.  The attempted smear failed because of the honesty and forthrightness of Séamus Mallon, and his decency and concern for the Moyna family.  To his these good people were not expendable.  It would have been far easier for him to withdraw and protect his own character from the smear but this was not his nature.  He stood by his hosts.  With such a man you can surely sit down to talk with confidence of a new Ireland and know that your trust will be respected.</P>
    <P>No matter who was involved, the Government stand condemned for their incompetent and vindictive handling of the affair.  The only recourse now is to salvage public confidence and the confidence of this House through an independent judicial inquiry as suggested in our motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I oppose this motion. Nevertheless I welcome the opportunity to deal with the various points that have arisen in one way or another.  It also gives me the opportunity to deal with jibes that I have taken refuge in silence.  As for my silence, I know there are people who do not like to let facts interfere with the free flow of their imagination but nevertheless I propose to recount some facts.</P>
      <P>The matter we are referring to &mdash; the bugging or the attempted bugging of a house&mdash;was first published in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> on 19 February.  On that day a statement was issued by the Taoiseach concerning the complaint that had been made to him about it.  One day later, on 20 February, in association with the Garda Síochána, I issued through the GIS a long statement about it.  I find it difficult to understand how it could be suggested in the face of that statement that I was silent on the matter.</P>
      <P>The day after that, the Leader of the Opposition decided to table a Private Notice Question to the Taoiseach and to direct a number of supplementary questions to the Taoiseach.  I assume it is not suggested that it was either necessary or appropriate for me to try to intervene in those exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> On the following day, Deputy Woods tabled a Private Notice Question to me. It was ruled out of order.  The issue of my speaking in the House did not arise on that occasion.  At the same time, if not before that, it became clear that I would be called on to speak this week in a debate of the kind we are now having.  I am speaking at the earliest possible moment in this debate.  I strongly believe, and I say this without intending to be in any way acrimonious, that Deputy Woods knew perfectly well his Private Notice Question was blatantly out of order and had no prospect whatsoever of being accepted since it could not possibly be regarded as urgent.  I believe the question was put down as a Private Notice Question for the express purpose of getting some political mileage out of a claim that the Opposition were not being allowed to raise matters, and that we the Government side, and I in particular, were running away from them.</P>
    <P>I should like to begin by clarifying some points raised in public.  The most important clarification from my point of view concerns certain interpretations put on comments made by the Taoiseach in his statement in the House about the reaction of Mr. and Mrs. Moyna to the approach made to them by the Garda. As might be expected, what the Taoiseach said in that respect was based on material supplied to him by me, so I have a special interest in clearing up those points.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that the reaction of Mr. and Mrs. Moyna to the approach to them by the Garda was one of surprise. That has been publicly misinterpreted as an allegation that their reaction to the Garda approach was hostile.  I genuinely do not know how anybody could think that a reaction as being one of surprise was intended to convey that it was a hostile reaction.  Even if the word had been ambiguous, which it was not, the context also made it clear that that was not what was intended.</P>
    <P>The point being made was that the Garda Síochána had been hesitant to interview the two Moynas because they felt that the Moynas might not have <Col N="900" /> intended that the Garda should be brought into the matter and, as it turned out, it appeared that was not an unreasonable feeling for the Garda to have had&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we have some copies of the Minister's speech?  Apparently the Press Gallery have been given copies but Members of the House, particularly Members of the Opposition, have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am speaking from notes and script.  The question of hostility did not arise in any way in the Taoiseach's comment.  Similarly, and in the same context, the point was made in the Taoiseach's statement that while the status of Séamus Mallon was well recognised he is not the occupant of the House and that what the Garda had to take into account primarily was the attitude of the occupants.  This has been construed publicly as meaning that whereas Mr. Mallon is a man of honour, Mr. and Mrs. Moyna are to be taken as people of a different type in the eyes of the Garda Síochána &mdash; most emphatically not so.</P>
      <P>If the words themselves leave any room for any doubt, which I very strongly deny, the context makes it clear that no such meaning was intended.  The meaning is straightforward and, I believe, quite clear.  At the time this statement was made Mr. Mallon already had made certain comments that left no doubt that at all relevant times he had wanted the Garda investigation.  The point being made in the Taoiseach's statement was that although Mr. Mallon is a senior member of the SDLP and a public figure, his wishes in this matter would not necessarily have been the determining factor because it was the Moynas, not Mr. Mallon, who had the right to have the determining voice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seemed to the Garda, rightly or wrongly, that the Moynas had reservations about involving the Garda Síochána.  I repeat that that did not mean that they were hostile or in any way unco-operative.  They were neither.  If they had been under the impression &mdash; I <Col N="901" /> do not know if they had been &mdash; that that was intended, I very much regret it was so.  As far as I and the Garda are concerned, no issue of any kind that could be defined as antagonism had arisen as between the Garda on the one hand and Mr. Mallon and Mr. and Mrs. Moyna on the other.  There may have been some misunderstandings but that is a very different matter.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the second main point that I am anxious to make by way of clarification.  There has been much talk about the sophistication or lack of it of the equipment used and the effectiveness of it as installed and about the skill or amateurishness displayed in the matter of the wiring and so on.  The impression has been created that the Garda are engaged in some way in making a case which it is in their interest to make and which they are determined to defend at all costs, and that ranged against them are Mr. and Mrs. Moyna with the backing of an admixture of people.  We have had Deputy Woods seeming to act as if he and the Garda were acting in competition in the collection of evidence.  We have had statements that the transmitter found was one that transmitted on the Garda frequency, a point that, though not of much importance, admittedly might be of some interest if it had been right.  I am assured that it is not right.</P>
    <P>I should like to try to put this matter back on the rails.  The Garda are not setting themselves up against Mr. and Mrs. Moyna.  They have no vested interest, nor of course have the Government, in putting forward anything but the truth, in so far as we know it, about the equipment, about the manner of its installation or any other aspect of it.  It is an easily verifiable fact that the technical advice from within the Garda was and is that this was an unsophisticated device.  That, too, is the view of competent people from outside the force who have studied the matter.  For very good reasons, the Garda view has been that that device as installed was not effective to transmit normal conversations in the room in which the microphone was.  They carried out several tests to check it in conditions materially similar to those in which it was <Col N="902" /> reported to have been found.  On both points the Garda reported the facts as they had found and evaluated them.  If they had found that the device was highly sophisticated and effective there is no reason whatsoever why they would not have said so.  Furthermore, if it was now to be shown that because, for instance, of some information given to them that was either incorrect or misunderstood, any of their conclusions was mistaken, there is no reason whatsoever why they should not change their evaluation.  They are not selling a product or a theory, but as of now they have no basis for changing.</P>
    <P>For the same reason it is quite misleading to suggest that the Government or the Taoiseach claimed or maintained this or that about the equipment.  We have stated the position as it was given to us. We have published that information because it helps people to form a conclusion as to what the whole thing may have been about.  If the information had been any different we would also have published it.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the manner of the wiring.  In the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 27 February, it is stated that photographs taken by Mr. Moyna overstate the crudeness of the manner of wiring and that the photographs relate to wiring not as found by him but as temporarily replaced by him. I do not know if this is so, but if it is, well and good &mdash; it may modify a little the impression that has been given.  The photographs were understood by the Garda to have been given to them precisely to show the kind of work that had been done, but I do not think much hinges on any difference because Mr. Moyna himself put strong emphasis on the very bad workmanship that was displayed.</P>
    <P>The point about all this is that the evidence appears to point strongly towards a conclusion that the job was done in the full knowledge that it would be discovered very quickly.  It is but a short step from that to the conclusion that it may well have been put there for the specific purpose of being discovered though there is, in theory at least, the possibility that it was put there in the belief that it could pick up such conversations <Col N="903" /> as might take place in a short period after its installation on the basis that the foreseeable subsequent discovery of the equipment was irrelevant.  But that raises questions of how it could be thought that such conversations were likely to take place in the short period before detection.  One way or the other, the evidence was put forward on a neutral factual basis to help towards an understanding of what is involved, not in an effort to paint a particular picture.</P>
    <P>I repeat with all the emphasis that I can that the Garda Síochána have no interest whatsoever in putting forward any particular theory, or in adhering to any particular theory if new facts emerge to invalidate any views that have been put forward.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the matter of the siting of the microphone.  Deputy Woods, without apparently realising that what he was saying would do damage to another of his theories, announced that it was three inches up the wall &mdash; but then retracted.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Likewise, it seems that his expert witness was not quite as supportive of his views as he had expected.  The latest suggestion about the microphone in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> is that it was between an upturned end of the carpet and the wall.  I have seen Mr. Moyna's written statements. It will not be in dispute that he stated clearly more than once that the microphone was under the carpet.  The Garda assessment of the ineffectiveness of the device as installed was based on what they had been told.  I do not know if the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> report means that Mr. Moyna now believes that he was mistaken in what he said.  If that is the position, fair enough.  The Gardaí will take that into account and see how it may affect their view of the episode as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to the question of the lapse of time between the handing over of the <Col N="904" /> complaint to me by the Taoiseach on 18 November and the interviewing of the Moynas on 12 January.  In the joint statement issued by my Department and the Garda Síochána on Monday of last week, it was said that the Garda decided to seek that interview only just shortly before it took place.  On the following day, in his statement the Taoiseach amplified that by saying that as a result of an evaluation by me it was suggested to the Garda at that stage that they should arrange such an interview.  I note that the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> commentary by Mr. Vincent Browne looks on those two statements as contradictory and asks &ldquo;Which is it?&rdquo;.  The answer is &ldquo;Both&rdquo;.  There is no contradiction. The decision to interview was made by the Garda.  The suggestion that such an interview should be sought was made on my behalf by my Department.</P>
    <P>I cannot refrain at this point from observing that when Mr. Browne noted that I decided to convey that response to the Garda Síochána, a response that he earlier suggested that the Taoiseach should have conveyed, he proceeded to question the right of the Minister for Justice to give, as he puts it, directives as to the way in which the Garda should carry out their investigations.  Heads he wins, tails I lose.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the suggestion that the two Moynas should be interviewed was made at that point on my behalf to the Garda Síochána and on receiving information to that effect the Garda arranged to interview the Moynas.  Within the last 48 hours, however, I have learned that the explanation given in the joint statement as to why the Garda had not done this earlier does not do full justice to the perspective of at least some of those involved on the Garda side.  I think it is right to clear it up.  The written complaint received by the Taoiseach was handed by an officer of my Department to a Garda officer.  There was discussion about the need to carry out the inquiries in a discreet way and specifically of the need to keep the information in a very small circle, so as to avoid the danger of leaks. But the thrust of the discussion was interpreted on the Garda side as meaning also that inquiries would be confined to P and <Col N="905" /> T officials unless the Garda then got confirmation that interviewing the Moynas would not involve any breach of confidence or any understanding that might have been reached between the Taoiseach and Mr. Mallon, or anything of that kind.</P>
    <P>That interpretation corresponded with an underlying Garda perspective that they were approached in this matter in an unorthodox way, with the result that they apparently felt unsure about what exactly they were expected to do and were concerned that they might be acting in a way that was unwanted by the complainants. The result was that for a significant part of the period before the interviews with Mr. and Mrs. Moyna, action was effectively held up because of this misunderstanding. It is relevant to note that it was a time of extreme pressure because of a variety of other events.  However, that stage ended when, as a result of an inquiry from the Taoiseach, an immediate written report was sought on 12 January and the fact that the two Moynas had not been interviewed was noted in my Department when the documents were read.</P>
    <P>I am giving this explanation.  I do not wish in any way to evade or blur my responsibility as Minister in the matter. As Minister, I received the complaint and undertook to have it looked into.  I have to accept, and do readily accept, that for the reasons I have outlined an unfortunate delay arose.  I have given the explanation because an explanation is called for, in view of developments.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the specific terms of the motion.  This day week, the Leader of the Opposition, by means of a Private Notice Question to the Taoiseach, began the call in this House for a judicial inquiry to investigate the circumstances of the bugging, or attempted bugging, of the house where Mr. Mallon stayed from time to time.  The Leader of the Opposition knows as well as anybody in this House &mdash; and better than most &mdash; that the idea that such an inquiry could do anything to find the culprits would not bear examination. I do not propose to delay the House by raising issues about the principles involved in the setting up of an <Col N="906" /> inquiry to deal with something that might later have to be determined by a court. It is unnecessary to raise such issues because the proposal fails on the practical level.  It would not work.</P>
    <P>An inquiry could not secure an admission from the culprit unless the culprit were before it in the first place.  Who is to identify the culprit in order to bring him, her or them before the tribunal? The Garda Síochána are not in a position to do so.  Even if they were able to identify someone as having been involved, their duty would be to submit a report to the DPP with a view to seeing whether there were grounds for criminal prosecution. If a situation were to arise where the Garda Síochána had information identifying those responsible, or narrowing the range of identifiable suspects to manageable proportions and if it became clear that no prosecution could be taken and if it then appeared that a tribunal could be set up to conduct an investigation that would not infringe on the basic rights of those involved &mdash; three very big &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;&mdash; the matter could, no doubt, be looked at again.  But as matters stand, the setting up of such a tribunal would mean that we would have a tribunal solemnly sitting to ascertain culpability with no evidence available to it on which it could do so.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition suggested that the tribunal could work in association with the Garda Síochána.  So, indeed, it could &mdash; but to what purpose, since the Garda cannot identify any particular individual?  That suggestion, therefore, is devoid of substance &mdash; and I suggest it is clearly known to be so. Why then is this demand made by people who must know that the tribunal they are seeking could not have any prospect of success?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to set Deputy Burke's mind at ease I will not be taking half an hour.  I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add after &ldquo;Kilbarrack&rdquo;, the following words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and other such incidences of telephone tapping or electronic eavesdropping which may be drawn to its attention; and to examine whether existing legislation offers sufficient protection to citizens against unwarranted intrusions into their privacy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to broaden the scope of the inquiry proposed in the motion.  Despite what the Minister says about the amendment I feel that in an inquiry which is looking into the question of phone tapping or bugging it is only reasonable to expect that they would take into account the present legal position for the protection of citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The apparent attempt to bug the house in Kilbarrick used by the Deputy Leader of the SDLP, Mr. Séamus Mallon, is a matter of serious concern.  We have had the spokesperson from the Fianna Fáil Party and the Minister for Justice repeating <Col N="910" /> word for word the allegations and counter allegations that have been made in this whole controversy but it has not yet been clarified precisely what went on on the particular day when the attempted bugging took place.  It appears to us that none of the parties involved in this controversy have been entirely convincing in their explanations and that the only way to clear the web of allegation and counter allegation is by the establishment of a judicial inquiry.</P>
    <P>While the allegation in this case is one of concern, there have been other allegations of a similar nature made in recent years.  We believe it would be a better use of public finance, and also give the Government an opportunity to fulfil one of their election promises, that any inquiry which takes place will not be limited to the Kilbarrick case but should conduct a comprehensive investigation into all similar allegations made in recent years, particularly the bugging of the phones of a number of journalists during 1982.</P>
    <P>Many serious allegations have been made concerning activities of this nature, the illegal tapping of phones, the bugging of individuals and the abuses of the system by the tapping of telephones under warrant from the Minister for Justice. Indeed, in January last year there were a number of leaks from sources associated with the former Minister for Justice which suggested that the phones of The Workers' Party offices in Gardiner Place were being tapped and had been tapped during the terms of office of the two previous Coalition Governments.  If our phones have been tapped it represents a serious attack on our democratic rights and a greater abuse of power on the part of the authorities.</P>
    <P>When I tabled a number of questions to the Minister for Justice last year asking him to repeat the assurance given by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, in 1970 &mdash; an assurance which was repeated on two subsequent occasions &mdash; that no phones of any TDs were being tapped, the Minister declined to give any such assurance.  The failure of the Minister to do so can be reasonably interpreted as an admission that the phones of some TDs <Col N="911" /> may in fact be tapped.  If this is so it is a matter of serious concern, as serious, if not more so, than the allegations about the Mallon affair, and should be investigated by any judicial inquiry which the Dáil decides to establish.</P>
    <P>The disclosure last year that the phones of two journalists, Miss Geraldine Kennedy and Mr. Bruce Arnold, had been tapped is also a matter of serious concern. It is an intolerable state of affairs that journalists phones can be tapped because the Government of the day do not like their stories.  The circumstances in which warrants were issued by a Minister for Justice authorising this tapping have never been adequately investigated or explained and many questions still remain unanswered about that particular incident.  It is, of course, necessary to remind the House at this stage that the inquiry which we have been promised into allegations of political interference with the Garda has not yet been held.</P>
    <P>The Joint Fine Gael-Labour Programme for Government contained a specific pledge that there would be such an inquiry.  The programme said that the inquiry would cover:</P>
    <P>allegations of political interference with the gardaí, with terms of reference covering the past three years, and a remit to recommend any necessary action to ensure that such interference cannot take place in future.</P>
    <P>This undertaking was repeated by the Minister for Justice in January last year when a series of disclosures led to the resignation of the two most senior Garda officers in the force.  The plan for a judicial inquiry was supported at that time by Fianna Fáil.  However, since then no action has been taken by the Coalition Government on this matter.</P>
    <P>The allegations of political interference in the affairs of the Garda going back over a number of years are far too serious to be allowed to sink into the sea of the Government's broken promises which we have at the present time.  The credibility and authority of the Garda has been damaged and will be damaged permanently unless there is a comprehensive and <Col N="912" /> impartial inquiry into all of the allegations that have been made in recent years.  It is my belief that the Garda would welcome such an inquiry.  If the Government are not prepared to honour the commitment given in their election programme I believe they are stoking up the very great degree of apathy and cynicism which exists among the electorate concerning the possibility of a political solution to the many problems which face us.</P>
    <P>One important element which has largely escaped attention in this controversy is the fact that even if those who placed the bugging device in the Moyna household are detected it is very doubtful if they could be charged with any criminal offence.  While under the Postal and Telecommunications Act, which came into effect in January this year, it is now illegal to tap phones without a warrant, there is no law against planting a bugging device of the nature involved in this case. There is now an urgent need to introduce a Bill for the protection of privacy which would protect citizens against unwarranted electronic eavesdropping from any source.  I feel this should be coupled with a Freedom of Information Bill which would guarantee all citizens reasonable access to files concerning them held by Government Departments, State agencies or commercial bodies.</P>
    <P>These are the matters which a judicial inquiry could reasonably be expected to cover and should be looking at.  Anything else will be of little lasting value to the citizens of this State.  I urge the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party to support the amendment which The Workers' Party are putting before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Before making my main points, it would be remiss of me if I did not mention the statement the Minister made to the House and say that he has treated the House with nothing but contempt. He made no effort to answer the many points raised both inside and outside the House since this matter was first published in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> last Sunday week.  He made no effort whatsoever to answer the question of his own failure to act on the complaint over a period of two months.  On the contrary, in his contribution <Col N="913" /> the Minister has raised more questions and has confirmed the need for a public sworn inquiry which we call for to be set up by the House.</P>
      <P>In defence of his silence over the last two weeks, the Minister said if he had had an opportunity he would have come into the House.  I ask the House to contrast that with his ability, sense of urgency and positive ambition to go out to the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; studios roughly this time last year when he was trying to spitefully destroy the organisation of which I am privileged to be a member.  His silence during the last ten days compares very badly with his efforts in the spiteful campaign he carried on at that time.</P>
      <P>In his contribution the Minister referred to the difference in the technical nature of the equipment found in the Moyna household and raised questions which should be properly answered by a sworn public inquiry.  He raised questions with regard to the theory of the rough workmanship and whether the device was intended to be found.  He refused to answer questions about the time lapse or why it took two days for such a serious matter to be brought to the attention of the Taoiseach.  Why did the Minister when he was asked to carry out his duty by the Taoiseach fail so miserably to do so?  He spoke about keeping the inquiry in a nice tight circle and about misunderstandings in the Garda force.  I thought this was merely an incidence of totally inept handling by the Minister and the Taoiseach but the more I listened to the Minister and the Taoiseach and to the serious questions asked in the media in the last ten days, which he did not answer, the more I wondered if there is not something more sinister than just the Minister's recognised and proven inefficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did the Minister not act from 18 November until 12 January and only then on the basis of a further query from the Taoiseach?  The Minister made no effort to defend his position or explain it.  We are entitled to an explanation as to why, as Minister for Justice entrusted with the Department of Justice, he made no effort to follow up a serious complaint that was made.  The Minister asks who is to identify <Col N="914" /> the culprit.  If the Garda cannot identify anyone, which the Minister said, why have suggestions been made regarding the Provisional IRA and why did the Minister make spiteful comments regarding taking the word of the Garda against the Provos?  The Minister cannot identify who the culprits are at this stage but he is still prepared to carry on in his usual form of being an expert on smears.</P>
    <P>The primary responsibility of the Minister and of the Government of any nation is to provide for the security of its citizens.  Security in this sense does not just mean security of borders and seas but, more importantly, security which would allow citizens to go about their daily lives without fear of intrusion by criminal elements in their homes or places of business and the mental security provided by the knowledge that they will not be spied upon in their homes by telephone tapping or other electrical bugging equipment, audio or visual.  A citizens' right to protection must be matched by his meeting his responsibilities to the State in the sense that he is not a threat to the State.  Only to that extent has the State the right to eavesdrop on citizens' conversations.</P>
    <P>In the case before us tonight, neither the Minister nor the Government have performed their most basic duty to the Moyna family and Séamus Mallon.  The Minister and the Taoiseach have been guilty of at least tardiness and carelessness, as mentioned in the editorial of <i>The Irish Times</i> of 22 February.  They are guilty at the very minimum of failure to follow up the matter in the appropriate manner.  Unfortunately, from a national point of view, the Taoiseach has been guilty of vindictiveness in his treatment of the Moyna family.  I remind the House of the timescale of the incident we are debating and why we feel nothing short of a tribunal of inquiry is necessary.  As we heard from Deputy Woods in his carefully prepared and argued contribution tonight, the Taoiseach on 16 November was given two documents by Séamus Mallon.  They were given to an official of a Government Department.  Two days later &mdash; I ask why this official took two days to handle such a serious matter &mdash;<Col N="915" /> the Taoiseach asked the Minister to investigate the matter.  When did the Minister ask the Garda to investigate the bugging?  How long was it from the time it arrived in the Department to the time the Garda were asked to act?</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked by the Taoiseach on 18 November to investigate this matter but he did not take any further action until 11 January when the Taoiseach gave Séamus Mallon two flimsy P &amp; T reports from two Post Office officials who had investigated the bugging. Then they said this was a satisfactory reply to a complaint made on 16 November by the Deputy Leader of the SDLP. Following 11 January, Garda inquiries really only began and are still continuing. Why did it need the Minister to tell the Garda to call to the Moynas?  As a layman I assume that if the Garda get a request from the Taoiseach, through the Minister for Justice, from the Deputy Leader of the constitutional Nationalist party of Northern Ireland that at least the Garda would interview the persons concerned. However, that was not the case.  The Minister's excuse here was that this was to be kept in a nice, tight circle but it is not acceptable that it takes practically a ministerial directive to the Garda to do this.  I do not want to attack the Garda. Indeed I say it as a defence of the Garda from the type of political interference that evidently exists.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, while these investigations are continuing the Taoiseach feels it appropriate &mdash; in a totally irresponsible way &mdash; to hurl innuendoes at Michael and Marjorie Moyna, even suggesting that they were hostile to the Garda inspector who visited them and, as stated in the editorial of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 26 February, that there was a clear connection between them and one of the vilest form of subversive activity, the construction of bombs.  No words would better describe the Taoiseach's approach than those used by the editorial in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> as follows:</P>
    <P>...that the Taoiseach should so cheaply and meanly vilify these people for the sole purpose of lessening the <Col N="916" /> embarrassment this incident has caused him is a testimony to the extent to which he can debase himself while still presuming to have almost a monopoly of righteousness.</P>
    <P>Throughout all this sad and sorry performance, the Minister for Justice has remained uncharacteristically silent.  I should like to address a few questions to him and I hope that during the course of the debate somebody else will answer them as the Minister has not answered any questions.  When the Taoiseach issued an instruction to have the matter investigated, why did the Minister for Justice not report back to him until nearly two months had elapsed?  This delay would be unacceptable in the case of an ordinary citizen.  However, when the complaint is made by the Deputy Leader of the constitutional Nationalist party of Northern Ireland, a party which is engaged in the great national effort of the Forum and where the individual concerned, Mr. Séamus Mallon, played such a key role and whom the Taoiseach meets on a weekly basis, the Minister's performance borders on national sabotage and I use the phrase advisedly.</P>
    <P>Recently I had the privilege of representing the Members of our Parliament as one of a delegation to London under the auspices of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  I met many fellow parliamentarians from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords.  We also met the Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, and the Northern Ireland Secretary, Mr. James Prior.  Incidentally, like other members of the delegation, I was depressed by the low level of interest in or knowledge of Irish affairs and the lack of a sense of urgency of the need for a speedy solution to our national tragedy which was claimed 2,500 lives.  However, any interest shown in Ireland was in the outcome of the Forum and any action by the Government which would damage the credibility of the Forum is to be abhorred.  There was a dereliction of duty by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice in not following up this matter and it has damaged our national image and that of the Forum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> If the Minister signed a telephone tapping warrant for the Moyna household either before or since 11 November it should be clarified by the tribunal.  I would not normally raise such a question in the House but the Minister set the precedent regarding warrants about this time last year, or slightly earlier, when, for political expediency, he spoke on the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme regarding warrants.  An answer as to whether the Minister did or did not sign it would remove the aura of suspicion in the public mind with regard to Garda involvement in this unfortunate matter.  Since their foundation, the Garda have served the people and successive Governments loyally and honourably.  I confidently believe they will continue to do so but it is the Minister's duty, as political head of the Department of Justice, to ensure that the Garda are given the manpower, resources and equipment to carry out their task.  For the Minister to make the spiteful suggestion that in some way we were casting aspersions on the Garda and accepting the word of the Provos is even below the level of the Minister's form of political attack.</P>

      <P>Because of the contradictory expert opinion with regard to the bugging equipment as to whether it is crude, efficient or effective, does the Minister not consider that this matter should be properly investigated by a separate tribunal similar to that which we have suggested?  We are going through a very difficult time economically and socially.  Over 200,000 people are unemployed, many are school leavers from second level colleges and there are also unemployed graduates.  The response of the institutions of State to the predicament facing our people is subject to critical examination of a type to which they have never before been subjected.  There is a depressing level of cynicism with regard to the ability of the State to respond to the crisis which we are facing. It is incumbent on any Government not only to be just, correct and even-handed in the performance of their duty but also <Col N="918" /> to be seen to be so.  Our party feel strongly that the Government have failed, either through ineptitude or vindictiveness, to meet the criteria in their handling of the matter before us.  In order to restore confidence in the institutions of the State, it is vital that the Government should agree to the establishment of this tribunal.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party tabled an amendment to our proposal and I see much merit in the section which asks for the inquiry to examine whether existing legislation offers sufficient protection to citizens against unwarranted intrusion into their privacy.  Such an examination is timely when one considers the advances in technology that have taken place in recent years.  Our legislation which authorises the Minister to sign a warrant for phone tapping was drafted at a time of less technical advancement.  It is appropriate that the rights of our citizens should be protected by legislation in such areas as micro-bugging of homes, a very important matter.  My understanding of the technical advances is that bugging equipment is now so small and sophisticated that it can be implanted with no great difficulty.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch díot as ucht an am a thabhairt dom chun an cheist seo a phlé maidir leis na dea-crachtaí atá faoi láthair ag Smailcbhia Teoranta i monarcha Stáit tionscail Údarás na Gaeltachta ar na Doire Beaga i mo dháilcheantar féir.  Le déanaí cuireadh na hoibrithe ar thrí lá sa tseachtain in áit cúig lá sa tseachtain mar ba ghnáth dóibh a bheith ó bunaíodh an mhonarcha seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ag dul ar ais go dtí 1974 thug Aire na Gaeltachta an ama sin cead do Ghaeltarra Éireann tacaíocht a thabhairt chun an tionscal seo a bhunú agus ní raibh ag an am sin ach mionlach na scaireanna a bhí ag Gaeltarra Éireann.  Ó am go ham nuair a bhí deacrachtaí ag an gcomhlacht <Col N="919" /> seo, chuir Aire na Gaeltachta agus Gaeltarra Éireann nó Údarás na Gaeltachta airgead isteach sa chomhlacht sin go dtí gur tháinig an t-am nuair a bhí tuairim is 100 faoin gcéad de na scaireanna ag Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Glacaim gur tuairim is 95 faoin gcéad de na scaireanna atá ag Údarás na Gaeltachta anois. Os rud é go bhfuil an méid sin scaireanna acu &mdash; 95 faoin gcéad &mdash; glacaim gur ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus ag Aire na Gaeltachta atá an dualgas chun fadhbanna na monarchan seo a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios ag Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ag Aire na Gaeltachta, an Teachta O'Toole, go bhfuil a lán fadhbanna agus deacrachtaí maidir leis an chomhlacht seo.  An deacracht is mó atá acu ná na fiacha atá ag an gcomhlacht seo a ghlanadh. Thuig mise roimh dheireadh na bliana go mbeadh an tAire ag dul chuig an Rialtas chun cead a fháil níos mó airgid a thabhairt don chomhlacht seo chun na fiacha seo a ghlanadh agus an comhlacht seo a chur ar bhunús nua.  Tá díomá orm, a Cheann Comhairle, nár tharla rud ar bith go dtí seo &mdash; faoi mar is eol dom ná ag duine ar bith sa cheantar sin &mdash; maidir leis an rud a thuig mise, go raibh an tAire ag dul chuig an Rialtas chun fordheontas a fháil chun cuidiú leis an mhonarcha seo agus chun cuidiú leis na hoibrithe.  Shíl mé freisin go raibh rationalisation study déanta agus ceapaim de réir an staidéir sin go bhfuil sé cruthaithe go bhfuil áit don chomhlacht seo agus gur féidir na jobanna atá ansin a shábháil agus b'fhéidir níos mó jobanna a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>The function of Údarás na Gaeltachta is to create jobs in the Gaeltacht and this industry is based on a raw material which is available in County Donegal and the Six Counties.  We should ensure that a factory such as this is a viable proposition. It is the only factory in the industrial estate which has raw material readily available.  The packaging material is manufactured in the factory next door. The expertise should be available and the only problem appears to concern market research and development.  Donegal farmers should be encouraged to grow the type of potato which is necessary for <Col N="920" /> the product.  However, farmers are being discouraged from doing so because of the uncertainty surrounding the factory's future.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for me to establish the exact number of jobs involved since some of the employees are full-time and others are part-time or temporary.  I understand that about 100 people are employed directly while others are employed in auxiliary industries.  Europlas manufacture the packaging material and jobs could be at risk there too.  A rationalisation programme was prepared and this should be with the Minister for consideration. Based on this he will make his case to the Government.  I would point out to him that this is the only factory on the estate which has raw material available in the county and province.  Some of the money which is owed is due to the Revenue Commissioners and it would be poor economics if the Minister for Finance did not give the Minister for the Gaeltacht the necessary funds to ensure the maintenance of jobs in this factory. I believe the industry could be expanded and the number of jobs increased.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that some of the unfounded allegations in relation to Údarás na Gaeltachta and companies within the Údarás may have contributed to the difficulties of this factory and of several other factories under the umbrella of Údarás na Gaeltachta.  It is unfortunate that the Member who made the allegations here is not taking the opportunity tonight to make a short statement of regret in regard to his allegations which have now been proved, as a result of the report of the Director of Public Prosecutions, to have no basis.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that financial assistance should be forthcoming to save these 100 jobs and to help create further employment in my constituency which has the highest rate of unemployment in the country.  Figures show that west Donegal has an unemployment rate which is three times higher that the national average. These points should be borne in mind by the Government when deciding on the future of this factory.</P>
    <P>Market research and development would seem to be a problem, as there is <Col N="921" /> a drop in the market at present despite the fact that this product, this Sam Spuds product, can compete with any other product of its type in this country or on the Continent.  It is based on a natural, national and renewable resource.  That cannot be repeated too often.  In adition, in this factory there is some of the most modern machinery in the world.  I hope the Minister will ensure that this money is made available as quickly as possible. The fact that the factory is now on a three-day week could be its death knell. I appeal to the Minister to make the necessary finance available.  No doubt my two colleagues with whom I am sharing my time will fully support my plea on behalf of the workers in this factory.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, i dtús báire ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil sé ar intinn agam cupla nóiméad a chaitheamh ag labhairt ar an ábhar seo mar tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an Teachta eile as Tír Chonaill ina chónaí sa cheantar agus go mba mhaith leis cúpla focal nó b'fhéidir níos mó a rá.  Ba mhaith liom, ar dtús, tacaíocht a thabhairt don méid atá ráite ag Pádraig Ó Gallchóir anseo. Tugadh le fios dúinn i mí Mheán Fómhair &mdash; an triúr Teachtaí as Dún na nGall &mdash; go raibh deacrachtaí ag an am sin ag na hoibrithe sa chomhlacht seo.  On ráiteas atá agam anseo &mdash; foilsithe ag an Aire ar 13 Deireadh Fómhair &mdash; tá na deacrachtaí seo ag Údarás na Gaeltachta ó 1981 agus is amhlaidh nach bhfuil réiteach déanta orthu ag an am seo.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil comhlachtaí eile ar fud na tíre, agus b'fhéidir nár cheart é a rá, ach nuair a chuireann tú an méid airgid a bhíonn de dhíth orthu, cuir i gcás i CIE nó ceann ar bith mar sin &mdash; i gcom-paráid leis an méid atá Smailcbhia ag iarraidh i láthair na huaire, is fíor-bheagán é.  Níl na cuntais foilsithe don bhliain seo go fóill, ach sa bhliain 1982 bhí siad ag déanamh brabaigh.  Is é an rud is tábhachtaí ar fad ná go bhfuilimid ag caint faoi jobanna do idir 88 agus 100 daoine agus ba mhór an trua nach ndéanfadh an Rialtas gach iarracht iad sin a shábháil.  Tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire &mdash; más féidir ar chor ar bith é &mdash; an t-airgead atá de dhíth ar an chomhlacht <Col N="922" /> seo a chur ar fáil chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí ar an dtaobh eile a thug deis dom cúpla focal a rá ar an ábhar seo, mar sílim go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach.  Tá an mhonarcha seo suite ar estát tionscail Gaoth Dóbhair i mo pharóiste féin i nDún na nGall.  Inné thug mé cuairt ar an estát agus cuireadh in iúl dom go bhfuil breis agus 1,700 duine fostaithe ar an estát san Ghaeltacht sin. Mar a dúirt na Teachtaí ar an dtaobh eile tá beagnach 100 de na daoine sin fostaithe i monarcha Smailcbhia nó Irish Snack Foods.  Dá mba rud é go dtarlódh aon rud chuirfeadh sé isteach go mór ar chúrsaí dífhostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht ansin.  Dá gcailleodh an oiread sin daoine a bpostanna bheadh beagnach 15 faoin gcéad de na daoine atá ag obair ar an eastát gan obair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar a dúirt Teachtaí ar an dtaobh eile, tá siad ar thrí lá sa tseachtain anois agus tá mé féin agus na Teachtaí eile ag plé leis an cheist seo le cúpla mí.  De réir mar a thuigim tá iarratas istigh ag Údarás na Gaeltachta i láthair na huaire &mdash; sílim gur cuireadh ar aghaidh é chuig an Rialtas i mí na Nollag &mdash; ar bhreis airgid fá choinne an mhonarcha seo a choinneáil ar siúl.  Tá súil agam nuair a thiocfaidh sé roimh an Aire agus roimh an Rialtas go gcuimhneoidh siad ar an méid is fiú an fhostaíocht atá curtha ar fáil ansin agus an dochar mór a dhéanfadh sé don Ghaeltacht dá dtarlódh aon rud a chuireadh deireadh le fostaíocht.  Chomh fada agus is eol dom, ghlac Udarás na Gaeltachta nó Gaeltarra Eireann a bhí ann roimhe seo ceannas an tionscail seo orthu féin i 1979.  Chaill an tionscal airgead go leor roimh 1979, mar i litir a fuair mé féin ón iar-príomhfheidhmeannach a bhí ar Údarás na Gaeltachta i mí na Samhna seo caite dúirt sé liom, an chuid is mó den airgead atá caillte ag an tionscal gur cailleadh é roimh 1979.  Dúirt sé chomh mhaith leis sin go ndearna siad proifid de bhreis is £100,000 i 1982 agus go raibh an mhonarcha ag déanamh proifide go dtí lár 1983 agus ó shin d'éirigh na deacrachtaí. Sílimse, mar a dúirt na Teachtaí ar an <Col N="923" /> dtaobh eile, go bhfuil an mhonarcha agus an tionscal seo bunaithe ar ábhar atá le fáil i dTír Chonaill &mdash; prátaí &mdash; agus ní amháin go bhfuil an tslí beatha atá ag na daoine sa mhonarcha i gceist, ach tá slí bheatha go leor feormeoirí agus daoine eile i dTír Chonaill i gceist.  Dá dtarlódh aon rud, ni hé amháin go gcuirfeadh sé isteach ar an Ghaeltacht ach chuirfeadh sé isteach ar an chontae go léir.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, tá mé cinnte nuair a thiocfaidh an cás roimh an Aire agus róimh an Rialtas go mbreathnóidh siad go fábharach air.  Leis an fhírinne a rá nuair a bhí an tAire i nGaoth Dobhair ag an deireadh seachtaine tá a fhios agam gur chas sé le cuid de na hoibrithe as an mhonarcha agus tá a fhios aige go díreach cad é mar atá an scéal ansin mar bhí cruinniú aige leis na hoibrithe an oíche sin.  Le bliain anuas thug an Rialtas agus an tUdaras tarrtháil ar thionscail eile san Ghaeltacht. Seachtain nó coicís ó shin chuir siad beagnach £100,000 ar fáil do mhonarchan Europlast ansin agus tá comh-oibriú mór idir Europlast agus an tionscal seo. Déanann an tionscal seo an tairgeadh agus cuireann Europlast na málaí ar fáil. Tá súil agam nuair a thiocfaidh an t-am go mbeidh airgead le fáil.  Mar a dúirt mé tá beagnach 100 post ansin agus faoi choinne 100 post a chur ar bun sa Ghaeltacht cosnóidh sé na milliúin punt.  Is é an rud atá le déanamh anseo ná na postanna atá ansin anois a chaomhnú agus chomh fada agus is eol dom is é an t-iarratas atá istigh ná timpeall £1 mhilliún. Is é sin £10,000 an post faoi choinne an mhonarcha a choinneáil ansin agus ligean dó dul ar aghaidh.  Ní féidir postanna úra a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht ná taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht inniu ar £10,000 nó b'fhéidir £20,000 ach an oiread.  Má chuirtear an t-airgead isteach sílim go mbeidh sé caite go maith mar coinneoidh sé monarcha agus fostaíocht sa cheantar sin.</P>

    <P>Ina theannta sin bhí caiteachas nach beag ar mhonarchana atá ar léas ag an gcomhlacht ón Údarás féin.</P>
    <P>Sa bhliain 1974 a thug Aire na Gaeltachta cead do Ghaeltarra Éireann cúnamh a thabhairt chun an tionscal a bhunú.  Ar ndóigh, ní raibh ach mionlach na scaireanna le bheith ag Gaeltarra ag an am seo.  Ina dhiaidh sin, áfach, nuair a bhí fadhbanna le réiteach, fuarthas cead ón Rialtas do chaiteachas breise ó thráth go chéile.</P>
    <P>Tá roinnt mhaith airgid de dhíth chun fiacha an chomhlachta a ghlanadh agus is gá dul ar ais go dtí an Rialtas chun an t-airgead sin a cheadú.  Nuair a bhíonn cás á chur faoi bhráid an Rialtais bíonn léargas chomh cruinn agus is féidir le tabhairt ar a bhfuil i ndán don tionscal: níl aon dul as sin i gcás Smailcbhia ó tharla nár baineadh amach spriocanna a cuireadh in iúl don Rialtas cheana.  Mar shampla, nuair a bhí cás Smailcbhia os comhair an Rialtais i mí an Mheithimh 1981 bhí brabach maith measta ach is caillteanas tubaisteach a tháinig amach i ndeireadh na bliana sin.</P>
    <P>Thug mé freagra mar seo a leanas anseo sa Dáil ar an 14 Nollaig seo caite ar Cheist ón Teachta Ó Gallchóir i dtaobh Smailcbhia Teo:</P>
    <P>Tuigim ó Údarás na Gaeltachta go bhfuil iarrachtaí ar siúl lena chinntiú go gcuirfear oiread agus is féidir de na poist sa mhonarcha sin ar bhonn slán ach, chun é sin a dhéanamh, go meastar nach mbeidh dul as ach scaoileadh le cuid den fhoireann.</P>
    <P>Níl ag éirí leis an gcomhlacht earraí a dhíol a choinneodh an fhoireann uile sa mhonarcha ar obair lánaimsire faoi láthair agus, ó tharla nach bhfuil aon <Col N="925" /> socrú déanta fós le scaoileadh le cuid acu, ní fheictear go bhfuil aon dul as ag an bpointe seo.  Is mar sin atá an scéal agus is ar mhaithe leis na daoine atá ag obair ansin atá socrú dá leithéid á chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar a luaigh mé, beidh airgead mór breise de dhíth chun an tionscal a thabhairt slán &mdash; fiú le foireann laghdaithe &mdash; agus beidh ormsa dul os comhair an Rialtais agus a léiriú go bhfuil eagar ceart ar an tionscal sula mbeidh aon seans go gceadófaí airgead mar sin.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé cheana tá droch bhail ar an gcomhlacht faoi láthair agus le go mbeadh deis ann réiteach a fháil ar an scéal seo beidh lán-chomhoibriú na n-oibrithe ag teastáil.  Muna bhfuil obair ann don fhoireann atá ann faoi láthair in iomlán caithfear roinnt dóibh a ligean ar siúl.  Is eatarthu féin atá sé á réiteach agus idir daoine eile atá ag plé na ceisteanna thuas ansin atá le réiteach cé ligfear chun siúl.  Ach i ndeireadh na dála is trí chomh-oibriú a réiteofar an rud seo agus is trí chomhoibriú a choinneofar an mhonarcha ar oscailt.  De réir sin, tá súil agam go mbeidh an fhoireann sásta an comhoibriú sin a thabhairt don chomhlacht i dtreo nach mbeidh an tionscal i mbaol.  Chomh fada agus a bhaineann liomsa ní bheidh aon mhoill an moladh a bhéas á dhéanamh agam a thabhairt os comhair an Rialtais nuair a bhéas chuile rud in a áit féin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá mar fhocal scoir <Col N="926" /> go raibh deacrachtaí ag an Údarás féin maidir le moltaí a thabhairt chomh fada liomsa.  Go deimhin tá deacrachtaí faoi leith acu go fóill maidir le moltaí faoi leith ach ar aon nós tá go leor agamsa anois le dul os comhair an Rialtais agus tá an talamh á réiteach faoi láthair leis sin a dhéanamh.  Idir an dálinn, ar fhaitíos go gcuirfí an mhonarcha i mbaol níos measa ná mar atá sí faoi láthair, mholfainn do na Teachtaí ón gceantar sin, más féidir leo, iarraidh ar na hoibrithe atá ansin a gcomhoibriú iomlán a thabhairt don bhainistíocht le go féidir an mhonarcha seo a thógáil as an mbaol in a bhfuil sé agus i ndeireadh an lae go n-osclófar é go lánaimseartha arís fiú amhán más an toradh a bhéas leis ná go mbeidh daoine ligthe ar siúl.  Is fearr é sin ná daoine a bheith ag obair gan aon obair dóibh mar ní sheasódh sé sin i bhfad go ndúnfaí an rud ar fad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have been deeply concerned about the human rights situation in the Philippines for some time. Ireland's Representative in the UN Commission on Human Rights expressed the Government's disquiet at last year's session of the Commission and called on the Philippine Government to take steps to improve the human rights situation in that country.  Later, on the Government's instructions our representative raised the issue with the Philippine Representative in Geneva.  The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, took up the matter of human rights violations with the Philippine Foreign Minister in March last year and I myself raised the issue during my meeting in New York in September with the Philippine Foreign Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Deputy's suggestions that Ireland sponsor a resolution on the situation in the Philippines, I should perhaps explain briefly the way in which the Human Rights Commission work.  The Commission has two different procedures for examining situations of violation of human rights.  The first of these is a confidential procedure in which it examines communications submitted to it which appear to reveal a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights.  Under this procedure, which is conducted in private, the Commission examines the allegations of human rights violations together with written observations, if any, of the Government of the State in which the violations are alleged to have occurred.  The Government concerned are invited to send a representative of the Commission who may make a <Col N="760" /> statement and reply to questions posed by the delegates.  The Commission then indicates by means of a resolution how it views the situation and, where appropriate, that it requires further action from the Government.  The details of proceedings and the terms of the Commission resolution remain confidential unless the Commission decides to refer the matter to the United Nations Economic and Social Council.  At the end of this procedure the chairman of the Commission announces in public session the countries in respect of which decisions have been taken.  The effectiveness of this procedure (including its confidentiality) in securing the co-operation of Governments and improvement of human rights situations is attested by the fact that in very few cases over the years has the Commission felt it necessary to decide to proceed to publication of its examination of a particular case.</P>
    <P>The second procedure is a public debate in which delegates express their concern at human rights violations anywhere in the world and submit resolutions for adoption of the Commission.  It is most unusual that a resolution is adopted, or even submitted, in respect of a country where a resolution has already been adopted in regard to that country under the confidential procedure described above.</P>
    <P>The Irish delegation at the Commission are fully aware that the human rights situation in the Philippines calls for consideration by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that because of the way in which the Human Rights Commission conducts its business, I cannot at the present time give any further details in relation to discussions under the confidential procedure.  However, he can be assured that the Irish delegation will use every appropriate occasion to express concern at the repeated reports of violations of human rights in the Philippines and to press for appropriate action by the Human Rights Commission.</P>

      <P>Under the Motor Vehicles (Registration of Importers) Act, 1968, fully built up motor vehicles may normally be permanently imported only by those registered firms which have been engaged in the assembly or importation of motor vehicles under a franchise or corresponding arrangement.  There is, however, special provision whereby persons transferring residence and/or business from abroad are allowed to import vehicles if certain, long-established criteria are satisfied. The Deputy can be assured that in the case in question these criteria were fully satisfied.  In this regard I would emphasise that an import authorisation on transfer of residence and/or business does not remit the excise duty and VAT payable on the vehicle or vehicles.  The levying of these charges and the valuation of motor vehicles for import purposes are solely the concern of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the reduction in the tax-Thefree allowances in the current year 1983-84 is due to the fact that since 26 July 1983 the tax-payer has been in receipt of a social welfare old age pension in addition to his retirement pension.  The practice in such cases is to allow the social welfare pension to be paid without deduction of tax and to recover any tax referable to that pension by reducing the PAYE tax-free allowances available for use against the retirement pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It now appears that the taxpayer will <Col N="773" /> not be liable to income tax for the year 1983-84 because his total income for the year will be below the relevant exemption limit.  An amended certificate of tax-free allowances to give effect to this exemption was issued recently and any tax deduction since 6 April last will be refunded by the Paymaster General.</P>

      <P>A hospital services card is documentary evidence, provided by a health board that a person is entitled to free hospital consultant services.  It is intended mainly for a person who has had some indication of the need for hospital services arising.</P>
      <P>The issue of such cards to all persons affected by the Health Services (No. 3) Regulations, 1983, would require a considerable administrative effort by health boards.  Most of this effort would be wasted because very few of these cards would actually be needed.  Any person affected by the regulations who may need hospital services should apply to his or her local health board office and a hospital services card will be issued without delay.  If such a person is referred for hospital services without having received a hospital services card, his entitlement to free hospital services is not affected and can be established by the hospital at the time of receipt of services.</P>

The provision for such expenses in 1984 has been reduced to the extent of the estimated savings arising from the decision to re-assess the eligibility for medical cards of persons between the ages of 16 and 25 years who are dependants of persons who do not qualify for medical cards.</P>
      <P>The overall savings resulting from implementation of this decision are estimated at £2 million for 1984 of which about £300,000 might be associated with the Southern Health Board area.  As mentioned, however, the benefits have been reflected in the provision under subhead G.3 of the Health Estimate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 438 and 439 together.  It is not possible, without a detailed study of the relevant records, to separate students from non-students in the category of persons aged 16 to 25 years who held medical cards on 31 December 1983 or in the sub-category of these persons who were affected by the Health Services (No. 3) Regulations, 1983.  The effort and cost of such a study would not be justified by the expected results.  Reliable estimates of the number of non-students involved or of the possible savings to the Exchequer by the application of the regulations to these persons are not therefore available.  It is likely that the great majority of the persons affected by the regulations are students.</P>

      <P>The person concerned whose husband died on 17 November 1983 has been awarded a widow's non-contributory pension at the weekly rate of £69.40, with effect from 30 December 1983.  This is the rate applicable to a widow under 66 years who has three qualified children and whose means have been assessed as nil.  Her husband had been in receipt of old age non-contributory pension of £82.55 per week which included an increase in respect of his wife and three qualified children and she was paid this pension for six weeks after his death, in place of widow's pension.</P>
      <P>A widow's pension book with orders payable from 30 December 1983 has been sent to the designated post office for collection by the claimant and she has been notified accordingly.  It was necessary before the pension could be awarded to investigate the means of the widow and this required a visit to her by a local officer of the Department.</P>

      <P>The means of the person concerned were assessed on the basis of his earnings from self-employment as a machinery contractor.  Following an <Col N="784" /> investigation of his case by a social welfare officer his claim to unemployment assistance was disallowed on the grounds that his means exceeded the statutory limit of £2,350.40 per annum from 24 August 1982, date of application.  He appealed against the assessment of his means but an appeals officer also decided that his means exceeded the statutory limit.</P>
      <P>On 24 November 1983 he applied to have his means reinvestigated.  Following reinvestigation a deciding officer assessed his means at £16.80 per week from 24 November 1983 entitling him to unemployment assistance at £11.20 per week being the maximum rate payable to him £28 less means £16.80.  He has appealed this assessment of his means and arrangements are being made to have his means determined by an appeals officer after which the rate of unemployment assistance payable to him will be reviewed.</P>
      <P>The arrears of unemployment assistance due to him from 24 November 1983 were recouped to his local health board as he was in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of his unemployment assistance claim.</P>

The re-assessment of means of smallholders under this provision commenced in May 1983 and the number whose unemployment assistance payments ceased following factual assessment between may 1983 and 1 February 1984 was three in the case of Macroom employment office and 38 in the case of Newmarket employment office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 527 and 528 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Deputies to the reply which I gave on 16 February 1984 to Deputy Fahey in response to a question on somewhat similar lines about a number of Garda stations in County Galway. In that reply I referred to the discussion that is going on within the Garda Síochána about the feasibility of further extending the system of rural policing which has been tried out successfully for <Col N="818" /> some time in two rural Garda districts. This has apparently given rise to a great deal of rumour and speculation about the closure or what is being referred to as the &ldquo;downgrading&rdquo; of a number of stations.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that no Garda station anywhere is being closed down and no decision has as yet been taken in regard to changes in the Garda strength or station opening times at any of the stations mentioned in these questions or indeed at any other station in either County Galway or County Roscommon. The feasibility of extending the new system of rural policing is being discussed in general terms &mdash; the counties of Galway and Roscommon are not being singled out for special attention.</P>
    <P>I think that it is regrettable that the new system of rural policing is being depicted by some people in a very negative way.  The fact is that the scheme is designed to improve the level of Garda service to the community and the Garda authorities, on the basis of the experience gained in the areas where it has been tried out, are satisfied that it achieves this.  The main feature of the new system, as I have explained before, is that the Garda personnel allocated to a group of small rural stations combine as a team to provide patrolling and other services for the whole area covered by these stations. It is intended that each such area will be provided with a Garda car.  Each small station in an area will have a garda permanently assigned to it and it will be served as well by other gardaí assigned to the area who will attend as required &mdash; for example, to open the station on days when the local garda has time-off, etc. This in fact is designed to provide for more regular opening of stations than is provided by the present system.</P>
    <P>The service to the public will be further improved by the provision of new communications facilities.  A radio-phone at every small station will enable the public to contact the Garda at times when the station is closed and as all gardaí on patrol will be in radio contact there should be a much more effective response to calls requesting Garda attention or assistance.</P>
