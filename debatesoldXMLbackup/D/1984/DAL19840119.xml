    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support the Bill and I should like to compliment the Minister for Justice, and the Government, for honouring a commitment given prior to the last general election in regard to this legislation.  There is an urgent need to update all legislation in this area.  The increase in the number of crimes committed in recent years is frightening.  In 1973, 38,000 crimes were reported and that number increased to 92,000 in 1982. There is a duty on us all to ensure that our laws are strengthened to assist the Garda in their fight against crime.  We must do everything possible to ensure that our citizens can walk the streets of our cities and towns without fear of assault.  We must examine the causes of crime.  A number of factors have contributed to this.  High unemployment among young people inevitably leads to an increase in crime but respect for <Col N="337" /> authority is breaking down.  That is regrettable and serious.  There is an obligation on us all, whether we are involved in political life or not, to do everything possible to help the Garda in their fight against crime.  We must work as a team to make it as difficult as possible for those who do not respect our laws or institutions to operate.</P>
      <P>The powers of the Garda should be strengthened in regard to crime prevention and detection.  Many people dwell on the rights of people detained for questioning or brought before our courts but we must also remember that those who have been victims of crimes have rights also.  We have a duty to protect them. We must tighten our laws to such a degree that they are protected.</P>
      <P>I welcome recent statements by the Minister on detention centres.  The provision of more suitable places of detention is very important because now people can be brought before courts, found guilty, sentenced to jail terms but very often go free immediately because there are no places in which to detain them.  Therefore, we need to increase the number of detention places.  We should also try to get people who have committed crimes to contribute to the community services provided by voluntary bodies. In that way they could be made to pay their debt to society.</P>
      <P>Another welcome change which the Bill provides is in regard to crimes committed by people on bail.  For far too long people on bail who went out and committed more crimes were treated too leniently by way of concurrent sentences. Very often people allowed out on bail in effect were given blank cheques to loot and plunder.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in regard to majority verdicts by juries.  Another change that was due was in regard to the right of people in detention to remain silent.  In such a case it is not unfair to infer that people who remain silent have some reason for their silence.  That change will strengthen the arm of the law when they are dealing with serious offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that we should examine the position in regard to persons who at some <Col N="338" /> stage in their lives had criminal convictions. Records of such convictions remain on their files for the rest of their lives. That is unfair because a crime could have been committed when the person was very young but it remains there as a black mark against him.  I know the case of a person who committed an assault when he was 16 years of age.  Many years later the record of his conviction prevented him from securing a job.</P>
    <P>In this debate we must address ourselves to the lack of uniformity in court decisions for similar offences.  I have been concerned about it for some time.  We can see tremendous differences in sentences handed down by district justices for similar crimes in different areas.  This should be rectified so that sentences in all District Court areas would fit the crime in all cases.  I appeal for an examination of this.</P>
    <P>We noticed the startling increase in our crime rate since the troubles in Northern Ireland began and the breakdown in law and order there.  That has spilled over into this State and has put tremendous pressure on our security forces.  The troubles in the North have had an awful effect on business life, tourism in particular, in the South.  It has affected our image among our partners in the EEC and in other parts of the world.  Everything possible should be done to ensure that those involved in the troubles north of the Border will not be allowed to roam freely throughout the length and breadth of the country, looting and plundering. In the last 12 months we have seen kidnappings and the murder of gardaí and members of the Army.  Concerned citizens here recognise those people for what they are and they condemn them.  They have brought disgrace to all of us, to all Irish people whether they live in England or in America.  They have done untold damage to our economy.  They have cost the taxpayers vast sums of money in order to try to secure the State against their activities.  They have deprived young people of jobs because of the money spent on security; the cost of maintaining law and order has deprived people of badly needed houses.</P>
    <P>In this context I regret the comments <Col N="339" /> of our Cardinal recently when he failed to recognise those people for what they are.  It is regrettable that anyone, North or South, should fail to condemn those people.  How can anyone say that a man who goes out to place a bomb or to shoot people can be right in any sense?  Those who support and protect those people, who feed them, South or North, are contributors to the violence they commit. Anybody who supports those organisations contributes directly or indirectly to the murder and maiming of people north and south of the Border.  I deplore that in the strongest possible way.</P>
    <P>We should compliment the Garda Síochána on their efforts in fighting crime and the apprehension of criminals.  We should also support them in every way possible.  I believe this Bill is a positive step in that regard.  We have heard quite a lot of talk recently about arming the Garda.  I would not like to see that happening. The longer the Garda remain unarmed the better for all of us.  While I recognise it is essential to have a certain number of the Garda Síochána armed I believe this should be left to the Special Task Force and if that needs to be strengthened so be it.  We were all very proud of the Garda in their efforts to secure the release of Mr. Tidey but it was with sadness we heard of the events in Claremorris and other places.  We can all learn from this.  I appeal to the Minister to have these matters examined in detail and to take whatever steps are necessary to prevent things like this happening again.  It can be demoralising for the Garda Síochána and it can also create confidence in those criminals that they can run free throughout the country and damage the whole image of the Garda Force.  Every possible step should be taken to ensure that things like this do not happen again.</P>
    <P>I note from the Minister's comments that this Bill will not come into force until a complaints procedure is set up within the Garda Síochána.  I welcome that.  It is vital that this complaints committee should consist of independent people.  I do not believe it would be in the best interests of democracy to have it made <Col N="340" /> up entirely of members of the Garda Síochána as we have in relation to other organisations.  If one has a complaint in relation to the legal profession it is usually investigated by the Incorporated Law Society or if one has a complaint against an accountant the matter is examined by the Chartered Accountants' Association. I do not consider that that is the best procedure.  We have all come up against situations in the past where some of the people practising in those professions failed to live up to their obligations.  I do not believe that a complaints committee made up entirely of members of the Garda Síochána is the best type of committee. It is vital that every citizen has total confidence in that complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to disciplinary action taken against members of the Garda Síochána and the time lag between the time the offence is committed and the time action is taken.  I know of one case where it took seven years between the time the complaint was made and the time action was taken.  This is very undesirable and is not good for the Garda Síochána.  I again compliment the Minister and the Government for introducing this Bill and it is my pleasure to welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Criminal Justice Bill because I feel if a poll was carried out throughout the country at the moment we would find that crime and the breakdown of law and order is one of the priorities of the people.  This is the case right across the country not alone in Dublin, Cork, Galway or any of the large towns throughout the country. People are distressed and worried.  That is the reason I am glad this Bill has come before the House and I am glad that it has been debated for such a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In country areas there is a problem where the small Garda stations were closed down some years ago and also where those stations are still open with only one or two gardaí on duty.  Those Garda stations are closed for very long periods, perhaps from 4 or 5 p.m. in the afternoon until 10 a.m. the following <Col N="341" /> morning.  This is not a good situation. People like to know that the garda is on duty and is close at hand, if possible, 24 hours a day.  If the garda lives in the community the people have a wonderful opportunity because a good relationship can be built up.  The Garda are given an opportunity to root out the people who break the law and they can find those people much easier when they live in the community.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the Garda Síochána are spending far too much time filling up forms and writing out reports which I believe they should not be doing. If they dictated those reports and they were typed by secretaries they would have an opportunity to do what they should be doing, go out among the people and speak to them.  Representations have been made to all Members of the House over the last few months by certain members of the legal profession, the Council for Civil Liberties and other organisations suggesting that this Bill is restricting the right to freedom, that we are going a little too far with the Bill, that we are almost becoming panic-stricken.  I suggest it is time that instead of being over-concerned with those people we should be more concerned with the people who respect the laws of the land, who do not break the law.  We should restore the balance of advantage to the law respecters and also to the Garda Síochána who do not have it at present.  We should spend less time speaking about the rights of people in detention and more on speaking about the rights of those who have never broken the law.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we had a particularly sad case recently of an elderly man whose wife died a short time ago.  At 3 a.m he heard some thugs kicking in his door.  He keeps a shotgun beside his bed because of the times that are in it.  He fired a few shots and the following day he reported the matter to the local gardaí. They told him that he had done a very serious thing and if he had hit one of these people he could have been charged with assault.  That is not good enough. We must have the right to defend our homes.  If one finds one's home being <Col N="342" /> ransacked what is one supposed to do? Does one communicate with the local gardaí or knock at the door and ask the intruders if they would now go away?  We must have the right to defend our property. Until such time as we do, this Bill will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Stolen cars are causing a major problem. There is also the problem of uninsured cars.  If we are to believe the statistics available the number of cars being driven without insurance is enormous.  If everyone paid insurance the premiums would be lower.  I am convinced that if a person drives a car without insurance and his passengers know that they are in an uninsured car they must accept the consequences of that if they meet with an accident.  We must not allow a situation to continue in which these people can reap financial benefit.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made already this morning of different penalties for the same crime.  Surely we could have a position where people would almost know the punishment for each crime before it was meted out to them.  When we see different penalties for the same crime in different parts of the country, people ask what is going on and begin to question the sincerity of some judges. Judges do a fine job but this kind of thing gives rise to doubts in the public mind about their sincerity.</P>
    <P>The right to silence should be changed. The Garda Síochána should be able to put an interpretation on that.  People will not answer questions and it makes life extremely difficult for the Garda.  People in detention can just sit back and laugh at the Garda.  They do not have to provide alibis or answer anything.  The Council for Civil Liberties, the legal profession and others have said that this is an unwarranted assault on the person's rights and interferes with the due process of law.  I do not accept that.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about police brutality. There are 11,000 members in the police force.  They are the pride of the people.  They are as fine a police force as one would find in the western world.  In a force of this size there are bound to be some people who are not suited to it. Perhaps we should be more careful in <Col N="343" /> screening applicants for the Garda Síochána.  The time spent in training gardaí should be extended.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of crimes committed by people while on bail.  It has been said that going out on bail is almost having a licence to do what one likes.  I am glad the Minister intends to change that.  There should be a mandatory sentence for crimes committed while on bail. It is time we became serious about this. Regarding minor crimes for which people are fined £1 or £10, is it not time such people were compelled to do community work such as brushing the streets?  If they were compelled to do community work and if it was known that it was because they had committed a crime no matter how trivial, that would be a more effective deterrent than charging them a nominal fine.</P>
    <P>It is time that the courts were seen to back up the Garda Síochána and not make life more difficult for them as is sometimes the case.  Many reasons have been given for the increase in the crime rate.  We have been told it is because of the recession and is a consequence of unemployment and so on.  I have yet to see any statistics which would indicate that where economies are booming and unemployment is dropping there is a consequent drop in crime.  People say if we had more housing and so on the problem would be solved.  That is whistling in the wind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan spoke here about a month ago about what family life was like 20 years ago.  Few have a better right to speak about that.  As parents we have all failed in our duty.  Do we always know where members of our family are in the early hours of the morning?  Do we know who they are with and what they are doing?  Perhaps we should have a greater interest in our children and be more involved with them.  Corporal punishment is no longer allowed in our schools but I suggest that the clip on the ear that some of us got when we were at primary and secondary schools did not do us any harm.  Our schools have failed, particularly in civics, in teaching respect for our Churches, our State, our institutions and the good things of this country.  All <Col N="344" /> of us have failed in this area because we have not given due respect to those institutions that have served us so well.  We have not shown an appreciation of what those bodies have done for us as a country. Perhaps radio and television have contributed to the lack of respect for our institutions, for elected representatives and so on.  We must teach our young children to show this respect.  It is time that the Garda Síochána visited all our schools to speak about crime and respect for the institutions of the State, building up a bond of friendship with the young people.  That would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>There is and has been some ambivalance at all levels with regard to crime and Deputy Naughten spoke about it just now in another context.  We are either for crime or against crime: we cannot have it both ways.  Our older people have the right to go to bed at night comforted in the knowledge that they will be protected by the Garda Síochána and the institutions of State.  We saw recently in a part of Dublin that older people were afraid to open their doors after 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening, where they had boarded up their windows and were living in absolute terror.  That is completely wrong and all of us must come together to do something about that situation.</P>
    <P>In my view the recipients of stolen property are the greatest criminals of all. There should be some provisions in this Bill to make life impossible for these people, to make it unprofitable for them to deal in stolen property.  If they were not there we would not have the many robberies that take place.  The recipients of stolen property make life very pleasant for the people who steal.  If we see people stealing or breaking the law and if we do nothing about it, we have not the right to speak about the breakdown of law and order.  By our silence we are condoning crime.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill and I am sure it will go through this House intact.  The Minister has made a determined effort to deal with this serious matter and I believe his stamp is on this Bill and will help considerably to eliminate crime in the years to come.</P>
    <Col N="345" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he introduced the Bill which indicated to all sides of the House that he was amenable to listening carefully to the views of various commentators and Members of the Oireachtas and that he would take a flexible approach to accepting amendments where they might seem desirable. Traditionally perhaps there has been too great an intransigence in this respect and when speaking in debates here one occasionally gets the view that it is a pointless exercise.  However, in view of the Minister's invitation and his welcome for honest, frank and open contributions in relation to this measure I hope that this debate will be meaningful.</P>
      <P>The debate has been quite comprehensive and a variety of views has been expressed.  Mainly they have fallen into two categories, both at opposite ends of the pole.  Essentially there has been the view that unless one accepts the Bill in total that somehow one is weak-willed about the problem of crime and on the other side there has been a view, which was expressed particularly by some of the organisations who traditionally have expressed concern in this area, that the Bill has been a major and brutal assault on the rights of the individual.  As is so often the case, the truth is probably somewhere between both extremes.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the Bill on two levels: first, with regard to its general tone and orientation and, secondly, with regard to the specific provisions.  With regard to the perception of the Bill as being a major and timely answer to the very serious problem of crime, those who have been superficial in their reading of it or who have simply read the headlines would interpret the Bill as presented as being a major step forward in relation to tackling crime.  However, that would not be the case.  The Bill is not directed towards achieving that end and, in fairness, the Minister and a number of speakers have not claimed that for it.  However, the public perception is that this Bill will be the body-blow to the trends in criminality in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> The principal five major changes proposed in the Bill deal with the problem of trying to ensure as absolutely as possible that convictions are secured where there has been already a detection, an apprehension, or at least a suspicion pointing specifically to one individual.  In other words, the problem deals with people already known to or in the custody of the Garda.  Therefore, the Bill answers the problem, if it is a problem, of increasing the numbers of people convicted. However, I submit it has nothing or very little to do with the problem of increasing the number of people detected or apprehended and that is the fundamental problem in relation to the general area of police work.  If there was a problem in relation to securing convictions in regard to those in custody or about whom the Garda already had reasonable doubts, then the Bill would meet that need.  All available evidence indicates that securing convictions is not of itself a problem and that the Garda have a very high rate of convictions, many secured in the normal way of good police work and some by voluntary confessions, or confessions of one kind or another.  The measures in the Bill, in a sense, miss the point if that is to deal effectively with the criminals who are loose in our society.  We cannot under-state that fact.  The Minister in his speech in the House and at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis dealt and has been dealing very effectively with the perception of the ordinary citizen that we have the highest rate of lawlessness and criminality at present rampant in our community.</P>
    <P>I do not know the pedigree of this Bill, but in view of the rapid pace of political change over the last number of years I suspect that this is the Bill which was, in whole or in part, promised by a succession of Ministers for Justice.  It may very well have been in some shape or form on the stocks for some considerable time, although in its present form it is obviously the work of the present Minister for Justice. It may be that the momentum set going four or five years ago may have carried the Bill into the office of the present Minister for Justice where, naturally enough, the Minister would assume that adequate time, debate, consideration <Col N="347" /> and consultation had already been given and that in those circumstances the Bill, largely as received, should be presented to the House.  I do not know if that is the case.  This Bill may very well be a completely new measure.  Certainly a Bill had been promised by a succession of Ministers for Justice and because of the references made in those promises as to its likely contents, I suspect that this is the Bill, in large measure, as promised to us. It may not necessarily be the immediate outcome in recent times of a process of deliberation and consideration relevant to the present problems and the present serious situation.  It may have taken five or six years to arrive, as is unfortunately too common in relation to some areas of legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a number of sections which are very welcome and timely.  However, I want to try, firstly, to establish that the overriding purpose of the Bill has to be seen to deal with those whom the Garda have in custody or are about to take into custody.  I am open to argument, but I see no evidence in the Bill that this measure will help the Garda to detect or apprehend one extra criminal.  The problem is not one of securing convictions, because approximately 90 per cent of those who appear before our courts at present are convicted.</P>
    <P>In the 1978 Garda Annual Report on Crime, of the numbers coming before the courts over 10,000 were convicted.  That figure was approximately the same in 1979; it dropped to 9,519 in 1980, in 1981 came to over 10,000 and fell just below that figure in 1982.  In all cases that figure represented a very high percentage of those actually charged.  The Garda are painstaking, in most part, in their work and do not lightly bring charges or take people into custody, so it is reasonable to assume that they will pursue a case to its successful conclusion.  There have been some anomalies standing in their way, one or two of which have been dealt with in the Bill, and I shall refer to these in a moment.</P>
    <P>By any reasonable standards, securing convictions is not a major difficulty or one about which the Garda Representative <Col N="348" /> Body or the Association of Inspectors and Sergeants have been vocal, to the best of my knowledge.  The accumulative effect of the measures will be to make it easier to deal with something which, if it is a problem, is certainly not a major one.  The detection and apprehension of those who commit crime in our community is the major problem in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill, but may not be the major problem in relation to crime in our community. Obviously, it again deals with an area of activity, as it were, subsequent to the event.  There are fundamental reasons why crime occurs in our community and we are not dealing with those in this Bill. Arguably we should, but perhaps it would be unreasonable to expect that.</P>
    <P>The reality now is that for most offences people are not apprehended or detected.  On average, anyone now committing a crime is more likely to get away with it than to be caught.  That might be a little unfair to the Garda, because many of the offences which are tabulated in the Garda report are, from the overall point of view, relatively minor by contrast with the serious crime area in which the Garda have a good record of apprehension. That does not mitigate the serious effects of the other types of crime, including those referred to in the Bill of larceny of vehicles, petty thefts, crimes against property, muggings and so on.  I am sure that the House will accept that as a representative of a constituency which can be said to be well qualified in the inner dealings of some of our criminal fraternity I can vouch for the fact that one gets the occasional insight which might not be available in some other areas.  Now more and more people do not bother to report crime because they feel it to be a waste of time and quite often are told that it is, particularly in relation to robbery of sums of money, the theft of handbags, breaking-in and larceny.  The Garda find themselves unable to stretch their force right across the whole area of those activities.</P>
    <P>In passing, we regularly introduce new legislation, year by year, without reference to the demands placed on the Garda by new Acts or regulations.  We automatically <Col N="349" /> expect that, somehow, they can be sufficiently elastic and their powers and perception sufficiently malleable and pliable to deal with any new challenge. That is not the case.  What the Garda do, logically and naturally as you or I would, is make an order of priorities.  They deal with what they consider to be serious crimes and, in most cases, deal with those efficiently and effectively.  The back wash is that the smaller type of crime is not dealt with in the way in which the Garda or this House would like.  It is inevitable in some cases that people would not continue to report these crimes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the major legal challenge in the area of crime, I have no doubt that this Bill, frankly and with respect to everybody involved, largely misses the point.  In fairness, it should be said that some of what has been expressed as being about to be achieved by this Bill has not been claimed for it, either by the Minister or by the Government. It was not being advanced as the answer to crime in our community. Therefore, when one says it may miss the point in relation to dealing with crime, it should be interpreted as meaning that other measures should be introduced to deal with that and that this Bill does not necessarily do so.</P>
    <P>In any debate on crime the problems of tackling the catchment areas of crime and of dealing with the interrelated, complex social and economic deprivation, which is the context from which crime invariably springs, have to be mentioned, even if people are tired of listening to it. There should be no short cuts through the law, no temporising and making it easier for the criminal in custody.  None of these things will deal with the problem in a fundamental way unless we come to grips with the enormous problems of areas which have a culture of crime and deal with them as if they were a regional problem.  I know it is very difficult in these economically lean times to talk in terms of investing in resources and education and so on, but crime is not a mystery. We can reasonably predict who are likely to be tomorrow's criminals.  That ability to predict should afford us assistance in trying to deal with the problems <Col N="350" /> in the areas from which these people come.  That is not to say that all crime belongs to a certain socio-economic class, although the preponderance of certain crimes has a clear profile and poses a challenge to us.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that we must have a rethink on present policing methods and improving efficiency.  I know that the Minister for Justice is very concerned about this matter and is very anxious to assist the Garda in every respect.  However, unless we can help the Garda to improve their ability to detect and apprehend, we will lose the battle.  The only ultimate answer to the problem is to ensure that anyone who is disposed to commit a crime will know with absolute, inexorable, inevitable certainty that they will be caught and dealt with.  If they believe they will not be caught they will commit crime, and that is what is happening at present.  On average a person has a 50-50 chance of getting away with it.  We must find out why we are unable to detect what is causing crime.  It may be because of the workload of the Garda and if that is the case, we should consider changing it.  Today's garda has to be an extraordinary person.  He is expected, on the one hand, to deal with the murdering thugs who were active recently and who behave without reference to any moral sense or values.  Apparently, he is meant to confront these people virtually with his hands in his pockets, a practice which I trust will cease.  The outcome of this is predictable as we have seen in the past. He is also expected to concern himself ostensibly with issues like dog licences and parking tickets.  If he is asked to continue working to this pattern he will end up doing neither job very well.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case to be made for looking at the workload of the Garda and removing work from them which is extraneous to their essential job of fighting crime, of guarding the peace, a literal interpretation of their name.  There are many agencies and authorities who are quite well equipped to deal with dog licences, parking tickets and other areas of activity in which the Garda are engaged at present.  The Garda will have to be given modern technology in their offices, <Col N="351" /> although the concept of a garda spending a third of his time typing his report with two fingers is fortunately beginning to fade due to the enlightened measures introduced in recent years, but it still lingers in some areas.  There is also the problem of gardaí having to spend long hours in courts waiting to deal with prosecutions, in some cases for matters as trivial as the proverbial light on the bicycle. There must be a review of the way their time and resources are used.  I suggest that it is possible to increase the available Garda strength by 30 per cent or 40 per cent by refining their work.  Of course the work will have to be done by somebody else, either by staff recruitment or by changes in the workloads or patterns of others.  The point is that gardaí should not be distracted or inhibited from dealing with the fundamental challenge of serious crime.</P>
    <P>The measures in the Bill, as has been outlined a number of times in this debate, basically involve five important and major changes.  In one or two cases this is long overdue.  It is years since I remember standing in this House asking that the nonsensical situation with regard to the laws on bail should be changed.  I heartily welcome the change in the Bill in that respect.  It is ironic that at present the best time from the point of view of receiving the least punishment is the period during which a defendant is on bail because of the concurrent sentencing policy of the courts and restrictions on sentencing in the District Court.  It is intriguing that somebody already charged with an offence gets the next best thing to a honeymoon during which they are at liberty to commit further crime in the knowledge that that crime will probably be taken into account.  That measure is dealt with effectively in the Bill and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>The question of consecutive sentencing, of making absconding while on bail a specific offence and of increasing the 12 month limit in the District Court are sensible measures and will finally put an end to the problems we have in relation to crime committed on bail.  There was always a problem in that regard but it was <Col N="352" /> very hard to quantify the type of problem because I cannot recall any convincing evidence being produced about the numbers involved.  Obviously, there were figures in the report of the Garda Commissioner which were referred to on occasion by people in authority.  They gave indications of figures which purported to relate to that area.  There was no finality about those figures and, to the best of my knowledge, they have not been authenticated.</P>
    <P>While those measures will deal with the problem there is one other measure that should receive the attention of those who have the responsibility of trying to ensure that the problem of crime being committed on bail is dealt with, that is the, on occasion, extraordinary length of time between the initial charge and the actual coming to trial of a defendant.  I am far from convinced that the length of time it takes at present is warranted in some cases.  I am not sure whether it is fair to say that the courts should work harder.  Perhaps they are busy on the administration of paper work associated with the background to trials.  But certainly, if there is to be an extended period allowed to a person on bail, for example, if the person is out of work, or may be of a criminal disposition already, obviously the temptation will be greater for that person anyway.  What I am maintaining is that the time lag involved should be the minimum possible.  Wherever improvements are needed to review that area to ensure that we get efficiency in that area then they should be effected.</P>
    <P>The problem relating to what is known as the right to silence is not clearcut.  The Bill will allow the criminal courts to draw an inference from the failure or refusal of an accused person to mention certain matters.  Unquestionably what that does mean, without any doubt, is that the right to silence will no longer exist as we have come to know it.  I do not know how serious a problem it is.  In discussions with individual gardaí, with bodies representing the Garda, or with individual lawyers, I am not aware, nor am I convinced, that this has been a major problem, that the problem of a defendant sitting there with his mouth shut has been, say, a major <Col N="353" /> obstacle against making progress against crime in our community.  It is to me, at the very least, peripheral from that point of view.</P>
    <P>However, in so far as it is presented in the Bill, in so far as it has been put forward in the past as a major area of controversy, then it is reasonable for us to deal with this problem though I do not honestly believe that the numbers of people involved would be great.  The principle is what we are talking about here.  If it affects one person in a way that none of us would want it to affect them, then we must confront it.  After all, we must ask ourselves: what is the right to silence?  It is the refusal of a person to answer a question.  First of all, nobody can force anybody to speak if he or she does not want to speak.  It is not so much a right as the exercise of a physical function, just simply not to answer a question. However, certainly I have a sympathy with those who would say that it seems very unjust that a person can sit there obdurately and say nothing.  Therefore, I suppose the right to silence has to be qualified to some extent by the obligation of the ordinary individual, all of us, towards the rights of the community.  It is arguable at least that there is no such thing as an absolute right to anything, that all rights are qualified by the responsibilities associated with them.  At least that is an argument.  Therefore, in this case it does not seem preposterous that a person should feel obliged to speak in the light of his responsibility to the community.</P>
    <P>This matter does raise some problems. First of all, the reality is that we may get people who are not that well equipped to speak up for themselves, who are simply inarticulate, illiterate, or who may, in the process of that dialogue, find themselves at a severe disadvantage.  In other words, it is not merely the speaking but the quality of the answer that may count whereas, relatively speaking, in the past, a silence would have rendered them at no disadvantage. Therefore, I would imagine that it would be important that a person might be able to seek or utilise legal help in that respect if they found themselves at that kind of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> The second factor that arises is that there may be perfectly good reasons, not relevant to the case, why the defendant may not wish to give an answer.  Usually I suppose the kind of central question would be: &ldquo;where were you on the night of ...&rdquo; There are a number of reasons a person might be unable or unwilling to answer that question.  I have tried this with a number of my own friends; I have asked them: where were they on the night of 5 January or 10 November last and most of them could not remember where they were; nor could I.  It could very well be that a person put in that position and fluffing it, or being indecisive &mdash; in the context of the adversary system we operate in our courts &mdash; could simply be put at a very severe disadvantage indeed.  If you like, they could find themselves in trouble, not because they were unwilling but because they are simply either unable with sufficient clarity or precision to answer the question.  The second factor is that the answer might be incriminating in some other respect &mdash; perhaps not legally or criminally incriminating &mdash; but might cause embarrassment, confusion or violate some other code operated by that person.  In some respects which I have in mind I would not be too worried about it.  But I can see how there would be circumstances in which it might simply be extremely awkward, in public court, to give an answer which would cause difficulty from the point of view either of one's local community, one's family or some association or body with which one was involved.</P>
    <P>I might make a suggestion to the Minister for consideration in this respect.  I put this forward tentatively and, I have to admit, with a basic repugnance at this right being violated at all.  Nevertheless, because of the obligation of the accused to the community, by and large, there should be an obligation on us, as citizens, to contribute to the well-being of our peers and the proper development of our society, there should be some contribution in that respect, some recognition of our role and our responsibilities.  If a person refuses to speak the inference will be drawn and, whatever about the theory of it &mdash; that that person should not and <Col N="355" /> would not be convicted on that alone &mdash; the reality is that that would be extremely damning.  By and large I have no doubt that, in the normal day-to-day routine of the courts there would be an inclination to deliver a judgement of guilty on a person who simply refuses to speak.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would suggest that the Minister might consider some form of amendment which would allow a person to give an answer either <i>in camera</i> or better still, to the judge alone; in other words, that he would be asked not to state the answer in open court if he did not want to.  Instead the right to silence would be respected in that regard, silence in so far as the matter would rest between the person answering the question and the judge.  After all, in the final analysis, subject to the jury of course, the judge has to give important directions to the jury and could take it into account in that regard.  If the judge then decided that the matter was of sufficient moment that it justified the continued silence of the defendant he could make that clear.  It is not an ideal solution but it seems to me to attempt to bridge the gap between the undeniable difficulty which exists in this respect, for some people at least, and that fundamental right which, up to now at least, has been cherished and respected.</P>
    <P>On the other hand the right to silence has rarely caused difficulty for the real criminal.  I was suggesting that a person who is truly guilty of a criminal offence will be so overridden, so burdened with concern about the integrity of his answers in the court, by and large, that he or she, instead of inventing a colourful alibi, will remain silent when that particular silence will be now invariably interpreted as inclining people towards the belief that he or she is guilty.  What I am saying is that the persons who will be caught on the hook of this difficulty will be people who will be conscientious, people who are concerned about things like perjury. I do not know how much of a concern that is in the courts any more, but I mean people who are taking the matter seriously. The true criminal, the person with whom we really want to deal, will not <Col N="356" /> hesitate to deal with this particular provision in his or her own inventive, imaginative way in the same way as much of his or her defence will be concocted.  It may result in us bearing down on a small number of people who, if not innocent, may be inclined to be innocent.  I suggest that we consider the type of amendment which would allow the person to go to the bench and say he wants to tell the judge privately one, two, three or four reasons why he does not want to discuss this matter in public.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to consider that suggestion.</P>
    <P>The altering of certain existing trial procedures particularly in relation to the notice of alibi, the abolition of unsworn statements and the majority verdicts by jury, are justifiable and reasonably timely.  I would, however, enter one or two caveats in relation particularly to the question of the alibi.  I have always found it nonsensical that in a court case all the cards were not put on the table.  The prosecution was left in a situation where he would not know until the last moment what was to be offered as a defence. However, it appears from the Bill that in this case the alibi will have to be provided prior to the conclusion of the preparation of the prosecution procedure.  We must bear in mind that we are talking about a person who, at that point, is innocent until proven guilty.  This is a principle none of us can tamper with.  People have a responsibility to contribute positively to the prevention of crime and clearing society of that evil and people have an obligation to come forward with the alibi so that it can be examined.  At the same time we have to insist that the other side have concluded their deliberations, in other words, responsive corrective measures would not be taken at that stage on the basis of the alibi.  If a time limit is put on notification of an alibi then strict time limits should also be placed on the prosecution in serving new evidence on the accused.  Otherwise we could have a cat and mouse game.</P>
    <P>The prosecutor sees his job as securing prosecutions.  The job of the prosecution is to ensure that the person before the courts is convicted if he is guilty.  He relies <Col N="357" /> on the adversary system to take care of the defence.  If an alibi was to be provided, and a time limit on the notification of the alibi, but there was no time limit on the serving of new evidence, we could have a situation where the approach of certain prosecutors could be that they will wait until they hear the alibi and seal it off at that stage.  That would be wrong and if it is a loophole, it should be closed. I have no qualms about the concept of a person stating clearly what is his alibi.  In my view that is reasonable because we all have an obligation to our peers in society. That obligation should not be disregarded by some kind of isolationist approach &mdash; I am here, I am innocent and I will do or say nothing until I am proven guilty.  That lack of co-operation is not satisfactory but we have to be careful how far we go in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>The abolition of unsworn statements is a positive measure which is to be welcomed. Certain people have taken issue with the majority verdict of juries.  They said if one or two people on a jury have doubts, that advances reasonable grounds for thinking that there is a reasonable doubt but I am not so sure about that.  It is next to impossible to get unanimity on anything, particularly in Ireland.  I have often come to the conclusion that we would not pull together to win a tug-o'-war match.  There is also the prospect of the opposite: for some reason one person might decide not to take into account all the evidence and weigh the balance.  Provided there is a very large majority I do not see this as being unreasonable. The only qualification I would make is that measures such as this should be reviewed after a certain period to see how they work.  Majority verdicts seem to operate in other jurisdictions.  In principle I have no objection to the idea of 11 or ten out of 12 people giving a verdict which would be final.  It seems far more reasonable to include a provision that if an overwhelming majority see the outcome as being one way, it is more likely to be that way than the view of the small minority.  I admit that any new measure taken in that regard is always fraught with difficulties and extraordinary cases <Col N="358" /> could arise which would need us to go back to the drawing board.  Again I ask that that be reviewed after a certain time.</P>
    <P>The powers of the Garda to detain suspects in certain circumstances have been misrepresented in some areas.  It must be borne in mind that we are talking about crimes which at present warrant very heavy sentences and we are talking about putting an upper limit on the period of detention.  It has been suggested, however, that this introduces a new concept&mdash;that people would be held for the purpose of interrogation.  I am not very sure about that.  If the Garda have a reasonable doubt or reason to assume that a person may be guilty they should be able to question him thoroughly.  Earlier I mentioned that one of the problems was detecting and apprehending.  This proposal might facilitate progress in this respect, but it is impossible to be certain about a measure like this.  Sometimes I envy people their certainty.  They know it is the right thing for the community or they know it is an enormous assault on civil liberties.  In this case there are eminent lawyers on all sides who disagree with this measure.  I am not totally enthusiastic about it, but I fail to find in it the extremes of assault on civil liberties which some people have found.  I have looked but they are not there as far as I can judge.  There may be a case for saying that this power of detention for questioning is wasteful and inefficient, and in some cases even oppressive.</P>
    <P>Under the British Prevention of Terrorism Act, 25 persons are detained for every one subsequently prosecuted for a terrorist offence.  While the Irish statistics are not immediately comparable or as precise, one gathered from a reply by the Minister for Justice to a parliamentary question in March that nine persons are arrested and detained under the Offences Against the State Act for every one charged with an offence.  It appears that a fair number of people are pulled in who are not effectively involved or about whom it is impossible to get conclusive evidence.  It could be argued that a more efficient method could be devised, but if it takes six, seven or eight questionings to yield one result of that nature, that <Col N="359" /> may be the price we have to pay.  No label should be attached to people who are questioned, assuming they are let go and not charged.  Naturally when suspicions are aroused it is hard to remove these tags and labels and this can come against people in various ways.</P>
    <P>The powers of detention contained in sections 3 to 8 of the Bill change the purposes of the arrest in some senses.  At present the person is charged and brought before the courts as soon as is reasonably possible.  A concept which is new and unknown to our law, and which has been rejected on occasions by our courts, is that of detention for the purpose of asking questions.  The only exceptions to the best of my knowledge are in section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and section 2 of the Emergency Powers Act, 1976. Experience with section 30 has been that only one in about every eight to ten people of the 3,000 detained per annum is actually charged.  That does not mean it is a totally wasteful exercise.</P>
    <P>I am not against a concept because it is new.  It may be necessary.  I am heartened by the unequivocal guarantees given by the Minister in relation to safeguards which he has promised.  Obviously it would have been much easier if specific references to those safeguards were included in the Bill.  In the wake of an unfortunate episode in the past relating to charges of Garda brutality the Justice Barra O Briain committee reported to this House and made certain recommendations which were ignored very largely.</P>
    <P>This Minister has been unequivocal and very assertive in stating very clearly that adequate safeguards will be introduced. I accept that.  From the point of view of making the Bill politically saleable it might have been helpful to have included some specific references in the Bill although one might argue that that might be extraneous to the central matter. The reality is that some of the concerns expressed by speakers with, I am sure, the very best will in the world towards the Minister and the Bill, might have been alleviated had those safeguards <Col N="360" /> been spelled out.  Unfortunately in recent years of political turmoil one cannot give guarantees about future actions.  No one knows how long anyone will be anywhere.  I expect this Minister will have the opportunity to introduce those measures.  I suggest, as I think he has suggested himself, that the Bill should not become law until those safeguards are introduced.</P>
    <P>In this debate we should refain from getting into the area of attacking the Bill as a cruel assault on civil liberties, which clearly it is not.  I would reject such a criticism.  In some cases the measures have been demanded unanimously by all sides of the House for many years.  Yet powers are ascribed to the Bill which it has not got and which those putting it forward do not claim for it.  If there is some concern about the Bill it has been expressed responsibly and with sensitivity, and a genuine view to ensuring that the problem most of us perceive as the fundamental problem, that is, the problem of crime in our community, is dealt with.</P>
    <P>Some of us have said the Bill may not do justice to that overriding concern.  I am satisfied that the Minister for Justice will ensure that what has been said here will be considered carefully.  I should like to compliment him publicly and in that I am echoing the view of people all round the country on his very successful Ministry to date.  I wish him well in the future. The comments I made have been put forward with a view to trying to effect improvements in the Bill, if possible.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the introduction in this House of measures which will deal very fundamentally and ruthlessly with the real problem.  If we can get to the stage of assisting the Garda by overhauling their working methods, giving them extra resources, ensuring that they are efficient and re-organised where necessary, and if many of the obvious failings in their present procedures are dealt with, we will be closer to dealing with the real problem.</P>
    <P>Sooner or later we must take a systematic view of the social and economic reasons for crime in our society, and deal with them.  Otherwise we will witness a <Col N="361" /> continuing problem of escalating crime, based on the problems of urbanisation where complex problems arise.  Perhaps our political system is not geared to deal with fundamental issues because it often temporises and is short term in its nature. Ultimately that is the answer, not to deal with the criminal, but to deal with the formative factors of criminality.  This Bill does not claim to do that, but some Bill should soon, before it overwhelms our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us attempts to tackle the crime problem in a one-sided fashion.  For that reason we put down an amendment suggesting that the Bill should not be given a Second Reading.  Unfortunately, that amendment has been ruled out of order.  However, the reasons for the amendment hold good.  The Bill attacks very seriously the civil liberties of the general public.</P>
      <P>It was introduced without any serious attempt to discuss the issues concerned with various bodies, other than the Garda, with a direct interest in the question of crime and the administration of justice.  It was introduced without the publication of a White Paper which would have enabled all sections of the public&mdash;the victims of crime, those who are only vaguely aware of crime, those involved in the detection of crime, the Garda, lawyers, the Judiciary and Members of the House&mdash;to discuss the broad issues involved in the whole question of crime.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to withdraw the Bill and rethink the approach to the whole question of crime.  The approach to this question can be judged by the Estimates recently published by the Government. The Estimate for the Department of Justice is almost £300 million.  Of that amount, £120,000 is allocated for education within the prison service.  Of that £300 million, £1 million is allocated for the probation service.  Those two elements are indicators of the approach to the question of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another statistic which is worth taking into account, particularly when one realises that the vast majority of people who come before our courts <Col N="362" /> are young people.  I understand that the amount spent on youth services is in the region of £1.6 million and this must be compared to the Estimate of £300 million for the Department of Justice.  This is an indication of the approach by the Government to the whole problem facing us.  I do not attempt in any way to deny the importance or the severity of that problem.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, there have been no in-depth studies of the causes of crime in Ireland.  We all have our own ideas, based on our experience in our constituencies, as to what these causes are and there are many learned people in the universities who have views on the matter. No Government agency has ever set out to study the causes of crime.  The views generally expressed and accepted are that most crime derives from deprivation of some form.  The Minister referred to that fact.  He also said that while the vast majority of people who are deprived do not become involved in crime, yet most crime derives from that sector of the community.  Clearly there must be other elements besides lack of economic strength which lead to crime.</P>
    <P>I have listened to a person who is involved with young people and also in the courts system expressing the view that in his experience of courts the vast majority of people appearing there are young, poorly educated, very inarticulate and generally from families which are dependent on social welfare.  That is not to say that everybody who is on social welfare or is in some way economically deprived is involved in crime.  Clearly this is not the case and only a very small proportion of such people would be involved.  However, the seeds are there in those conditions.</P>
    <P>We all have our own experience of crime and our own ideas about what leads to crime.  It is my view that there are families in every area who are at risk. These are families who suffer from some form of deprivation.  The parents may have failed to get adequate education or the young people involved in crime may be backward in some way.  The State services have failed to deal adequately with these problems.  I do not have any <Col N="363" /> expert reports which would prove anything I would say in that regard.</P>
    <P>A number of inquiries have been made into the question of delinquency and vandalism in Britain but there are various cultural differences between Ireland and England, as well as the question of different traditions and so forth, and these factors could lead to different findings in Ireland.  The general view is held in Britain, as it is in Ireland, that deprivation in terms of income or education has a very large part to play in determining whether a young person will enter a life of crime.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not in any way deal with the problems of eliminating crime and, to give the Minister his due, he said as much in his speech.  He does not intend the Bill to deal with the problems of crime but he hopes it will enable greater detection rates.  He does not offer any evidence that the proposals contained in the Bill will result in the detection rate for which he hopes.  In reply to criticisms that the Bill is repressive he said that the same provisions are in effect in other European countries.  That is the case to some degree but there are certain safeguards provided which are not included in this Bill.  It is also true that the crime rates in these other countries are as bad as they are in this State.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is proposing this Bill as a means of increasing the crime detection rate, he has offered no evidence that the proposals will achieve this result.  Statistics show that 80 per cent of people who are convicted in our courts under the present system are convicted on the basis of confessions they have made.  This Bill will not impel the Garda towards more investigation and detection but will encourage greater emphasis on interrogation and a higher rate of convictions based on confessions.</P>
    <P>The Bill was widely welcomed on its introduction.  I indicated in a statement that I was anxious to study the Bill before making detailed comment.  I recognised that steps had to be taken to deal with the problem of crime but, not being a lawyer, I was not then in a position to declare whether the Bill was good, bad or indifferent.  Having studied the Bill <Col N="364" /> and received advice from people in the legal field and in the arena of social work, I am convinced that the Bill will be regressive and repressive legislation.  It represents the introduction of elements of emergency legislation into the common practice of law.</P>
    <P>There are various powers under the Offences Against the State Act for dealing with subversive crime.  There have been such powers on the Statute Book at least going back to 1939.  Under the Offences Against the State Act the Garda have the power to arrest and detain for 24 hours and then for a further 24 hours. Figures issued by the Department of Justice show that more than 2,000 people have been arrested under section 30 of that Act in the past year.  In 1972 the figure in this respect was 200, so the increase since has been dramatic.  However, the ratio of people charged as a result of those arrests is one in nine.  That would not seem to indicate that there is any value in the arrest and detention provision being proposed in the present Bill.  Rather, it indicates that there is a tendency to use section 30 in what can be termed only a very loose manner.</P>
    <P>I have had reports from various constituents who have been arrested under section 30, who have had no connection whatever with subversive crime but who have been held, not for the full 48 hours but for a number of hours.  It seems to me that once the wider powers are brought in, the tendency will be for the Garda to use them fairly freely and in circumstances where they are not necessary.</P>
    <P>The Bill was welcomed fairly widely. It was welcomed by the spokesman for Justice in Fianna Fáil and it was welcomed also by people outside the House. But since the introduction of the Bill fairly significant sections of the community, particularly lawyers who will have the job of interpreting the legislation, have expressed grave reservations about it.  I am aware also that there are Deputies, apart from those of us in this party, who are gravely concerned also about the effects the Bill may have.  There are Deputies in each of the three major parties who share this concern.  We are all aware of the crime problem but some of <Col N="365" /> us fear that this Bill is going too far and does not represent the correct way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>I have gone to some trouble to obtain the opinions of lawyers on this matter and on this basis I propose to deal with four aspects of the Bill, aspects which I consider to be wrong in intent and in the way in which they are likely to be used. I propose first to deal with the question of arrest and detention.  The power to detain persons for the purpose of interrogation is one that is entirely new to our system of criminal justice.  As I have mentioned, there is such power in the Offences Against the State Act for dealing with subversives but this is not the position in relation to our ordinary criminal justice system.  The effect of the proposal in this case is to incorporate emergency law both in substance and in principle into the ordinary law of the land.  The object of that power is to increase the number of confessions and, consequently, to increase the number of convictions in circumstances where the conviction rate based to a large extent on confession is very high already.  The emphasis is towards conviction while nothing is being done in the area of the very poor detection rate of offences, a matter that has nothing to do with the power to interrogate.</P>
    <P>This new power will diminish the value of constitutional liberty and deny the detained person the protection of speedy and impartial judicial supervision of that detention.  There is no evidence, statistical or otherwise, to substantiate the promised increase in conviction rates following the exercise of this power, a promise that has been made in an effort to justify the very serious deprivation of liberty.  The extension of emergency powers is to be accomplished in very wide ranging terms, conferring the power of detention in respect of all indictable offences without there being any safeguards in relation to the sort of abuses that are known to have occurred in the past, particularly in relation to the legislation enacted in 1976.</P>
    <P>The other area which I propose to talk about is that of the compulsion to speak. The effect of sections 14 and 15 of the <Col N="366" /> Bill is to compel persons who are being questioned to speak under threat of prosecution while conferring immunity from prosecution when people agree to speak. This contains the risk that people may seek to minimise their involvement in a series of events under investigation by way of implicating others or, by way of implicating others from motives other than motives of justice.  The immunity is conferred by a police officer requesting information from the informant.  This is a complete departure from the exercise of the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to confer immunity, a power which is used very selectively and only rarely.</P>
    <P>By allowing an adverse inference to be drawn from the silence of a questioned person, section 16 undermines the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt which lies with the prosecution.  In applying the section to every stage of criminal investigation and by allowing adverse inferences to be drawn from silence at all trials and in respect of any offence with which an accused is charged, the Bill sweeps too broadly.  In addition, it applies in respect of questioning when the interviewee has no legal advice available to him and has not the benefit of an impartial system of recording his words and when he may not even be a suspect and engages an officer in casual conversation.</P>
    <P>The section makes presumptions concerning the level of knowledge of an interviewee who is presumed to know the legal nature of his offence, his probable defence, which perhaps will be a mixed question of law and fact and who to a large extent is expected to anticipate the nature of the charge to be made against him.  The section makes assumptions about the nature of each subject which are not necessarily justifiable.  Silence can arise because of circumstances other than the guilt of an interviewee.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by sections 16, 17 and 18 of the Bill will prolong trials by creating many new issues which will be have to be treated at the trial within a trial.  Sections 17 and 18 undermine the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt as required of <Col N="367" /> the prosecution while all of sections 14 to 18 undermine the adversary and accusatory nature of the criminal justice system. These sections also undermine the fairness of procedures required of a trial under Articles 38 and 40.3 of the Constitution and the privilege which may exist under the Constitution not to incriminate oneself.  The sections abolish the Judges Rules as hitherto known and undermine the protections afforded an accused making a statement by the use of caution. These sections envisage the use of compulsion in the extraction of information from interviewees and thus abolishes the right to silence and undermines the rule that statements be made voluntarily. That is a strong indictment of the efforts to restrict the right to silence.  I am not a lawyer and the views I have expressed are on the basis of advice from lawyers who are actively concerned about these problems.</P>
    <P>The third area I should like to deal with relates to the inadequacy of safeguards to prevent abuse.  The Workers' Party hold the view that safeguards do not take up a large part of the provisions in the Bill nor does much thought appear to have been devoted to them.  A person detained does not have any note taken of the person who arrests him, the time of arrest, the reason for the arrest or the complete history of his detention.  There is no central agency to which reference could be made by a solicitor or relative looking for a client or relation and to which details of every detention would be forwarded by all stations immediately. The detained person is not afforded an opportunity to contact his solicitor, or relative, personally or by phone.  There is no provision for recording the fact that a person detained has been informed of his rights and of the efforts made to obtain the attendance of his solicitor or relative.  There is no provision that a detained person should not be questioned prior to the arrival of his solicitor or that a reasonable time be allowed to pass for the arrival of the solicitor before questioning commences.</P>
    <P>Consideration has not been given to the practical aspect of procuring legal <Col N="368" /> assistance, no matter what the time of arrest.  A duty panel of solicitors should be constituted under the legal aid scheme to meet this gap, if the Bill is passed.  No additional safeguards are provided for children between the age of seven and 17 years in respect of the presence of a solicitor or parent before interrogation begins.  That is one of the weaknesses in the Bill that surprises me most.  The legislation will affect children as young as seven years because the age of criminal responsibility still stands at seven years. There are no mandatory provisions contained in the Bill under which the Minister would be legally bound to introduce the tape recording facilities prior to the operation of the provision in law.  The confinement of such facilities to police stations has resulted in the police in other countries where such a system was introduced by-passing the facility, for example, by eliciting statements on the journey to police stations.  It is unacceptable that non-observance of the tape recording provisions should not be a basis upon which statements obtained in detention must be excluded in evidence.  Otherwise, the tape recording provision does not have any force.</P>
    <P>The fourth area I should like to deal with is the extension of the jurisdiction of the District Court.  The District Court was established in 1924 with a maximum sentence of 12 months which could only arise after consecutive sentences as the maximum for many summary and all indictable offences was six months.  The number of indictable offences triable summarily was small.  The present District Court was established in 1961 and the main statutes governing procedures and sentence are, the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967 and the Criminal Law Act, 1976.  An accused may be charged with two or more offences of a summary nature arising out of the same incident.  The accused may also be prosecuted summarily for an indictable offence at the option of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  At present an indictable offence would normally carry a sentence of six months or 12 months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> In a summary trial the accused is given a charge sheet or summons and none of the information provided in a trial or indictment is given.  That indicates that summary justice was to be speedy and by virtue of the disadvantage of not knowing the prosecution case, the penalty was to be in the realm of six to 12 months.  The present provision as to consecutive sentences is contained in section 5 of the 1951 Act.  That section provides that where a sentence of imprisonment is passed on any person by the District Court, the court may order that the sentence shall commence at the expiration of any other term of imprisonment to which that person has been previously sentenced.  Where two or more sentences passed by the District Court are ordered to run consecutively the aggregate term of imprisonment shall not exceed 12 months but in section 10 of the Bill it is proposed to insert &ldquo;two years&rdquo; for &ldquo;12 months&rdquo;.  It is not clear whether the words &ldquo;previously sentenced&rdquo; would include an accused appearing on four summary charges and receiving six months on the first and the rest being consecutive.  A critique of extending the sentencing powers of the District Court is inevitably tied in with the fact that such a trial is a non-jury one.</P>
    <P>The personnel of the District Court comprises the district justices.  Provided the appropriate statutory qualifications exist there is no guarantee that a district justice has any knowledge of criminal law, procedure or evidence.  The steady stream of State orders is evidence of the frequent errors and occasional manifest injustices that can occur in a summary trial.  However, the unremitting amount of trials which a district justice hears must, at the end of the day, take a toll on the ability to distinguish facts, facts which would otherwise be tried by a jury.  The majority of criminal cases are tried in the District Court and for the majority of the ordinary citizens their contact with the courts will be with that court.  It is, therefore, mandatory that the jurisdiction of this court be confined and limited.  Most practitioners will argue that the injustices of law and fact that have been witnessed occur in the District Court.  For that <Col N="370" /> reason, and the others stated, we oppose the granting of power to district justices to impose sentences of up to two years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the areas I have dealt with are a legal minefield and lawyers would have different views on them.  That is another reason why there is a need for a thorough study of the proposals in the Bill.  I do not believe that an assembly consisting mainly of lay people should be expected to carry out such a review.  We are concerned about the provisions of the Bill and as they stand we oppose them. There is a need for alternatives to deal with crime.  I am not denying that there is a need for change in the law in order to deal more effectively with crime but the provisions in the Bill go too far in that direction.  The Bill stands alone in the sense that there is no other Government initiative to deal with the questions of how crime occurs, who is involved in crime, why those people are involved in it or how the crime rate can be reduced.</P>
    <P>A number of debates have taken place on policing here.  There is widespread support at present for the concept of community policing and I have no doubt that a form of community policing could have a significant effect on the level of crime among young people.  The question of an alternative to jail should be considered also.  Last year we passed a Bill dealing with community services but its provisions have not been implemented to date. The Estimates indicates that £120,000 out of £300 million has been allocated for education in prisons.  We must remember that about 90 per cent of young people return to jail after serving their first sentence. There is something wrong with our prison system and the way we deal with young offenders I am convinced that there must be a many-sided approach to crime; that the whole area of youth work has been neglected shamefully&mdash;that the paltry amount of money spent by the State to provide youth services is a shame.</P>
    <P>The absence of adequate family courts must have a bearing on our crime rate. In my constituency my experience is that the worst offenders among young people come from homes which are deprived in <Col N="371" /> terms of income, education, ability to learn and lack of ability to communicate socially.  These families cannot be helped overnight.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, a case came up in my area of a mother with seven children who was evicted from a house, whose problems, like £1,300 rent arrears, and all sorts of social welfare difficulties were a major contributory factor.  Unless services of support are provided for that family I have no doubt that a number of the children will find their way into the courts and prisons.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I urge the Minister to withdraw this Bill, to take it back to the drawingboard, to issue a White Paper on crime and come back to us in six months or a year with a series of Government initiatives on youth services, family supports, education and the running of our prisons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I welcome the Bill but there are certain aspects about which I have reservations.  I intend to address myself briefly to those aspects. In general they have been discussed and analysed by Deputies on both sides who have legal brains, which I have not.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I will draw the attention of the House to part of the Minister's introductory speech &mdash; earlier, Deputy De Rossa referred to it.  I refer to the cause of crime.  Both the Minister and Deputy De Rossa use the term impoverished conditions as a cause of crime.  I do not believe that is true.  That is a factor but not a major one.</P>
      <P>The reason for my attitude being different from that of the Minister is a piece of research done in the US by Drs. Eleanor and Leonard Glueck into the causes of juvenile delinquency.  They looked at impoverished areas and asked themselves very simple questions: does impoverishment cause crime and if so why does not each person who is impoverished commit crime?  In other words, why do not all people in poor circumstances, in run-down neighbourhoods, commit crime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They took 300 juvenile delinquents and matched them with 300 non-delinquents, <Col N="372" /> in sex, age, colour, ethnic backgrounds and neighbourhoods, as near as possible.  By comparing and contrasting the two groups they were able to draw up a list of factors which they believed were major causes of juvenile delinquency.  I will refer to a few of them.  The major factors most likely to cause a child to become a delinquent are the affection of a mother for her children and the form of discipline is imposed by parents.  If the discipline is irrational the child is more likely to become a delinquent.  If the discipline is over-strict the chances of the child becoming a delinquent are less high. If the punishment is based on reason the chances of the child becoming a delinquent are less high.</P>
    <P>A number of other factors were referred to.  Though it was only a piece of research, the New York Juvenile Authority in 1945 decided to investigate whether the Glueck findings could be used.  To become a juvenile delinquent the child would have to be 16 years of age.  The New York authority examined a number of six-year-olds individually, using the factors drawn up in the 1940 research.  Of course they had to wait ten years for the results of their research, but the 1940 findings were found to have been 93 per cent accurate.</P>
    <P>Therefore, to blame impoverishment and poor neighbourhoods as a major factor in crime is not realistic.  Of course it can be used on political platforms.  If we wish to resolve the problem of crime we must turn our attention not to potential criminals, young people, but to the family. What we have to do, which cannot be done readily, is almost to lecture or retrain parents on how to act as parents. It is not something that is within the rights of this House to do.  How can it be done?</P>
    <P>If it is not done it is possible that children from broken homes, homes with bad discipline or lack of affection, are highly likely when they get married to create the same type of family atmosphere, thus carrying the disease from generation to generation.  It is the duty of this House, of the churches, of leaders of communities, in every way possible to point out to young married couples the factors that cause marital breakdown.  In 6<Col N="373" /> this way we might reduce the causes of crime.  It is not something that can happen overnight &mdash; it would have to be worked on for 20 or 30 years, and there is no guarantee we would resolve it.</P>
    <P>However, I would point out to the Minister that his belief that a rising economy here automatically would lead to a reduction in crime does not necessarily follow.  He introduced the Bill on the understanding that it would be a deterrent as well as a convictive Bill.  I do not believe the Bill will in any notable way act as a deterrent to crime.  The reason I say that is that we should be turning our attention to prevention and detection and I cannot find in this Bill any great hopes for detection.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of the Bill which I support wholeheartedly.  These are the sections dealing with the commission of a crime by a person out on bail, the increased penalties for those found in possession of fire arms and the increased penalties regarding the theft of cars.  The areas which I find hard to give total support to are sections 14 to 18 because, like many Members of this House, I depend on getting information from professional people, people with interests and training in particular subjects.  This is true of many Members but when I try to get support for some of the beliefs I have from some professional people they are totally contradictory.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote an example of this from Mr. Frank O'Donnell, the president elect of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland who, at a seminar on 26 November 1983, stated regarding the right to silence:</P>
    <P>A person in our criminal legal system is presumed innocent until proven guilty.  The onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond all reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused.  One of the most fundamental corner-stones of this presumption of innocence, is the right not to say anything, or to remain silent in the face of ones accusers.</P>
    <P>He backs up his argument by quoting from the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedures 1971 which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> ... doing away with the right of silence would amount to requiring a person to answer questions based on possibly unsubstantiated, unspecified allegations, or mere suspicions before a specific charge can be formulated. That runs counter to the presumption of innocence, and to the requirement that the prosecution bears the burden of proof, and it brings with it a real risk that innocent people may inadvertently make damaging remarks.</P>
    <P>If every article I read gave this viewpoint I would certainly find it very difficult to support the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from another article, The Eleventh Report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee in England in 1972 which advocated that the right to silence as it existed should be abolished, and stated the reasons for that as follows:</P>
    <P>There is now a large and increasing class of professional criminals who are not only highly skilful in organising their crimes and in the steps they take to avoid detection but are well aware of their legal rights and use every possible means to avoid conviction if caught.  These include refusal to answer questions by the police and the manufacture of evidence.</P>
    <P>Here we have two professional bodies with contradictory views on something which is very important.  How can I make up my mind on an issue like this if I cannot depend on such professional opinions when they are so diverse?  The conclusion I must draw is that because they are diverse and diametrically opposed I must not support this provision unless some person with better knowledge can tell me that either of those is right.  That is the right to silence and one of the areas I have reservations about, the fact that an innocent person may inadvertently make a statement that can be used against him.</P>
    <P>There are also sections where a person who refuses to make a statement or to give reasons why he is in a particular place at a particular time is now also presumed to be guilty.  Up to this a judge had to direct his jury not to draw inferquents <Col N="375" /> ence from a person's silence.  Now it appears that inference against the person accused must be drawn.</P>
    <P>I find some difficulty about the problem of bringing an individual into a Garda station and having the person in charge of the station make a decision about whether this person could or could not be involved in a crime.  This places the onus on the person, normally the sergeant, in charge of the Garda station.  I believe there are 110 Garda stations throughout the country which are manned by one garda.  This means that he can be the garda who brings in the person who is to be accused and he is also the person who makes the decision as to whether he was right in doing so.  There is no safeguard for the individual there.  How many Garda stations are there with two gardaí and one sergeant, where that sergeant might not be present at all times and the garda responsible for the station might be a young rookie, a person without any great experience, with the result that a person will be brought into a Garda station and perhaps kept for six hours on the recommendation of a young inexperienced garda?</P>
    <P>I am sure on Committee Stage the Minister intends to tighten up the section regarding strip searching.  Under the provisions of the Bill it is envisaged that only in cases where there is the possibility of drugs or firearms can an individual be searched.  I am sure the House is aware that if any garda wishes to carry out a body search all he has to do is to say that he assumes the person is carrying drugs. There is a pretty good likelihood of this happening because usually the reason for searching an individual brought into a Garda station is that the individual is assumed to have stolen property in his or her possession.  A garda could say he thought the person had drugs and so carry out a body search.  In discussions I had recently with the chief superintendent as to whether body searches would be carried out by members of the same sex he told me that there were sufficient female gardaí around the country to carry out body searches of females involved in crime.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> Another area I am not too clear about is in relation to individuals being questioned in a Garda station. Can he be questioned while waiting for his solicitor or must his solicitor be present?  If a solicitor has to be present how long can he be present, in other words, can he be present for the full interrogation?  I am sure on Committee Stage the Minister, who is open to suggestions, will be able to answer or change some aspects of the Bill to satisfy Members of the House.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to something mentioned by Deputy De Rossa regarding community policing.  I place great faith in this.  If one examines a rural village with a fixed population and compares the crime rate to that of a large town with the same population one would find that the crime rate in the town was much higher than that of the village.  The reason is that in the village the likelihood of detection is greater.  Individuals are known to each other and therefore the likelihood of them committing crimes against one another is lessened.  It is for this reason that I believe in community policing.  If a policeman lives in the community and knows every family in it, that can have a preventative effect rather than a convictive effect.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the idea of community watch.  One worries that they might become vigilantes.  In the US neighbours travel around in their area in a car on a rota basis and look out for suspicious people and watch houses where the people are away so as to ensure that nothing happens to them.  The reason this has been effective in America and might not be so here is that there is a stronger sense of community in America than there is here.  If we were to develop communities and make certain areas of the community focal points for meeting areas and have small Garda stations, the crime rate would drop.</P>
    <P>There is a joke that there are areas in Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway where the police dogs go around in pairs. The idea of calling an area a &ldquo;bad area&rdquo;&mdash; we had some experience of this in Dublin some years ago &mdash; has a detrimental effect on the character of the <Col N="377" /> people living in the area.  It is almost a case of a self-fulfilling prophecy.  If they are told often enough that they are living in a crime ridden area they will say if they are to be treated as criminals they may as well act as criminals.  This technique of labelling is often used by the press for sensationalism.  I ask everyone to avoid describing an area as being crime ridden or as an area where delinquency is rampant, or in any way degrading a community.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give this Bill a three-year trial and if after that time it is seen to be effective then continue it but if it is seen to be ineffective then abolish it.  I know the Minister would feel that the idea of imposing a Bill for three years would appear to the public to be like a special powers Act and might have a frightening effect but it is better to be flexible in a case like this.  A Bill which contains areas such as those about which I have resservations being imposed as a reaction to the increase in crime might not necessarily be a good Bill, and judging its effectiveness after three years would be the best way out.  I ask the Minister to bring in a White Paper on crime and allow the general public to see what the causes of crime are and the likely solution to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Bill had a slow start in that it did not seem at the beginning that there would be many contributions from Deputies on both sides. Thankfully, rather like the Bill on the referendum, as people began to think about it, they realised the importance of the legislation that was before us.  In the small amount of time the commentators and public were able to think about it, a number of Deputies have considered in depth the implications of the Bill.  It is significant that most of the earlier contributions were in favour of the Bill.  Much of the debate was confined to praising the forces of law and order, and rightly so. We are very concerned about the tremendous upsurge in crime, lawlessness and vandalism that has occurred in the last 15 years to the utter bewilderment of the populace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Civil obedience was almost taken for <Col N="378" /> granted here.  It is not long ago that it was very rare to have a serious crime committed such as murder.  We might only have half a dozen a year.  I am not saying &ldquo;might only&rdquo; in the sense that it was acceptable.  In recent years the number has grown out of all proportion.  It is a pity that the Bill was not available for discussion among the public and professional bodies because of the revolutionary effect it will have on our criminal law. Their opinion could have been sought on how best to proceed.</P>
    <P>There have been many comments in the past few months from lawyers, academics, members of the public and associations regarding the Bill.  Questions have been asked from where did it emanate and suggestions have been made that it came directly from the Department of Justice.  That is probably somewhat unfair because in the past few years the public have been asking for such a measure and successive Ministers for Justice have told the House they were working on such a Bill in the hope of bringing it forward for debate.  There have been some comments in recent months, particularly by practitioners in criminal law and lecturers in law, that suggestions should have been made during that period when they knew such a Bill was being contemplated. Now some constructive criticisms have been levelled at sections of the Bill. There is a worry that if some of the sections are not changed they will have a retrogressive effect on criminal law and have a bad effect on society.  People have said that more time should be given to consider the matter.  I listened on the monitor to Deputy De Rossa who suggested to the Minister that he should take back the Bill for reconsideration and bring it forward in six months' time.  Even though it is somewhat late in the day to make such a suggestion, there is no doubt that the whole matter has serious implications for everyone.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister has taken office and since the introduction of the Bill it is obvious that there is a degree of confidence in the people.  This is particularly so because of the way he has approached the presentation of the Bill.  He has shown willingness to consider contributions <Col N="379" /> and to make changes if they are necessary.  In the past week I read about a meeting he had with representatives of the Garda Síochána at which they expressed satisfaction in regard to the talks they had with the Minister.  They said they were very pleased with the outcome. Knowing their views on the Bill as they have made submissions to Members of this House, I hope that will not be interpreted as meaning that the extra powers they are seeking will be granted automatically.</P>
    <P>There have been many contributions in this House from different sides and from people representing all parts of the country and all have been concerned to ensure that the matter is put right.  Prior to the recess I listened to the contribution of Deputy Flynn.  While I did not agree with everything he said &mdash; he spoke at some length, as he is well able to do &mdash; I was impressed by his contribution and the way in which he pointed out to the Minister the necessity to reconsider some sections.  On Committee Stage I expect there will be many contributions and suggestions and I am sure the Minister will take into consideration any points that are made.  I am also sure that, if any changes are necessary in the best interests of criminal law and the population, such changes will be made.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that this Bill will be seen as the answer to all the crime problems. The timing of the Bill is rather unfortunate in that what it is trying to achieve has been confused with that dreadful problem.  In the early stages it was put forward as the solution to all our problems but recently people have become persuaded that it will not solve them.  However, certain provisions in the Bill are very welcome and there is no dispute about them.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate it has become clear which sections have caused the most concern.  Because a White Paper on the matter has not been issued and because the matter was not the subject of public debate and discussion in the past few years we have to be concerned about what is proposed here.  The professional people involved who have been aware of <Col N="380" /> this impending legislation have themselves to blame in large measure for not making their contributions before now. They would have been valuable and welcome to the Members here who do not specialise in matters relating to the law and also to the Minister and the Department when formulating the legislation. However, we have to go on from here. Everyone accepts it is necessary to make changes in the law.  What all of us are concerned about is getting the balance right and that is extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>That many Members have expressed doubts on certain sections of the Bill has not been interpreted by the Minister as a disgruntled attack merely for the sake of being vindictive.  However, at the early stages, as I have heard some Members say, there was a tendency to play politics with this Bill by not criticising it as a whole, for fear of a backlash in the very sensitive communities that we represent, because of the extremely high crime rate. It has come across fairly clearly in recent times that this is very serious legislation and if there are sections in it which could do the kind of damage suggested by commentators, contributors to the debate, members of the public and our constituents, they should be taken very seriously and, if necessary, amendments made.</P>
    <P>Many professional bodies have made contributions, some of which have been referred to by previous speakers and I do not intend going into them now in great detail.  However, as even the last two Deputies have mentioned, while all are conscious of not being practising lawyers when discussing a legal measure such as this, many commentaries have been made by practising and academic lawyers, to which we can frequently refer, as well as referring to comments made by other bodies not of a legal nature, members of the community and voluntary and religious organisations.  Some of the recent statements since the introduction of the Bill have been made by members of the legal profession, all of whom express concern about some sections of the Bill.  For example, the President of the Incorporated Law Society, Mr. Houlihan, in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 28 November 1983, warned that certain provisions <Col N="381" /> of the Bill made substantial inroads into the presumption of innocence of all our citizens.  He was referring to sections 16, 17 and 18 which entitled inferences to be made on the exercise of the right to silence.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial of 19 October 1983 stated that the Garda had got what they wanted, or the lion's share of it, in the Criminal Justice Bill.  It continues:</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation also calls the bluff of the gardaí.  How often have we heard spokesmen for them argue that rise in crime has been caused in large part by timid laws?  The gardaí specify the areas in which they wanted greater leeway.  Their requests have been granted and it remains to be seen if any significant advance will be made in reducing crime.</P>
    <P>The editorial goes on:</P>
    <P>Police forces everywhere will exploit to the limit any advantage they have and it was garda abuses which brought about a situation in which judges had to intervene heavily to protect individual rights.  The Minister now proposes to redress the balance in favour of the gardaí.  Anyone concerned that civil liberty should not be eroded will worry that the gardaí can detain people for up to 20 hours without charging them.  This is one reason why there must be an independent complaints procedure.  With all due respect to the gardaí it can be a mistake to give too much power in the hands of any law enforcement agency.  A little doubt always keeps them more honest.</P>
    <P>A particularly relevant letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> of October 25, 1983 by Professor Boyle, Dean of the Faculty of Law in University College, Galway, states that the present Bill represents the most wide-ranging assault on our perceived ideas of both the investigation and trial of criminal offences in the history of the State.  He says:</P>
    <P>It is not an exaggeration to say that when you add up its proposals on the investigation stage; detention for questioning rather than charge, including making it a criminal offence not to give <Col N="382" /> certain information to the gardaí, compulsory fingerprinting of suspects without court authority; compulsory submission to questioning for intelligence gathering purposes with 12 months' imprisonment and £800 fine if a suspect withholds information on himself or others; the abolition of the Judges Rules, the caution and the right to silence in the police station, the investigation of crime is to be transformed in this country.  If to these proposals are added the changes at trial; the massive increases in penalties for certain offences, the changes in alibis and jury verdicts and most important of all the abolition of the <i>right</i> to silence in the trial it is equally no exaggeration to say that we are proposing to rewrite the rules in a radically different way from what they have been for centuries.</P>
    <P>He questions who recommended all these, and who determined that 200 years or thereabouts of principle and experience should be scrapped and left for the history books.  He is suggesting that nobody did, that there was no reference to the Law Commission, no special inquiry, no study or no research.  I have referred to this earlier and do not propose to add to that.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that there has never been in 60 years a comprehensive study of crime and the criminal law in this State.</P>
    <P>That is why it is unfortunate that the manner in which the Bill was introduced has hit everybody by surprise although we should not have been surprised.  We certainly should have had an in-depth study and there should have been time for public comment.  I am glad that the debate has extended into January.  It had looked as if it would end prior to the Christmas recess.  People have given it a lot more thought and we do have Committee Stage to come.  The Bill seems to be, as Professor Boyle said &ldquo;a cobbling-together of the more repressive proposals and suggestions for change in criminal procedure over the last decade in the neighbouring island.  Many of the proposals included in the Bill were discarded in this study in Britain.&rdquo;  For example, the abolition of the right to silence was <Col N="383" /> recommended in 1972 in Britain in a report which achieved considerable notoriety in legal and political circles there.  It was abandoned by the Government because of the storm provoked by that proposal.  Now we have this proposal almost verbatim in sections 16 and 17 of this Bill.  In 1981 the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure in the United Kingdom recommended that the present law on the right to silence in the face of police questioning after caution should not be altered.  That recommendation has been accepted.  I believe that, in the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill soon to be reintroduced in the United Kingdom, the right to silence is preserved.</P>
    <P>I might add here that Professor Boyle is of the opinion that if this Bill is adopted we will have the distinction of having the most oppressive pre-trial system of criminal procedure of any democratic country of which he is aware.  Bearing in mind this kind of comment it is obvious that we must give this Bill very careful consideration, be as certain as we can &mdash; based on our experiences and all of the expertise we can muster &mdash; and not make any changes to the detriment of our people or the criminal law.  Rather we must ensure, as far as possible, that the situation legislated for will be for the good or indeed betterment of everybody.  I submit what we are endeavouring to do really is review our criminal law which everybody agrees needs updating and revision but, at the same time, we are endeavouring to give extra powers to the Garda which they feel they need.  However, there is confusion, whether deliberate or not, that the powers contained in this Bill will actually solve our crime problems.  There is a very strong body of opinion who do not accept that it will.  They maintain, in the same way that the referendum did not solve the abortion problem, that this Bill will not solve our crime problem. Therefore, in its consideration, we must put out of our minds the notion that this Bill will solve our crime problems.  There is no doubt that its provisions will go a long way to tackling the very serious crimes committed.</P>
    <P>Further objections were raised by different <Col N="384" /> members of the legal profession which I should like to place on the record, if they have not already been.  These constitute expert comment on which we should draw freely in assessing the contents of the Bill.  For example, the Chairman of the Bar Council, Mr. Patrick McEntee, described the Bill as being so dangerous and sinister that it potentially strikes at the heart of liberty in this country. He said it was a means of introducing wide-ranging powers into the criminal law which would create enormous problems for the ordinary citizen.  One member of that group contended that the extended powers of detention and new rules on the right to silence, when taken together, erode the liberty of the citizen, that guilt could, in certain circumstances, be inferred from silence.</P>
    <P>In <i>Magill</i> magazine of November 1983 Mr. Adrian Hardiman in an article entitled &ldquo;Justice Being Done?&rdquo;  posed very poignant questions in relation to this Bill. In the course of that article he said:</P>
    <P>The unpublicised sting in the tail in this Bill is found in Sections 16 to 18 entitled &ldquo;Inferences from Accused's Failure to Mention or Account for Certain Matters&rdquo;.  It is impossible to overstress the size of the revolution these sections would effect in the laws of evidence, the conduct of trials and the role of the police.  These changes would be for the worse, not the better.  For some ten years past, the investigation of serious crimes had centred to an unhealthy extent on alleged voluntary confessions made by accused persons to gardaí, usually in garda stations. Frequently these were the only evidence presented.  Frequently they were absolutely repudiated by the accused once he or she ceased to be in custody. Sometimes, especially in the case of juveniles confessing to a series of, say, burglaries, they contained admissions to crimes which the accused could not have committed since he or she was in custody at the time of the crime.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hardiman also had this to say:</P>
    <P>Looking at Section 16 of the Bill... <Col N="385" /> its implications are disturbing.  First, it applies to every offence, even a parking ticket and not merely to &ldquo;serious crimes&rdquo;.  Second, it envisages questioning by gardaí, quite informally, with no recording or independent verification and no legal advice.  Third, the person need not be even a suspect at the time of the questioning.</P>
    <P>More serious by far is that &ldquo;such inference(s) as appear(s) proper&rdquo; may be drawn from a &ldquo;failure to mention&rdquo; a particular matter.  Now many people are quite unable to say what is or is not material to their defence.  Even with the most careful advice and preparation lengthy consultation is necessary to elicit all material facts.  Yet a person is by this section obliged to live up to an objective standard of legal reasonableness, or face &ldquo;such inferences as appear proper&rdquo; being drawn against him or her.</P>
    <P>In other words he or she is being tried not only for the offence (for which there may be only the flimsiest other evidence) but for his or her skill or lack of it in answering questions, perhaps about technical matters.  Even this assumes that the conversation is honestly and accurately recorded.  Yet there is no obligation on the garda even to write it down.</P>
    <P>We should not lightly dismiss that kind of comment coming from practitioners of our existing law.  Perhaps, as Deputy De Rossa has already suggested, there is need for a period of reflection and consideration.  It is quite likely that we will have such consideration given on Committee Stage and that the contributions to be made then will satisfy everybody that we have not rushed through legislation in this House which will have a permanent effect on our society.  Like other speakers, I might refer to the openness of the Minister in his speech in which he welcomed contributions and said he would certainly reflect, consider and be prepared to make changes if they were desirable.</P>
    <P>In section 17 there is a similar provision regarding explanations of objects, substances or marks on a person, on his or <Col N="386" /> her clothing, in his or her possession or in a place where he or she is.  Failure to explain may give rise to ubiquitous inferences against the defendant.  Section 18 has a similar provision about failure to explain one's presence in a place.  While section 16 only requires mention of a fact which one might reasonably be expected to mention, sections 17 and 18 have no such limitations, so mere ignorance can tell against a person.  The making of oral inquiries and the taking of statements are governed by the Judges' Rules under the present law.  These enshrine the obligation to caution a person if the Garda decide to charge him or her and to say that what he or she says will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence.  He or she is then invited to sign the written version.  These safeguards have been shown to be inadequate and, far from being strengthened, they are being abolished.  The present rules require a parent or guardian to be present when a juvenile is questioned.  In this Bill it is proposed that inquiries be preceded by a statement in ordinary language and a failure or refusal to mention a fact which may be relied on in a hypothetical future defence to a hypothetical prosecution may lead to inferences being drawn.  Furthermore, this mention must be made to the agent of the adverse party who may or may not write it down.  The effect of this will be that more and more criminal trials will turn into swearing matches, not about hard evidence but about what was or what was not said by a person to a garda.  If it is desired to introduce an inquisitory system of criminal justice &mdash; and this is what these provisions do &mdash; it should be done in an open and considered way and questioning must take place formally before an independent person and be recorded verbatim.</P>
    <P>In sections 3 and 25 the powers to detain without charge are extended.  Section 3 does this for offences punishable by five years or more imprisonment.  This includes the great majority of non-trivial offences.  A person can be detained for six hours or a further six hours if authorised by a chief superintendent.  This requirement is hardly a safeguard, for experience under the Offences Against <Col N="387" /> the State Act suggest that such authorisation will not be refused.  Experience also suggests that this power of detention for questioning is wasteful, inefficient and oppressive.</P>
    <P>Under the English Prevention of Terrorism Act, 25 persons are detained for every one person subsequently prosecuted under the Act.  The Minister said, in response to a Dáil question last March, that normally nine persons are arrested and detained under the Offences Against the State Act for every one charged with an offence.  This is because, under the Offences Against the State Act, as under this Bill, only the reasonable suspicion of a garda is required for detention, and the reasonableness of this suspicion cannot be checked because privilege will always be claimed.  Therefore, the situation will continue in which 80 per cent of detentions do not fulfil their purpose and cause great misery to innocent people.  Apart from this power of detention, section 25 (3) allows a person arrested on a warrant after 10 p.m. or arrested without warrant but charged after that hour to be held without being brought before a court or a peace commissioner up to noon the next day.  This appears almost an invitation to make arrests on holding charges at a late hour and to question persons without even the safeguards provided under section 3.  Only the integrity of the Garda will prevent abuse of this provision.</P>
    <P>The Council of the Law Society also referred to this Bill.  They said that tough law and order measures will not solve the crime wave and they expressed serious concern.  At its worst the new law may leave innocent citizens being subjected to intimidatory processes which may lead them to confess to crimes they did not commit.  However, they expressed approval of some of the measures and there has not been any disagreement about majority verdicts, the abolition of unsworn statements, notification of alibi defences and changes in the laws relating to bail.  The Council of the Law Society condemned plans to give more powers to the Garda.  They said they could not support the extension of the Garda's powers <Col N="388" /> of detention or the inroads on the right to silence contained in the Bill.  The conferring of powers of detention for the purpose of the investigation of a crime is a serious invasion of the rights of innocent citizens, and serious breaches of the existing interrogation laws by the Garda did not encourage the lawyers to welcome greater powers for the Garda.  They said that tougher new laws and extensive police powers are no solution to the problem of increased crime.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Incorporated Law Society added their voice to the growing opposition to the Criminal Justice Bill.  I am making reference to the expert comments that have been made by professional bodies, members of the legal profession and academic lawyers, so that we can draw on these comments in coming to a decision about this legislation before the House.  The Incorporated Law Society said that certain sections of the Bill would lead to a serious invasion of the rights of innocent citizens and intimidation by the authorities.  They repeated that they approved of some of the proposals but were seriously concerned about the principal ones.  They are concerned that the Bill is being advanced as a solution to the problem of increased crime.  This seems to filter through from most professional opinions.  The society are satisfied that only the provision of better facilities and adequate training for the Garda, coupled with an increased sense of community responsibility, is likely to lead to any lessening of the level of crime.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we examine that statement.  The Joint Committee on Crime and Vandalism, of which I am a member, have been examining this question. I am concerned about the effectiveness and the efficiency of the Garda Force.  Like the majority of Deputies I have a respect of the Garda.  Gardaí are like the rest of us: they have families like our own, they have similar backgrounds and they are constantly referred to as the finest body of men in the country.</P>
    <P>I am not very happy about the efficiency and deployment of the force.  This area needs to be examined before we can accept some of the statements that have <Col N="389" /> been made by Garda representatives to have these changes made.  This measure has been put forward as an answer to our crime and vandalism problems but we should know how effective and efficient the force are and we must have evidence that not alone are they doing everything possible to reduce the crime rate but that they are going about it in the right way and know exactly what they are doing.</P>
    <P>Mr. Rogan, the new general secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors declared his support for this Bill in his inauguration speech.  He said he supported community efforts to remove the social problems which give rise to crime.  He also said the Bill proposed measures which would give the Garda a fair chance of dealing with highly professional criminals.  I do not think anyone would dispute that but there is an inference that this Bill is necessary to give them a fair chance of dealing with other kinds of crime too.  One of the issues coming out of this debate is that while certain measures in this Bill are necessary to tackle professional criminals, they are not necessary to deal with ordinary crime, and many of our crime problems have grown up in the last ten years because of other problems.  The danger is that these methods and powers would be used universally.  This would mean we would have a changed society and we might have a different opinion of the Garda Force which at present is highly respected.  I do not think the Garda would want that and neither would the people.</P>
    <P>Mr. Rogan said that they rejected the view that these measures were too severe or that they represented a severe diminution of the citizens' rights.  Almost every other professional body in the country, academic and legal, disagree with that.  They say these provisions are a severe diminution of the citizens' rights. I do not understand why they insist on this provision, and that is why I am tying this into the operation of the Garda Force.</P>
    <P>Mr. Rogan said that these provisions were no more, indeed in some cases far less, than the power which every police force in Europe have.  We do not have to <Col N="390" /> compare ourselves with every country in Europe.  We had to go to Britain to get most of the wording of this Bill.  Deputy Kelly and I often comment on this constant referring to other societies for solutions to our problems.  I will refer in greater detail to that point later because other Deputies referred to powers given to the police in other countries.  That is not an argument for introducing draconian powers here if we do not need them. I would prefer if once again we had a law abiding citizenry similar to that which existed some years ago and we would prefer the gardaí to be our friends.  If we can survive without this type of measure we should do so.</P>
    <P>If there are other reasons for our crime problems we should tackle them.  To introduce short-cuts in one big sweep is a dangerous practice to adopt.  It is an enormous responsibility to undertake to change the criminal law in this way if it is not the right thing to do, if in the future, it will cause more problems than it solves, and if it causes the alienation of certain sections of the community from the Garda or if it makes the Garda unpopular. All these points have to be taken into consideration when we are introducing legislation.</P>
    <P>I have to agree with Mr. Rogan when he said:</P>
    <P>Controlling crime involves improving the quality of family life, the way schools are run, the way cities and towns are planned and the efforts of many people other than the gardaí engaged in the delivery of services. Every institution has a role to play by working in unison to solve the problems that affect the whole society.  Any tendency by the general public to see the gardaí as having sole responsibility for the prevention and detection of crime weakens civic responsibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan mentioned the area of community relations, neighbourhood watches, and so forth.  I would like the Minister &mdash; perhaps he is doing it already and perhaps this is obvious from some of the statements made recently by the new Commissioner of the Garda &mdash;<Col N="391" /> to look at how the whole system of policing operates, how effective it is, and what improvements could be made, The first thing that has to be done is that the force as it exists, its size, its capacity and its facilities, has to be looked at.  We have to ask ourselves are we getting, not value for money although that might apply in a commercial sense, but a return from a force of 13,000 odd, or whatever the figure is.  Are the Garda really being effective throughout the community?</P>
    <P>I would not like to be thought of as just being critical, although I would not be in the slightest bit perturbed by any criticism which might be levelled back at me. Having spoken to some of my colleagues over the past few months I know many people in this House are very wary about saying anything which might be interpreted as a criticism of the Garda in case there might be any political repercussions. That is an attitude I would not be prepared to live with.  We should be able to put any institution of the State under a microscope to see whether we are getting the best value from them.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are so far as the effectiveness of the Garda is concerned. People keep saying we have the finest force in the world.  That is a bit sentimental. We have a fine force of Garda, but I want to ask have we also got the most inefficient force.  I have lived abroad and I have seen other systems in operation in different countries, and I think we must be very near to having the most inefficient force.  As a public representative I have had to listen many times to the problems of my constituents, and check the response to inquiries, or complaints, or calls for help by my constituents.  I have not been very impressed.</P>
    <P>One does not have to be very observant to realise that the Road Traffic Act has fallen apart.  One wonders if we have one at all.  In the past ten or 15 years there has been an increase in driving offences and the standards have totally collapsed. Every day you must be careful when you are going through green lights.  You are likely to be overtaken at a junction or a set of traffic lights.  One of the reasons why we have so much petty crime is that <Col N="392" /> Acts like the Road Traffic Act have not been applied over the past ten to 15 years. Little by little the Act has not been applied.  People know they will get away with going through red lights, bald tyres, no insurance and no tax.</P>
    <P>Standards fell and crime built up. There was a lack of detection of crimes and a breakdown in community relations. There was a lack of planning on our part for new estates, for the increase in population and the growth of our youth population. With no forward planning in those areas, with the increase in unemployment and the recession, it was inevitable that there would be an increase in crime.  We have to get back into each of those areas and correct the mistakes.</P>
    <P>We have to look at our Garda force and see how they are working and how they are deployed.  I asked questions about deployment before, and I was amazed to be asked by very senior people what I meant.  I could not get a satisfactory response which would indicate to me that the best possible use was being made of the force.  It is a peculiar and unusual job.  A person may be doing a certain job on a factory floor and his work can easily be measured.  It is more difficult when somebody checks in and his job is to float around the place, if that is his job.</P>
    <P>In the past couple of years an attempt was made to examine the suggestion of having a neighbourhood watch, as it is called in some countries, or community policing as it is called in other countries. If you took that as an example you would not be encouraged at the efficiency of the force.  For the past two years a booklet on neighbourhood watch or community policing was passed.  It has not been produced yet.  At recent meetings of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism we asked for a booklet and what we got was a hurriedly put together photostat of a folded page with blanks for photographs and a few notes extracted from different manuals published throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Recently there was a rushed attempt &mdash; and I hope this Bill is not being rushed in the same way &mdash; to set up pilot schemes, one in Finglas I think, and the other in Store Street.  What instruction <Col N="393" /> and training have members on the ground got?  They will be responsible for working this scheme.  If any training is anticipated, the details should be given.  Who will set up, operate and monitor the neighbourhood watch as we will call it for the moment?  Will there be a special section as there is in other countries to receive calls and liaise with the public?</P>
    <P>I do not think that at the moment the Garda can respond fast enough to the public.  If we had a neighbourhood watch there would be extra demands on the Garda and calls into the stations.  How would they respond?  I am not sure, but I suspect that there are only two telephone lines in each Garda station in the city.  I wonder how they would respond if there was a bigger demand.  If there is not a special section, how will the calls be recorded and accounted for?  I do not think there is any record kept at present of calls made to stations in the Dublin Metropolitan area.  It may be a hit-and-miss system and I would like to know what the structures are.  The 999 system is overburdened and it is difficult to get through.  I would hope that this area of Garda operations would be looked at constructively with a view to improving it.  I think this is being done by the Commissioner and I wish him every success.</P>
    <P>Apart from legal submissions, there have been other submissions made by different bodies.  Some are held in high regard and others are not.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties have expressed a fear for the innocent, lovable souls of young people who are frustrated by the complexities of our system.  These would be the young, inarticulate people to whom other Members have referred. Fears have been expressed about whether they would be intimidated by the system, not by the people operating the system, although there would be fears in that area as well.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors also made submissions and they wanted changes in the Judges' Rules which I would not favour.  They recommend that rule 2 be modified to enable an interviewer to elicit all the information a suspect is prepared to divulge.  Therefore <Col N="394" /> the caution should not be administered until a suspect is actually charged.  Rule 2 of the Judges' Rules states that whenever a police officer has made up his mind to charge a person with a crime he should first caution such a person before asking him any questions or any further questions, as the case may be.  They also want the abolition of rule 3 which states that persons in custody should not be questioned without the usual caution being first administered.  They say that this would be a logical consequence if the proposal to permit detention for investigation is approved by statute.</P>
    <P>In tandem with this Bill the operations and deployment of the Garda should be looked at.  Most people are clueless when they are confronted by police and especially when they are taken into custody. I would not like to see a situation evolving where, following the introduction of this legislation, one could not look crooked at a garda without being taken in for questioning and held for a number of hours.  I hope that will not happen.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that I do not think this Bill would be the solution to our crime problems. Everyone must accept that.  I would like it to be seen that politicians are not grasping at this Bill as a solution to the problem.  I realise that the Garda are doing the best for themselves in putting forward what they think they need in order to solve the problem of crime.  They have done a public relations job on certain aspects of the Bill and it is up to us to consider what has been said in the debate both inside and outside this House.  Everybody accepts the total need to support the Garda.  It is a community problem and I do not think that some of the scaremongering about the Bill should deflect us from our path.</P>
    <P>The reference which has been made by other Deputies and members of the Garda to what is available in other European countries as opposed to the powers of detention we have here is not a strong argument for changing our powers.  It does not necessarily follow that what applies in England, Scotland, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg and The Netherlands and Sweden should apply here, given our traditions and given <Col N="395" /> that not long ago we had a very low crime rate and everything was under control. In the past ten or 15 years things have got out of hand and it is up to us to examine the reasons and rectify the situation.  It would be a sad day if we ever got to the stage where a person could not answer back a member of the Garda.  If some of these measures were implemented that situation could arise.  That is not to say that anybody would be intimidated or would be treated in that manner by a garda, but we are dealing with a huge body of people and human nature and other complexities are involved.  It is very rare among the majority of people to have to go into a police station or to be taken into custody.  It is a terrifying experience for a member of the public and the safeguards that exist should not lightly be changed unless absolutely necessary. This is an area we need to examine.</P>
    <P>A lot of people are dissatisfied that the Bill was introduced without prior consultation. Although everybody was aware that such a Bill was being contemplated, suggestions and submissions were not made.  Debate has taken place only during the past month or two and between now and Committee Stage there will be time for reflection so that people can think seriously and enable us to have a constructive debate on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with the Bill and like everybody else who has spoken I am glad that he is receptive to the suggestions being made by the House and that he is prepared to consider changes that may be for the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue. We have been waiting since 1965 for a measure of this kind.  The support of the public for the Bill is demonstrated amply by the small amount of criticism of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have set out to produce a measure that strikes the right balance. There are many difficult areas in relation to this whole matter but my suggestion is that some of the practices <Col N="396" /> adopted by the Garda in the early days of the State should be re-employed.  I am thinking of the role they played in terms of educating the community.  The fears of those who believe that the innocent may be abused as a result of these new measures will have to be assuaged in some way and that is why I am thinking in terms of an educational role in conjunction with the passing of the Bill.  Perhaps the Garda could adopt a PRO system whereby designated members would visit primary and secondary schools to explain the provisions of the Bill and the efforts being made by the Government to combat the lawlessness we have been experiencing in the past number of years.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an interest in education so I am sure he will agree with the need to spell out to the community in a very personal way what is intended by this measure.  Perhaps he would consider, in conjunction with the Department of Education and the Garda, providing a means of making the people fully aware of what is involved.  I, too, wish the Minister well with this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank all those Deputies who have contributed to this very wide-ranging Second Stage debate.  Many Deputies went into great detail in their contributions while others, quite rightly, sought to set the Bill in the overall context of what would be the appropriate reply of the Government to the rise in crime that has been afflicting our community in the past number of years.  In 1982 indictable offences reached the 97,000 level.  Sixty per cent of all the offences occurred in the Dublin metropolitan area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my opening speech, there is no general agreement among criminologists about what are the causes of crime. There is no general agreement that can provide absolute criteria on which the Government or a police force can base their policy.  I reiterate that I see the Criminal Justice Bill as one element, a significant element, in an overall approach to crime and lawlessness. Those Deputies who referred to the equipment, the training and the deployment <Col N="397" /> of Garda were right to do so because we can only consider changes in the law in the context of the total resources of a community in combatting crime and lawlessness.  Those who referred to the prisons had a valid point also because, in fairness, there is not much point in processing people through the legal system if at the end of the day a court cannot be sure that the sanction decided on will be implemented to any degree of adequacy.  People talk in terms of the relationship between the community and the Garda.  That, too, is relevant in the context of the Bill as a whole.</P>
    <P>In my reply I will be confining my remarks largely to the points arising directly from the Criminal Justice Bill.  I realise that the Bill must be set in a wider context and it was in that wider context that I introduced the Bill.  But, in that wider context, other matters arise, other solutions have to be found and we have had a number of debates in the House on associated matters since I became Minister. While I will be restating some of my views on other matters I will be confining my remarks primarily to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A point that was made recently and which is worth referring to now is that when we think of crime we think almost automatically of crime detection.  We think in terms of a very effective police force trying to ascertain who the perpetrators of the crime were and then proceeding to charge them, to have them brought before the courts and eventually to have them sent to prison.  One point that has occurred to me always in that regard is that as soon as one starts on a system of crime detection, to a very large extent the harm is done.  There is someone who has been the victim of the criminal. There is enormous cost to the taxpayer in respect of moneys spent on the police force and on the courts and also in providing adequate prison space for criminals. I do not consider that enough attention is paid to crime prevention.  If some of the resources used in crime detection could be transferred to crime prevention, the benefit to society would be enormous. First, there would be fewer victims of <Col N="398" /> crime and in addition we would not have the major problems that are experienced in our prisons and in our courts or the major problem of the time of the Garda being taken up in crime detection work.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Authority established a new small industry board, on a pilot basis, in Cork in June 1983.  This is part of the concentrated small industry programme for Cork City and the non-designated areas of the county announced by the Taoiseach in March 1983.  Six new small industry specialists have been assigned to the Cork office as a result.  All decision-making powers and functions relating to small industry in the Cork area, with the exception of policy, have been devolved to the Cork Small Industry Board.</P>
      <P>The IDA have appointed an assistant regional manager to its new office in Tralee to intensify the promotion of industrial development in County Kerry.</P>

      <P>My question has been on the Order Paper for some time and events have caught up with the problem mentioned in it.  Last night the House discussed that problem in depth.  I am concerned that the Cork-Kerry region has not been as successful as other regions in attracting industry and I should like the Minister to give an assurance that the IDA operation in Cork will be as effective as operations have been in other areas, such as the mid-west region.  That area has been very successful in the last <Col N="399" /> ten years through the influence of SFADCo.</P>

      <P>The number of IDA staff in Cork is 19 compared to eight in 1979.  That is a major improvement in the resources being deployed to attract industry to Cork.  The emphasis of this effort is on harnessing the skills and enterprises of local people in Cork and that is why there has been a complete devolution of executive responsibility in the small industries programme to Cork through a small industry board.  I would not like to get involved in comparisons between one region and another.  The experience of our nearest neighbour, Great Britain, has been a bad one as far as this is concerned.  In Great Britain different regions competed with one another and outbid one another for industry.  Industry was taken from one part of the country to another at great cost to the taxpayers.  It is better that regions should complement one another and co-operate rather than compete in this instance.</P>

He asked if the IDA have a mechanism for supplying this information and the answer is that they have otherwise they would not be preparing regional plans.  They will be providing that sort of information in their regional plans.  On the general question of employment needs in the north-east region, the North-Eastern Regional Development Organisation have been doing some work on this.  They have published &ldquo;Development Strategy for the North-Eastern Region 1983 to 2001&rdquo;.  They have produced various assumptions about employment availability in the region. They have produced two scenarios, one relating to a situation in which there would not be migration from the region, everybody staying in it and the population remaining static, and another which they entitle &ldquo;Migration Scenario&rdquo; which implies that some people would leave the region and go to other parts of the country. They have come up with a report on job needs per annum to 1988 and another on job needs per annum up to 2001. Between now and 1988 they reckon that the annual job needs will be in the region of 937, and the annual job needs to 2001 will be 201 over the period.  There are slightly smaller figures in their alternative scenario in which they allow for migration out of the region.  As far as manufacturing employment is concerned, in Louth during the period from January 1980 to November 1982 there was a decline of 1.4 per cent in the number engaged in manufacturing employment as against a national average in the same period of 0.53 per cent.  It is true that in terms of manufacturing job losses in Louth in that period there was a more rapid decline in manufacturing employment than nationwide.  The Deputy can draw his own political conclusions from those figures.</P>

These include ABS Pumps and Lett &amp; Co. In addition, 17 small industry projects commenced operations in the county last year which will lead to the creation of 100 jobs.  The IDA also negotiated a successful rescue package with Bergman for the former Janelle factory at Enniscorthy.</P>
      <P>There is a total of 113,500 sq. ft. of factory space available to the IDA for promotion in Wexford town.  In New Ross an advance factory of 25,600 sq. ft. is currently being constructed as are cluster units totalling 4,000 sq. ft. and 9,000 sq. ft. in Gorey and Enniscorthy respectively.

I have given it special attention also, having met people from the county to discuss their problems.  I do not believe we should look at the unemployment or the industrial problems on the basis of one county against another.  The fact is that the reasons for unemployment here are much more profound than neglect of one county against another by any State agency.  We have serious cost disadvantages which we must overcome in the industrial area, the energy field, in costs associated with labour and in regard to taxation deriving from excessive public expenditure.  We also have problems in regard to the organisation of industry where, in my view, there is insufficient identification of the employee with the interests of the firm, lack of opportunities for work shareholding in industry, problems of absenteeism and so forth.  It is at that wider level that politicians must seek to solve the unemployment problem.  I certainly concede that there is a political responsibility for unemployment in this country, not in the sense of one area vying with another but rather trying to solve the more profound causes of unemployment which very often are the failure of the political system to control its own expenditure, and resulting in excessive costs which have to be borne by the productive sector.</P>

      <P>Am I to take it from the Minister's answer that he does not intend to designate Wexford as an area in need of special attention?

      <P>The Deputy must realise that there are serious unemployment problems in every county in Ireland and there is no basis whatever for the allegation he is making that the IDA are not paying attention to County Wexford. They are paying particular attention to that county in view of what is recognised as the county's special unemployment problems, but this will not be solved by the type of opportunistic questioning the Deputy is engaged in.  Our unemployment problems will not be solved by robbing Peter to pay Paul, by taking from one county to benefit another.  We have got to be much more national than that in our approach to the unemployment problem.</P>

There are a number of reasons for some hope generally about industrial prospects during 1984 but it is undoubtedly true that there is not the stream of industrial projects available to the IDA for announcement that there was in the past. That points up what I was saying earlier, that if we are to solve our unemployment problems we must look at the more fundamental causes of unemployment on a national basis, not looking at one county against another.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the Industrial Development Authority are vigorously promoting Edenderry for industrial development.  The IDA have 23 acres of land available for industrial development in the town in addition to a cluster development of four 3,000 sq. ft. factory units which had been provided under a private finance arrangement.  The IDA are also promoting the former Group Textiles plant for a new project. Already, a number of promoters have visited these premises but no firm proposals have emerged to date.  I am not satisfied that designation of the Edenderry <Col N="412" /> area would be justified at this stage, bearing in mind the possible repercussions for other areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I note from the Minister's reply that there is nothing in the pipeline for the Edenderry electoral area. Since I put down a question two other companies have made workers redundant. In view of that would the Minister ask SFADCo, who are in the Ferbane electoral area and are operating in the Birr electoral area of County Offaly, to come in to back up the IDA who, in my opinion, have done very little on the ground?  Would the Minister extend the operations of SFADCo to the Edenderry electoral area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that the main closure recently in the Edenderry area was not in the manufacturing sector but was in the retail sector. I know that this creates problems for unemployment in Edenderry but it was not a closure which the IDA could have any power to avert.  I certainly agree that there are serious long-term industrial problems in Edenderry.  Since I became Minister I visited most of the major industrial plants in Edenderry and studied the problem there.  I know from discussions that manufacturers in Edenderry are particularly concerned about costs in the economy which are causing them competitive difficulties.  The long-term future, as I said in reply to earlier questions, of industry in Edenderry and elsewhere would be best secured by addressing the more fundamental problems we face in the industrial field.  I would be reluctant to give the Deputy any hope of expanding the SFADCo area as far east as Edenderry which is quite a distance from the area already covered by SFADCo.  As the Deputy is aware, this is confined to west Offaly.  We are talking here about the extreme east of the county.  I could see them becoming involved in Kildare very quickly if they became involved in Edenderry.  The meaning of SFADCo would become diffused if they were involved in areas as far flung as Edenderry and west Clare.  I have <Col N="413" /> told the Deputy that the industrial problems of the midlands must be looked at seriously.  I hope in due course that more industry will be attracted to the town.  We have been promoting the former Group Textiles plant in addition to the advance factory.  I will convey to the IDA his representations, as I will all representations made by Deputies in respect of different parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the serious unemployment <Col N="414" /> problem in Offaly, the fact that it has the third lowest industrial growth rate in the country and the fact that it is a midland county, would the Minister not agree that special treatment is overdue as regards industrial development there? On numerous occasions various Ministers for Industry and Commerce met deputations from Offaly but they never accepted the fact that we have such a low growth rate of industrial development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is being less than fair in saying that.  I met Offaly County Council to discuss this matter and accepted that the county faced special problems of industrial development.  I do not see the answer lying solely in the area of expanding SFADCo or designation or any of the other administrative means. There are plenty of opportunities to be taken in the small industrial sector in Offaly.  I have visited some outstandingly successful industrial projects in Offaly which started as one-man operations and now employ large numbers.  We should try to build on that kind of success rather than look for special treatment of the kind the Deputy has in mind.  It does not work.</P>

Three groups have visited Group Textiles in this context in the past six months.  A number of promoters have also visited the small industry cluster.  I do not have the precise number of these.  As regards the small industry cluster, this is particularly intended for local small industrialists. I should like to avail of this opportunity, which I hope will be reported in the local press, to invite local people with business ideas in the Edenderry area to <Col N="415" /> consider establishing industries themselves in one of these cluster units.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the number of small firms which depend on the dyehouse service of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  I understand that there have been some problems for the institute in meeting the increased demand for this service following the closure in 1983 of the only private dyehouse operating in Ireland on a commission basis.</P>
      <P>The institute have assured me that they are committed to the continuation of this service and are currently examining the possibilities for some expansion of the service within the limits of available resources.</P>
      <P>I understand that the IDA have approved grant assistance to a local firm towards the take over of the private dyehouse service which closed in 1983.  This should help alleviate some of the demand on the IIRS service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we have an assurance that the resources made available to the IIRS will be sufficient to meet the demands for this service?  There are over 60 small industries from Donegal to Wexford in the textile area depending solely on the dyehouse service of the IIRS.  This time last year they employed up to 2,000 people.  Unfortunately, because the IIRS could not meet the demand and with the consequent cash flow crisis and lay-offs in the industry the number involved has dropped somewhat.  We heard earlier from the Minister the efforts the IDA are making to create jobs.  Can we not ensure <Col N="416" /> that these 2,000 jobs will be secure?  This argument has been going on for over two years and we have got no further.  The situation is still appalling.  The IIRS cannot meet the needs of the industry and I would like to know what can be done immediately without further deliberation.</P>

      <P>The proposal from the management of the IIRS to improve their dyehouse facilities is under consideration by the board of that body.  They will be proceeding to make arrangements which will improve the situation.  I have also indicated in regard to the type of activity that would be suitable in the previously operated private dyehouse that facilities will be available now on a commissioned basis from the new promoter for a fabric dying service.  The main business of the IIRS is in yarn dyeing.  There is a problem that small lot dyeing is not a very economic activity and the IIRS have had to increase their fees for this purpose to cover their costs.  I understand that the users could make some contribution towards reducing costs by concerting the type of request they make to the dyehouse to achieve some economies of scale in the type of work done in the IIRS.  I am assured that the IIRS would welcome discussion with the people concerned to progress matters further within what are very constrained financial resources.  I understand the IIRS will be doing their best to meet the demand for services of this kind.</P>

I understand, however, that they will be doing something about this which will help but whether it will be enough to meet all of the Deputy's many requests in this matter I cannot as yet say.  At any rate there will be an improvement.  A useful purpose would be served by further discussions between <Col N="417" /> the users and the IIRS to see what further contribution the users could make towards helping this process.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should realise that the enforcement of any point of law is a matter for the Garda Síochána or, in so far as it may come into this House, is a matter for the Minister for Justice.  I would not wish to get involved in the deployment of resources of the Garda Síochána.  However, any Garda station to whom any kind of crime is reported is well fit to ensure that the requisite information is passed on to whichever part of the Garda Síochána organisation has responsibility for it.  If people have complaints to make they should not wait until they know exactly which person in which room in Dublin Castle is responsible.  They should go straight to the local Garda station and make their complaint.  They can be assured it will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Work is in progress on the <Col N="420" /> east Meath regional water supply scheme &mdash; stage 4.  When completed this scheme will provide additional storage capacity for the Dunshaughlin, Duleek, Kilbride, Ratoath and Stamullen areas.  I have now approved Meath County Council's proposal for the augmentation of the existing scheme from ground water sources which will yield 594,000 gallons per day.  To meet the future requirements of the area Meath County Council have asked the consultants to examine the east Meath scheme and to design a scheme which will meet the long-term requirements of the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state when the extra 500,000 gallons to which he has referred will be provided?  Will that quantity be available before the summer? Is he aware that the Ashbourne area, which draws approximately 1 million gallons from the Drogheda Corporation, needs 2.4 million gallons?  Even if they were to get the extra 500,000 gallons they would still be one million gallons short of the demand in the area.  Will the Minister indicate when the extra 500,000 gallons and the other one million gallons will be available?</P>

      <P>With regard to the further questions, there will be some easing when the Drogheda scheme is augmented.  Additional water suplies will be available from that augmentation when stage five has been completed.  Contract documents will be approved of by me within the next week.  The completion date of that scheme will be somewhere around June of 1986.  It is inherent in the plan that the total provision of water from that scheme will be 9,000 cubic metres per day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations at present require that windscreens be made of safety glass.  In practice, this means either laminated or toughened glass.  Most new road vehicles, in fact, have laminated windscreens.  A proposal relating to the use of safety glass in vehicles is under consideration by the EEC.  The points at issue have not yet been resolved.  At this stage, it would not be appropriate to amend existing Irish regulations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the toughened glass to which he has referred shatters on impact and scatters and that a number of people have had very serious eye injuries through involvement in motor accidents where this toughened glass was the type used in their cars, rather than laminated glass?  This laminated glass, I understand, is maintained intact after impact and minimises the possibility <Col N="422" /> of serious eye injury.  Has the Minister any statistics on the number of people who have suffered either loss of sight or serious damage to their eyesight arising from the splintering of glass in car accidents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not statistics about such injuries.  Most vehicles in Ireland today are fitted with laminated glass windscreens, including Ford, Toyota, Datsun, Fiat, Volkswagen, British Leyland, Talbot, Vauxhall, Opel, Citroen, Peugeot and Renault.  Virtually all the new vehicles on the market made by these companies are fitted with laminated glass windscreens.  In some cases &mdash; Datsun and Renault in their cheaper models, British Leyland for the Mini-Metro and the Maestro, fit toughened safety glass in the windscreens, but the vast majority have now changed to laminated glass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not make a list of the vehicles which do not have laminated glass.  It would be much more helpful if he did.  Why is he reluctant to introduce our own regulations making it mandatory on motor assembly companies to use laminated glass?  I do not want to be rising every few minutes, but would point that the Deputy who put down this question had a sad experience of being involved in a motor accident in which he nearly lost the sight of his eyes because laminated glass was not used in his vehicle. Why should we have to wait for the EEC to make some decision in this matter? Surely we can use our own discretion. There is a clear need for regulations of this kind.  Would it be possible to introduce such under the Road Safety Bill which is at present on the Order Paper and will be coming before the House fairly soon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons is that this area will be covered by the EEC directive on which there is consultation and it is hoped that a decision will be made on it in the near future.  The argument that toughened glass is perhaps less safe is one on which there is considerable disagreement by the experts.  Therefore, <Col N="423" /> I would not like to make the decision in this House to bring in a special regulation for car builders to use only laminated glass when the experts cannot agree as to which is the safer.  I would prefer this debate to continue in the EEC and a decision to be made.  Then all cars will have to have the same type of glass and the experts will have to come to a decision, one way or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is scope for joint venture projects based on privatisation or partnership arrangements between local authorities and private interests and I am anxious to encourage soundly based projects of this nature.  I have seen a copy of the address referred to by Deputy Leonard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Projects currently being carried out as joint ventures between local authorities and private developers include a bridge over the river Liffey at Ringsend and a multi-storey car park at Marlborough Street, Dublin.  Proposals for further projects being considered at present include <Col N="425" /> a bridge over the river Liffey at Palmerstown, as part of the Dublin western parkway scheme, and multi-storey car parks at Drury Lane, Dublin, and Lavitt's Quay, Cork.</P>
    <P>On the housing side, a joint venture arrangement has been in operation since February 1982 whereby local authorities may enter into a special agreement with builders under which they provide them with sites or building land at a price based on the cost of acquisition for the purposes of building modestly priced houses for sale to selected purchasers.  I understand that a number of housing schemes under this arrangement have been undertaken or are being considered at various locations around the country.</P>
    <P>In a number of areas the local authorities provide developed housing sites, either for small builders or persons building their own houses, on the basis of acquisition and development costs.  In these cases the persons concerned can receive the benefit of a site subsidy payable by my Department to the local authority, provided specified conditions are met.</P>
    <P>Joint venture or privatisation arrangements have operated in the case of a number of major sanitary services projects in the past with funding being shared by the local authorities and the relevant industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some local authorities have entered into joint venture schemes for the construction of local authority houses.  Will the Minister encourage greater participation in such joint venture schemes to accelerate the construction of local authority houses and houses that will become available to people who qualify under the local authority housing waiting lists?  What action is the Minister taking to encourage local authorities to become more and more involved in joint venture schemes? I am aware there are a few schemes dribbling along but there does not seem to be any great enthusiasm from the Department or from the Minister so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be accepted <Col N="426" /> what local authorities can do in this area. If it requires me to put pressure on them to expand their activities I shall have no difficulty on that score, but local authorities and their members are well aware of what can be done.  Certainly my Department will encourage any authority that wishes to proceed along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House recognises the urgent need for the construction of homes for the large numbers of people awaiting them on local authority housing lists.  My question is to ask the Minister &mdash; and perhaps he would answer it directly &mdash; what he is doing to encourage local authorities to involve themselves in joint venture schemes for the purpose of increasing the output of local authority houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Encouragement to build houses by my Department, or through pressure from me, is best done by providing adequate sums in the Estimate for the building of houses and certainly also in assuring local authorities that they can put forward proposals, such as the Deputy has suggested, for consideration by my Department when they will certainly receive a very sympathetic hearing.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> As I was saying before Question Time, I should like to thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their contributions to this debate and for the responsible and constructive approach they adopted to the Bill.  By and large those who spoke supported the Bill and I welcome that.  It is apparent also that Deputies appreciate the seriousness of the crime problem confronting us and the urgent need to take measures to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I indicated in my introductory statement that I am ready to consider any reasonable proposals aimed at improving the Bill.  That is still my attitude.  I should make it clear, however, that the Government consider that the Bill is broadly the right approach and that its general thrust is fundamentally right in principle.  But we shall be looking at the provisions again in their entirety before Committee Stage and there may be scope for some amendments.  Naturally, I will take into account very seriously the views expressed in this House while, at the same time, paying due attention to views expressed by people who are not Members of this House who have also contributed to the external debate which was going on contemporaneously with this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the points made during the debate relate to matters of detail.  I would hope to deal with them also on Committee Stage.  Others relate to matters that come within the ambit of my Department generally but are not within the scope of the Bill.  I dealt with those already this morning.  I shall try to deal with as many of them as possible, however briefly, in the course of my reply but since the debate has been a very long one I could not possibly respond now to every point. There will be ample opportunity for <Col N="452" /> Deputies to make specific points on Committee Stage and I shall be happy to deal with them then.</P>
    <P>I will begin by responding to some of the points made about the proposed power of detention and related provisions &mdash; sections 3 to 8.  The need to give the Garda a power of detention for serious crime has been widely recognised, although some Deputies expressed misgivings about the adequacy of the safeguards being provided.  Perhaps the most important suggestion made was that a system of custodial guardians should be introduced along the lines recommended in the Ó Briain Report.</P>
    <P>The Government considered this idea very carefully before the Bill was finalised but decided against it.  The main options seemed to be between having guardians drawn from the Garda &mdash; sergeants or inspectors &mdash; and having independent lay persons to do the job.</P>
    <P>There are substantial practical difficulties associated with having independent lay persons for a task such as this.  It must be doubted whether it would be possible, for example, to get people of the right degree of competence and responsibility to take on what would be a very tedious job to be done in very uncongenial surroundings. Some sort of special paid service would have to be created if enough people were going to be available at all hours of the day and night.  In the present very difficult economic climate that is, I think, asking rather a lot.  But it is not simply a question of cost.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of whether, if the system were to be credible, questioning could be permitted at all in the absence of a guardian.  The period immediately following the arrest of the suspect &mdash; perhaps the first hour &mdash; may be a crucial one for obtaining a statement from the suspect about his involvement in the crime or for obtaining other evidence or apprehending accomplices.  If the Garda had to delay questioning during this vital period to await the arrival at the station of a guardian who might have to be summoned from his sleep in the middle of the night, investigations could be seriously hampered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> During this debate, and in the course of the public debate on the Bill outside this House, the idea of having some identifiable member of the force responsible for the well-being of the detained person and for seeing to it that he was informed of and was accorded his rights, came up more than once.  There are arguments in favour of this but there are also real practical difficulties.  I intend to look at it again however, to see whether something along those lines could be worked out.</P>
    <P>Although I said in my introductory remarks that the period of detention of six hours &mdash; or 12 with an extension &mdash; applies no matter how many offences are being investigated simultaneously, the idea seems to persist that, once a person has been detained for an offence, the Garda can keep thinking up new offences and so extending the period of detention. It has even been suggested that the Bill permits unlimited detention.</P>
    <P>This interpretation of the effect of section 3 is not in accord with reality.  The clear intention is to permit detention for a maximum of 12 hours &mdash; excluding a period between midnight to 8 a.m. where questioning does not take place.  However, I shall have the drafting re-examined, and if there seems to be any real possibility of ambiguity, I am entirely willing to introduce an amendment at committee stage to put the matter beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion was that a person may be rearrested and subjected to further periods of detention for different offences arising from the same set of circumstances. For example, a person suspected of robbery in which a stolen car was used could be detained first for the stolen car.  He would then be released and re-arrested for the robbery.  There is no question of this.  All the offences involved in a particular incident that are known to the Garda must be investigated at the same time.  They cannot adopt a piecemeal approach and thus prolong the detention period.</P>
    <P>But we cannot prohibit rearrest and detention for an offence which is not connected with that incident.  Here again, I am willing to have the drafting looked at to remove any abiguity but I must <Col N="454" /> emphasise one point.  Any attempt to draft legislation of this kind in a way that would exclude extreme or perverse interpretations would in fact be dangerous.  If one set out to exclude the extreme or perverse interpretations in one case, the courts may be forced to admit the possibility of such an interpretation in other cases on the principle that when the Oireachtas wants to exclude such an interpretation it says so.  We cannot &mdash; and I suggest should not &mdash; attempt to legislate as if the courts were not there to stand between the citizen and an oppressive application of the law.</P>
    <P>The point was also made that there was nothing in the Bill to preclude the use of section 30 of the Offences against the State Act and section 3 of the Bill in succession for the same offence so that a person could be detained initially for up to 48 hours under section 30 and then released and rearrested and held for up to 20 hours.</P>
    <P>While, on the face of it, this might seem to be a theoretical possibility merely because it is not specifically prohibited, personally I do not accept it in the sense that it would clearly be an abuse and there is no possibility that the courts could deem it to be a reasonable application of the law.  However, I propose to look at it again though with the reservations I have mentioned earlier about the positive dangers of attempting to spell out every last detail as if the courts could not be trusted to act in accordance with reason.</P>
    <P>Deputies Shatter and Molony in particular made a number of points about the exercise by a suspect of his right of access to a solicitor.  Section 4 provides that a detained person must be informed &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; of his right to consult a solicitor and that, if he so requests, the solicitor must be notified &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; has been criticised on the grounds that it would permit the Garda to delay notifying the solicitor.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that that is correct.  &ldquo;As soon as practicable&rdquo; recognises that it may not be possible to contact a solicitor at a particular time.  If there are no difficulties about contacting him, then the <Col N="455" /> obligation arises immediately.  This is a well-recognised phrase of a kind which the courts are frequently called upon to apply in various sets of circumstances.</P>
    <P>It was also said that the Bill does not say how much time may elapse before a detained person may see a solicitor and that it is not clear whether a solicitor may remain with the person during the course of questioning.</P>
    <P>The right of access to a solicitor as defined by the courts is a right of reasonable access and, in this regard, the courts have said that what is reasonable must be considered having regard to all the circumstances of each individual case.  It is not intended that the solicitor should be allowed to remain during the course of questioning.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by Deputy Shatter that provision should be made for a code of practice regarding the treatment of detained persons and the questioning of suspects.  Some Deputies also suggested that there should be a duty on the Garda to keep a written record relating to detention, a copy of which would be given to a person who is released without charge.</P>
    <P>I do not think there would be any objection in principle to the idea of a written record to be given to a person on release but there could be considerable practical difficulties and we could find ourselves building up a system involving costly paperwork that would have very little, if any, real value.  As far as a code of practice is concerned, it is certain that there will have to be a code of practice but it is another matter to say that it should have some kind of statutory force. We cannot overlook the point that there appears to be a great deal of truth in the complaints made by the Garda that already &mdash; and even with the increased powers in the Bill &mdash; they will be operating under more rigid constraints than almost any police force they know of. The laws &mdash; including court decisions &mdash; impose very extensive restrictions on the admissibility of evidence even when its relevance and accuracy are not in question. It would be a big step to introduce the concept of a statutory code of practice if the implication was &mdash; as it would seem <Col N="456" /> to be &mdash; that a departure from that code could lead to the exclusion of relevant evidence that was not obtained by any oppressive means.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods said that we should consider whether the application of the Bill to all offences carrying five years' imprisonment is not too wide.  Could we, for example, remove some less serious offences from the scope of the Bill?</P>
    <P>The Government gave very careful consideration to this point.  We looked at the question of having a list of offences to which the provisions of the Bill would apply.  However, there were serious practical drawbacks about having such a list. For one thing, it would have added to the complications the Garda already have to face arising from the number of lists they have to operate with at present for different purposes.  In addition, there are so many very serious offences that come within the five year formula &mdash; and all of them would have had to be covered &mdash; that the list would have been extremely long and complicated.  The five-year formula is straightforward and avoids these difficulties.  There is hardly an offence within it that ought not to be within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>References have been made in this context to some offences carrying five years' imprisonment, such as petty larceny and shoplifting.  If we were to isolate a few offences of that kind, one could undoubtedly make a point but even then, I would suggest, not a conclusive one, because these offences are very often part of a pattern which raises the matter to a different level of seriousness.  There is no practicable method that I can see of &ldquo;breaking up&rdquo; larceny &mdash; as far as this Bill is concerned &mdash; into minor and serious offences.  The only place that distinction can be made is in the court which can assess the facts.  I do not see how one can operate a system where the larceny of a very large sum of money is treated differently under law from the larceny of a small sum, unless we changed the Larceny Act and divide seriousness of offences in relation to the amount of money taken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods suggested that there should be a duty imposed on the Garda <Col N="457" /> to destroy all copies and records of photographs and fingerprints.  That is already explicitly provided for in section 6 (1) and I do not see that it can be made more explicit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods and Deputy Shatter also suggested that the taking and retention of fingerprints of persons who are given the benefit of the Probation Act was contrary to the spirit of that Act.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I have to disagree with that. The Probation Act is widely used in our courts and even people who have several previous convictions are sometimes dealt with under it.  The application of the Act means that the accused person is proved to have committed the offence and the reality is that such a person may commit other crimes.  Consequently, the Garda need to be able to fingerprint such a person so as to assist subsequent detections. Once they have been found to have committed an offence, I cannot agree that they have any ground for complaint at the fact that the Garda will have a record.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that there should be an overall time limit on the retention of records in relation to a convicted person who has served his sentence or who has not been in trouble with the law for a substantial number of years. Again, I cannot agree.  At present there is no time limit and fingerprints of convicted persons are retained indefinitely. However, I would emphasise that access to fingerprint records is strictly confined to the Garda Síochána and that such records provide essential information in criminal investigations.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made during the course of the debate by several Deputies that stripsearching should not be prohibited where there was suspicion that items such as weapons, stolen money, etc. were concealed &mdash; in other words, it should not be confined, as the Bill proposes, to drugs and explosives.</P>
    <P>I can see the force of this argument but we must also keep in mind that stripsearching is inherently distasteful and, I believe, it should only be done where the need is very strong.  I would be against any extension of what is in the Bill relating to personal searches unless what is <Col N="458" /> there is found by experience to be inadequate.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested that the Bill would allow female suspects to be strip-searched by male gardaí.  The Minister of State at my Department felt compelled &mdash; quite rightly in my view &mdash; to issue a statement to rebut this allegation.  The Garda Code already explicitly prohibits any search whatsoever of a female by a male garda and no instance of a breach of that instruction has ever come to my notice.  Accordingly, I do not see a need to include a specific provision in the Bill to the effect that a search of a person must be conducted by a garda of the same sex.  For much the same reason as I mentioned earlier about the dangers of trying to exclude extreme interpretations, I am firmly against such a provision, precisely because it would be absurd to suggest that such a search would not be a serious abuse of power.  We should remember that the Bill does not give power to strip search or body search.  These powers exist already in the case of drugs legislation and searches for explosives.  This Bill gives power to search, but not to strip search or body search.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed about the provisions in section 14 and section 15, which make it an offence for a person found in unlawful possession of a firearm or ammunition or in possession of stolen property to fail or refuse, without reasonable excuse, to give an account of how he came by the weapon or stolen property as the case may be.  It has been said that these provisions could be used to require information from &ldquo;anybody with anything in his hand or pocket&rdquo; or from social or youth workers.  This sort of comment is quite misleading.</P>
    <P>Let me take section 14, dealing with firearms and ammunition first.  Is it not clear that what is in question here is a person found in unlawful possession of firearms or ammunition?  I have to stress that because it seems to be overlooked that a serious offence may already have been committed before the section can apply.  Consequently, we are not dealing here with innocent people going about their business.  The object of the section is to get information about the suppliers <Col N="459" /> of these weapons because, as everybody knows, there is a trade in the supply of weapons, such as sawn-off shotguns, for use in crime.  It is unreasonable, having regard to the death and destruction that is being caused, to require a man with a revolver, who has no licence for it and, therefore, no business having it, to say where he got the gun?  I think not, especially when we are providing that the information requested cannot be used against him or his spouse.</P>
    <P>As regards section 15, which is to the same effect but relates to stolen property, the garda who finds the person in possession of the property must have reasonable grounds for believing that an offence consisting of stealing or some related offence has been committed.  The provision does not empower the Garda to stop and search people for stolen property.  We are dealing only with a situation where a garda finds a person in possession of property.  The garda must have reasonable grounds for believing that that property is part of property that is believed to have been stolen.  He must then inform the person of his belief and he must tell him in ordinary language what the effect of not giving the information might be. Moreover, the offence is not committed if the person has a &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; for withholding the information.  There is also the safeguard that any information given cannot be used in evidence against the person or his spouse.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that any person living in an area with high levels of crime who is found in possession of property or money is liable to be detained for up to 20 hours.  I think that it is sufficient to say about that suggestion that it is without foundation.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed that the new power of detention and the provisions dealing with withholding information about firearms and stolen property will have an adverse effect on the relations between the Garda and the community. I do not believe that this will be the case and for two reasons.  First, there are substantial safeguards to ensure that they cannot be used indiscriminately or arbitrarily.  Second, the existence of <Col N="460" /> recognised but strictly limited and controlled powers as now proposed should in fact lessen the pressures on gardaí to enter a grey area where it was not always clear whether the suspects were being detained unlawfully or not.  It is quite clear that this Bill gives no power to the Garda to go out arresting persons on so-called &ldquo;fishing expeditions&rdquo;.  Some people seem to have misunderstood how the power of detention will operate and I would like to take this opportunity to stress one or two important features.</P>
    <P>First, the Bill does not provide for any new powers of arrest.  Before the powers of detention and the related provisions in the Bill can be used several conditions must be satisfied.  There must be a valid arrest under existing law.  The arresting garda must suspect that the person arrested has committed a serious offence and there must be reasonable cause for his suspicion.  It is well established that under existing law an arrested person must also be told the reason for his arrest and this is why we have not included a provision to that effect in the Bill.  The reasonableness or otherwise of the garda's suspicion on which the arrest is founded and the circumstances surrounding the arrest are open to review by the courts.  In other words, the question of what constitutes reasonable cause is an objective test based on all the circumstances and not a purely subjective one confined to the mind of the garda alone.</P>
    <P>When the arrested person is brought to the Garda station the member in charge, who is usually of sergeant rank, must have reasonable grounds for believing that detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence. Again, the reasonableness of the grounds of his belief would be open to review by the courts if the matter became an issue. If he believed that there were no reasonable grounds for detention, the arrested person would have to be released.  So he will have to satisfy himself on the point.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that the new powers might be applied in respect of petty offenders with subsequent damage to the Garda/community relations, there would not, in normal circumstances, be legal authority for detention in <Col N="461" /> such cases because there would not be reasonable grounds for believing that detention would be necessary for the proper investigation of such offences.  In the great majority of such cases evidence would already be available to enable charges to be brought straightaway or to proceed by way of summons.  I would stress that it is well established law that if a statute says that a garda has to have reasonable grounds for suspicion, it does not mean simply that he says or even genuinely believes he has reasonable grounds.  These grounds must exist objectively. We also know that, as a practical matter, the Garda are already hard pressed in dealing with serious crime and they have neither the time nor the accommodation for detaining petty offenders.</P>
    <P>I believe that, by helping to remove the hardened criminals from certain areas, these provisions will do a valuable service to the law-abiding people living there and that most people will see them in that light.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 to 18 of the Bill which allow a court or jury to draw inferences from the silence of an accused in certain circumstances, have come in for criticism &mdash; strongly put in a number of instances. Let me acknowledge at once that I do not wish the remarks I am going to make to be taken as in any sense faulting any Deputies for their outspoken views.  I think it is fair to say that some of the vitally important features of the provisions &mdash; features which will operate as essential safeguards &mdash; have been ignored or else have been &ldquo;glossed over&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molony asked me to say why these provisions are considered necessary. What I am going to say is directed at section 16 but it will also apply, with some modifications, to sections 17 and 18.  One of the objectives of the section is to eliminate the existing artificial distinction between what can and cannot be said by the trial judge in relation to the silence of the accused when being questioned or charged and to enable the judge, and consequently the prosecution, to comment in a commonsense way on the fact that a person seeks in court to offer an explanation for his behaviour that he could reasonably have been <Col N="462" /> expected to have offered earlier but failed to do so.</P>
    <P>In my view it is impossible to defend the distinction which the law makes between what the judge can say and what he cannot.  It flies in the face of common sense and, if we never had a crime problem in this country, we would want to make this change at the earliest opportunity. As I said in my introductory remarks, the judge can tell the jury that the failure of the accused to mention to the police a fact that he relies on in his defence is a matter they can take into account in determining the weight to be attached to his evidence but must not invite them to infer from it that his defence is false and that therefore he is guilty.  For the judge to invite the jury to draw such an inference is a misdirection even if their common sense tells them that that is the only logical inference.  Many eminent lawyers &mdash; among them Professor Glanville Williams and the late Sir Rupert Cross &mdash; have concluded that this puts the judge in the position of having to talk &ldquo;gobbledegook&rdquo; to the jury. Nobody can, I think, defend legal provisions that produce that kind of result.</P>
    <P>That apart, I do not think that in present day circumstances &mdash; considering all the advantages an accused has &mdash; it could possibly be regarded as unfair to an accused to draw an appropriate inference from his putting forward an exculpatory explanation which he chooses to give at the trial if he could have given it to the police.  Some people think we should go even further and require accused persons to put forward a book of defence pleadings or that we should completely abolish the right to silence, making it compulsory for an accused to give evidence at his trial.  I am not implying that that would be justified, but it is a view that a number of reasonable people hold.</P>
    <P>It has been said &mdash; quite wrongly, I suggest &mdash; that the effect of section 16 will be to require a person being questioned by the police to respond to unfounded allegations and that such a person would, in the absence of legal advice, have to decide essentially legal points about what might or might not be material to his defence.  It was said that <Col N="463" /> to put the accused in such a position in a police station, bearing in mind that he might be a relatively unintelligent person, is fundamentally unfair.</P>
    <P>This kind of comment ignores some of the essential safeguards of the section and incidentally ignores also the fundamental role of the courts.  An inference can only be drawn from a failure to mention a fact which</P>
    <P>in the circumstances existing at the time (the accused) could reasonably have been expected to mention ......</P>
    <P>The court or the jury will decide whether it would have been reasonable to expect the person being questioned or charged to have mentioned the fact at the time.  Common sense indicates that they would take into account, in deciding these matters, whether the accused was confused or of low intelligence or whether, because of lack of legal advice early on or otherwise, he could not reasonably have been expected to mention the fact at issue.  As regards the issue of unfounded allegations, I find difficulty in understanding how such an issue could arise at all in court but if it did I cannot see how any court or jury could ever think it was reasonable to expect a person to disclose something in response to unfounded allegations.</P>
    <P>But that is not the only safeguard. Even if the accused had failed to mention something he could reasonably have been expected to mention and which he now mentions in court, the court or jury may draw only such inferences &ldquo;as appear proper&rdquo;.  A trial is presided over by an experienced lawyer &mdash; the judge &mdash; and it will be for him to guide the jury.  There may have been reasons for silence consistent with innocence and that fact can be and no doubt will be emphasised.  The accused may be unable &mdash; because of confusion, as has been said &mdash; to remember some fact which could clear him.  He might wish to conceal some embarrassing fact about where he was at the time or he may want to protect a member of his family.  But, of course, if one pushes that kind of argument, it could be suggested <Col N="464" /> that a person may confess to a crime for the same reason.  The law as enacted by Parliament cannot do more than set down the principles and procedures &mdash; it cannot itself administer justice which is and must be a function of the courts.  And it will be for the court &mdash; or the jury with the help of the judge's directions &mdash; to decide whether, having regard to all the circumstances, it would be proper to draw an adverse inference.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea questioned the provision in subsection (3) of section 16 which relates to the admissibility in evidence of the silence or other reaction of the accused in certain circumstances.  This provision and similar provisions in sections 17 and 18 are designed simply to preserve the existing law.  This allows evidence to be given of an accused person's reaction, say, to the news of a murder, if it is relevant, and whether he is in police custody or not.  Under existing law an adverse inference may be drawn in such circumstances.  There is no change here in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This morning Deputy Keating referred also to this section and made the point, which is certainly worthy of examination, that at times it might be appropriate that an accused could inform the presiding judge confidentially of a matter such as is raised in these sections.  It presents a difficulty in that justice must be seen to be done in open court.  Under our system I am not sure if it is possible to provide an amendment which would allow the confidential imparting of information to a judge.  Certainly the matter is worthy of examination and I will look at it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question of what effect certain provisions in the Bill &mdash; particularly those relating to inferences &mdash; would have on the Judges' Rules.  The Bill does not abolish the Judges' Rules but the effect of sections 14 to 18 will be to change the caution that the suspect has to be given by gardaí. Before I deal with the change, I should perhaps indicate something of the background to the rules.</P>
    <P>These rules are essentially administrative directions issued by the English judges for the guidance of the police in the early part of this century and they <Col N="465" /> have been adopted by our courts.  They relate to questioning persons in custody and suspects generally and they specify the caution that the police should administer. They also specify when the caution should be administered.  They do not have the force of law but, if they are contravened, the trial judge has a discretion to exclude from evidence any statement obtained.</P>
    <P>On the enactment of sections 16 to 18, the Garda will be obliged to inform the person being questioned or charged in ordinary language what the effect of them is, that is to say, that adverse inferences might be drawn under section 16 from his failure to mention some fact that he subsequently relies on in his defence or, under sections 17 or 18, from his failure or refusal to account for the presence of a particular object, substance or mark in his possession or on his person, or for his own presence in a particular place.</P>
    <P>As regards the inferences that may be drawn under section 16, the person will not be legally obliged to mention any particular matter and he will be told that that is his right, as at present.  But he will also be told that if there is any fact that he intends to rely on in his defence in court it would be advisable for him to mention it as otherwise his evidence might be less likely to be believed and this could have a bad effect on his case in general.  And as regards sections 17 and 18, he will be similarly advised of the possible consequences of failing or refusing to account for objects, marks, etc.  It is intended that suitable forms of words will be worked out.</P>
    <P>Sections 14 and 15 differ substantially from sections 16 to 18 in that they impose a legal requirement on the person being questioned to give information about illegally held weapons or stolen property so that effectively his right to remain silent about those specific matters will no longer apply.  Of course, it is provided that any information he does give cannot be used against him.</P>
    <P>The point I wish to make about the inference sections is that the new formula will not be inconsistent with telling a suspect that he has a right to remain silent. That will still be true.  It is only in the <Col N="466" /> strictly limited cases of illegally held weapons and stolen property that a suspect will be required to give information under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies &mdash; even those who criticised the sections of the Bill dealing with detention or inferences &mdash; expressed themselves to be generally satisfied with most of the other provisions of the Bill. Those in relation to bail, alibis and majority verdicts seemed to have been particularly welcomed.  However, there were some points made that I think I should respond to.</P>
    <P>This morning Deputy De Rossa referred to four different aspects of the Bill on which he was in fundamental disagreement. I have dealt with most of them already with the exception of the increased jurisdiction of the District Court.  In that section of Deputy De Rossa's speech there was a misunderstanding of what is actually being proposed in the Bill.  The jurisdiction of the court being increased to impose sentences of two years would apply only to consecutive sentences.  It is not a general increase in the jurisdiction of the District Court which seems to be the interpretation the Deputy took from the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly indicated surprise at the approach in the Bill to the problem of offences committed while on bail.  What he suggested was that we should change the law relating to the granting of bail so that bail could be refused where there was evidence that the accused was likely to commit further offences while on bail. This approach would meet the decision of the Supreme Court in the O'Callaghan case head on.  He went on to say that if the Supreme Court rejected the legislation we should have a referendum to decide the issue.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that the views of Deputy Kelly in such an issue must command respect and it seems to me, at all events, that the case he made out for saying that preventive detention is already known to the law is a persuasive one.  However, I think that there would be a serious danger that the kind of legislation he recommends would in fact be rejected by the Supreme Court and, having regard to the history of the matter, <Col N="467" /> the Government decided that, on balance, it was better to attempt the approach in the Bill.  Of course, if the bail problem were to persist the possibility of having a referendum on the question could not be ruled out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods questioned the necessity for section 25 which relates to bringing a person charged with an offence before a district justice or peace commissioner. He asked for clarification.  As I said in my introductory statement, section 15 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 &mdash; which is being amended &mdash; applies only to persons arrested on a warrant. We are extending it to persons who are arrested without warrant and charged with an offence.  In both cases such persons have been charged with an offence. Section 25 provides for the bringing of such persons before a district justice or peace commissioner.  We are also taking the opportunity of putting in statutory form the common law relating to persons charged late at night.  Such persons do not have to be brought before a court until the following morning and we are simply maintaining this.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have made the point that, as section 26 stands, it is not obligatory on the Minister to make regulations for electronic recording.  I accept this view at least as being arguable though I would see it as being very close to a legal obligation and possibly an enforceable obligation if there were any culpable failure to act on it.  I want to make it quite clear that the only reason that the section says &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is that there is a clear and serious need to have the system thoroughly worked out on the basis of pilot schemes and study of what has been learned elsewhere, and so on. We all of us recognise a clear need to proceed on these lines but we have to deal with the practical problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter proposed that it should be obligatory on the Garda to explain to the court at the trial the reasons for any failure to record questioning and to provide that the court or jury could draw appropriate inferences from the explanation.</P>
    <P>I do not see the need for a statutory <Col N="468" /> provision in this regard.  When electronic recording of questioning is introduced generally it will obviously be open to the defence to raise the question why tape recording was not carried out in a particular case.  If there is not a good reason, the court or jury will be able to draw its own conclusions.</P>
    <P>Until the committee examining the introduction of tape recording has considered the point and reported to me on it I would not want to do anything that would prejudice the admissibility in evidence of statements that had not been tape recorded.  There will always be reasons why tape recording will be impossible in particular cases and we could never achieve a situation in which a recording could be made of everything that happens between a suspect and a garda from the moment of arrest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly raised the question of tampering with tapes.  That used to be one of the principal arguments against bringing in tape recording.  However, I am advised that devices are now available that would &ldquo;give the game away&rdquo; if there is any tampering, such as a built-in timing mechanism on the tapes and an audio track with a high pitched tone that is not audible on a play-back.  These are matters that the committee will be looking at in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly also spoke at some length about the need to reverse the effect of the Supreme Court decision in the O'Shea case.  That was to the effect that the DPP can appeal an acquittal in the Central Criminal Court to the Supreme Court.  I would not necessarily disagree with any of what he says and I may move an amendment on Committee Stage to achieve this.  However I need more time to consider the matter, but I shall let the Deputy know if I decide not to move an amendment at some stage so that he may have an opportunity to do so himself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly and one or two other Deputies made the interesting suggestion that a time limit might be put on the operation of certain provisions of the Bill on the lines of emergency legislation and that provision might be made for the suspension of any particular section if <Col N="469" /> abuses became apparent.</P>
    <P>I would not entirely dismiss this idea but I can see objections to it.  I think that all, or virtually all, the provisions of the Bill &mdash; I am referring to the central ones such as detention, the bail provisions, the inferences sections and improved trial procedures &mdash; are necessary to enable the Garda and the courts to do their job properly.  They are not, as I said before, solely related to the current crime problem which may be a temporary phenomenon. For that reason, they are not reforms that lend themselves to an &ldquo;on-off&rdquo; approach.  The Garda, no less than any other police force, need a power of detention and I cannot foresee a time when they will not need it.  It would be wrong to give a contrary impression.</P>
    <P>Moreover, court procedures will develop as a result of the changes we are making in this Bill in rules of evidence and in practice and procedure.  It would not be desirable to alter these again after a short period of time.  The law needs to be settled.  However, this is a point for further reflection and I will think about it between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers recommended the creation of various new offences in the Bill.  Deputy Woods suggested that dishonest handling of stolen goods should be made an offence and Deputy David Andrews thought that pickpocketing and handbag snatching should be dealt with specifically in the Bill.  Deputy Brady thought that there was a case to be made for making loitering an offence for which the Garda could arrest without warrant on suspicion.  In fact, this Bill does not set out to create new offences except where this is necessary in order to strengthen the hands of the Garda in enforcing existing law.  These proposals for new offences are really appropriate for other legislation.</P>
    <P>As regards dishonest handling, I accept that there is a case for amending the present law in some such way as Deputy Woods suggested.  I have proposals before the Government in a separate measure that will cover various forms of handling stolen goods other than receiving, but any comprehensive changes in the law relating to receiving must await <Col N="470" /> a review of the Larceny Acts which cannot be undertaken quickly.</P>
    <P>As to pickpocketing and handbag snatching, such activities are offences under existing law &mdash; the offence being &ldquo;larceny from the person&rdquo; carrying 14 years penal servitude.  It would be difficult to justify increasing this sentence.</P>
    <P>On the question of loitering, I am aware that residents in some housing estates are being annoyed by groups of young people congregating or loitering at certain points in these estates.  I am advised that since the young people concerned are not committing any specific offence merely by hanging around there is no action that the Garda can take against them.  However, this is a complex legal and social problem and one that cannot really be tackled in this Bill which, I would suggest, covers a fair amount of ground as it is.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to see the Bill as a panacea for all our ills.  It was not put forward in that context but in the context of providing a very important element in an overall package of provisions to combat crime and lawlessness.  To extend that even further, to seek in the Bill provisions for problems in communities which are not particularly problems of crime and vandalism, is to go beyond what is intended in the Bill.  I do not think that the social problems of society can be solved in a Criminal Justice Bill and certainly there is no attempt by me to imply that this Bill will provide a cure for the various social ills which Deputies have mentioned.  I have always put it in the context of a very important set up provisions in the Bill which will amend the law, provide a new legal framework and give extra powers to the police, but which in itself is not being put forward as a solution to the crime problem and is certainly not put forward as a solution to the various slings and arrows of outrageous fortune which afflict individuals and communities. It would be wrong to interpret the Bill in that way.  It is not being presented in that way.  It is a Bill which I believe will play a very significant role in combating crime but certainly it is not presented as a cure-all or a panacea of any sort.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> The debate was a very wide ranging one and many points were made about crime and law enforcement generally.  I propose now to respond to the main ones.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies voiced their concern regarding the serious drug problem and I fully share this concern.  As I have already pointed out, the Garda have had considerable success against the drug racketeers in recent months and I can assure the House that there will be no let-up in their efforts.  The Minister for Health has primary responsibility in relation to the Misuse of Drugs Act and I will invite his attention to the various suggestions that have been made.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the desirability of making parents answerable in some way for offences committed by juveniles.</P>
    <P>There is already provision in section 99 of the Children Act, 1908, whereby a court may order a parent to pay a fine, damages or costs in respect of an offence committed by a child or young person.</P>
    <P>The new Children Bill in course of preparation by the Minister for Health will provide the opportunity for a debate on such issues.  They are outside the scope of this Bill.  Other provisions relating to children, which were mentioned by Deputy Woods, such as residential care and provision of places of detention for juvenile offenders, can also be raised in the context of the Children Bill.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that sittings of the District Court might be held at night to enable a saving to be made in time and expense of Garda witnesses attending court outside their normal hours.</P>
    <P>The question of establishing a night court in Dublin was examined by a committee comprising the President of the District Court and representatives of the Garda, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Department of Justice.  The committee concluded that if a night court were to be established it would need to sit for several hours from, say, 11 p.m. onwards because of the substantial numbers of persons arrested after that hour.  Additional district justices and District Court staff would be necessary. <Col N="472" /> Additional Garda staff would also be needed in the Bridewell to cater for the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>The committee estimated that the annual staffing costs associated with the provision of a night court would substantially exceed the cost of Garda overtime under the present system and the existing arrangements give better value for money.  As in all things of this nature, society is changing rapidly and an appropriate response in one year might not necessarily be the appropriate response subsequently.  I make that comment as information for Deputies in the House rather than in any attempt to exclude any options in this area.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the need to develop to the maximum extent our forensic science capability.  I share the view that forensic science plays an important role in criminal investigation and I am fully convinced of its value.  However, I would not want it to be thought that the Garda are lacking in this area.  In fact, they assure me that they are very well served indeed, by international standards. I intend to ensure that the resources and equipment necessary for this valuable service will continue to be made available and that its requirements will be regularly reviewed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gerard Brady raised some interesting points concerning the establishment of neighbourhood or community watch groups with a view to the prevention of crime.  I agree with this approach.  I am satisfied that the most effective way of reducing crime is for the Garda and the community to work together and it is the general intention to encourage and promote community co-operation with the Garda Síochána.  I am aware, as Deputy Brady has pointed out, that a neighbourhood or community watch system has developed in other countries and particularly in some parts of the United States.  The present position here is that the Garda authorities are actively considering the matter and I look forward to the outcome in due course.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the desirability of having proposals for an independent procedure for dealing with complaints against the Garda brought before <Col N="473" /> the House for consideration side by side with the provisions conferring increased powers on the Garda.  I would like to reiterate the commitment I have already given that the new powers will not come into operation until a procedure ensuring an independent assessment of the investigation of complaints against the Garda has been established.  Work is proceeding on this as a matter of urgency and I hope to have it before the House at an early date.</P>
    <P>A number of points were made about recruitment to the Garda Síochána.  It is one thing for a Deputy to mention such things in passing but I think I would be trespassing excessively on the patience of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle if I were to respond to those observations in the course of this debate.  There will be other opportunities in the near future.</P>
    <P>However, I would like to make a brief comment on radio communications.  A modern sophisticated national radio communications system, which will cost in excess of £10 million, is at present being provided for the Garda Síochána. This system will be of major benefit to the Garda in the fight against crime, as it will provide for immediate contact between Garda stations and enable gardaí on outdoor patrols to be in constant touch with their stations.  Installation of the system in areas outside the Dublin area is already well under way and will be completed by early 1984. Tenders have been received for the supply of the Dublin system which will include a new modern computer-aided control centre and these are under examination at present.  It is hoped that it will be possible to place a contract by the middle of this year.  The Garda have been involved in the planning and design of the whole system so that it will be tailor-made to meet Garda requirements.</P>
    <P>In this connection there is a misinterpretation of the published Estimates.  It was intended that equipment necessary for the radio communications network would be funded by a leasing arrangement over a number of years.  At the end of this year I found that there were some funds at hand in my Department and I decided to dispense with the leasing <Col N="474" /> arrangement and to purchase outright at the end of 1983 the required equipment. Consequently, the sum of money which was intended for leasing radio equipment in the published Book of Estimates shows a reduction, but the reason for the reduction is that the equipment was bought outright at the end of 1983 and consequently there is no need for provision for leasing in the Estimates.  In conclusion, I hope that I have covered most of the important points made in the debate.  The Bill has the general support of the House, but as I said, I will be looking closely at it between now and Committee Stage to improve it wherever possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not a remedy for all ills.  I am fully aware of the importance of other factors such as improved social, environmental and economic conditions, especially for young people.  I appreciate also the contribution that closer Garda community relations can make in bringing about a better and more law-abiding society.  This Bill is only one step, though an important one, in the fight against crime.  Nevertheless, the Bill and the other measures we are taking will, I believe, bring about a significant improvement in the present situation.</P>
    <P>Again I thank all Deputies who contributed.  It has been a most interesting debate and in it I can take the opinions of Deputies on board both in the context of this legislation and in the wider context because Deputies made major contributions in areas which are under the auspices of my Department.  I am very glad that such wide-ranging and in-depth contributions were made and I will take them into account when formulating other measures to combat crime and vandalism and to give greater access to justice and to bring about the kind of society which we all want.  So far it has been a successful debate.  I am still approaching it in an open-minded way.  I am open to persuasion as to appropriate amendments on Committee Stage.  I think it will be possible to carry on with this Bill in an atmosphere of Deputies on all sides of the House having an input into the legislation and having an influence over the amendments and other policy decisions <Col N="475" /> which were made subsequently by me and by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides us with the opportunity of considering the shortcomings in the various housing programmes being undertaken by local authorities acting as agents for the Department of the Environment.  A number of Members of the House are also members of local authorities and they will realise that in the past 12 months the amount of money available for housebuilding programmes in both urban and rural areas has been totally inadequate in terms of meeting the demand for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my local authority area, Louth County Council, the number of people on the waiting list has reached frightening proportions.  If we consider the rate of progress in the provision of housing, whether we are talking of schemes that are at the design stage, the construction stage or which are yet under consideration, we realise how inadequate the programme is to cater for the immediate demands apart altogether from the demands that will be made in the future. Increasingly, people are finding it more difficult, and in many cases impossible, to provide housing from their own resources.  With people marrying earlier it is inevitable that there will be an ever-increasing demand for housing generally. There are many shortcomings in terms of the finance that is available for housing so far as the individual is concerned <Col N="477" /> whether we are talking of SDA loans of £14,000 or of the housing finance agency loans or of loans from the building societies.</P>
    <P>If we examine the ordinary SDA loans we find it is a fact of life that £14,000 is completely inadequate for anyone to contemplate building a home.  The Minister for the Environment should consider increasing the amount of money to be made available.  Having done so he will have to look at the operation of the mortgage subsidy scheme.  People find themselves in difficulty about repayments.  In most local authority areas an increasing number of people are finding themselves in difficulty.  It is essential that we look at the mortgage subsidy scheme, its operation and the possibility of extending it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>It was necessary to bring this Bill before the House because of the difficulty which arose following a court case involving a Mr. MacNamee and the Buncrana Urban Council.  The implications of the decision in that case created a grave situation for local authorities.  In the rural hinterland the industrial base attracts people from a wide area.  People living in rural areas gravitate to urban areas where there are employment opportunities.  When they decide to set up a home they look to the local authority in that area.</P>
      <P>The implications for them of this court case are very obvious.  As the law stands the authorities are precluded from considering their applications for rehousing. I fully support the passage of this Bill through the House.  The sooner it is enacted the better since quite a number of people are feeling very anxious about their plight.  They are concerned to find out whether their applications can be considered.  The passage of this Bill will, I hope, rectify the situation.  County managers will have one headache less when considering applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the Christmas recess I dealt with the difficulties concerning housing schemes and rehousing generally.  It is <Col N="478" /> unfortunate that this debate is being restricted and limited in range.  We should take a long hard look at our house building programme, and re-assess our housing needs particularly when we have a new Minister for the Environment who we hope will be prepared to look at all the difficulties and problems.  It is unfortunate that we are not allowed to broaden the debate to deal with all the needs and shortcomings which are so obvious.  I covered most of the points I intended dealing with in the debate before Christmas. It is unfortunate that I am not permitted to broaden the scope of the debate but I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I opened the Second Stage debate on this Bill on my first day as Minister for the Environment.  Deputies from all sides of the House extended their congratulations to me on taking up the onerous office of the Minister for the Environment and wished me well in undertaking the many challenging tasks which this position entails.  I am extremely grateful for those generous sentiments which are always a source of encouragement to someone embarking on such an important mission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The activities of the Department of the Environment are many and varied and are of vital importance to the country's economic and social development. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that in one way or another these activities impinge on the daily lives of almost every citizen.  This is more true of housing than of any other area of the Department's activities since housing is one of the basic necessities of life.  It is one of my foremost objectives as Minister to develop a national housing policy that will maximise housing output while at least maintaining the current level of the local authority housing programme so that the less well off in our community are not deprived of decent accommodation because of lack of means.  It is fitting, therefore, that I should have been destined to take charge of a housing Bill &mdash; even if only a small one &mdash; on my first day as Minister for the Environment and, as I indicated in my opening speech, I hope <Col N="479" /> it will not be too long before I am back in the House with another much more extensive Housing Bill.</P>
    <P>I am thankful to Deputy Molloy for his assurance of full co-operation as Opposition spokesman &mdash; I am sure he will not mind if I have to remind him of this from time to time &mdash; and, in particular, for his support for this Bill, for which his party also accepts the need.</P>
    <P>As I said in my remarks when opening this debate, this Bill is a short one with a limited purpose.  It does not result from any comprehensive review of Part III of the Housing Act, 1966, which deals with the provision and management of local authority housing.  Rather, its sole purpose is to overcome the difficulties for housing authorities to which certain sections of that Act &mdash; as interpreted by the Supreme Court &mdash; have given rise and to restore the position as it obtained prior to the judgment.  This is not to say that I regard this legislation generally as being otherwise perfect; indeed, as soon as this Bill is out of the way I intend to give priority to the revision of Part III of the 1966 Act and to preparation of more extensive amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Were the position as enunciated by the judgment to continue the prospects of many families in urgent need of housing could be detrimentally affected.  If the position was not rectified by provisions such as we are debating, long established practice adopted by a number of local authorities of considering persons residing outside their functional areas in allocating tenancies would have to cease.  In the past many county councils have housed persons residing within urban districts in the country and vice versa because such arrangements were seen to be the most advantageous way of looking after local housing needs.  It is important that local authorities should not be restricted from entering into mutual arrangements best suited to local needs and circumstances.  We are ensuring by the provisions in the Bill that such arrangements can continue.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Ceann Comhairle has ruled a general discussion on overall housing policy out of order and it is not, <Col N="480" /> therefore, my intention to dwell on the broader issues in my reply to the debate. However, before he gave this ruling Deputy Molloy had made some critical statements about the Government's housing programme and I would like to reply very briefly to these.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the Deputy's comparison of the relative performances of Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments does not stand up to examination.  He claimed credit for building 24,000 houses in 1973 although he left office in March of that year.  This claim is fair enough since it takes time for Government measures to show up in the number of house completions.  However, by the same yardstick how can Deputy Molloy with any consistency castigate the present Government for the level of completions in 1983 when his party were in power for most of the previous year?  In fact, considering the severity of the economic recession, it is generally acknowledged that housing has held up very well.  Provisional figures for 1983 show 26,121 house completions, which is much better than had been anticipated this time last year and just 2½ per cent down on 1982. Thus, in 1983 the pace of decline in housing completions slowed down sharply compared with 1982 when the number of houses completed declined by 7.3 per cent on the 1981 figure.  Furthermore, key indications of activity on the private housing side are showing promising signs for next year.  New house loan approvals by the building societies in 1983 were about 8 per cent up on 1982.  Similarly, new house grant approvals are up about 13 per cent on last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Similarly, the outlook on local authority housing is encouraging. As a result of the very substantial capital provision of £208 million for 1983 the level of activity on the programme increased by up to 10 per cent over that of 1982.  Although final figures are not yet available indications are that completions were up from 5,686 to about 6,200 with over 8,000 dwelling in progress at the end of the year.  As for this year we expect that the very substantial allocation of £211 million will maintain last year's satisfactory level of activity, when account is taken of the current unit cost levels and the Department's recent guidelines on cost control.</P>
      <P>The Government are acutely aware of the importance of the local authority housing programme in meeting the needs of those who cannot afford to house themselves.  Deputies may be assured that the programme will continue to command a high priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my opening speech, the Government fully accept the need for improved legislation within which the problem of homelessness can be tackled more effectively.  Deputy Molloy appears to be under the impression that this could be achieved by simply inserting another section in this Bill.  However, I am afraid that this is an entirely unrealistic and over simplistic approach.  As Deputies are aware, the Seanad is at present debating the Second Stage of Senator Brendan Ryan's Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill. Deputy Quinn in his capacity as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment made a considered and comprehensive contribution to that debate in which he conveyed clearly the Government's <Col N="482" /> genuine concern for the plight of the homeless and outlined the action being taken to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>I want again to put on record here my own personal commitment to do something about the problem of homelessness and my determination to take all practicable steps, by legislation and otherwise, to alleviate the plight of homeless people in our society.  I accept fully that the present legislation is not a satisfactory legal framework within which the problem of homelessness can effectively be tackled.  It has become obvious that there is a pressing need for the overhaul of Part III of the 1966 Act and I can say that the formulation of better legislation in the whole area of public housing is now receiving priority attention in my Department. It is in this context that the Government's legislative proposals on the homeless will be developed.  It would be totally inappropriate &mdash; not to say irresponsible &mdash; even to attempt to deal with this problem in a short Bill of the type now before the House.</P>
    <P>In this area of legislation the need to maintain public confidence in housing allocations and to ensure that the housing that can be provided from the resources available is allocated fairly on the basis of objective and defensible criteria is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the preparation of new legislation is a task that must be approached with great care to ensure that whatever measures emerge retain the attributes I have mentioned and at the same time that they are sufficiently flexible and sensitive to the different kinds of housing need that exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy contended that the present legislation excludes homeless persons from consideration in the letting of dwellings by housing authorities.  The basis for this contention is not clear to me because under the 1966 Act a housing authority is entitled to let houses to all persons in need of housing accommodation and who cannot provide it from their own resources.  Perhaps the problem lies with the schemes of letting priorities being operated by individual housing authorities.  In fact, I think it should be acknowledged that local authorities have <Col N="483" /> catered over the years for many families who have been rendered homeless for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>In this context, it is worth recording that Dublin Corporation &mdash; the largest housing authority in the State &mdash; last year housed 151 families, 241 one-parent families, 155 couples and single persons, mostly senior citizens, all of whom were classified as homeless.  The corporation have re-let to single people a number of small flats in various locations originally intended for the elderly but which subsequently became unsuitable for this purpose.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies called for improved co-operation and flexibility between housing authorities in the provision and letting of houses and in the arrangement of transfers.  I fully endorse these sentiments and I will take the opportunity of exhorting authorities to this effect when circularising them after the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The overriding objective of housing authorities must always be the provision of suitable housing in the quickest and most efficient way possible for those in the greatest need.  This Bill will enable them to do this by giving them the freedom to enter into mutually advantageous arrangements for the building and letting of houses, transfers, etc, but in the final analysis the extent to which these powers are availed of is entirely at the discretion of the authorities at local level.  It would be neither fruitful nor desirable that the Department should by legislation or otherwise attempt to coerce authorities into making arrangements of this nature. Since these provisions are entirely discretionary, it is difficult to appreciate Deputy Wallace's fears that this Bill may create bigger problems than those that already exist.  The Bill will not affect the total number of persons seeking local authority housing one way or another, but to the extent that it is availed of by the authorities, it will permit a less compartmentalised approach to meeting the needs.</P>

I refute absolutely his allegation that it was irresponsible of me to seek to have this Bill used to alleviate the problems of homeless people because of the interpretation which local housing authorities are putting on the relevant section of the 1966 Act.  On the Second Stage I was not allowed to go into this.  I was stopped by the Chair, but the Minister was allowed to reply.  That was very unfair.  I have brought the matter to the notice of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I intend to pursue the matter there.  I first raised it there this morning and I will pursue it further when I get an opportunity.  I do not want to delay the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is a tragedy that in the years from 1973 to 1983 we have only increased the annual output of housing from 24,000 to 26,000.  It is tragic that we have not yet faced up to the housing crisis which exists for thousands and thousands of young families who have not got proper homes.  It is very remiss of the Minister to boast about housing figures when it is the last thing he should be doing.  The Minister's Government came in with a target of 30,000 houses.  I fully support that target but I do not see any effort by the Government to achieve their target.  We will fall miserably short again in 1984.</P>

      <P>Deputy Jim Fitzsimons has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment of the House the question of the Bula Mines situation and the Government's intention or non-intention to assist in getting them off the ground.  The Deputy has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission I will give five minutes of my time to Deputy O'Malley.  The reason I am raising this on the Adjournment tonight is that there is a lot of apprehension not only in County Meath but throughout the country in relation to the present situation with Bula Mines.  I must remind the Minister of State that it was a previous Coalition Government who grossly mishandled this situation approximately eight years ago when £9½ million <Col N="486" /> of the taxpayers' money was paid to Bula Mines for a percentage of the mine without any planning permission or without any commitment to commence mining.  I would like to remind the Minister of State and the House that that £9½ million is of the order of £23 million to £25 million today.  It is little wonder that there is deep concern in relation to the investment of that £9½ million of taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a duty to inform the public if it is the Government's intention to try to get something out of that investment eight years ago.  Is it not time we got some return in relation to the money invested or in relation to jobs?  Many people have wondered if the Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time, Mr. Justin Keating, even discussed it with the Cabinet.  Many members of the present Government, including the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, were members of that Government.  If it was a collective decision by that Coalition Government, now that Bula have got their planning permission the Government should say that they will follow the original investment of £9½ million which is worth at least £23 million today, with a view to getting their investment back.  Do they intend to waste more good money?  The Government must face up to that situation.</P>
      <P>The Government must also consider if Bula Mines are financially viable or do they intend to go it alone?  If Bula Mines are not financially viable will the Government bail them out?  As a member of Meath County Council in 1974 I can be quoted in the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> and other media as saying that the proper thing was for Bula and Tara to merge, that it was very foolish not to mine the ore body as a unit and it was very foolish to have a duplication of the most expensive machinery such as building a mill, a tailing pond and all that goes with sophisticated mining plant.  I have always held that view.  If Bula can go it alone and if they are financially viable I wish them well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the Minister's reply to a written question yesterday he apparently feels that if a Bula Mines development project <Col N="487" /> emerged in which he was satisfied that it was feasible and acceptable in its various aspects he would be prepared to propose that the Government consider supporting the project financially.  The important thing is whether Bula are feasible and acceptable in relation to the various aspects.  It seems that Bula by their own admission are in considerable financial difficulties.  They claim it would take £60 million to take their operation off the ground.  In that £60 million there is a figure of £22 million debts to the bank so they are claiming that £38 million is the sum required to put the mine into operation. We know that £340,000 was due in interest on 3 January and we are also aware that there is another loan due for call up from 1 February to the tune of £3.9 million.  Other problems have arisen as well as those financial problems.</P>
    <P>Other mining experts dispute the fact that £38 million would bring the mine into operation.  People who have vast experience in the whole mining area claim that it would take up to £100 million to put the mine into operation.  I would like to quote from the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> of 7 January 1984 a report by the ICC Corporate Finance Limited, a subsidiary of the Industrial Credit Company which states:</P>
    <P>The commercial viability of the planned Bula Ltd. mine at Nevinstown, Navan, has been disputed in reports by the I.C.C. Corporate Finance Ltd., a subsidiary of the Industrial Credit Company, and Professor C.T. Shaw of the London School of Mines....</P>
    <P>The I.C.C. reports that it completed an assessment of Bula Ltd. for the Government in December 1981, and advised that in its view an independent development of the company's lead/zinc reserves was not commercially viable, i.e., that &ldquo;a willing, informed and prudent commercial investor would not provide finance for the development of the prospect&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Whether the Government who presented the Bill were wise and prudent investors is questionable.  They would need a lot <Col N="488" /> more wisdom today than they had when Justin Keating was Minister when the great bloomer was made.</P>
    <P>The report is quite detailed and confirms a view I have always held.  In order for Tara Mines to increase its output the report reckons that the maximum support required from the State would be guarantees of loans for some £20 million which the company would need to raise. It is questionable whether the Government should pursue their original investment. The Government will have to decide on that.  To compound the problem we have been told again in the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> of another development:</P>
    <P>The Department was not prepared to comment this week on suggestions that the absence from Bula's plans of a sulphuric acid leaching plant, used in other mines to draw out magnesium oxide impurities from the ore would affect the profitability of the project by making the concentrate less saleable to the international smelter companies.</P>
    <P>On top of that there is the absence of what is known as a cyanide plant which they have in Tara and other mines.  The function of these two operations is to optimise the recovery of the ore and make it more saleable to the international smelters.</P>
    <P>I know the situation well and there is no doubt that the ore in the Tara end of the mine is exactly the same as that in the Bula end of the mine.  If Tara need that kind of sulphuric acid leaching and cyanide plant, then for Bula's ore to be saleable they will need the same.</P>
    <P>In today's <i>Irish Independent</i> there was an article by Colm Rapple headed &ldquo;Safety Problem for Bula&rdquo;?  He states that there are not two safe exits out of the mine.  The second exit would be by vertical ladder up a 400 foot deep shaft. The company have many problems.  I have always said that the proper way to operate the mine is to merge it as one unit but I do not wish Bula ill in any way. We have a new Minister for Energy.  I wish it was Deputy Bruton who is from County Meath also.  He was a junior Minister in the Government of the day who committed the cardinal boob of giving <Col N="489" /> £9½ million to Bula without their having planning permission or any commitment to mine.  Now eight years later we have nothing to show for it but a few trees planted.  Bula tell us &mdash; I hope they are right &mdash; that if they can get off the ground there are 400 jobs there.  We need those jobs not only in Navan and Meath but in the surrounding areas.  The boob was committed by the Government and it behoves them to correct it as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to reply in some detail regarding the present position between the Government and Bula Mines Limited.  He should tell the House what stage negotiations are at.  Deputy Hilliard put down a written question to this effect yesterday.  He got a very short and vague answer which unfortunately is the wont of written answers and one reason why one should try to put down oral questions on matters of this kind.  It states that if a Bula mine project emerged which he was satisfied was feasible and acceptable in its various aspects he would be prepared to propose that the Government consider supporting the project financially.  On what terms would the Minister do this and what does he regard as feasible and acceptable in its various aspects?  As the Minister's reply was put so conditionally it is obviously his view that the present development project is not, as it stands, feasible or acceptable.  I am not surprised at this.</P>
      <P>That is the major question that must be asked but there are many others.  It is correct to say that many of the questions I asked in this month seven years ago from the same benches still remain to be answered.  We are no further forward than the day when the infamous Bill on Bula was introduced by the then Deputy Justin Keating in January 1977.  The questions I asked then which went unanswered and were pooh-poohed as being unnecessary are, unhappily for all of us, as valid today as the day they were asked. They remain unanswered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the amount of the ore reserves?  We have no definite information on that.  Professor Shaw has one figure and Bula Limited, as is their wont, <Col N="490" /> have a much higher one.  What will the market realisations be?  What is the cost of complying with the planning conditions? There are nine pages of them. What would be the cost of the additional items overlooked in the planning permission which Deputy Fitzsimons has just adverted to &mdash; the fact that there is no second exit and therefore a permit to mine cannot be got from the Department of Labour, and the fact that there is no sulphuric acid leaching plant?  What will be the overall cost of developing the mine?  There are conflicting figures on this ranging from £20 million to £80 million. We are entitled to know before any decision is made what the projected revenues for the mine would be.  Where is the management expertise?  Who is going to manage the mine if it goes into production? The Government will have to answer these questions and make certain that their answers are precise before they commit further moneys to the project after the money that was so disastrously spent by them in 1976-1977, money that was out of the taxpayers' pockets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Fitzsimons for giving me the opportunity to speak on the development of Bula Mines.  Usually when a Deputy raises on the Adjournment a constituency matter he indicates encouragement for development and for the saving of industry.  In this case the Deputy is more or less saying that this mine should not be developed on an independent basis.  He made that quite clear in his contribution and I am sure his constituents will note his attitude.</P>
      <P>The Deputy used phrases such as &ldquo;throwing good money after bad&rdquo;.  I reject that.  The State is entitled to ensure that it participates in the development of our natural resources.  Under the 1975 licensing terms for offshore exploration, the Government are entitled to up to 50 per cent of any development of an oil find.  Is the Deputy now suggesting that the State should not participate in the development of Bula mines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The logic of the Deputy is faulty.  The <Col N="491" /> attitude he took indicates to me that he has taken a similar line to that of a certain source in the mining industry in Ireland and that causes me a certain amount of discomfit.  The Deputy seems to be well briefed by that source and that is unfortunate. I can assure the House neither I nor the Government will be put off by any person or company trying to divert the Government from developing our natural resources.  I am disappointed the Deputy has taken this attitude in this House.  To me it is an indication that he has been advised in a certain manner. Deputy O'Malley's similar attitude surprises me because he was Minister for Energy and he knows the intricacies of the development of any mining operation.</P>
    <P>The Government are anxious that the Bula ore reserves should be developed as soon as possible having regard to the substantial employment potential which would be created in the construction and operation of the mine in the Navan area and its environs.  Deputy Fitzsimons and Deputy O'Malley seem to be prepared to throw that employment potential to the winds for their own narrow political ends. I well appreciate that there is a serious unemployment problem in the area and that the commencement of a new mining operation in the area could contribute directly to alleviation of the unemployment situation and indirectly through its spin-off effect.  A new mine development would, for instance, have a favourable impact beyond the Navan area in relation to transport of concentrates from the mine and from the operation of port facilities.  The development of the mine would also have a favourable impact on the country's balance of payments situation.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, progress towards the development of the Bula mine has been slow.  In the case of any new mine development a lengthy period elapses between discovery and development of the mine.  In the Bula case the period of start-up has been a good deal longer than usual.  One of the principal factors involved has been the lengthy planning permission proceedings which <Col N="492" /> finally concluded in November last when full planning permission for an underground mine development was granted to the company.  It is very much to be hoped that the company can now proceed quickly to a viable development project.</P>
    <P>This task is primarily a matter for the management of the company.  It is a task which has been rendered more difficult than usual by the substantial pre-development indebtedness which the company has accumulated over the years during which planning permission applications were being pursued.  One of the principal elements in developing a satisfactory mining project is the raising of development finance.  I am aware that the management of the company has been actively pursuing contacts with various interests with a view to satisfactory development arrangements and indeed my Department have been involved in certain of these contacts.  It would be improper for me at this stage to give details of these contacts and discussions. What I can say is that my Department will continue to do what they can to facilitate them.</P>
    <P>I can also say that, if a development project emerges which I am satisfied is viable and acceptable in its various aspects, I will be prepared to propose that the Government consider supporting the project financially.  In arriving at their decision on any proposal that may be put before them, the Government will have the benefit of a considerable volume of professional advice which my Department have obtained on the Bula mine project.  The Government, conscious of the contribution the project could make to creation of badly-needed new jobs, will give any such proposal the most serious consideration if it meets the appropriate criteria.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has adverted to the situation that certain advisory reports presented to my Department have become the subject of press comment.  I do not propose to make any statement on the press articles in question as to do so would be an infringement of the normal business confidentiality to which companies are entitled in their dealings with my Department.  I would say, however, that <Col N="493" /> the reports to which reference has been made form only a part of the large volume of material available to my Department in relation to the viability of a Bula mine project.  As I have said, the company's management is working on a development project including the critical financing aspect.  I hope that these efforts come to fruition soon and I can assure the House that when the company's proposals are presented to my Department they will be examined in a constructive and urgent way with the objective of bringing this long-delayed project into operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat surprised that members of the Opposition, and in particular a Member for the constituency in which the mine is located, should cast cold water on the efforts of the company and of my Department to ensure that this mine is brought to fruition, in the context that there would be employment for approximately 400 people for a period of <Col N="494" /> years, that it would help substantially our balance of payments and that there would be substantial infrastructural development in the area.  I can only assume that Deputy Fitzsimons and Deputy O'Malley have some other political&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>(a)  There is an inevitable overlap from year to year as regards volumes programmed for sale and volumes actually sold.</P>
    <P>(b)  Final figures for 1983 are not yet available.</P>
    <P>(c)  In regard to timber sold standing the felling could have been carried out directly by the purchasers of the timber or by contractors engaged by them.  In these cases FWS would not be directly involved.</P>
    <P>(d)  In regard to timber harvested by the FWS such harvesting would have been largely carried out by FWS employees and to a lesser extent by contractors.  In order to ascertain the precise volume of harvesting carried out by contract on behalf of the FWS it would be necessary to consult staff in some 250 individual forests and it is felt that the cost of such investigation would not be warranted.</P>

In order to qualify for these benefits a claimant must satisfy certain statutory contribution conditions one of which requires persons over 21 years of age to have not fewer than 26 <Col N="445" /> contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  The governing contribution year for all claims in respect of treatment in the calendar year 1983 is the 1981-1982 contribution year, 6 April 1981 to 5 April 1982.  As only eight credited contributions in respect of the payment of unemployment benefit were recorded in the 1981-1982 contribution year, her claims to dental and optical benefit could not be approved.  Inquiries were issued to her in June 1983 and again in August 1983 about her employment record but she did not reply.</P>
    <P>In view of the Deputy's statement indicating that the person concerned had several employments since April 1979, arrangements have been made to have the question of outstanding employment contributions investigated by an outdoor officer of the Department.  On completion of these inquiries the claims made by the person concerned will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was advised to apply for a qualification certificate and was furnished with an application form on 27 September 1983 but only returned it to his local office on 2 November 1983.  His case was then referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of his means and the inquiries in the matter were only recently completed. He was assessed with means at £0.15 weekly derived from capital, and his claim has been allowed at £86.85 weekly being the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable to him, £87 less £0.15, with effect from 14 December 1983 the date after which he exhausted his title to unemployment benefit on completion of 390 days of benefit.</P>

      <Col N="446" /> He is a postal applicant and arrangements have been made to issue an order to him for encashment at his local post office, for an amount of £434.35 representing all arrears due, on 19 January 1984.  Further weekly payments will be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was assessed with means of £26.40 per week derived from the value of board and lodgings in his parents' home.  He is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at £1.60 per week being the maximum rate payable to him, £28 less £26.40.  The family income of the household was assessed following investigation by a social welfare officer.  The claimant appealed against the assessment of means but the appeals officer upheld the assessment.</P>

Inquiries are still being made in the matter but it is expected that they will be completed shortly.  His means will be reviewed in the light of the report and the rate of unemployment assistance payable to him will be determined accordingly.  In the meantime he continues to be paid unemployment assistance at £36.10 weekly, being the maximum rate payable to him, £80.30 less means £44.20 derived from the beneficial occupation of holdings and from the sale of turf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>There were no financial cutbacks affecting the policing arrangements for Ballinamore.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on previous occasions, the precise arrangements for the policing of individual areas are a matter for decision by the Garda authorities who review the strength assigned to the various stations from time to time to take account of changing needs and circumstances.  I am informed by the authorities that following a review of the deployment of Garda resources in the Cavan-Monaghan Garda Division, aimed at making the maximum use of available resources in meeting the police needs of the division as a whole, it was decided in September last to reassign one sergeant and five gardaí from Ballinamore station to other stations in the division and to reallocate the patrol car based at Ballinamore to the Detective Unit at the District Headquarters at Ballyconnell, which covers the Ballinamore area.  In addition, the 24-hour opening of Ballinamore was discontinued and the opening hours of the station were revised to 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on weekdays and 12 noon to 2 p.m. on Sundays so as to enable the reduced station party to carry out the maximum amount of outdoor Garda duties, while maintaining a reasonably adequate office service.</P>
      <P>Since the investigation into the recent kidnapping case commenced in the Ballinamore area on 16 December 1983 the local station has been kept open round the clock on a temporary basis pending completion of that investigation.  The Garda authorities consider, however, that the revised arrangements for the policing of Ballinamore introduced in September 1983 are adequate to meet the normal police needs of the area.  Apart from the service provided from the local station, the Ballinamore area also receives attention from mobile units based at Swanlinbar, Ballyconnell and Cavan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195, 196 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>Investigations have been carried out into damage at various national schools during recent stormy weather, with particular reference to that which occurred at Keadue national school in County Donegal and to prefabricated classrooms in various other centres.  Preliminary reports from the Commissioners of Public Works, who are responsible for the arrangements for the provision of national school accommodation, are under consideration in my Department and further detailed reports are awaited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding as to the position at Keadue national school is that a prefabricated classroom which was being used as an adjunct to the permanent school building was seriously damaged by unusually strong gales and that the school has been temporarily closed due to the presence of debris in the yard.  The schools authorities are proposing to accommodate the pupils and teacher who occupied <Col N="450" /> the damaged prefabricated building in a nearby closed national school as a temporary measure and my Department are prepared to sanction transport to facilitate such arrangements.  The question of a permanent extension to the school is also under consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general question of the use of prefabricated classrooms and their safety such classrooms have been in use for more than 25 years and have proved generally satisfactory from the standpoint of safety.  My Department and the Commissioners of Public Works, whose local offices are readily contactable by national school authorities, will respond immediately to any requests for inspections and advice where such buildings have been damaged or where the school management authorities consider an inspection is warranted.</P>
