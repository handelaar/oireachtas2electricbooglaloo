      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 11, 7 and 6.  By agreement and notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders the Dáil shall sit later than 5.30 p.m. and not later than 10.30 p.m. and business shall be interrupted at 10.00 p.m.  The sitting shall be suspended from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. today.  The Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4.00 p.m.</P>
      <P>Also by agreement the proceedings on the remaining Stages of Item No. 11 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 1.30 p.m. today by one Question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Also by agreement the debate on Item No. 6 shall commence not earlier than 3.30 p.m. today.  The speech of each Member contributing to the debate on the motion for the adjournment for the Christmas Recess today and tomorrow shall not exceed 30 minutes with the exception of the opening speaker and the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party who shall not exceed 45 minutes.  The Taoiseach shall be called on to conclude not later than 3.10 p.m. tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on the motion for the adjournment for the Christmas Recess <Col N="2588" /> shall be adjourned at 3.55 p.m. tomorrow, whereupon the proceedings on the Supplementary Estimates, the Excess Votes and the First Stage of the Appropriation Bill, 1984 shall be brought to a conclusion forthwith and successively and decided without debate.  The proceedings on the Remaining Stages of the Appropriation Bill, 1984, and on the motion for the adjournment for the Christmas Recess shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.00 p.m. tomorrow by one Question which shall be put from the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides that employment under the social employment scheme shall be insurable employment for occupational injury benefit purposes by the insertion of a new provision in section 38 of the Consolidation Act, 1981.  The occupational injuries scheme which was introduced in 1967 was incorporated into the general social insurance system and, where practicable, the classes of insured persons insured for occupational injuries corresponded to those already insured for social insurance.  However, certain additional employments were made insurable for occupational injury benefit. Some types of employment were <Col N="2592" /> excluded and these additions and exclusions are set out in section 38 of the 1981 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill proposes the adoption of the social employment scheme.  The scheme is extremely vague. There has been some small degree of detail in the document produced by the Government, <i>Building on Reality,</i> of the types of job opportunities that might be introduced but we should get more details of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with section 3 which provides that employment under the social employment scheme shall be insurable employment for occupational injury benefit purposes.  Basically, that is all that is dealt with in section 3.  The section amends, by the insertion of a new subsection, section 38 of the principal Act of 1981.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>What will be the amount of the net payment to an individual after the deductions of social welfare contributions? Will the people who participate in the scheme be liable for the 3 per cent employment levy and other levies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>People in the social employment scheme will be covered for occupational injuries benefit.  The class J rate of contribution provides cover for occupational injury benefit only and it will be 3.4 per cent for the employer and nil for the employee, assuming that an employee holds a medical card.  The rate normally amounts to 0.4 per cent for the employer and the 3 per cent for the employee.  That 3 per cent comprises the 1 per cent health contribution, the 1 per cent youth employment contribution and the 1 per cent income levy.  However, where an employee has a medical card &mdash; it can be assumed that many participants in the social employment scheme will be <Col N="2593" /> holders of medical cards &mdash; then the full 3.4 per cent contribution is paid by the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the employer will have to pay 3.4 per cent for each employee in the same way as employers generally pay it?  The £70 per week will put the applicant over the rate for the medical card, because in the Western Health Board area the rate for a single man would probably be not more than £48 a week.  As Deputy Pattison is Minister of State at the Departments of Health and Social Welfare, I ask him to amend the Bill so that no participant in this scheme will be deprived of a medical card for the duration of the scheme.  If a young man or woman is deprived of health services as a result of participation in this scheme in the short term, earning £70 a week, he or she may find that he or she is worse off when the medical card is taken from them.</P>
      <P>The Minister said most people participating in this scheme would have medical cards and would not be liable for the higher rate of contribution.  We can take it that the young people will be deprived of a medical card when they come into the scheme unless the Minister amends this legislation or directs the health boards that participants under the scheme will not lose their medical benefits.</P>
      <P>The employers' contribution of 3.4 per cent may not be a disincentive, but this money has to be provided.  If Roscommon County Council took on a few hundred people, we would have a fairly healthy liability in the administrative area, and at this stage we do not have the funds to provide even 3.4 per cent of an individual's wage because many of our workers have been laid off over the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, can the Minister tell us at what stage the Minister for Labour will be speaking?  The Minister said yesterday that at some stage today the Minister for Labour would be coming into the House <Col N="2594" /> to give details of this scheme.  As I said last night this discussion really centres around the information which will be given by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Calleary.  Admittedly this Bill is being introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare but a number of sections come under the Department of Labour and the National Manpower Service. I did not contribute to the Second Stage debate because we had not heard the full details of the scheme from the Minister for Labour.  Before we can proceed we should have at least an outline of how the scheme will function.  It is very difficult to discuss a scheme on Committee Stage without having the details of that scheme.</P>
      <P>Yesterday Deputy McCarthy supported the principle of this Bill which deals mainly with the labour market but so far we do not know how the scheme will operate.  We are told it will be operated by the National Manpower Service. Section 3 gives very sketchy details about the social employment scheme, but anybody who knows anything about the National Manpower Service will know that they do not have the facilities to operate such a scheme.  Only recently they got money to get modern equipment. I do not want anybody to think that I am critical of Mr. Hannon and his staff, because they do a fantastic job under unbelievable circumstances, but if they are to take responsibility for a major scheme which will take 10,000 people off the live register&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would relate his remarks to section 3 which deals with insurability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case insurability covers people who are insured at present but who will be taken off because of a scheme about which I know little or nothing, except that it will take 10,000 people off the live register.  There are not many sections in this Bill, which means that I will not have too many opportunities to ask this question.  I want to know <Col N="2595" /> if the Minister for Labour is going to give details of this scheme.  If he gives this information on the Adjournment Debate, that will not help us debate this Bill.  I want to know how this scheme will operate, how Manpower will operate the scheme and what this scheme is all about.</P>
      <P>It is easy to agree something in principle, but we cannot agree to legislation when we do not have the full details.  I know that some weeks ago people were running around trying to put this legislation together and to decide which Department would be responsible. Would it be possible for the Minister of State to read sections of the Minister for Labour's script, which he probably has at this stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the matters already raised.  First, Deputy Leyden was not correct when he said I was Minister of State at the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  I am Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister of State has a little input in the Department of Health.  His counterpart in Health has a lot to do with social welfare for the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan is Minister of State at the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  I hope that clarifies the position.  The question of medical cards is for the health boards. Deputy Leyden was saying that it might be more attractive for some people not to avail of this scheme because they might be better off keeping their medical cards and social welfare benefits.  I want to stress that the scheme is purely voluntary. In other words, it will be optional for people on unemployment assistance for the required period.  Nobody will be coerced into a less favourable financial situation. Deputy Leyden also mentioned the extra cost to local authorities.  I want to emphasise that the money to pay wages <Col N="2596" /> and PRSI contributions will be given by the Exchequer to the local authorities and the sponsors.  No extra cost will arise for local authorities.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with section 3 at present, and this prevents me from expanding further on many other points which have been raised.  As Members are aware, this country holds the Presidency of the EC Council and the Minister for Labour is obliged to be in Brussels at present.  That is an obligation which unfortunately prevents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will defer to my senior colleagues, but I do not think we should be debating this Bill when we do not have the details of the scheme.  The Minister said last night that 10,000 people will be employed on this scheme but we have no details concerning the jobs or what county councils will be affected. We do not know what kind of work is involved, who will be employed or what their prospects are when the 12 months are up.  We are merely discussing the mechanical nature of the application of the scheme.  It is putting the cart before the horse, and I object very strongly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that this is a voluntary scheme and that there would be no coercion to participate in it.  I raised this point on Second Stage last night, and I should like the Minister to clarify what would happen to a person who is offered a job under one of the schemes but refuses it.  Will he still remain eligible for unemployment assistance, or will he de denied it because <Col N="2597" /> he will be classed as not available for work?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme is voluntary and there will be no coercion or discriminatory action taken against anyone who does not participate in it.  The Minister went into detail regarding the scheme and its operation.  I do not know what specific questions the Members opposite wish to have answered, as the contributions so far have been of a very general nature. However, if there are questions relating to the sections as we go through them I shall do my best to reply to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to infer from what the Minister said that people employed under this scheme will be covered for occupational injuries only?  If so, it would be a very serious disadvantage.  People employed under this scheme should be entitled to full insurance cover.  If that is not the case, people employed under the scheme may well lose out at a later stage as there will be a reluctance on the part of people who have fairly substantial employment contributions to get involved in it.  Will the Minister extend cover to the full range of benefits?</P>

      <P>The position was explained yesterday and today.  People employed under the scheme will be covered for occupational injury benefits and will receive credited contributions in the same way as they receive them if they are claiming unemployment or disability benefit.  Their record will not be affected. Deputies will note that there is one necessary change in the calculation of one's insurance record.  People involved in the scheme will get credited contributions and, if they get other employment for the rest of the week which is fully insurable, those paid contributions will be calculable for benefits as usual except that they <Col N="2598" /> will not be taken into account to re-qualify a person for unemployment benefit while they are participating in the scheme.  In other words, when someone works on outside employment during the time they participate in the scheme they receive 13 paid contributions but they cannot go back on unemployment benefit until they are finished with the scheme. However, that is not a backward step.  I emphasise that credited contributions will be allowed to everyone in the scheme in the same way as persons claiming unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or submitting medical certificates and being paid disability benefit are allowed credited contributions.  People in the social employment scheme will also receive credited contributions which will preserve their insurance records and they will be no worse off than if they were on unemployment assistance.  They are not losing anything by participating in the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in response to my question earlier, said that the Department would provide the 3.4 per cent for the employers.  Where is that specifically spelled out in the Bill?  It is very important to clarify this point, because it would mean a major change in employer-employee relationship.  If anybody in this House wishes to employ somebody under the scheme would they be liable to pay the 3.4 per cent contribution or would this money be provided from the Exchequer?  Local authorities and voluntary organisations may not have funds to provide this contribution although they would be willing to take people on if there was no charge.  The 3.4 per cent is very important because it would make a major difference in the estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support my colleagues in their remarks about the non-availability of the Minister for Labour.  When a commitment is given in this House the Ceann Comhairle should ensure that it is honoured by the Government.  He has a duty to see that the Minister comes in in the course of the debate.  He or the Minister of State should be here to outline to us <Col N="2599" /> the exact details of this scheme.  We do not know where these 10,000 people will be employed.  It is damaging the debate. There is little incentive for this side of the House to go into the nitty gritty of detail when we do not know the concept or philosophy behind the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister was quick enough to go on Radio 1 to outline in a generalised way what he intends to do with all the staff and the picking of the right person for the right job, but he is not available to the House.  The Dáil takes precedence over Europe, Irish Presidency or not.  If the Minister's Bill is before this House, he owes his loyalty to this House, not to any other assembly.</P>

      <P>At the beginning of this week, when Fianna Fáil were asked to take urgently two Bills, one of our conditions, when I was approached by the Government Whip on Monday evening about the debate on the social employment scheme, was that we would get to see the details.  We got that assurance.  It is social welfare legislation, while section 3 technically deals with the PRSI arrangements for workers to be employed under the social employment scheme.  How can we debate regulations under a scheme when we have not the details of the scheme?  We agree with the principle of <Col N="2600" /> anything that helps to reduce unemployment, but we do not know who the employers will be.  I know that the National Manpower Service cannot operate the system, because they have not the capacity to do so.  That being so, will the local authorities be the employers?  If a person works with the local authorities for three weeks and with the health boards for three weeks, how are his or her contributions going to be dealt with?</P>
      <P>We got assurance from the Minister on Second Stage yesterday that this major new initiative would be brought into operation in the coming months and that his colleague, the Minister for Labour, would be giving an outline of the scheme in the House on the following day &mdash; today.  I did not come into the House for the Second Stage debate, deciding to wait to hear what the Minister would say in the House today.  How can I, as spokesman on Labour, debate a scheme of which I have no details?  The purpose here, I am told, is to give amending legislation to the Department of Social Welfare to allow the scheme to operate.  What scheme and what employer, and where is the Minister of State for Labour?  This is absurd.  This is rushing through important legislation &mdash; a major initiative, according to the Minister's speech &mdash; and we have no details.  The next chance that I shall get to comment on this matter will probably be in the debate on the budget speech next March.  It is very unfair, unreasonable and sharp practice to rush through a Bill under certain conditions and then totally renege on those conditions.</P>

      <P>One of the major planks of the booklet, <i>Building on Reality,</i> was that 10,000 people were to be taken off the social register and given social type employment.  This led to hope that something was going to be done about the unemployed.  I repeat that we are talking about people getting a certain type of employment, but who are the people, where will they be working and what types of jobs will they be doing? What is the future outlook for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would have to seriously consider, <Col N="2601" /> on this side of the House, continuing with the debate on this legislation.  We are talking about shapes but not about the inside flesh of the scheme.  I want to know more about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues. We have been very badly deluded in relation to this Bill.  As my colleagues have said, the Minister absolutely assured us on Second Stage that the Minister for Labour would be giving an outline of the scheme on the following day and that, for that reason, he did not propose to go into any great detail on the scheme.  He just mentioned aspects of the scheme.</P>
      <P>We expected to get from the Minister for Labour today absolute details of this scheme, so that we could debate them and express our views.  We have been very seriously led astray on this.  I do not think that we can continue with this debate.  We will not have another opportunity for debating this before the legislation is passed, unless the Minister for Labour can be produced to us.</P>

      <P>The Deputies just cannot have it both ways.  It would be a nice debating point that the schemes should be debated first.  But then perhaps Members would be asking what the framework was on which these schemes would operate. They might say that we should not discuss the schemes until we see that legislative framework.  What we are doing here is trying to get the legislative framework or foundation within which these schemes would operate.  The exact details of the schemes are still being worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be finalised in their finer points and details within the next few days.  Deputies will have plenty of opportunities early in the new year to debate the whole scheme in general.  At that stage they will know the legislative framework.  The social employment scheme is one of a number of special Government measures designed to cater for the specific needs of the longterm unemployed.  Chapter 4 of the national plan, paragraphs 4.11, 4.12 and 4.13 provides for the setting up of a social employment scheme.  Because the majority of existing training in employment schemes cater for the under 25 age group, it was decided to confine participation in the social employment scheme to the over 25 age group, except in very exceptional circumstances like special skill requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order that progress may be made I will outline the principle features of the scheme.  It will offer part time work on a two and a half day basis for one year. Participants will be paid £70 per half week.  In addition, a contribution towards the cost of supervision and materials will be available.  The gross cost of the scheme in any one year with a participation rate of 10,000 people will be £57 million. There will be a build up of participants under the scheme.  The amount being sought for 1985 is £29.5 million.  Projects will be submitted for consideration by the public sector and voluntary organisations. It is anticipated that local authorities will be the biggest sponsors of <Col N="2603" /> projects, but other areas such as tourism, educational and support services are also expected to provide projects under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Projects submitted for consideration must be of a non-profit making character and be identifiable as a benefit to the community.  In no circumstances will any project be eligible where it is clearly in substitution for existing employment. This condition will be applied vigorously so that existing workers will not lose their jobs or have their hours of work and consequently their pay reduced because their employers availed themselves of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme will be administered by the National Manpower Service of the Department of Labour.  The details of the scheme are being finalised.  That is just a general outline.  It is not quite in order on this section, but in view of the questions which were asked I thought it would be appropriate and helpful to give that outline in order to make progress on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That outline was helpful. However, I must correct the Minister of State.  It is wrong of him to try to say that we are being unhelpful on this matter.  On the contrary, this Bill appeared on Monday morning.  We know that 17 per cent of the workforce is unemployed. It has gone up by 8 per cent in the last 12 months.  We now have the highest unemployment level in Europe. We will co-operate with any provision to alleviate that position that the Government might bring in.</P>
      <P>When we were told at the beginning of the week that this legislation was to be rushed through we said we would co-operate. We did that on the basis that we would have an opportunity to talk about this major new initiative.  All we know about it is what the Minister of State has told us, and that basically was in the national plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked who would administer the scheme and was told it would be the National Manpower Service.  I know the problems they have.  I imagine the reason <Col N="2604" /> why the Minister for Labour is not here today is that there are no details of the scheme but what happened was that the Department of Social Welfare were asked some months ago how they would handle a scheme such as that outlined in the national plan.  They worked out a scheme and that is what we are talking about today.  This Bill is totally isolated from what we thought we would be taking under this legislation.  We were further confused, so do not blame us.  We were told yesterday that this major new initiative would be outlined by the Minister for Labour during the course of the passage of the Bill.  The Government told us that.  I have sympathy with the Minister of State who had to come in and try to handle what the Minister for Labour ran away from.  I know that the Minister is in Brussels.  We do not want him to come back, because the business of the nation is important, but surely he had a script. We would not mind waiting for a few minutes if the officials wish to get that script.  The Minister of State could then read it.  Where is it?  It must be somewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State only told us what was in the national plan, but that is not new information.  How seriously can we debate a new scheme if we do not have details of it?  I am concerned about the long term unemployed, the hardship, deprivation and poverty that we have this Christmas.  That is why I want to debate it.  I do not want to be told I have no function in it.  I was told in the House when I asked about it last October that we could debate it within a few weeks. The House adjourns tomorrow.  When we come back, we will have the budget debate and then the Finance Bill and then a Social Welfare Bill to deal with other matters and other legislation.  We are being treated extremely unfairly.  Our Whip is now in the House.  He knows the basis on which we agreed to take this legislation.  We agreed to take the legislation relating to the Central Bank, which was dangerous legislation.  It was rushed through in a few hours.</P>
    <P>We do not know anything about this legislation.  We do not have any details. <Col N="2605" /> What is the scheme?  Who will run it? What categories will be involved?  How many women will be covered in it?  We want to know about the various social welfare schemes that would affect women but not men.  We have been treated appallingly all this week.  I am Opposition spokesman for Labour but I have nothing to contribute if the Minister of State has no more details.</P>

      <P>On the last point Deputy Ahern mentioned, as far as the Chair is concerned this is the Social Welfare Bill being sponsored by the Minister for Social Welfare.  It deals with a number of things.  The Chair can only look at the Bill as it is before the House in deciding what is and what is not in order.  In order to safeguard the Chair in the future about this, if a scheme was brought in on this Bill by the Department of Labour the Chair is anything but certain that a detailed &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;detailed&rdquo;&mdash;discussion on such a scheme would be in order on this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but would the Chair agree, as an experienced and very articulate legislator in Opposition, that when there is a Second Stage of a Bill and the main thrust of that Bill is about unemployment, it is only a technicality that is brought in under another Department?  The scheme is about the long term unemployed and how to reduce the numbers on the register.  It is to be operated by the National Manpower Service. We were told we would be given the details but now we find we are not being given any.</P>
      <P>I purposely did not contribute on Second Stage so that I could come in when I heard what the Minister for Labour said about the scheme.  I have the speech I intended to deliver yesterday with me but I gave way to my colleagues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Ahern has made a very reasonable request.  It seems that the Government have put the cart before the horse.  With due respect to the Department of Social Welfare, it seems that they have done their business, that they have looked at what effect this type of scheme will have for the Department and they have put this Bill before us.  We had something similar in the maternity protection legislation.  The Minister for Labour brought in the overall legislation and the Department of Social Welfare later told what effects that would have on the social welfare code.  The Department of Social Welfare and the Minister of State who is here have done their job but they have put the cart before the horse.  We are as anxious as the Minister is to see this done.  We want to see that the framework is right and to look at the welfare provisions in the light of the overall scheme.  Not only do we want to see that the framework is right but it would be important for the success of the scheme that people are attracted to it. If the voluntary bodies, local authorities and organisations are to be involved, it is important at this stage for them to know precisely what is involved for them and the effect it will have on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note from what the Minister of State said recently that the cost will be in the region of £58 million.  What appears to be going on here is a gimmick and a facesaver for the Government, a pretence that something is being done about unemployment.  Everyone knows that in the Land Commission and in the forestry division people are losing jobs day by day because the Government will not provide even £1 million to keep them in employment. Deputy Leyden here a few days <Col N="2607" /> ago raised the abolition of the Land Commission and its effect on the people employed there.  All of those people are being thrown out of work at a time when we are producing a face saving exercise, a public relations gimmick.  This is because the money to maintain them in employment has not been provided.  We cannot run away from this today.  The Minister for Labour has responsibility to tell us details of what he proposes to do in this so that we can get some indication of the impact it will have on social welfare payments and of what discussion we can have on this Bill before us.  This is just another Government exercise at whitewashing their total neglect to deal with issues that need to be faced.</P>

      <P>You, Leas-Cheann Comhairle, were not here when we were discussing this with the Ceann Comhairle. We have not got the details and the Department of Social Welfare are doing their best to bring forward here a Bill which is totally unacceptable and it is not catering for the scheme.  Can the Minister inform the House that the Department of Labour will bring forward legislation to provide for this arrangment in relation to taking on 10,000 people for schemes? That is important.  Will the Minister of State say now that the Minister for Labour will bring before this House a detailed Bill which will allow our spokepersons and our party to discuss in detail the long term implications of this scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Deputy Daly is relevant to the overall situation.  This is merely a window-dressing operation.  In <Col N="2608" /> reality, and &ldquo;building on reality&rdquo;, the semi-State organisations and the state Departments, including the Land Commission, are shedding their employees. Now we have a Bill coming before the House saying we are going to create 10,000 jobs when the Land Commission are laying off men just before Christmas and making them redundant while those men could be kept on if money was provided for them to maintain their jobs. Some of those workers were earning not much more than £70 a week net, yet those men are being laid off by this Government who have the hypocrisy to come into this House to bring in a half measure, a window-dressing exercise, a whitewashing exercise to try to quell a growing revolution among the young unemployed. There is a feeling among the people that something must be done. They will take to the streets unless this Government do something, and just before Christmas the Government bring in a Bill under the Department of Social Welfare which has no basis in reality because it does not deal with schemes or the overall plan promised by the Government. As an Opposition party we face difficulty in dealing with social welfare legislation when we should be dealing with the job crisis.  I put it to the Minister that if he would intercede with the Land Commission he would maintain many worthwhile jobs which would be fulltime and long term.</P>
    <P>Bord Telecom Éireann propose to shed around 4,000 jobs in the next 12 months. How realistic is it then to talk about creating 10,000 short term jobs when we are shedding 4,000 long term, permanent jobs in the communications business?  We are shedding them in the Land Commission, in Irish Shipping and in all other semi-State organisations.  This Bill is unrealistic.  We are concerned about employment.  That is why we are here prepared to debate this issue.  It is not fair of the Minister of State to say that in some way we are delaying this Bill.</P>

I did not speak <Col N="2609" /> because I was assured twice in the course of the Minister's speech that the Minister or a Minister of State from the Department of Labour would be here today to give us details of the scheme.  I am a member of a county council who want to employ people.  Constituents of mine, men and women in County Westmeath, are awaiting details of these jobs.  I would take a line slightly different from that taken by my colleagues and suggest that if we could hear the details of the scheme we might know who would get the jobs and what they would be doing.  This is all a charade.  I do not blame the Minister of State.  He came in with his little bit of business to do.  I do not know if he will get it done, but we are engaged in a charade.  We are talking about something we know nothing about.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, before you occupied the Chair Deputy Ahern put a very reasonable suggestion to the Minister of State, Deputy Pattison, and asked if it was possible for him to get the script which the Minister for Labour might be reading here.  Is it possible to have that script in the House so that the Minister could read it and at least could give us information which we require?  Surely the Minister of State is in a position to reply to that.  I did not hear him reply.  If that understanding is reached we can continue to discuss the Bill, but to do so is impossible at present. I was the last speaker here last night, and the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Desmond, said that it was hoped that the Minister for Labour would be here today.  It is unfair that the Minister of State present should say that we are trying to obstruct the process. That comment should be withdrawn.  I am asking the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare to reply to Deputy Ahern's question.  Is it possible to provide this document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Again let me say that the social welfare aspects of the scheme must be settled before the scheme can come into operation, otherwise nobody would <Col N="2610" /> know what his or her position was in regard to PRSI arrangements and insurability under the Social Welfare Acts. Some Deputies have expressed concern about insurability and I have clarified the matter there, as it was necessary to clarify it before the final details of the scheme could be worked out.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Walsh, let me say that I have already explained the reasons why both the Minister for Labour and the Minister of State cannot be here today. It was hoped that if the Minister were available a token Estimate for his Department would be introduced on which he would speak.  It was not the intention that the Minister would speak during the debate on the Bill since it is a Department of Social Welfare Bill.  However, that has not been possible but it should be possible to have the social welfare aspect cleared out of the way.  That is a prerequisite to the introduction of the schemes.</P>
      <P>I have been in public life for a long time and during that time I have been asked continuously why the Government of the day do not take action to provide work for the unemployed.  I am sure other Deputies have had the same experience. I have been asked why the State pay out so much money to be unemployed without being able to devise schemes to provide some work for them.  I have never been able to answer that question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. It would be impossible under our social welfare legislation to do what everyone seems to want us to do and that is why we are amending some aspects of our social welfare law.  This will remove some of the impediments in relation to the insurability of the kind of employment we have in mind and to the difficulties of people refusing to take up such employment. As the legislation stands, if people refuse to take up employment they can be disqualified from receiving benefit. Deputy De Rossa raised that point, too.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with section 3 of the Bill which proposes to change certain aspects of the social welfare legislation in order to enable people to take up certain types of employment and to enable them to refuse employment if they so wish, something that is not possible for them under the existing code. We are proposing also to enable people to leave the employment of their own free will.  Without these changes, the schemes could not come into operation.</P>

      <P>I emphasise again that there is no point talking about schemes if the necessary amending legislation is not enacted.  I do not see why anyone should wish to block these changes in the social welfare code.  There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the schemes when details of them are announced. Everyone's contribution will welcome.</P>
      <P>I take the point that we are all here trying to create employment.  What we are doing is a contribution in that direction. Nobody has claimed that in this way we are providing the answer to the unemployment problem but it is a positive effort.  I am not aware of any alternative scheme being proposed.  Again, I appeal to Members to allow us implement these necessary amendments to the social welfare code.  It can be argued that the present code is in some ways preventing certain forms of employment in that schemes could be devised if the legislation were otherwise.  We tell people who are unemployed that if they are to continue to obtain benefit they must not be employed even in a voluntary capacity, but we are trying to change that.</P>

      <P>We have gone out of our way to accommodate the Government on this Bill because we realise the importance of any step that can be taken to create employment and in particular to take young people off the dole queues. Yesterday the Minister for Social Welfare expressed his gratitude to us for the way in which we had facilitated him in allowing the Bill to go through.  The Minister talked about a major new initiative which would be brought into operation in the coming months by the Minister for Labour who would be giving an outline of the scheme in the House today. He went on to say that for that reason he <Col N="2613" /> did not propose to go into any great detail other than to mention aspects that were relevant to the proposals in this Bill.</P>
      <P>We have been conned.  Having tried to accommodate the Government in every way in the interests of the people who might get jobs as a result of the legislation, we had hoped to be given some details of the scheme.  We have all read this document of unreality in which the scheme is referred to in very vague outline. That is all the Minister for State has been able to read to us today.  What is contained in that document makes no sense.  We need to have details of the scheme, details of the type of employment that will be available and so on.  For instance, are the jobs concerned to be non-profit type jobs &mdash; in other words, basically community work?  We consider that we have been badly deceived by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as we have been able to do so we have discussed this Bill.  We are not blocking it.  We know practically nothing about the scheme the Government are referring to.  If this Bill passes and is of benefit to social welfare recipients that is good, but we cannot discuss it further as we have not been given the details of the scheme.  Last Monday we were asked to participate in social welfare legislation which had as its main thrust a new scheme which the Minister would outline during the course of the debate.  I did not speak on the Second Stage of the Bill because I understood that the Minister would come in here today to outline the details of the scheme so that we could debate the various amendments that would be necessary in the social welfare code.  We have done that so far as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither the Minister for Labour nor the Minister of State is here to give us the details.  At the start of the debate this morning I requested that if neither Minister could be here, if both had to be in Brussels doing the nation's business, the script which was meant to have been read by the Minister for Labour or his junior Minister could be read by the Minister of State in the Department of <Col N="2614" /> Social Welfare.  That request was refused.  Each time we made points and asked for details we were quoted the section of the national plan which we have known about since 3 October.  This leads us to believe that the Government wish to pass a Bill in the event of a scheme coming forward and that the reason there is no Minister and no script is because the scheme has not yet been worked out. The Department of Social Welfare in isolation from the Department of Labour were asked what would it mean for social welfare legislation, if there was a scheme whereby people who were unemployed for over 12 months were to work two-and-a-half days a week and to put that into a Bill.  They have done that exercise, but how can we go any further?</P>
    <P>How can we debate legislation to implement a scheme when we do not know anything about the scheme other than that it will be run by the Department of Labour and secondly that it will be administered by the National Manpower Service?  We know that the Manpower service have not the manpower or the resources to implement the scheme.  All we know about the scheme is that it cannot be implemented and we are asked to debate it.  We cannot do so.  We are in a total vacuum and cannot go any further. This Bill will probably pass by default without our efforts.  Either there is no scheme or the Government want to introduce it without debate in this House, by blocking our right to debate it.</P>
    <P>When the national plan came out on 3 October we were told the big issue was that in a matter of weeks 10,000 people would be off the unemployment register. It would provide jobs in local authority areas through environmental work schemes and so on.  That was in October, and we were told that we would have a chance to debate it within weeks.  Today, three months later, we are told we will be able to debate it some time in the new year, when we know that the budget, the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill will take up all the time of the next session.</P>
    <P>We have been totally misled.  We cooperated in relation to this legislation; we <Col N="2615" /> were treated shabbily and undemocratically. As far as we are concerned we have no further contribution to make to this debate.  This Bill will pass by default, and I hope it does because the Department of Social Welfare obviously feel that it is necessary to comply with something they have in mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister sent in here this morning has been totally misled.  I saw the Minister looking around earlier to see if some of his colleagues would come in to help him, but not one Member of the Government has come in.</P>

In future we will think twice before we come into this House to discuss imaginary legislation. When the details of the scheme come out perhaps time will be given to debate it, but until then we can play no further part in this debate.</P>

I sympathise with the Minister of State, Deputy Patterson, because he has been totally isolated by his colleagues.  Two Departments are involved here.  The Social Welfare Department have done their job in great detail but the Minister for Labour and his colleague totally failed us.  We were conned into believing that we would get the details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would do anything to help the Government create jobs.  We will do anything to help improve the employment situation, but we have been deceived and there is no purpose in us continuing.  I am satisfied that the social welfare details have been given but the details which we were assured would be furnished by the Department of Labour have not been given.  There is no representative from the Department of Labour to give the <Col N="2616" /> Minister a hand.  I feel sorry for the Minister, but we will have to withdraw from the debate as we cannot discuss this any further.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Minister in responding to the debate on section 3 referred to the disqualification of persons who would refuse employment under this section, in response to a query I raised. The Minister said that this Bill to amend the social welfare legislation would ensure that such persons were not disqualified. The only section of this Bill that might cover that is section 4.  Could the Minister explain in what way this section prevents people from being disqualified for refusing to take on jobs of this nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 provides that participants in the SES shall be disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance for the remainder of the week during their participation in the scheme. This means that workers employed under the scheme will not be eligible to draw assistance for the remainder of any week. The £70 will be paid in lieu of assistance and the scheme is being funded on that basis.  The worker concerned can take employment for the remainder of each week, if he or she can get it.</P>

      <P>I understood that a person who would refuse a job under the scheme would be disqualified from unemployment benefit, but the Minister assured me that will not occur.  He indicated that the Bill will prevent it from occurring.  In sections 2, 3 and 4 I cannot see any provision which would do this, and there could not be a provision in the other sections because they only deal with wet time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential point is that if a person does not wish to take a job he or she will not be knocked off unemployment asistance as a consequence.  It is not in the Bill but it is a feature of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Minister attempted to mislead the House earlier when he said the Bill would prevent the knocking off of people from unemployment assistance.  If it is not provided for in the Bill, why has there been all this talk about the necessity to get the legislation through?  The Minister must know that the managers of exchanges will be interpreting the law in relation to people's rights &mdash; they will not be interpreting what the Minister or I said in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for the making of an Exchequer grant to the Wet Time Fund in 1985 to cover the cost of any claims outstanding on the abolition of the scheme which cannot be met out of the Wet Time Fund.  At present the Wet Time Fund is financed by way of equal contributions from employers and workers.  However, the recession in the construction, engineering and painting trades in recent years has seriously affected the financial situation of the fund.  It is estimated that the amount in the fund at the end of 1984 will be of the order of £20,000.  This will not be sufficient to meet the cost of outstanding claims and therefore it will be necessary to meet this cost from the Department's Vote.  It is not possible to say precisely what amount will be required, but it is proposed that a sum of £0.5 million should be provided for this purpose, any unexpended amount being repaid to the Exchequer at the end of the year.  This section, therefore, amends section 269 of the 1981 Act by the insertion of two new subsections.</P>

Bhí suim beag airgid curtha ar fáil sa chéad bhliain le h-íoc as bóithre a bhí ceadaithe an bhliain roimhe sin ó bhí Fianna Fáil i gcumhacht.  Caithfidh an tAire glacadh leis nach bhfuil sé fíor a rá gur féidir le muintir na Gaeltachta iarratais a chur <Col N="2622" /> isteach go dtí a Roinn chun deontas a fháil le bóithre áise a dheisiú.

      <P>Nuair a bheidh a gcumas léirithe acu, má thagann siad ar an tuairim mheáite gur fearr a d'fhéadfaidís leas na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn ach cumhachtaí a fháil de bhreis ar a bhfuil acu faoi láthair, tig leo iarratas dá réir a chur ar aghaidh chugam agus breithneoidh mé go báúil é le súil go bhféadfainn an Rialtas a shásamh gur chóir dóibh ordú cuí a dhéanamh faoi alt 9 den Acht. Mar chabhair dom, ar ndóigh, beidh an cás iomlán le leagan amach ag an Údarás &mdash; na lochtanna sa chóras, na bealaí chun iad a leigheas, an costas a bheadh i gceist agus mar sin de.</P>

De ghnáth, nuair a bhíonn an tÚdarás ag scrudú iarratais le haghaidh tionscal nua téann siad i gcomhairle leis an IDA, cuir i gcás, le fáil amach an bhfuil a leithéid de thionscal sa cheantar nó sa tír &mdash; is rud náisiúnta é seo &mdash; ag fáil deontas uathu siúd.  Má cheaptar go bhfuil go leor de thairgeadh á dhéanamh ar cibe rud atá á dhéanamh ní thugann an tÚdarás deontas dá leithéid de thógra.

      <P>I am aware of newspaper reports that the Transport Employees Tontine and Benefit Society closed their doors about a week ago but I have no first hand information about the state of the society's affairs or the position of their members.  The society is registered under the Friendly Societies Act, 1896.  On 12 December the Registrar of Friendly Societies received an application pursuant to section 76 of that Act to appoint an inspector to examine and report on the affairs of the society.  This application is being considered as a <Col N="2648" /> matter of urgency.  Assuming the requirements of the Act are complied with, I will consent to the appointment of an inspector.  Apart from consenting to the appointment of an inspector, I have neither powers nor functions in relation to these societies.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of increasing public concern regarding provident and friendly societies taking deposits from the public?  Are there any controls or plans which can secure the public from substantial losses, in many cases of life savings?  Can the Minister exercise power in a case like this to ensure that such funds as may be in that society will be secured at this point from dissipation to the detriment of people who have put their life savings into it over perhaps 20, 30 or 40 years?</P>

Yesterday, 200 members of the society made application to have an investigator appointed to examine the affairs of the society.  This is being considered as a matter of urgency and, if everything is in order, I will consent to the appointment of an investigator without delay.  I cannot say any more at present.</P>

Do you accept that this is unsatisfactory from the point of view of the principal Opposition party?  Do you not see it, Sir, as a somewhat cynical exercise when the Chief Whip of the Labour Party purports to ask a question of a junior Labour Minister in the House about a matter of this sort when he had ready access to his own Minister?  I should be grateful if you would give some explanation as to why this Private Notice Question was allowed today when our <Col N="2649" /> spokesman was not allowed to raise it yesterday.</P>

      <P>In opening this debate on behalf of the Government I will be dealing with a number of features of the current political and economic situation.  The Government have now been in office just two years.  In that time there have been successes and disappointments.  I propose to talk briefly about these, and later to refer to thrust of Government policy for now and the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is evident that the decade of the eighties is being characterised by a set of circumstances and problems radically different from both the sixties and seventies. Quite apart from questions of ideology relating to preferred political and social choices of different Governments and different parties, the size of the issues to be faced is greater whether in relation to the management of the economy or, indeed, to our very capacity to continue to exercise effective choices over the policies Governments adopt, or to the fact <Col N="2908" /> of the alienation of many young people especially in deprived urban areas, or to the continuation of serious difficulties in Northern Ireland, or to the future shape of the European Community in economic, social and political terms.</P>
    <P>There are no easy options or choices. There is no basis for political auctions or long strings of political promises that are mutually inconsistent and are merely aimed either at embarrassing the Government or the Government parties, or at the naked bidding for short-term interest group support.  Unfortunately, we have seen in recent weeks plenty of apparent concessions or benefits floated off by Fianna Fáil without any analysis of the consequences or costs in other areas.</P>

      <P>Earlier in this session the House debated the national plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> and approved its adoption. At that time in opening the debate I recalled the fact that on taking office the Government were faced with critical policy choices and apparently conflicting priorities arising both from the impact of the recession and from the way the economy had been managed in previous years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Tough and unpleasant decisions were taken.  The objective was to recreate the conditions whereby economic recovery could occur, to minimise the effects of any deflationary action on <Col N="2909" /> growth and employment and to maintain the essential fabric of our public services in health, social welfare, education and other areas.  All these aims had to be accommodated in the context of a critical fiscal situation.  There was no room for any policies of budgetary expansion &mdash; rather many commentators were calling for major public expenditure cuts damaging in the short-term to both equity and employment.  These were avoided by deliberate Government choice.  Instead, the overall burden of taxation was raised, and adjustments made by that mechanism. Now, however, as the national plan recognises, the overall level of taxation, as distinct from its distribution, has reached its maximum.</P>
      <P>In the preparation of the national plan earlier this year the Government were concerned to deal effectively with the economic realities as they existed &mdash; the enormous unemployment issue, even though the rate of increase in employment had slowed in 1984 compared with 1983; the growing volume of national resources pre-empted for servicing the national debt; the relatively slow recovery in European markets; the still difficult but improving balance of payments situation; the fact that budgetary targets over the two years 1983 and 1984 were being broadly met; and the good news that manufacturing output and, in particular, exports were growing strongly, while inflation was falling.</P>
      <P>At the same time, social issues were of major importance; the need to protect social welfare recipients, the aged, the unemployed, the sick, from the burden of adjustment called for in the rest of the community, to ensure the continuation of social programmes in areas such as housing, health and education while at the same time seeking to ensure greater efficiency in the management and delivery of public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's choices on these issues were published in the national plan after a public debate arising from the publication of the National Planning Board's report last spring.  I well recognise that not everyone will agree with the choices made or the assumptions taken. <Col N="2910" /> However, what I want to stress today, rather than rerun the debate on the plan we had in October, is that the decisions made were taken on a realistic basis, on an honest appraisal of the facts and that the options represent a clear policy direction for three years ahead.  That is not to say that the proposals in the plan represent a long term solution to our economic problems on the ills of Irish society generally.  Although a significant increase in employment is projected up to 1987, there is no way that an unemployment outcome of the magnitude involved could represent a solution to my party or indeed, I am sure, to the other parties in this House.  The task of economic reconstruction, which must be accompanied by social equity, is a task for a decade or more.  What is essential is to get the policies and priorities in place that the situation demands in the short term.  This will allow the real long term choices for our society to emerge in a rational way and be put to the people at an appropriate time in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>It is widely recognised that significant adjustments in our approach to economic and budgetary policy were essential since the eighties began.  This process was and is in many respects difficult and unpleasant and has had to be approached in a balanced, rational and humane manner. As far as the elimination of the current budget deficit of 1987 was concerned, it was always the intention to take due regard of prevailing economic conditions and in particular of the importance of achieving economic growth and dealing with unemployment.  The Government have not been obsessed with &ldquo;balancing the books&rdquo; or &ldquo;bookkeeping&rdquo; or with abstruse financial matters, as some critics persist in claiming, rather than dealing with real human problems in our society. This is a travesty of the truth.  The Government are concerned with such problems only to the extent necessary to ensure that the Irish people as a whole can continue to exercise choice and discretion on the way we shape our society, to the extent required to prevent control from external sources over the policy decisions that are proper to us <Col N="2911" /> as an independent State.  These are the realities that must be recognised.</P>
    <P>There has been also some discussion in recent times emanating from Opposition Deputies and other sources on the question of the climate for enterprise and the need for more incentives.  Government policy has also been criticised as offering little or no hope to our young people and to the community generally or as fostering a type of national self-defeatism in relation to the economy and to issues relating to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government decisions in the national plan and in other areas do not offer false expectations or bogus remedies. The nation has had enough of cynical opportunist politics that aspire to present as real solutions the mere passing fancies of a political day.  Genuine optimism about the future of this country &mdash; I believe that the Irish people are capable of mastering all the difficulties in the way &mdash; can only be built on solid analyses of where we are, of what the policy options are and of realistic methods of achieving them.  This is the case whether one is proposing the politics of the right, the left or the centre.  There are many incentives for enterprise, public, co-operative and private &mdash; what is required is the careful rebuilding of national self-confidence in a spirit of realism and faith in ourselves that has been the hallmark of the Irish people at different times throughout our history.</P>
    <P>In this context the proponents of the importance of the private sector have many apologists, a visible array of intellectual support and effective methods of conveying the views of specific interest groups.  I recognise the important role of the private sector in our &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; economy and that the quality of its future performance is of major importance.  I want at this stage to say, however, some words on the role of the public sector and its importance in the context of the national plan, particularly as the public sector has been the subject of much comment in recent times.  Some of this criticism has been crude, biased and motivated by a superficial ideology; some <Col N="2912" /> of it has been balanced and has stressed the need for greater efficiency and public accountability in both the public service proper, in the public agencies and public commercial enterprises generally.</P>

      <P>The Government are not anti-public sector, in ideological terms or otherwise.  That is not to say that concern at their performance in the Dáil, in the Oireachtas Committees and in the community generally is not justified and proper.  The Government are committed to ensuring a more effective public sector geared to contributing to economic development by well run and profitable State enterprises, to social development by efficiently organised social services and to improved performance and accountability in public administration generally.  Regarding the commercial enterprises, it is important to remember that their financial results have often been adversely affected in the past by inconsistent objectives and by their taking on, often by Government or ministerial encouragement, of additional tasks in the field of social policy.  In judging their history, their current difficulties and their future potential, fair standards must be applied.</P>
      <P>In the Government's view commercial public enterprise has a key role to play in the future.  This means addressing the weaknesses that have arisen and laying major emphasis on developing modern industry, on commercial viability and on the earning of adequate profits.  In this respect the National Development Corporation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It will not be a resting place for failed enterprises, private or public, and the Government will be ready to make funds available for commercial projects as and when needed.</P>
      <P>As leader of the Labour Party, I believe in a strong, well-organised public sector making its full contribution to the creation and maintenance of jobs.  The Labour Party believe in backing that public sector, in defending it from unjust criticism and in supporting it through difficulties. Throughout the history of this Government, that influence is clear and visible.  CIE, for instance, will remain in public ownership in spite of the demands of some that it be dismantled and the profitable parts privatised.  The Great Southern Hotels were rescued and jobs preserved to the maximum extent.</P>
      <P>But we also believe in an efficient public sector.  We do not support the notion, now apparently being propounded by Fianna Fáil, that already very hard-pressed taxpayers should dip further into their pockets to pay for very bad management decisions such as in Irish Shipping.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context it is important to remember that the issues were not just about adverse trading conditions, or a temporary shortage of capital, or a medium-term downturn in profitability &mdash; Irish Shipping represented a fundamental miscalculation and it is that miscalculation that has doomed the company and not any lack of goodwill on the part of the Government.</P>
      <P>We really do not have any choice but to learn from the mistakes of the past. That is why those of us who believe in the public sector, even more than those who do not, are entitled to demand performance from that sector.  As long as I am in Government the public sector will occupy a central role in the economy.</P>
      <P>I want now to turn to certain aspects of the problems relating to the North.  I do not wish either to underestimate or overstate the size and scope of the major issues involved with which we are all freshly familiar in the post-Forum context.</P>
      <P>Firstly, it is clear that the realities of Northern Ireland are extremely difficult for us, for the British and for the people who live in the community.  The only approach to overcoming the bitterness which we have all inherited and for which Britain, of course, bears the heaviest responsibility, was accepted by Mrs. Thatcher when she agreed with the Taoiseach in the post-summit communique &ldquo;on the need for efforts to diminish the divisions between the two communities in Northern Ireland and to reconcile the two major traditions that exist in the two parts of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The British and Irish Governments now agree on the principles which must be respected by any new structures of government if they are to work and to last.  The British Prime Minister agrees &ldquo;on the need for efforts to reconcile the divisions that torment Northern Ireland and that damage this island as a whole&rdquo;. We are now at the most difficult stage of this process.  It is to move from a recognition of what is required in terms of principles to devising actual solutions which will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was, of course, regrettable that Mrs. <Col N="2915" /> Thatcher after Chequers concerned herself in her public presentation of the discussions excessively with the sensititivities of the Unionists to the exclusion of the Nationalists.  There is considerable evidence from her own remarks and from speeches by Mr. Hurd that this is now realised in London and that some attempt is being made to put it in balance.</P>

We will not be panicked by jingoistic hysteria into abandoning our commitment to changing the condition of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Alienation is a human problem, and it consists in depriving people of a sense of hope, a sense of confidence in their system of government and a sense of security, and Deputy Lenihan's record on the subject leaves much to be desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been our concern to convey to the British Prime Minister and her Government that they must understand the depth of this human problem.  There is no use in denying that the British have had considerable difficulty with the concept. It is an equally undeniable fact that whether or not the British like the word &ldquo;alienation&rdquo;, Mrs. Thatcher has accepted and adopted the key principles <Col N="2916" /> needed to address the problem.  She has accepted that &ldquo;the identities of both the majority and the minority communities in Northern Ireland should be recognised and respected, and reflected in the structures and processes of Northern Ireland in ways acceptable to both communities; also the process of government in Northern Ireland should be such as to provide the people of both communities with the confidence that their rights will be safeguarded.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To deny this progress is to say to the people of Northern Ireland and particularly to the Nationalists: &ldquo;We are more interested in winning verbal battles with Margaret Thatcher than in ending your misery&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Only at regular intervals. I want to turn now to the contribution made by the principal Opposition party, Fianna Fáil, to the resolution of the country's economic problems.  Let them listen carefully; they may not be familiar with the details.  Over the last month or so we have witnessed the emergence of a rejuvenated and refreshed Opposition. Barring any grotesque, unprecedented, bizarre, or unforeseen events this ought to be good news for the country &mdash; if only that party had rediscovered the sense of responsibility that its leader showed, for one fleeting moment, way back in early 1980.  Alas, it is the Mr. Hyde of Irish politics that has emerged from its long summer of idleness, rather than the Dr. Jekyll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think at this point I can do no better than read, for the record of the House, some passages from a work which is fast <Col N="2917" /> becoming a classic work of fiction.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The heavy and continuing demands on limited State resources are such that any further investment in the transport area which might lead directly or otherwise to reliance on help from public funds must have sound economic justification.</P>
    <P>This quotation, like the others I will read, is of course taken from <i>The Way Forward,</i> the body of work with which Fianna Fáil have developed a love-hate relationship.  I quote this one in particular in order to contrast it with the immediate, unequivocal commitment given by Fianna Fáil in the wake of the tragedy that befell Irish Shipping.  The contrast could hardly be more striking.  I would ask the House to note that the cost of that commitment would be of the order of £200 million of those same limited State resources that Deputy Haughey referred to.  I would also ask the House to bear that figure in mind, as I will be returning to it shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me now read another passage from the same work:</P>
      <P>Growth in the size of the public sector and consequently in its cost must be reversed.  This means that the numbers employed in the public service must be reduced, and pay increases in the public sector must be moderate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It becomes harder to believe that the authors of this work are living in a land of reality, when one contrasts this passage with the undertaking given by Fianna Fáil that the pay increases currently being demanded throughout the public sector ought to be conceded.  Again, I would ask the House to note that the cost of concession of <Col N="2918" /> these claims would be of the order of £312 million and again, I would ask the House to bear this figure in mind for a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Another quotation:</P>
      <P>In the initial years of the Plan the amount of resources available for the Public Capital Programme will depend directly on the degree of success achieved in reducing the current Budget deficit.</P>
      <P>How does one contrast this commitment with the fact that Deputy Haughey is offering to reopen Verolme Dockyard?  The cost of this particular promise is at least £40 million <i>per annum,</i> since the only basis at present on which the ships can be built is for the State to order them.</P>
      <P>And finally, a quote from that glorious work:</P>
      <P>The measures to reduce the budget deficit must therefore fall on expenditure through, for example, transferring the cost of some services now paid for out of either taxation or borrowing to the users of those services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">

      <P>Fianna Fáil had in fact already ensured that this would happen when they left office in 1982, by failing to provide an adequate amount of money for local authority services.  Now, despite both their promises and their record in this area, they are promising again to scrap local authority charges, and they cannot even be honest in this promise. They are now maintaining, with a total lack of truth, that the charges they had intended were to supplement existing services, rather than replace existing income.  The truth of the matter is &mdash; and it is important that everyone understand the depths of their dishonesty &mdash; that they were proposing to implement cuts in the local authority subsidy three times as great as the cuts we had to make, and the consequent charges, promised in <i>The <Col N="2919" /> Way Forward</i>, would have been three times as high.</P>
      <P>One final point in relation to this latest false promise &mdash; its cost would be approximately £25 million a year.</P>

      <P>Now, let me go back over the size of the figures that have emerged from this rejuvenated Opposition party in the last few weeks &mdash; £200 million for Irish Shipping, £312 million for public service pay, £40 million for Verolme, and £25 million for local authority charges.  That means that the promises that Fianna Fáil have made and claim to stand over, in the last month or so, amount to £577 million.  That must be a record.  It means that Fianna Fáil are now making promises at a rate of £10 million a day &mdash; it used to be only £30 million a by-election.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say to the Opposition benches that I would be delighted to be in a position to say that all of these promises were realistic, but they are not. So devoid of reality are they that one can only come to the conclusion that Deputy Haughey has seen one too many mirages lately.</P>
      <P>If we had that kind of money available to us &mdash; when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I do not mean the Government; I mean the country &mdash; we could halve that.  We could double pensions, and still have change, but the country does not have that kind of money as Deputy Reynolds knows, and so the country must make choices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But Fianna Fáil do not want to know about making choices &mdash; they never have wanted to know in recent times.  Far better to pull the odd stroke here and there, to play at politics as if it were a game of expedience.  Deputy Haughey is the man, after all, who in one breath is <Col N="2920" /> able to say that he is the only one who can define what the Forum Report means, and in the next can castigate the Government for allegedly abandoning interpretations of that report to which he never subscribed, or had any intention of subscribing.</P>
    <P>I was not surprised when Fianna Fáil denigrated the document <i>Building on Reality,</i> because I do not believe they know the meaning of either word.  Their vision is something you would find in a hall of mirrors, distorted at every turn by whatever pressure group they wish to reflect.</P>
    <P>This, then, is the alternative Government &mdash; a party who believe in false hope, generated by false promises.  Such a Government would be ill fitted indeed to deal with the problems this country has. They spent two years demonstrating that fact in office, and they have spent the last two demonstrating it in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I want before concluding to say a few words in a different capacity, that of Leader of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I have said many times, in this House and elsewhere, that my party is an independent one, which takes pride in its independence and will always cherish it.</P>
    <P>In participating in this Government we have done so for two main reasons &mdash; firstly, because we accepted the responsibility, following a long and difficult period of instability, to restore equilibrium to the process of government.  In short, we felt then, and still do, that it would not be in the country's interests or those of our supporters for us to opt out of what was clearly going to be a difficult task.  The Labour Party has never in its history opted out of what it saw as its responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is another key reason why we entered government &mdash; to protect the things we believe in and to progress our policies.  In our first two years in office we have as a Government had some successes.  Our main successes lie in these areas, and I can offer no <Col N="2921" /> apologies for pointing them out.  We have protected, and in some cases improved, the living standards of those who are dependent on the State for support, and we are the only Labour Party in Europe who can make that claim.  We have, despite the immense scarcity of resources, protected the integrity of the health services.  No one's life or well-being has been threatened and no one has been charged for services who has never been charged before.  We have introduced new schemes, and will be introducing more. The child benefit scheme announced in the plan will be one of the most radical and redistributive to come before this House for many years.</P>

      <P>Much, of course, remains to be done. In the years and months ahead, I will be seeking to make progress under two main headings.  In economic terms, we will be aiming to give the public sector contribution to job creation a new thrust and impetus through the advancement of the National Development Corporation.  We will also be seeking to continue the work, already started, of reform and redistribution in our tax system.</P>
      <P>In areas of social policy there will be opportunities and challenges facing each Member of this House in the months ahead.  It is my hope that each Member will find himself or herself able to approach these challenges in an open and humane way.  With openness, we can change this country for the better.

      <P>I trust that what I have to say will be relevant to the current social <Col N="2922" /> economic and political situation because what we have heard is totally unrelated to the realities of society.  It is important to emphasise the sort of society in which we live and that we here in this Parliament of the people approach the problems of that society in a serious and responsible manner.  The Tánaiste's speech, with its verbiage, its persiflage and its nonsense, did not in any way make any serious contribution to those problems or to what I would regard as the meaningful debate we should have.</P>

I appointed Mr. William O'Brien Fitzgerald, a strong Fine Gael supporter and then a leading senior counsel at the Bar.  I recommended his appointment to a Fianna Fáil Government presided over by the late Mr. Lemass.  Mr. O'Brien Fitzgerald was appointed a High Court judge and subsequently a judge of the Supreme Court.  I happened to recommend also a former Fine Gael Deputy who is now President of the High Court.  I refer to the former Deputy Thomas Finlay.  He, too, was appointed to the High Court by a Fianna Fáil Government and he is now a President of the High Court.  That is my personal record in regard to matters of this kind.</P>

That should be our function here.  We are not in a debating society, we are here to represent the majority of the people.  We are not helped to perform our function by speeches such as the one we have just heard.  It is essential to make credible decisions on a whole range of political, social and economic affairs in order to restore confidence in our democratic institutions.

People base their assessment of the Government on their performance and on the possibilities held out.  Under this criteria it is quite clear that this Government fall.  It is disgraceful for this Government to continue in power on the basis of the present assessment of the Government by the people at every level.  If the Government insist on staying in power we will move towards a revolutionary situation.  Young people will become impatient and will want to know how long we can have an impotent and incoherent Government in power.</P>
      <P>Political power should not be abused by exercising it in a corrupt manner merely to appoint people to specific jobs. Political power is not a game.  Political power is sacred.

    <P>I can numerate the major errors of recent months which have eroded confidence. In the early part of this year the budget was introduced and a set of figures were prepared in regard to expenditure, revenue, balance of payments, imports and exports and so on.  Many facts and figures were produced by the Minister for <Col N="2926" /> Finance based on what he called authoritative information available to him.  A few months later that was shown to be a complete fraud and the infamous black hole that it has caused will cost us over £500 million, perhaps even £1,000 million.</P>

      <P>I will go again into item No. 3 which makes us very sad, the disastrous handling of the agricultural negotiations with the EC, the whole miscounting with regard to our milk figures, so that substantial moneys have been lost to Irish farmers.  The losses are not yet fully assessed so I will not create any scare in that respect.  There was certainly a disastrous presentation of the Irish case based on the miscalculation of figures in regard to milk production.</P>
      <P>The presentation of the case was not the most brilliant in the world but, if the Minister for Finance, the Government and the Department of Agriculture had given the presenter the right figures, he mught have managed even half way. When the Government presented him with the wrong figures, that young man had no chance good, bad or indifferent. I got the play-back from Brussels and, as far as the EC Commission are concerned and the Council of Ministers, on the agricultural front we are just a joke by reason of this presentation of our case during 1984.  Sometimes it is nice to be charitable, and sometimes we give the people the charity of silence.  I will say no more about that.</P>
      <P>I want to go into an area apart form the economic area but very directly related to it.  At no time since the formation of the State have we have such a breakdown in law and order in regard to the protection of ordinary people in their houses and homes.</P>

      <P>The loss of financial credibility which is basic to the functioning of the State is probably the most serious aspect of this whole matter.  We are not getting the money from abroad that we should be getting.  That has led to the Government being forced to borrow on the home market exchanges. This has let to increased interest rates in order to attract funds from home sources. We have had the rise in bank interest rates which was announced recently.</P>
      <P>That rise in bank interest rates was caused deliberately by the Government. Having deprived themselves of the capacity to get money on external markets because of their total lack of credibility on foreign markets, they have had to borrow on home markets and raise the interest rates.  Interest rates have risen across the board and that will happen in the mortgage area as well.</P>
      <P>This rise in interest rates was caused deliberately by reason of the Government's lack of credibility and inability to raise money abroad.  We had the liquidation of Irish Shipping, an international body of standing, an international shipping organisation which carried the Irish name and was basically an agency of the Irish Government. When that was liquidated, on the international exchanges Ireland was put into a doubtful credit category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus are facing precisely the <Col N="2929" /> same problem.

Above all, we depend on it from the point of view of international trade such as was done by Irish Shipping, is being done by Aer Lingus and numerous major private Irish firms.  They depend on our credibility for their banking and business transactions.  That is fundamental. The Government have seriously dented that credibility which we had since the formation of the State until this disastrous set up started on their way. They started to mistake real politics for cosmetic politics.  That is where the real damage was done.</P>
      <P>They began to believe their own stories.  They began to believe the people who projected them and wrote stories and headlines for them.  The unreal became the real.

      <P>In particular we stand by the conclusion of the Forum report and we are respected.  I have met so many British people, I have met British Prime Ministers and party leaders and Ministers all over the years and they respect us when we state our position.  But the day <Col N="2932" /> you start giddy goating around and do not state your position, that is the time you lose respect.  Your Taoiseach has lost respect and the Taoiseach of this country has lost respect as far as the British Government are concerned, as far as the international community is concerned and as far as Ireland is concerned.  It is very important to recognise this basic fact.</P>
      <P>Let us remember, between now and Christmas and into the new year that we have a country.  Let us get down to restoring its credibility.  Let us get down to having a Government in power that can restore its credibility.  This Government have lost their capacity to do that. This Government must go, for that reason and for no other reason but that. They must go out, out and out, and no question about it.  This Government have no credibility on the political front, on the social front.</P>

      <P>This country will solve its problems in the employment area if we can create more <Col N="2933" /> jobs and we will do that if we succeed in three areas: (1) in having more investment; (2) in having more production; and (3) in having more exports.  Under this Government in the last year we see this country succeeding on all three fronts.</P>
      <P>The fact is that there have been 30 to 40 per cent more projects approved in this country by the IDA this year than in the same period last year.  There have been 30 to 40 per cent more foreign industrialists coming to this country to invest here and to examine this country as a place for investment than came here in the same period last year.  Irish exports in 1984 are growing at 17 per cent a year, the fastest rate of growth in Irish exports in any year on record.  That is what is happening.  We are having more investment and more exports and it is through investment and exports that we create jobs, not by borrowing money which is simply robbing the children of the future to consume today: it is by selling things that people want to buy.  That is a difficult task to do and it is a task that this Government, unlike their predecessors on the other side of the House, are succeeding in doing.</P>
      <P>We are not creating artificial and temporary prosperity financed by borrowing which we know now all too well has to be repaid.  We are creating future prosperity and future employment the hard way, but the real and sustainable way through selling more, producing more and investing more.  May I repeat, for the Opposition lest they did not hear it, there are more people coming to this country to investigate foreign investment here than there were last year by 30 to 40 per cent. There are more projects being established here by small industries than there were by 30 to 40 per cent.  I was very glad to be able to announce this morning 1,000 new jobs being created in the north city of Dublin by a Hong Kong industrialist. I am glad to say that I was directly involved in creating this great opportunity for so many young people who need it so badly as a result of two visits to Hong Kong on industrial promotion since I became Minister.</P>

Pensions for judges, I ask you, on a day when the Government announced 1,000 new jobs.

If we are to succeed here we cannot rely as we did in the past, solely on foreign investment, although we shall still continue to attract it.  We must rely much more than we have done in the past on our own people having confidence in themselves, putting their own money down thereby creating more employment.

First of all we are providing one place where anybody from any region who has an idea about creating a project can obtain all the advice he or she needs. The position to date has been that many people go to the IDA for one thing.  They find then that they need advice on exports when they must go to Dublin to the CTT. Or perhaps one needs premises and one has to go to Limerick to SFADCo.  After that perhaps one needs research done on one's project and one must go to the IIRS in Dublin.  Such a prospective industrialist almost has to be as expert as is a civil servant in the Department of Industry to know one's way around all the schemes supposed to be available in order to help one.  That is not the way to do business. People with an industrial project want to get all the advice together in one place and quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There will also be loan guarantee schemes for exporters that did not exist before.  These are being introduced by this Government to help Irish exporters to create jobs.  We recognise also that while foreign firms have access to technology &mdash; probably having developed it at their home research bases &mdash; native Irish firms do not have it.  So, again, for the first time this Government are giving research grants that were never available before to Irish industry to acquire technology abroad.  Therefore, rather than bringing technology into Ireland to be used by foreign industrialists, when much of the profits are sent back home to the foreign parent, we are giving Irish people the opportunity to buy the technology abroad so that in using it here the profits can remain here.</P>
      <P>They are sensible developments as far as industrial policy is concerned.  Through the emphasis being placed on small, native industries, this Government will ensure a much more secure industrial base five to ten years hence than we have at present.  That is a direct result of the policies we are implementing and which I have outlined.  There are many parts of Irish industry owned by the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are also providing, through the National Development Corporation, the possibility of creating new State enterprises which will be either on a partnership basis or wholly owned by the State, guided into the areas of new technology in which they will operate on strictly commercial criteria, and which will be sold off after a period of operation and the money redeployed to establish a further new enterprise to create jobs with the aid of the State.

It is only by seeing our agriculture as part of a food industry for the consumer, it is only by deciding that what the consumer wants in the supermarket is what we should produce on our farms, that we will ever have a hope of having a long term future in agriculture.

We will not have a position where Irish agriculture is simply a commodity producer like some Third World country dumping its products on to the market and hoping with a prayer that somebody will buy them.  Instead, Irish agriculture will be based on contracts.  It will be organised like a modern industry and producing what the consumer wants to buy.  That is the way of the future and it is what we have outlined for our agricultural policy <Col N="2942" /> in our plan.  It is a policy that will work. I have confidence that in their more reflective moments &mdash; clearly they are not in a particularly reflective mood now &mdash; the Opposition will see it as the right policy.</P>

      <P>I should like to talk about the measures the Government are adopting to deal with the long term unemployment problem.  We have one of the highest rates of long term unemployed among our total unemployed in Europe. We have well above the average among our unemployed people who have been unemployed for more than a year.  Oddly enough, and this may be surprising, in comparative terms we have a relatively lower number of people under 25 who are unemployed as a proportion of our total unemployed.  Our really big problem &mdash; and this is recognised clearly in the <i>Building on Reality</i> document &mdash; is among the long term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to outline what the Government are doing about the long term unemployed.  We are providing an enterprise allowance scheme to give these people an opportunity to get off the dole, set up their own business and restore their dignity.  We recognise that many unemployed people are in that condition because they did not get adequate training or the skills they have are no longer demanded in the market place. We are providing, through the alternates scheme, an opportunity for those people to combine training with work so that they can restore their dignity and ability to sell what they have to offer.  Through the social employment scheme we are offering an opportunity to those people to do something useful for their community. Rather than paying people to do nothing we will be paying people to do something. These people will then have dignity and pride in themselves.  Their neighbours will have pride in them because they will be doing something useful rather than <Col N="2943" /> simply queueing up.  That is an important step forward.</P>
    <P>We also recognise that for many of the unemployed a lack of a basic education was a major part of the reason for their being in that condition in the first place. We are launching a major adult education programme as part of an attack on adult illiteracy.  There are many people &mdash; Deputy Tunney, a teacher, will be aware of this &mdash; who left our school system without being able to read.  It is no wonder that such people are unemployed. The Government, through their adult education programme, are launching a major attack on adult illiteracy to give these people the basic ability which is so necessary for having employment in this climate.</P>
    <P>Through the introduction of the family income supplement and the child benefit scheme, which will not discriminate between those at work and those on social welfare, the incentive to work for many of the unemployed will be greatly enhanced. At the same time we will be giving major benefits to those with families who need help most.  I listened with some lack of surprise to Deputy Lenihan referring to interest rates.  I should like to tell the House why interest rates are as high as they are.  They are high because the Government have to borrow too much. That has to be done mostly to repay debts incurred by the party opposite when in Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

      <P>Far from having a current budget deficit this year of about £800 million to £900 million, if we did not have to pay interest on debts incurred by our predecessors we would have a budget surplus of between £200 million and £300 million.  In fact we are a company trading at a profit with a financial loss because of debts in the past.</P>

      <P>We would be now in a position were it not for the inheritance of <Col N="2944" /> debts in the past, most of which were unnecessary and irresponsibly undertaken by the party opposite, that we would have a budget surplus.  We would be able to give money away without borrowing a penny.</P>
      <P>Our only problem in that financial sense is the interest on the debt.  The measures I have outlined indicate that the Government have set in train the policies necessary to do the three things needed to create jobs &mdash; invest, produce more and sell more.  We have policies to enhance our export growth and already we have a rapidly growing export market. We have policies to increase our output and already we have one of the most rapid rates of growth in industrial output in Europe.  We have policies to promote more investment and more people are investing this year than last year in new industrial projects.  More people are coming from abroad to invest here than last year.</P>
      <P>These are all signs that under the Government the country is moving confidently in the right direction.  They are clear policies as distinct from the approach of the Opposition which is simply one of agreeing with everybody. Members will recall the famous cliché about Lanna Machree's dog who was prepared to go a bit of the road with everybody. There is no doubt but that the Opposition are prepared to go a bit of the road with everybody when it comes to making promises.  But Charlie Machree's dog, is prepared to go the whole way home with everybody.  That is not a sound basis on which to run a political party.</P>

      <P>I had enjoyed myself at some festivities last night and I realise we have amplification available to us here.  I am not an aspirant for histrionics in any public hall and, accordingly, I hope that the Chair and the House will accept if I do not indulge in the loud tones, the roaring and shouting of the last speaker. However, I hope to be able to put before the House facts and considerations which will justify what I will say.  I accept that Christmas time is a period of good cheer, forgiveness and magnanimity.  It is a time <Col N="2945" /> when one might be encouraged to leave aside anything which might be distasteful to the listener.  Bearing all that in mind, the first thing I must do in the debate is to call on the House to ask, in God's name, for the resignation of the Taoiseach. With the indulgence of the House I propose to put forward some of the reasons for that call.  We are blessed in having available to us a <i>magna carta,</i> a Constitution which indicates to us how we should proceed at all levels.  There is a special section in the Constitution which refers to the appointment of an Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">

      <P>It is not my intention to direct my remarks at any Member other than the occupant of the Chair and I hope I will have the protection of the Chair from any interruptions, helpful or unhelpful, by Deputy McLoughlin or any Member.  I try not to interrupt or insult anybody and I am not going to take that from the Deputy, or anybody else, while I am endeavouring to collect my thoughts.  If the Deputy has any contribution to make in regard to the appointment of his party's nominee for Attorney General, the House is open to him.  I will listen patiently to him while he makes the case why the Taoiseach abrogated his responsibilities and passed them to the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution requires that the President appoint the Attorney General on the nomination of the Taoiseach.  We will see ample evidence of that if we examine the appointments to that office since the establishment of the State.  It has been the fashion to appoint a person who has gained a certain reputation in that field.  It has also been the custom to appoint a man or a lady who has certain sympathies towards the political party to which the Taoiseach belongs.  I see nothing wrong with that.  We all know that, whatever means is adopted to make it appear otherwise, the person who nominated <Col N="2946" /> the new Attorney General is not the Taoiseach but the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring.  These are the facts and nobody can deny them.  The public who have been reading the papers for the last few days or weeks know there was bartering about the appointment of the Attorney General.  We knew there was internal squabbling within the Labour Party as to whether the appointment should go to a lady or a gentleman but the Labour Party, in typical chivalrous fashion, appointed a gentleman.  I am not concerned about that but I am concerned about the Taoiseach abrogating his constitutional responsibility.  Any Taoiseach who does that is not worthy to hold that high office. I want to draw the attention of the House to difficulties which might arise in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Constitution if the Attorney General does not interpret the wishes of the Taoiseach or his party the Government can ask for his resignation. What is going to happen in the new year if the Taoiseach wants advice on the new laws from the &mdash; I do not want to make little of the office &mdash; cuckoo Attorney General?  Will the Taoiseach have the power to ask for his resignation or must he go to the Tánaiste, to the Labour Party, to Deputy Mervyn Taylor or Senator Mary Robinson to ask permission for the resignation of the man holding this office?  A Taoiseach who would put himself in that position is not worthy to hold that office and nobody in this House can say otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot of clap trap about commitments to policies and plans.  It was nauseating to hear the Minister with responsibility for creating employment telling us about these plans while there are over 200,000 people unemployed. Two years ago I heard him baying across the House telling us that when unemployment <Col N="2947" /> went beyond 100,000 the Government should get out of office.  Now there are 215,000 recorded unemployed and a further 5,000 or 6,000 could be taken into account if the Minister for Education had not been given a certain sum of money to encourage people to stay at school.</P>
    <P>I am making a case for the resignation of the Taoiseach.  On top of all the disasters facing this country we have a Taoiseach who can take European Presidents and tell them how to solve their wine lake problems.  This matter was given top priority at a time when there is poverty and deprivation of a kind never seen before in this country.  He who has his eyes on the stars never sees what is at his feet &mdash; and sometimes he does not want to.</P>
    <P>In a political, not a personal, sense I want to castigate the Taoiseach.  Some months ago his Government decided it was necessary to introduce a mini budget. They met and made all the arrangements for the introduction of that unpopular measure.  We heard the Minister, Deputy Bruton, talk about doing the unpopular thing.  What can one expect from a Taoiseach with a reputation for being forthright, brave and honest?  One imagines he would have had the courage to announce that mini budget, but what did he do?  He arranged for the mini budget to be announced by civil servants while he was in Europe.  This is a Taoiseach, who according to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is ever ready to do the unpopular thing.  When the pressure came from within his own and other parties, what did he do?  In some telepathic way he contacted the poor, unfortunate Tánaiste and had him make the unpopular announcement.  Perhaps it was at that stage that the bartering for the appointment of the Attorney General started; I do not know.  Perhaps that was the time when his indebtedness to the Tánaiste started; I do not know.  But these are the facts.  That situation cannot and should not be condoned.</P>
    <P>There is another appointment I would like to mention, the European Commissioner. I had the pleasure of knowing <Col N="2948" /> the former Attorney General and I have nothing against him, but the nature of the office is such that ideally it should go to a politician.  The Attorney General, Mr. Sutherland, made a slight unsuccessful attempt at politics but, apart from that, his involvement was in the legal field which may have been of some assistance to him in his office.  I am concerned that there did not exist between the Taoiseach and that great politician Mark Clinton, and that capable politician Richie Ryan, a certain understanding because the Taoiseach was prepared to forego what should have been a proper, more understandable and welcome appointment, one that would satisfy his own scenario and which would affect the two gentlemen to whom I have referred.  I mention them because of the fact that it would not have brought upon the Taoiseach the unwelcome situation of having a by-election.  He would not do that, but for some unknown reason he affronts politicians so that he could make this other appointment &mdash; not for the best reasons.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach since his entry into politics has paraded himself as the person who would not be associated with or tolerate anything which would not be above board.  He is aware that his Minister for Defence gave an assurance in respect of an appointment in County Kildare that everything that was traditional, proper and correct regarding appointments had been followed.  I was happy to accept the assurance of the Minister but on the following day we had the appalling and startling announcement that the Minister for Finance had interfered in the fashion mentioned by this side of the House and that the person appointed would not have been appointed were it not for the fact that he had the political qualification which was regarded as essential.  I am not talking about the imaginary jobs to which Deputy Bruton referred; I am talking about jobs and appointments that were made.  I do not see any way in which I can exonerate the Taoiseach or withdraw my request to him earlier on.  He is not fit to act as Taoiseach any more.</P>
    <P>Some four months ago the country was <Col N="2949" /> treated to a rather exciting presentation of circumstances under which the Taoiseach had prepared a paper which would destroy the myth that the Famine had killed the Irish language.  As one who has some slight interest in the Irish language I was rather taken aback, because in studies I have done I have never seen it stated that the Famine had killed the Irish language. I have my own views as to what might have been the cause, and I realised that the Taoiseach was applying himself to looking into the tragic happenings of the last century to discover reasons why the Irish language had been killed.  However, in his position as Taoiseach, and notwithstanding the requirements that exist that Irish is the first official language of this House, he appointed a Ceann Comhairle whose knowledge of Irish, as he admitted, was not of the kind which would make it comfortable for him to discharge his duties in the Irish language. Having said that, I should like to pay as great a compliment as I can to the Ceann Comhairle for the manner in which he has applied himself to redressing the inadequacy which he had on taking up the appointment.  It was not because of promptings from the Taoiseach but because of his own sensitivity to what is necessary that he has applied himself to mastering the language so that he will be able to discharge his duties.  I am castigating the Taoiseach who initially appointed somebody who did not have the capacity to conduct the affairs of the House in Irish.</P>
    <P>If we are looking for reasons for what might militate against the advancement of the Irish language, another important appointment was that of Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  A great man was appointed to that position, but he admits that his capacity to discharge his duties through the medium of the Irish language is not wonderful.  We all know that the development of the Irish language depends to a large extent on the exhortations, examples and policies of the Department of Education.  What do we get in respect of those appointments?  The Minister for Education, on her own admission, has very little knowledge of Irish.  Her Minister <Col N="2950" /> of State, on his own admission, has a working knowledge of the language but is not all that happy about carrying out the duties of that office through the medium of the Irish language.  I do not mention those appointments to reflect on the four personalities in question because they are people for whom I have the highest regard.  I mention them to demonstrate the unreasonable attitude of the Taoiseach, who will search and waste his and everybody else's time going back a century to find a reason which militated against the Irish language.  However, when he is in a position to help the advancement of the language he does the opposite.</P>
    <P>I now come to the appalling picture which we all saw on television when the Taoiseach of this great country addressed his audience in a fashion that made his most ardent admirer feel embarrassed.  I felt embarrassed when he made one point.  I listened to the Prime Minister from the adjoining island say that the essence of her discussions with the Taoiseach was the matter of restoring stability to Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom.  If an Irish Taoiseach is prepared to waste his time with any British Prime Minister doing nothing other than admitting to her that Northern Ireland was his function in respect of providing protection for her squatting in that part of our island, he is not interpreting the wishes, tradition or feelings of the Irish people.  I hope he is not interpreting the feelings of the Fine Gael or Labour Parties either.  Those are some of the points which occurred to me as reasons why I would be justified in appealing to the Taoiseach to step aside.  We would hope there could emerge from some quarter a Taoiseach who would bring leadership, forthrightness, courage and determination to the Irish people in the present appalling times.  We would not then have a Taoiseach who would make a mockery of our Constitution.  Think of the insensitivity of the proposed legislation to provide pensions, when there are so many underprivileged families here.  I referred last week to the refusal in my own constituency of the Minister for <Col N="2951" /> Social Welfare to withdraw the decision of the health board to take two allowances from an unfortunate, newly-married man confined to a wheelchair.  He was left dependent on his new, young wife. The Government have nothing better to do than to apply themselves to providing very attractive pensions for judges.  To say the least, it is nauseating.  Whether it be in pubs, on the streets, at shop corners, today there is abroad a degree of cynicism and depression never before experienced in this great nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton, illustrates the extraordinary removal of members of the Government from the facts.  He addressed me on my knowledge of the incidence of illiteracy in adults, which exists.  But there is also an incidence of illiteracy among those attending our primary schools.  As a Junior Minister I referred to the extraordinary situation where those who contribute most to the educational pool get least out of it, that the rest of us were contributing four-fifths of the cost of the education of all our university graduates. The dentist, the doctor and the legal man, having availed of these opportunities, showed their thanks to the public by charging them for every time they would speak to them.  At the same time, in our primary schools the children of the PAYE worker who are dependent solely on this form of education, had a student-teacher ratio of one to 35 or 40.  There was no provision for remedial teaching.</P>
    <P>I have been making representations to the present Minister for Education in respect of some of the schools in my area. We are talking about equality of education, but it would be necessary to adjust the whole scheme so that there would be a more favourable student-teacher ratio where there is a need for the provision of remedial teachers.  I was told no, that the same criteria which apply to good, upper income, middle class areas apply to those.  Some children's education can be complemented and supplemented by their parents who have &mdash; I was going to say nothing else to do &mdash; who have the <Col N="2952" /> facility for this, as against the offspring of those who are unemployed, or who have broken marriages, or the like.  The Minister's interpretation of equality in education is to expose both these classes to the same system.  She talks about job creation education but six months ago a caretaker in one of the primary schools in my area opted for some other employment and the headmaster and the board of management could not get permission from her to appoint a successor.  Minister Bruton is telling me of his exploits in Hong Kong, New York, Los Angeles, all over the world, looking for somebody who would create a job or give employment in this country, yet I cannot get our Minister for Education to provide a salary for a caretaker in that primary school catering for 560 students.  The unfortunate headmaster and board of management and staff have to run bingo and think up all forms of fund raising to provide for that essential service.  The only concern of Minister Bruton is that more money be provided for adult education. I agree that it should be provided, but our first concern should be with primary education.  If we have education at primary level, we will not have illiteracy manifesting itself at adult level.</P>
    <P>Minister Bruton, in my opinion, was uncharacteristically insulting to this side of the House.  He is a great man for the plans and the policies.  When I followed him as Junior Minister at the Department of Education, there was nothing else before me but a plan which that Minister who was then Junior Minister for Education, had prepared.  This referred to youth policies and organisations.  He had spent four years preparing that plan, but during that time he had allowed the whole youth scheme to become a helpless orphan.  In fact, there was no youth scheme at all. The first thing I had to do was to appeal to the then Minister for Finance, the late George Colley, to give me a sum of money so that all the youth organisations would not disappear.  For the previous four years we had this great Minister for plans and research and visits to Hong Kong and elsewhere.  He had prepared a plan which made lovely reading but <Col N="2953" /> brought no results.  I am afraid that all of the plans he had to reduce unemployment will be the same.  While he is talking about employment, unemployment is the fact of the day.  When he can come into this House and bay across to us that he has reduced unemployment to a figure below at least 100,000 then I shall give some credence to what he has to say.</P>

      <P>We were returned by the people to this House even if by an accident of birth or whatever we are not as qualified as the Deputy is in that area. I thought the Deputy's contribution was unfortunate.</P>
      <P>As the time at my disposal is limited I intend to confine my remarks to current developments of importance with in my own area of Ministerial responsibility. Firstly, I would like to advert briefly to the token Supplementary Estimate which the House is being asked to vote for my Department.</P>
      <P>The sum of £62,000, under subhead S, is required to pay gratuities to the former chairman and certain former ordinary members of An Bord Pleanála which are payable under the scheme entitled &ldquo;An Bord Pleanála (Chairman and Members) (Superannuation) Scheme, 1984&rdquo;, which was made in accordance with the provisions of section 9 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 15 February, 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of £86,000 for subhead U (Miscellaneous Services) is required to meet costs awarded in July 1981 against the Minister for the Environment in Circuit Court proceedings.  These are in connection with a Water Rights Provisional Order made by the Minister in June 1980 under the Water Supplies Act, 1942, relating to the Carlow north regional water supply scheme.  The circumstances of this case were exceptional in that the Minister was joined as a party in the <Col N="2955" /> Circuit Court proceedings.  Although the court upheld the provisional order, all the petitioners' costs and those of the county council were awarded against the Minister.</P>
    <P>The £1,000 sought for subhead E4 relates to the new £5,000 housing grant scheme for local authority tenants which was announced in the national plan.  The scheme will cover certain tenants and tenant-purchasers who vacate local authority houses and build or purchase houses for their own occupation.  Grant applications are processed by local authorities. The scheme operates with effect from 2 October, 1984 but no grants will mature for payment until the new year.  Provision has been made in the Department's Estimates for 1985 to fund the new grant scheme which has already evoked considerable interest.  Full statutory backing for this grant will be sought in a new Housing Bill which I hope to introduce in the coming session.  Its inclusion in the Supplementary Estimate is of a technical nature to enable grants maturing for payment early in 1985 to be paid prior to the approval of my Department's 1985 Estimate.</P>
    <P>The net amount sought in the Supplementary Estimate is, however, only a token £1,000 since £148,000 will be met from savings on subhead E6 &mdash; the Rent Tribunal.  These savings arise primarily because of a lower than anticipated volume of work in the year and the fact that the tribunal did not as a consequence take up new accommodation.</P>
    <P>The provisions for my Department in 1985, as shown in the recently published Estimates and public capital programme, are in accordance with the overall scheme of the national plan.  Considering the constraints imposed by the overall fiscal strategy, which I believe to be a well balanced one, and the rigorous scrutiny to which spending programmes were generally subjected by the Government, my Department's provisions can in general be regarded as satisfactory.  Next year's capital allocations to my Department, at £632 million, are 6 per cent up on this year's likely outturn.  As regards <Col N="2956" /> current expenditure, the total Environment provision of £578 million shows an increase of almost 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>In recent years environmental problems have been attracting increased attention at local, national and international level.  Within the European Community a significant package of proposals has been presented by the Commission during the last year to deal with different aspects of the air pollution problem and I am happy that the Council of Environment Ministers at a meeting in Brussels last week, chaired by me, reached agreement on a number of these.</P>
    <P>Agreement was reached on the difficult and controversial issue of lead in petrol. This is a major achievement on both health and environmental grounds.  Its implementation will lead to a significant reduction of the level of lead in air and in the environment in general, especially in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The Environment Council also made decisions on guidelines for a Community approach to the further reduction of vehicle emissions and agreed a proposal on air quality standards for nitrogen dioxide. In addition, the Council decided to establish an experimental information system on the state of the environment, with acid depositions one of the priority areas to be studied.</P>
    <P>Lastly, the Council formally adopted a directive on the transfrontier shipment of hazardous wastes which are exported for final disposal.  All of these measures are in accordance with the aims set out in the Community's third environment action programme.  The agreement reached last week on these important proposals for the protection of the environment is a substantial achievement for the Irish Presidency of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The subject of air pollution here at home, and especially in Dublin, has been debated in this House and in the Seanad recently and has received considerable press coverage.  It is true that air quality in our capital city, particularly the level of smoke, is now a greater cause for concern than in the past.  There has been a deterioration, due largely to rapid <Col N="2957" /> urbanisation, together with a significant increase in the use of solid fuel within the domestic sector.  There are also localised pockets of severe air pollution caused by industry which is unsuitably located.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise my concern for existing air quality and my determination that it be improved.  However, there is no easy solution.  Comprehensive policies will have to be devised and action taken aimed at tackling the problem on a number of fronts.  In particular, such policies will have to recognise the central role which the greater use of natural gas can play by replacing oil and solid fuels for all purposes, commercial, industrial and domestic.  Work will be carried out by my Department, in consultation with the Department of Energy, in relation to the options available with a view to devising appropriate solutions as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>On the legislative side, I am aware that the existing controls in regard to air pollution generally are in need of amendment to take account of present conditions and EC requirements.  Work on preparing the necessary legislation is in hands in my Department and I hope that this will be completed next year.</P>
    <P>The subject of local government reorganisation is one which has received much attention over the past year.  It has also been the subject of much comment and speculation in the media.  I have explained on various occasions the process which is in hand in this matter.  I will confine myself on this occasion to confirming a few points.  Reform in the local government system remains a high priority on the Government agenda.  At this stage various reform possibilities have been prepared in my Department for consideration by the Government following detailed study in the light of the submissions which were made by various interests, notably the representative local government organisations.  The stage has now been reached at which I would expect that definitive Government decisions can be taken in the near future so that the process of reform can be set in train.  The basic aims are to strengthen the local government system, to make it more effective in promoting the welfare <Col N="2958" /> of local communities and as efficient as possible in the delivery of the services for which it has responsibility.</P>
    <P>No one would deny that local government reforms, if they are to be effective, must be accompanied by corresponding reforms on the financial side.  The farm tax announced in the national plan is an important step on the road to the greater financial independence of local authorities. My Department are at present working on the legislation that will be necessary to implement the farm tax.  I hope to bring this legislation before the House in the next session so that the tax can be introduced in 1986 as proposed in the plan.  I am open to the possibility of further changes which would be effective in strengthening local authority financing and in redressing the imbalance between central and local funding of current services, and this subject will continue to have attention in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>While on this subject I want to refer to the statement recently attributed to Deputy Molloy speaking on behalf of Fianna Fáil who, we are told, are going to find it possible to repeal the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, and to introduce &ldquo;new radical legislation&rdquo; which apparently will greatly reduce the need for local authority charges.  It is interesting to compare this newly contrived promise with the following extract from <i>The Way Forward</i> published just two years ago: I quote from page 96, paragraph 2 of that document;</P>
    <P>In view of the increasing investment in sanitary services, it will be necessary to consider imposing realistic charges both on individual users of sanitary services and developers so as to recoup part of the cost.  This matter will be examined in the context of legislation to empower local authorities to charge for services generally.</P>
    <P>On this whole question Fianna Fáil are trying to have it both ways.  I think the people are entitled to know where they really stand.  If charges are to be abolished where do Fianna Fáil propose that the £50 million now accruing to local authorities from them will come from? <Col N="2959" /> Would they increase the rates of PAYE or VAT?  Alternatively, do they propose cutbacks in employment, services or road maintenance?  How would Deputy Molloy square this with his incessant demands for more expenditure on county roads especially in Galway?</P>
    <P>The increased concern at Government and at local authority level to continue the improvement of the fire service is reflected in the vastly increased resources now being devoted to it.  In terms of manpower, 43 new local authority posts have been sanctioned since 1982 by my Department for fire prevention work and Dublin Corporation now have a staff of 19 officers engaged full-time on fire prevention duties.  Increased staffing levels generally have enabled the number of fire safety inspections carried out on premises to be increased greatly.  Provisional figures available for 1983 show that 14,000 fire safety inspections were carried out compared to 7,800 in 1980, reflecting the new emphasis on fire prevention.</P>
    <P>Spending by local authorities on the fire service has grown rapidly in recent years and is now in the region of £40 million.  There has been notable progress in the construction of new fire stations and the purchase of fire-fighting equipment as a result of the increased capital made available by the Government.  The provision of £7.5 million for capital spending on fire services this year is three times the 1981 level.  Eighty new fire appliances and other modern equipment have been purchased and over 30 stations have been built or reconstructed since 1978.  Fifteen new projects are at present in course of construction at Bray, Blanchardstown, Bantry, Carrick-on-Suir, Cappoquin, Clonmel, Dunmore East, Ennistymon, Leixlip, Limerick city, Midleton, Tinahely, Tullow, Westport and the O'Brien Institute at Marino.  In addition this year loan finance was made available for the purchase of 21 new fire appliances and other emergency equipment. The year also saw the completion of new and improved fire brigade facilities at five locations, including new stations at Athlone and Phibsboro.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2960" /> We can look forward to a continuance of this remarkable progress in the years ahead.  Next year alone the Government are making available £10.24 million for fire service capital purposes and in the period of the national plan it is projected that capital expenditure on the fire service will total £33.5 million.  These will enable a further 50 fire stations to be constructed together with the purchase of the necessary new equipment.</P>
    <P>The Fire Services Council were set up last year with a wide range of functions, particularly in the matters of training, education related to fire safety, the preparation of standards, guidelines and codes of practice.  In the short time since the council were established they have made remarkable progress particularly in the area of training.  The council have a programme of 15 central training courses this year and a further 20 are planned for 1985.  In order to avail of the most up-to-date expertise and facilities, many of these courses are being run in the UK and in Denmark.  These courses are in addition to the on-going training being carried out locally by individual fire authorities.  I have asked the council to review overall training needs and facilities and in particular to examine the question of establishing a national fire service training centre.  An international consultant has been engaged and has reported to the council on this question and I am looking forward to the council's recommendations.</P>
    <P>I should mention here that Dublin Corporation are providing a very extensive training facility at the O'Brien Institute in Marino.  My Department are making necessary capital funds available for the reconstruction and other works and I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the corporation for undertaking this major investment.  The training centre is already in use and I am sure will lead to a significant improvement in the level of skills and effectiveness of the staff of our largest fire authority.  A number of third level courses in fire engineering have already been held and others are being organised.  The Fire Services Council are examining the means <Col N="2961" /> of providing a full programme for fire safety engineering courses at third level. Education and training are interlinked and both will be tackled in an integrated manner so that the best results can be achieved.</P>
    <P>My Department are now finalising extensive guidelines and a draft model plan for issue to local authorities to assist them in planning to cope with large scale emergencies, such as major fires or explosions.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that I intend to bring before the House in the coming session a new Housing Bill.  This will be a major item of legislation which will validate many housing schemes introduced in recent years and also set up new arrangements for the provision, letting and management of local authority housing, in accordance with the commitment given in paragraph 5.88 of the national plan.  A major purpose of the new legislation will be to provide statutory recognition of the housing needs of particular categories of persons including the homeless, the aged, the disabled, travellers and single parent families.</P>
    <P>This time last year, in contributing to the Adjournment Debate, I commented upon the encouraging performance in 1983 of the local authority house building programme.  Building activity under this programme in the current year has expanded further with the result that completions will be significantly higher than in 1983, probably in the region of 7,000 houses.  This increased level of activity has also had considerable impact on the employment generated by the programme, with the latest available figures showing that average monthly employment this year has exceeded 6,800, which compares very favourably with the monthly average of 6,400 last year.</P>
    <P>The Government's objective for the local authority housing programme, as set out in the national plan, is to provide accommodation for 9,000 households annually.  This will be achieved by building a minimum of 6,000 houses and by seeking to ensure that a further 3,000 houses from existing local authority stock <Col N="2962" /> are available for reletting each year.  The net effect is that about 27,000 households who are in need of housing will be accommodated by local authorities over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>In 1984 it is estimated that the rental income on over 100,000 local authority dewllings will be some £30 million less than the costs of maintaining and managing the housing stock and will make no contribution at all towards the cost of providing the houses.  The average Exchequer subsidy towards the cost of providing each new local authority house is now about £85 a week whereas the average rent payable by new tenants is £11 weekly.  However, while rent reviews are essential if we are to be able to maintain an adequate building programme for those in need, I can assure the House that the principle of income-related rents will continue to apply so that the burden on those with low incomes and those with large families can be minimised.  Negotiations with the National Association of Tenants Organisations on the terms of a new rents scheme are at present in progress.  I am hopeful that the discussions will lead to a scheme that will strike the right balance between the need to increase the rental income of local authorities and the ability of the tenants to pay.</P>
    <P>Under another new scheme announced in the national plan, capital allocations, subsidisable at rates of up to 80 per cent, will be made available to local authorities to assist them in funding major works of a structural nature to rented dwellings in certain housing schemes which were built in the late sixties and early seventies under low cost housing arrangements. These disastrous arrangements left us a legacy of poor housing, discontented tenants and, now, much extra expense on remedial works.  Certain remedial works to older houses will also come within the terms of the new scheme.  Capital for the scheme will be subject to some limitations and depending on the number of applications received, it may be necessary to deal with proposals on a priority basis related to need.  The arrangements I have outlined will extend to any tenant <Col N="2963" /> purchase houses in such schemes but the subsidy for these houses will meet 40 per cent of the loan charges and tenant purchasers will be required to meet half the costs of the work to their houses by way of a lump sum or an increased or extended annuity payment.  I have been very much aware from my work in my constituency of the acute need for special measures to upgrade some of the schemes in question.  I am especially pleased that the Government saw fit to accept the proposals that I put forward for this purpose.</P>
    <P>On the private housing side I am glad to report that the level of demand for the £1,000 grant and the mortgage subsidy continues to be quite buoyant.  I have recently increased the 1984 provision for new house grants to £11.5 million by transferring half a million pounds within the Vote to facilitate the payment of grants falling due and to avoid delays to applicants.  Under the mortgage subsidy's scheme, 30,000 claims costing £20 million are being processed this year.</P>
    <P>The Housing Finance Agency have experienced an unprecedented demand for loans in 1984 and as a result I have recently authorised increases in their capital allocation for 1984 totalling £9 million, bringing the total provision to £72 million.  The local authority loan scheme also continues to play an important role in providing mortgage finance for those on lower incomes who benefit from the fixed interest rate.  The continued importance of this scheme is reflected in the provision of £88 million in the 1985 Public Capital Programme. The impact of the increases in the loan and income limits which became effective in February last is now being seen in a much increased level of approvals.  In the six months to 30 September 1984 approvals amounted to more than £38 million compared with £27 million in the preceding six months.</P>
    <P>The availability of mortgage finance is a vital factor affecting both the housing programme and the building industry generally.  I am pleased to say that in <Col N="2964" /> 1984 the amount made available for the purchase and construction of private housing through the commercial lending agencies such as the building societies, banks and insurance companies and from public sources, through the local authority and Housing Finance Agency loan schemes, has been satisfactory.  It is likely that the total of £563 million advanced by the main lending agencies in 1983 will be exceeded in the present year.  The building societies' share of these record advances in 1984 will be of the order of £400 million.</P>
    <P>The recent increases in interest rates announced by the associated banks led to speculation about a possible increase in building society mortgage rates.  I met with representatives of the Irish Building Societies Association on 4 December and expressed to them my concern about the additional burden which such an increase would impose on existing borrowers and about the implications for the housing programme, the building industry generally and potential house purchasers.  I welcome the announcement this week by the association that the major building societies have decided not to increase interest rates for the present but to keep the situation under review.  This will be good news indeed for house purchasers as well as for the other interests I have mentioned.  It not only postpones an increase but gives some grounds for hope that, depending on interest rate trends and the inflow of funds to societies in the immediate future, it may be possible to avoid any increase in mortgage rates altogether.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the national plan which received an almost universal welcome was the decision to substantially increase State investment in road construction in the period 1985 to 1987.  The allocation for road improvements in 1984 is £101.65 million.  This will increase to £125 million in 1985, £140 million in 1986 and £155 million in 1987 &mdash; a total expenditure programme of £420 million under the plan.</P>
    <P>The last few weeks have also seen the <Col N="2965" /> publication of the study on the Newry-Dundalk Road, which was jointly commissioned by the Irish and United Kingdom Governments.  The study, which was jointly undertaken by An Foras Forbartha and the UK Transport and Roads Research Laboratory, recommended the construction of a new road between Balbriggan, County Louth, and Killeen Bridge, County Armagh, through Glendooey and linking up with the proposed western by-pass of Dundalk.  On 28 November I discussed the report with Mr. Chris Patten, MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary responsible for the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment, and we accepted the consultant's technical and environmental appraisal of the road link.  We also decided that further information on financial and technical issues, including cost sharing, would be considered before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>For many years the Governments have been asked to indicate medium term expenditure provisions in order to facilitate planning for the future.  I think we have been able to do this with our Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>It is now just a year since I became Minister for the Environment.  My Department carry responsibility for some very large public spending programmes and for a very broad range of functions which in one way or another affect the lives of all citizens.  It is difficult to make spectacular progress at once across such a broad spectrum of Government but I am satisfied that the past year has been one in which my Department have got down to tackling some of the fundamental problems involved.  On the whole, it has been a period of solid achievement. In some areas the fruits of our endeavours are already manifest &mdash; for example, in some of the provisions of the national plan.  In other areas solid groundwork has been laid for much needed reforms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech the Tánaiste said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately we have seen in recent weeks plenty of apparent concessions <Col N="2966" /> or benefits floated off by Fianna Fáil without any analysis of the consequences or costs in other areas.</P>
    <P>This sentiment was repeated also by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism during his blustery speech. In addition, the journalists who back up this Government are floating that idea, the idea of lack of care in projections emanating from Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>In the years 1973 to 1977, as Opposition spokesman, I was conscious of the importance of not making promises, of not indulging in the forecasting of activities which could not be delivered on because such a procedure debases the whole political scene, the whole business of politics.  Consequently, I find it difficult to have to hark back to the time when people who are now members of the Government, and in particular the Taoiseach, were present on every rent-a-crowd occasion when Fianna Fáil were in office, whether it was on housing, on preserving Georgian Dublin, running around with students or helping trade unions to picket.  Indeed, Deputy Michael O'Leary, then a Member of the Labour Party now of the Fine Gael Party, was seen parading up and down outside a Fianna Fáil Minister's office on an ordinary picket.  It comes ill from those people, many of whose statements are farcical, to state that this is an exercise that Fianna Fáil indulges in and in which Fine Gael, the sea green incorruptibles, never indulged.  We had all kinds of promises from Fine Gael and Labour.  It is two years tomorrow since the joint programme was supposed to come on the scene.  In it a fundamental reform of the social welfare taxation system with redistributive effects was to be undertaken. The most recent issue of <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> giving the receipts and issues on 7 December 1984, indicates that the present Minister for Finance has taken £269 million more than he had taken at this time last year.  This does not give a picture of the whole year.  It just says that on 7 December of this year, which is well into the year, that was the case.  On the income levy the Minister took £33 million <Col N="2967" /> extra, on VAT he took £173 million extra, on taxation on motor vehicles, even though the motor trade is at an all time low, he extracted from the unfortunate motorists £14 million more than he was able to get in 1983.  With all the farcical claims about financial rectitude we should take note of the fact that the issues of December 7 1984 when compared with the receipts was £1 billion, £528 million more.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste when speaking said that there was no prejudice in the present Government against the public sector. He said: &ldquo;The Government is not anti-public sector, in ideological terms or otherwise&rdquo;.  I do not agree with that statement and the Tánaiste in his heart knows that it is not true.  The Labour Party have no antipathy to the public sector, but Fine Gael definitely have and are showing it, and it is the policy of Fine Gael that is being made effective.  The spokesmanship for which I am responsible deals to a great extent with the public sector and it is through a minute and close examination of what is being done and not done and of what is being said and not said that I have come to the conclusion that the Ministers who are responsible for the various semi-State bodies are being manipulated and pulled by the Grand Sultan of the new Right.  We have a representative of the new Right, the Grand Sultan sitting before us this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer to use the word &ldquo;Sultan&rdquo; because the broad vowel has a certain solidity.  The Labour Party document commits them to a fair and redistributive tax system.  Of course they are committed, but they have not the say of a dog in the Government.  I have just told what is actually happening with regard to income tax, VAT and the income levy. The extra money is coming from the areas which Labour claims to represent and is supposed to stand up for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Joint Fine Gael/Labour Programme for Government, December <Col N="2968" /> 1982, we have practically the same commitment:</P>
    <P>Following completion of the work of the Commission on Taxation, a fundamental reform of the taxation and social welfare system with re-distributive effects will be undertaken with a view to its implementation within the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <P>For God's sake, who said there is any life in the Government?  Have we seen any life in the Government?  It is two years tomorrow since they took over, and all these grand promises are on the record and sweet damn all has been done about any of them.  That same document also says:</P>
    <P>Proportion of tax derived from P.A.Y.E. on Wages and Salaries to be reduced.</P>
    <P>Do I have to comment?  God save the mark.  The Minister for Finance is driving more and more into PAYE, into VAT and into the income levy to get money from the people who are supposed to benefit from this grand programme.</P>
    <P>It is a pity we have such a short time because the second anniversary of the coming to power of this Government would be a suitable occasion to go through this programme with a fine comb to let the country see exactly what was promised and what was not delivered on. The half hour is not sufficient to do that, but it should be done.  It should be brought to the attention of the people who were fooled by both Fine Gael and Labour.  I find it interesting and reminiscent of biblical times to read in the document that</P>
    <P>A Fine Gael Government whose record has shown that they tell the truth, regardless of unpopularity; are prepared to act, regardless of whether this may threaten their Party interest; and are consistent in their approach.</P>
    <P>The need is to ensure that the standards of political life are not only raised, but seen to be raised to a level compatible with our people's expectations concerning their political leaders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2969" /> Is there not a story about the man who went up in the synagogue and said &ldquo;Thanks be to God that I am not like the rest of men, sinners&rdquo; and is there not a story comprising part of that same story about the poor man, a publican, who stayed down at the back and asked pardon for his sins and he was justified and the pharisee was not?  Anybody that would read those two paragraphs would have to think of the pharisee and the publican, the pharisee who promised everything and did nothing and the poor old publican who had made his mistakes. The tax gatherer, of course, made his mistakes.  He inflicted himself upon the people as others are doing, but he repented.  That is out of the Fine Gael document and the Fine Gael Party should take note of that and learn from it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton came in here with a mighty bluster and rodomontade.  He was like the west wind blowing into this House hoping, I suppose, that with a stentorian voice and loud words rolling out of him he would conceal the weakness of his case.  He talked abut employment. I have just checked the figures of the unemployed when this Government took office two years ago and I checked the most recent figure.  The figure is 216,000. There was talk about the construction industry.  Of those, 43,381 were construction workers with skills of various kinds waiting to be put to work that is needed for the development of the country.  Neither Deputy Bruton nor his colleagues succeeded in doing anything about that.</P>
    <P>He boasted about an increase in productivity. It is true.  There has been a remarkable increase in productivity and in exports mainly in the electronics industries established by Fianna Fáil and in the chemical industry as well.  As I said when we were debating <i>Building on Reality,</i> I agree with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that that is not enough. It is the oldest saying at least since the time of Goldsmith, that where wealth accumulates and men decay you are not solving any economic problem.</P>
    <P>I have responsibility as a spokesman in the area of many semi-State bodies. <Col N="2970" /> Where is the Minister for Communications? They seek him here, they seek him there, but he cannot be seen.  He is not here in the mornings.  I do not know where he is.  He is there to do the bidding of the Grand Sultan of the New Right when it comes to saying Aer Lingus will get no more money, or Aer Rianta will get no more money, and Irish Shipping must be liquidated.</P>
    <P>I will not take up the time of the House too long on that liquidation.  It was a scandalous, cowardly act on the part of the Government.  They should have addressed themselves to the maintenance of a strategic Irish fleet in the tradition of Irish Shipping.  Having a liquidator is not a policy.  He is useful to hide behind when questions are asked in the House: &ldquo;I am gagged by the liquidator.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The country is being gagged by a whole concatenation of liquidators from Donegal to Cork, but that is not the way to face the economic problems we have at the moment.  The Government should address themselves to the provision of a strategic fleet.  It is not sound economics, when Moneypoint starts to generate electricity from coal below in County Clare, to pay foreign ships to bring the coal in there.  It is not sound educationally and I will have an opportunity later tonight to raise the matter of the people who, with ambition in their hearts, were training to serve on Irish ships in the future.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Government, but I am afraid I am appealing to deaf ears, to address the problem of a strategic fleet and to think of major business which will be available, such as the Moneypoint business, in the very near future.  We will be paying others for stoking our electricity generators, and this is nothing short of a scandal.  I fully advocated sloughing off the dreadful mistakes made in the Far East and I am talking about a different scene altogether when I am talking about a strategic Irish fleet.</P>
    <P>I want to put this on record.  For the 15 to 16 years Irish Shipping were making a profit, this House voted and paid £481,580,000 to CIE, another semi-State body.  That is not updated to take account of inflation which would drive it up much <Col N="2971" /> further.  The liquidator is picked up in the communal arms of the Government and shaken at me every time I ask a question about Irish Shipping.  I hope the Government are addressing themselves to the problem of the Irish Continental Line to maintain it as a profitable business, which it is, and one that we should have.</P>

      <P>I will come to the B &amp; I later.  The treatment given to Irish Shipping is worth noting.  The quick liquidation of that company will rebound to the discredit of this Government.  Where is the Minister for Communications?  Will somebody find him for me?  They seek him here, they seek him there, like the Scarlet Pimpernel.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transport Authority Bill was promised to us before Christmas.  I had sent the heads of the Bill to the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General's office before 14 December 1982.  In that Bill we were to have a Dublin transport plan, a traffic transport plan.  We were to have a budget and an education bureau similar to the one in the Department of Health to deal with traffic planning and policy, to deal with traffic management, to improve the provision of school transport, to deal with energy conservation.  The Minister for Energy would link into that.  They were to encourage the use of public transport to prevent traffic snarls and pollution. They were to study work patterns so that something could be done to relieve traffic congestion.  Where is the Minister for Communications?  Where is the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE are to be divided up into three sections, I gather, with an umbrella company. This was announced with a flourish of oboes or trumpets.  Again we have no word about the legislation.  If the Dublin Transport Authority were established by statute the Dublin city services could be linked into it.  That would be a logical thing to do.  It was envisaged in the heads <Col N="2972" /> of the Bill I sent to the Attorney General's office that CIE would provide a service for the Dublin Transport Authority which would be in total control of it.</P>
    <P>Private motorbus owners paraded around the city a week ago blocking traffic and protesting in an orderly and legal manner.  They have not been able to get near the Minister for Communications. They too are asking where is the Minister for Communications.  They do not know where they may fit in or may not fit into the new legislation with regard to CIE.</P>
    <P>I am glad the DART is such a success. The Minister for Communications said in this House that, had he been Minister at the time, he would not have embarked on it.  It is a tribute to Deputy Faulkner who had the idea and pushed it through against considerable opposition within and without his own parliamentary party. It is a great success.  The Minister for Communications had no bother at all in celebrating its inauguration.  Nor had the Taoiseach, who drove the train.  When he was being interviewed afterwards and some reporter whose job it was to ask an awkward question said: &ldquo;What about the money that is needed for roads in the west of Ireland?&rdquo; Immediately the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;Of course it was the Fianna Fáil Government who introduced the whole thing.&rdquo; Sin was all right if you could get publicity out of it.  Do not commit it, but if you can get publicity that is all right.  I do not think that is a worthy stance for the Taoiseach of the country.</P>
    <P>What is the position with regard to B &amp; I?  I came into this House 24 hours before we were rushed in to hear of the killing off of Irish Shipping.  I came in here and tried to get some information from the Taoiseach and I was ruled out of order.  Twenty-four hours later this thing happened.  I am asking, through you, a Cheann Comhairle, the Minister for Communications what is his policy on the B &amp; I.  There are dark rumours that he is not going to support it, that he is not going to back it.  I want to know, the B &amp; I want to know and the public and the taxpayers want to know what exactly <Col N="2973" /> his policy is in regard to the B &amp; I company. Could we have information about the present position?</P>
    <P>I was also promised before Christmas a Bill to liberalise road transport.  The recess begins tomorrow.  We have no Bill. Where is the Minister for Communications? What has happened to him?  Has he run to earth?  There are young men, entrepreneurs, risk takers with a few bob who want to buy a truck.  They will pay £6,000, £7,000 or £8,000 for a plate.  If the Bill was introduced tomorrow and put through this House that money would be money thrown away.  They do not know what to do.  This is crying out for legislative action so that there can be law enforcement in that area where there are particular problems as of now.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus.  Again the pashas and beys and the Grand Sultan himself of the New Right have pushed the Minister for Communications out front to say: &ldquo;No support for Aer Lingus from the Government. Fly away at the planes lads, do not come to us for comfort&rdquo;.  Aer Lingus, in a very difficult time, are showing a profit.  I want to put it on the record that my own particular view of semi-State bodies is that we should demand the highest standard of commercial action from them.  I make no bones about that when you are planning ahead in an area where you are going to spend between £300 million and £500 million and you do not know whether you will even get a Government guarantee for borrowing, because the language would do credit to the Oracle at Delphi.  I mean the Oracle in the days when the Oracle was declining because the Oracle gave straight out opinions when it was at its best.  But it said: &ldquo;<i>Ibis redibis nun quam peribis in armis</i>&rdquo; which could mean: &ldquo;You will go, you will return, you will never perish in arms&rdquo; or &ldquo;You will go, you will never return, you will perish in arms&rdquo;.  I would invite anybody who has time tonight to read what the Minister said about Aer Lingus.  You would not know whether he was going to refuse equity or give equity, whether he was going to refuse or give guarantees for borrowing.  He is using an oracular style <Col N="2974" /> to indicate that he is carrying, like a pigeon, the message from the New Right.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see Aer Lingus making a profit.  It is a miniscule profit compared with what they will need to replace their Boeings but the point is they are making a profit and this is not the time to try to knock them down.</P>
    <P>On page 18 of this famous document it says:</P>
    <P>Finally the need to re-establish the working relationship with the British Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I would put in brackets: &ldquo;(which has been almost fatally damaged by the present Government)&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;with a view to putting to that Government, with some prospect of success, a radical approach to breaking the tragic deadlock in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is a subject on which I do not want to be emotional or unjust but what happened in Chequers and afterwards in the Irish Embassy in London had a chain reaction in my constituency, one which was difficult to deal with and difficult to control.  I remember driving through that same constituency and the particular area where I have annual general meetings, an enclave in the mountainy part to the west where you have the Fermanagh border with Blacklion on one side and Belcoo on the other.  I remembered the time when Sunningdale was coming apart and when I think the BBC was encouraging those who wanted to bring down the joint authority of that time.  Wilson made his &ldquo;spongers&rdquo; speech insulting the people of my province and did sweet damn all. I got very downhearted at that particular time and not until the Chequers event did I feel so downhearted since, even at the worst time of the killing and the murder because what happened there was that our Taoiseach &mdash; and he is our Taoiseach, the constitutional head of our Government &mdash; was walked all over on by the British Prime Minister and I happen to be sensitive to believe that when our Taoiseach is walked on then I, <Col N="2975" /> as a citizen, am being walked on and so are my fellow citizens.</P>

Members know that a group of musicians known as Band Aid have got together to produce a record the profits of which are going to be made available to relieve famine in Ethiopia. They have approached the Government with a view to making sure that this is the case as far as possible.  I am glad to say that I have arranged with the Minister for Foreign Affairs that when we have certified figures for the sales of the record in this country a sum equivalent to the amount of VAT that will be collected will be paid from our bilateral aid fund to the charity to which the proceeds of the record are donated.</P>

      <P>The main economic policy event of this session was the presentation of the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i><Col N="2976" /> which was published a week before the resumption of the House and has been debated twice in this House, once in the context of a debate for which the Government made time available and which we were very anxious to have.  It was debated once after that in a different kind of way in the course of a debate on a Private Members' Motion put down by Fianna Fáil.  The House agreed, on the occasion of the first debate, that that national plan represents, in our circumstances, a fair and balanced approach to the problems with which we shall have to deal over the next three years.</P>
      <P>Of course Fianna Fáil having failed to make their point in the course of that debate, as they were bound to do &mdash; since really they did not have a point to make &mdash; then, in a fit of pique, put down a Private Members' Motion inviting the House to rescind its original vote approving the national plan, when they suffered the same fate on that second occasion. Thanks to the Opposition the national plan has been approved not once but twice within a short period of time in this House.</P>
      <P>The measures in that plan are designed to strike a fair balance between a series of objectives, all of them shared by Members of this House, and shared in a very general way by the whole community.  It is not difficult to outline here the objectives we all share.  I think I could say without any fear of contradiction from the other side of the House that all of us in this House want to reduce unemployment, we want to increase the total number of people gainfully at work in jobs that will last.  We all, perhaps some of us in slightly different ways, share a concern to protect the disadvantaged in our society.  We want to protect them economically, to protect them socially and, for many, we want to protect them medically.  The people I have in mind are those who are poor, the ill, the old or the handicapped.  Every Member of this House would wish to play his or her part in protecting those people from the difficulties they encounter every day in the course of their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2977" /> We could also agree all around this House on the need to provide services for our growing population.  Members of the House are well aware that we have the youngest population in Europe, that we have the fastest growing population in what is loosely called the western world. They need educational services, health services, training services, placement services, a whole range of services that we would all wish, as legislators and indeed as parents ourselves, to make available to them at a level that we would wish to see increase year by year in order to render those services available more efficiently.  But we would like to give to the succeeding generation a greater range of services and benefits than we have had ourselves.  There are many of us in this House &mdash; I acknowledge it very readily &mdash; who have been very fortunate, who have been well served by those who went before us.</P>
    <P>There is no disagreement in this House on the need to provide for a social infrastructure that will meet the requirements of that young and growing population, that will meet the requirements of a population having to cope with the difficulties on the economic side that we meet and have been meeting increasingly since 1979.  Neither would there be any disagreement on the need to provide an adequate level of economic infrastructure so that we could facilitate and support economic activity here with a view to improving the general wellbeing and, above all, increasing the total level of employment.</P>
    <P>I know there would be universal agreement in this House on the desirability of reducing the burden of taxation whether we speak of personal taxation or of indirect taxation.  So far there would be unanimous agreement in principle all around this House that those are the objectives to which we would attach most importance.  I am speaking in the context of economic and social policy.  There are, of course, a great many other things on which we would get agreement right around this House, but I shall concentrate <Col N="2978" /> on those I have mentioned as constituting the hard core of our objectives in terms of economic and social policy.</P>
    <P>What resources have we got that we can apply to achieving those objectives? What means have we at our disposal for bringing about the results we want to achieve?  More specifically, what resources are at the State's command to be deployed in fulfilling the State's role in relation to those objectives?  In summary, we can say that there are two kinds of resources.  The first kind are those that we ourselves decide to make available for all of these purposes through our tax contributions, the amount which we, as taxpayers, as wage earners, as consumers, are prepared to part with in order to finance all of those desirable services, the provision of means to implement those objectives on which we all agree.  That is one kind of resource available to us. Another kind of resource comes from the amount of borrowing, domestic and foreign, that we can carry out with confidence in our ability to service and repay the relevant debts.  As far as taxation is concerned the Government take the view &mdash; and that has been clearly set out in the national plan &mdash; that we should not increase the overall burden of taxation; there is general agreement on that view. I do not think it would take me long to detail all of the reasons Members of this House would agree with that proposition. But we have taken that view and it is part of our national plan, as one of its basic points, that we should not increase the overall burden of taxation.</P>
    <P>We might then look at the other kind of resource I have just mentioned, which is borrowing.  Debt servicing now absorbs a third of our tax revenue.  Therefore we cannot simply add up those two sets of resources in order to calculate how much there is at our disposal to bring about the desired results.  As I have said, debt servicing absorbs a third of our total tax revenues, which means that those of us who are contributing through the tax system start off behind in the game because not all our contributions will be available to do the things we want to do this year or next year; no, a <Col N="2979" /> third of it has to go in servicing existing debts.  That highlights one essential feature of borrowing which is not often given the attention it deserves but which is one to which we need to pay a great deal more attention in the future because it will present us with a problem, that is, that borrowing is deferred taxation. It limits our ability to use current resources to resolve our present problems. If we look at it in that way we could find ready agreement in this House that we do not want to see the level of preemption of our tax revenue resources increase beyond its present level.</P>
    <P>If we take the view that there should be no limits to our borrowing what we are saying quite simply is that we should look with equanimity at the cost of our debt servicing increasing from its present level of one third, but if we do not pay attention to this our debt servicing burden will be an increasing problem. That is one of the reasons for our policy in these matters, and it has been amply demonstrated not only here but in many other countries.  It is a matter we must remember and take to heart.  Otherwise we will find ourselves with a gradually diminishing capacity to deal with the problems facing us.</P>
    <P>When we look at this complex of problems &mdash; expenditure, investment, taxation and borrowing &mdash; it becomes very clear that we need to restore order to our public finance in order to restore our ability to use our resources usefully and efficiently.  That is a basic fundamental and the only valid reason for wanting to restore a degree of order to our public finances.  It has nothing to do with abstract bookkeeping so that we will see that the books are tidy at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have put across the message that the restoration of order to the public finances is carried out for bookkeeping reasons, as it is called.  I would have to say that the Opposition are acting irresponsibly because they are perpetuating a myth that there is no need to have order in the public finances, that there is <Col N="2980" /> no need to get expenditure and borrowing under control.  If we are to take them at their word they are saying it does not matter.  The answer is that next year or in five years we will find fewer and fewer of the resources we provide ourselves will be available to solve the problems of that year and more and more will be taken up with the results of what we do this year to solve this year's problems.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue to put that kind of mortgage on our future resources, because as far back as 1979 we saw the effects of that kind of policy on the ability any Government have to deal constructtively and immediately with the problems that face us.  The approach taken by the Opposition can only induce people, as it has induced the Opposition, to create a situation which would be even worse than the state at which we started.</P>
    <P>It is platitudinous to say that we will never be able to do all the things we should like to do, but from the way the Opposition have been acting in the debate on our economic policy during the last two years it seems we must repeat it fairly often in the House.  We will never be able to do all we should like to do and we must therefore choose and fix priorities.  That is what government is about; that is what the application and the exercise of power are about.  I was not particularly surprised, but a bit saddened, to hear Deputy Lenihan earlier today engaging in what Deputy Wilson calls rodomontade on this subject without referring to what the use of power should be for and what the process of government is about.</P>
    <P>The making of choices and the fixing of priorities are what our national plan is about.  I do not think it would be any harm to summarise just how this fits in with our concern and what kind of choices have to be made.  We have recognised in the plan that measures aimed at achieving substantial improvements in output and employment must be set in the medium term.  We must look further than the end of the present year because we need a longer time scale, first to fix our policy guidelines and then to give them time to work and to examine their effects and <Col N="2981" /> effectiveness in achieving their objectives.</P>
    <P>In the plan, the Government have acknowledged that unemployment is the most serious problem facing us, particularly among the young, the old and the long term unemployed.  As a central objective of the plan, we deliberately set out to increase employment and to halt and reverse the upward trend in unemployment. The policy measures in the plan are clearly designed to achieve that during the period.</P>
    <P>The plan acknowledges the reality of the employment position and that increases in the number of traditional jobs in industry and services will not be sufficient to meet the growth in our labour force in the next few years.  That is why we provided for special employment schemes for the long term unemployed. When those schemes reach their full annual potential they will cater each year for 12,500 applicants.  The plan states that economic recovery and therefore recovery in sustainable employment are being severely constrained by the state of the public finances.  The benefit of the economic growth is being dissipated by national debt servicing charges which are absorbing an increasing percentage of national output and taxation.  The measures in the plan aim to deal with that during the period.</P>
    <P>The plan aims to continue the process which we started in the middle of 1981 of reducing public borrowing in order to restore balance to public finances and to stabilise debt interest as a share of national output.  The Government realise that in spite of the urgent need to reduce Exchequer borrowing it would be unrealistic to expect that the gap could be closed by reliance on increased taxation.  We have provided that during the period of the plan there will be no increase in the overall level of taxation.  Though some individual taxes will have to be increased and perhaps some new tax measures will have to be introduced, though the scope is extremely limited, any changes of that nature would be counterbalanced by relief of taxation elsewhere, because the Government regard it as being important <Col N="2982" /> that the overall burden of taxation should remain at its present level.</P>
    <P>It would have been very nice to have produced a plan foreshadowing an overall reduction in the burden of taxation, and though Deputies opposite may not believe it I doubt if there are many in the House who would be happier than I to be looking forward to a reduction in the overall burden of taxation.  But when we balance the requirements that would create with the others I mentioned earlier it would have been downright irresponsible to make a proposal of that kind or to embark on that path.</P>
    <P>This stabilisation of the overall tax burden in itself is a major advance in view of the rapid rise in the burden of taxation in recent years and the difficult budgetary situation facing the Government. One of the key factors in increasing the level of sustainable employment would be the improvement of our competitive position.  The plan emphasises competitiveness as a key element to improving the job prospects of our young people and those who are now employed. In that connection it is clear that labour costs are a most significant element of industrial costs.  It we are to improve job prospects there is no way out of it but to recognise that disproportionate increases in labour costs must be avoided.  By that I mean disproportionate increases in costs here compared to those in our competitor countries.</P>
    <P>The relation of the overall pay objectives we have set out in our plan will bring about an improvement in our unit wage costs.  That, together with the expected increase in the level of productivity, will put us first of all in an improved position to compete with our trading partners and, more importantly, in a position to begin to realise further expansion in employment here.  No matter which way one approaches that problem one will find that one comes up with the same answer at the end of the day.  The only way we are going to provide extra employment is to be in a position to gain a bigger share of the markets whether for goods or services, whether at home or <Col N="2983" /> abroad.  The only way we are going to do that is to make a better product or provide a better service cheaper than the competition.  All the elements of our policy must point in that direction.  It is an old fashioned, very traditional but nevertheless true and relevant approach to expanding employment possibilities.</P>
    <P>I have just given a brief review of the main elements in our plan.  We went about making that plan in a particular way.  At the beginning we looked at what the likely course of the economy was going to be over the period of the plan. We estimated what amount of resources were likely to be available and we tailored the policies to suit those resources.  I cannot think of a more logical or sane way of going about building a plan.  There are other ways a plan can be drawn up. They were tried before and did not work. What has been the stance of the Opposition on the plan?  They voted against it twice and I must assume that they voted against the idea of fixing priorities, voted against the idea of making choices and voted against the idea of making balanced policies.  Not only did they vote against it twice but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They do not like taking the consequences of making choices.  It might be culpable ignorance on the part of others.  The Opposition have shown that they are paralysed by the requirement of making choices.  Instead of choosing policy options over the last two years they have chosen soft options.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder how that £577 million would be financed.  Would it be financed by cuts in the allocations we have already made in the plan, allocations the Deputies opposite have criticised as being insufficient?  Would they cut them in order to bring about these other changes they now claim should be made? Where is their commitment to the objectives in relation to current and capital expenditure?  Would they finance it by extra taxation?  They say they are in favour of reducing taxation, but to find £577 million they would have to increase the total tax take by 11 per cent, or increase excise duties by 46 per cent, or increase the income tax take by 30 per cent or increase value added tax take by 41 per cent.  Is that the Opposition's alternative to the plan?  Where is their commitment to reducing the tax burden? Perhaps they might get around the problem by making more rosy assumptions about the future than the ones contained in the plan which they have criticised. They tried that before.  They made rosy assumptions in a document entitled <i>The Way Forward</i> but they did not work.</P>

      <P>Before we adjourn for the Christmas recess it is worth recalling what successive Governments have done in recent years during the Christmas or summer recesses announcing unpopular measures, some of which should have been properly brought before this House and debated.  During the first recess after this Government was formed after the November 1982 general election, they chose Christmas Eve to announce the introduction of charges for school transport and so ended free school transport for many families.  Just after Christmas they announced increases in bus and rail fares.  Nothing surprising in that.  During the 1983 summer recess they introduced the mini budget and announced the postponement of the family income supplement scheme.  Last Christmas Eve they announced the postponement of the local elections and a couple of days earlier they announced a further annual increase in CIE bus fares.  The August weekend 1984 they announced the famous halving of the food subsidies just as the Taoiseach was heading off for his holidays.  This was done by an Administration which talked a great deal about open Government, letting everybody know what was happening and what their policies were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Coalition Government were following a precedent set by the Fianna Fáil Government.  During the August bank holiday week-end in 1982 the Fianna Fáil Government did a complete about turn on their economic policy and adopted the monetarist policy which this Government have followed ever since.  The Fianna Fáil <Col N="2988" /> Government announced a mini budget which involved cuts of £120 million and introduced the public service pay freeze. In that they were breaking an agreement which existed with the trade unions.</P>
    <P>What can we expect this Christmas? The increases in rail and bus fares look like becoming as much a part of Christmas as the turkey and the plum pudding.  Will there be a further postponement of the local elections for a further year?  Will hospital closures be announced over Christmas?  Already some hospitals have had to close wards. Will there be a liquidation of another State company?  Whatever it is, we can be certain the Government will not let this opportunity pass without announcing some bad news or dramatic new measures they have in mind.</P>
    <P>Whatever they do in the recess, it must be said that they did very little during this session.  Anybody who looks back will be unable to recall any solid legislation coming into the House during the last session.  We can remember things like the liquidation of Irish Shipping or the Bill which we rushed through last Tuesday due to the Central Bank strike and a few odds and ends like that, but this Government have been very short of legislation.  Last week they were searching for documents to put before the House because there was no legislation to offer.  Today there was nothing to do from 12 o'clock to 2.30 p.m.  There was no legislation before the House and no initiative from the Government.  It is not as if they did not have plenty to do.</P>
    <P>They should look at their joint programme for Government announced two years ago.  They do not have to look at basic issues like tax reform or things which would cost money.  They should look at smaller issues which would save money.  Yet the Government have done nothing about them.  For instance, the legislation to make changes in company law was according to the then Minister Deputy Cluskey, supposed to be at a very advanced stage in October 1983.  This legislation was to end the abuse of the company law system where companies were going bust leaving creditors and <Col N="2989" /> employees unpaid, and then being free to set up another company and start the cycle all over again.  This very important legislation would not cost the Government anything.  What is the explanation for not bringing in the legislation to change company law?  Do some powerful personages want the unjust company law system to remain as it is?</P>
    <P>Another recommendation in the joint programme was to take immediate action to bring an end to compensation loopholes in the planning acts.  Every local authority want this.  They know these loopholes are costing them a fortune and are forcing them to accept planning decisions they do not want to accept, but if they refuse they will have to pay compensation. This is very important legislation. What is preventing the Government from introducing it?  Neither party have explained why they cannot close these loopholes and give local authorities the power to make planning decisions without having to pay compensation to a speculator who puts up a proposal to force the planning authority either to give planning permission or to pay compensation.</P>
    <P>Another item in the joint programme was the anti-poverty plan.  If this plan was needed two years ago, it is needed ten times more today.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism said today that we have the highest number in long-term unemployment of any EC country.  What does &ldquo;long-term unemployment&rdquo; mean?  It means unemployment benefit has ended and these people are on unemployment assistance. It is estimated that almost two-thirds of our unemployed are receiving assistance and therefore on the poverty line.  But where is the Government's anti-poverty plan?  This plan sounded great when it was announced and both parties agreed to it, but neither has done anything about it.</P>
    <P>Something else promised in the joint programme but which was not introduced &mdash; the Government cannot plead they did not have the time to do something about it, because we had very little to do this <Col N="2990" /> session &mdash; was the compilation of a public register of private rented accommodation. Such a register would be very important because it would force landlords to register and those who at present do not pay tax would be caught in the tax net.  These people are screwing the last penny out of their tenants and in many cases the taxpayer is supporting the landlord through subsidies.  Nothing has been done about a public register of rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>Another item announced in the joint programme for government was changing the fee per item system in the GMS to a capitation system.  That has not been implemented although it would save the taxpayer money.  All these measures would not have cost anything, would have brought in money in some areas, saved it in others and introduced a just system into our legislation.  The Government have given no intimation or explanation as to why they are unable to bring in simple measures which would be of great benefit at no cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The disastrous effects of the Government's economic policies have left the people reeling and unable to comprehend what is happening.  They have lost faith in the Taoiseach and the Government and their lack of hope for the future has brought their morale to a very low ebb.  The Taoiseach's failure to face up to Mrs. Thatcher has lowered morale even further, and although the Government may well hang on for another year or more, they will not save their credibility.  The longer they stay, the more damage they will do to themselves and the country.  This feeling is widespread at present, and it is time that people looked carefully at the alternative. Fianna Fáil, in recent months, have been attempting to present themselves as the voice of the workers and the unemployed. They have been making overtures to the leadership of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>From some of their statements, one gets the impression that Fianna Fáil had never been in Government much less that they were in power for over 40 of the last <Col N="2991" /> 60 years and, therefore, have contributed in that proportion to the economic crisis.  Workers and trade unionists would do well to contrast what Fianna Fáil say in opposition to what they do in Government. Fianna Fáil claim that they will put the country back to work, but they always made this claim in opposition.  The numbers out of work have increased consistently, no matter what Government were in power, since 1973, and there is nothing to suggest that this will be different when there is a change of Government from Coalition to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The economic policies of Fianna Fáil and the Coalition are almost identical, as most people now realise.  For instance, Fianna Fáil are now criticising the Government on their policy on public service pay, but Fianna Fáil preached a theory of pay restraint in their document <i>The Way Forward</i>.  It was a Fianna Fáil administration which withheld the second phase of the public service pay agreement in August 1982 during the summer recess. Workers can draw little comfort from the industrial relations record of Fianna Fáil. Some of us can remember that it was a Fianna Fáil Government who left postal workers on strike for many months in 1979.  They forced nurses to go on strike in 1980 and in 1969 they sent ESB workers to jail.  The credibility gap is wide in many areas.  They now say they are against water charges because of great public opposition to them.  Yet Fianna Fáil were the first to propose charges for local services.</P>
    <P>They also now say they are against the health cuts but, just before the last General Election in 1982, they made major cuts in the health service which was one of the causes of their downfall. Fianna Fáil now proclaim themselves as the champions of civil liberties but they enacted the Forcible Entry Act which is now used to jail people fighting for the right to work when they occupy premises which close down.  Fianna Fáil also introduced and later amended the Offences Against the State Act which is today being used to prosecute people in County <Col N="2992" /> Kildare who have refused to pay their water rates.  As they are being charged, under this Act, ACRA, the residents association, are thereby being described as subversive for organising a campaign against water charges.  The contrast between what is said in opposition and done in Government has become the norm for Fianna Fáil and the Coalition. It is this kind of political double standard which has left so many of our people, especially the young, so cynical and disillusioned in regard to politics.  Many of them are alienated, which is undermining their faith in democracy and the democratic system.</P>
    <P>It would be very interesting to know what Fianna Fáil said the other day in their discussions with ICTU in regard to the Congress document, Confronting the Jobs Crisis.  How could Deputy Haughey stand by <i>The Way Forward</i> and, at the same time, support the Congress plan because the Fianna Fáil document says that the growth in the size of the public service and, consequently, in its cost must be reversed whereas the Congress document says that not enough resources are devoted to the public service?  The Fianna Fáil document says that it is intended that the annual allocation to education from 1984-87 will be the same as it was in 1983. The Congress document says that there can be no cutback in overall public expenditure measures in real terms in the area of education.  The Fianna Fáil document says that the emphasis will be on reducing the degree of State support for public housing whereas the Congress document says that there is an urgent need for an increase in the proportion of houses provided by local authorities and they call for the setting up of a State construction company.</P>
    <P>Workers should not be duped by Fianna Fáil, who do not provide alternative policies to the Coalition.  They are just different faces carrying out the same anti-working class policies.  The Workers' Party have consistently demonstrated their commitment to working people and have pointed to the clear alternative policies which can rapidly lead to full employment. We have consistently supported <Col N="2993" /> the ICTU position on legislation which has come before this House, most recently in regard to the protection of employees in cases of insolvency.  We put down an amendment to cover people working 18 hours or less who are not covered in the Bill.  A number of Labour Deputies supported the amendment in their contributions to the debate but Fianna Fáil did not give us any support. Of course, when we called for a vote nobody supported us.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Bertie Ahern was interviewed on television following his appointment as Front Bench spokesman on Labour, he said that he saw his job as defending the interests of the working class.  He used the term six or eight times, and he saw himself as working closely with the trade union movement.  Records show that not much credence can be placed on that statement.</P>
    <P>While we expected little from the present Government in the way of economic reform, there was a widespread belief, following the November 1982 election, that a Government led by Deputy Garret Fitzgerald, who had a strong liberal image, and which featured a strong Labour Party participation, would at least be a reforming Government, a reforming administration in social matters.  In fact, the performance of this Government on social issues has been abysmal.  Deputy FitzGerald has since 1981 led Governments for two periods, one a short period of about six months and now a two year period.  Any honest observer would have to admit that the earlier Coalition Government led by the arch-conservative, Deputy Liam Cosgrave, delivered more in the way of social reforms than this supposedly reformist Government have done.</P>
    <P>Practically none of the social reforms promised in the Joint Programme for Government has been acted upon.  There is still no family planning Bill despite statements by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Desmond, as far back as June last that the Bill would be published in a matter of weeks.  The Government have failed to take any action on divorce and marital reform and <Col N="2994" /> have been content to divert the whole area to the Oireachtas Joint Committee, the deadline for which has been extended on three separate occasions, the last being only ten days ago.  Nothing has been done on the question of illegitimacy and we are still awaiting even one of the long promised Children Bills, of which there are supposed to be three.  The only significant social initiative taken by this Government has been the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    <P>The contrast between the Taoiseach's constitutional crusade speech of a couple of years back and his legislative inaction since means one of two things.  It could mean that he was never serious about the crusade in the first place and that it was simply used as a vehicle to gain publicity &mdash; and it did gain widespread publicity. That is one possibility.  The other &mdash; and probably more likely &mdash; is that the Taoiseach was sincere in his intentions at the time but has since lacked the guts to confront those of his own party who do not share his vision of a non-sectarian, secular state which he advocated at that time and therefore he has thrown out these principles which he enunciated, probably sincerely, in the face of the opposition within his own party.</P>
    <P>There would be no better way for me to end than by a question, of which I will give the source.  The source is the speech of the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, at the opening of this Adjournment Debate.  He said:</P>
    <P>Alienation is a human problem, and it consists in depriving people of a sense of hope, a sense of confidence in their system of Government and a sense of security.</P>
    <P>That is how he described alienation, but he was describing it in the context of Northern Ireland.  I submit that, in the context of the State down here now, there is no better definition of the term &ldquo;alienation&rdquo; than that which the Tánaiste has given &mdash; depriving people of a sense of hope, a sense of confidence in their system of Government and a sense of security.  I submit that people are deprived of that.</P>

      <P>The last speaker nominated a number of differentials between the policies of the Fianna Fáil Party and those of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions as published in their most recent document.  I agree with the contrasts which he gave.  I would perhaps just add one more to his list, which is that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions document advocates equity in taxation and, more specifically, a reasonable system of capital taxation, including a wealth tax, whereas the Fianna Fáil Party, as we know, went about abolishing the wealth tax which was brought in by a Coalition Government in the period 1973 to 1977.</P>
      <P>This idea that the Fianna Fáil Party are at one with the Congress of Trade Unions, or union views, has no credence whatsoever.  That is part of the apology of the Fianna Fáil Party for opposition, which, as was pointed out in an article in a paper of this morning, consists simply in agreeing with all the demands that are put to them.  If people want an increase in wages or salaries, they go to the Fianna Fáil Party.  Agreed.  If people want reduced taxation, they go to the Fianna Fáil Party.  Agreed.  If people want water apology for opposition with which we have been faced for the last two years.  I regret that, because there is no doubt that the country needs a strong opposition. It needs a constructive opposition.  It is regrettable that that has not been forthcoming so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are a small country.  Our resources are limited and few and it is therefore essential that such resources as we have, limited as they are, in the field of revenue and natural resources be used very, very carefully and to the best advantage.  Have we been doing that over the years?  In very many respects, we have not.  We have been raising large sums of money by <Col N="2996" /> taxation and raising large sums of money through borrowing, both at home and abroad.  We have been following the policy which successive Governments have followed, which must surely be well discredited by now, of pouring millions of pounds of this taxed and borrowed money into capital intensive industries which have the effect of cutting out people from jobs.  The so-called modernisation grant under which millions of pounds are given to these mostly foreign firms to come in and re-equip, as it is put, has the effect of increasing our dole queues.  This has been a very major factor in the ruthless and relentless increase in our unemployment figures.  The money that has been poured into the foreign firms has produced nothing like the return that one should have expected from it.  It has resulted in blackholes in the economy.  The only benefit the country has from these foreign firms coming in to set up their industries here with enormous financial backing is the amount of wages that they pay to their Irish employees.  They bring in with them, and use our money to buy, the most modern equipment, computer controlled, which use very, very few people to operate them.  The wages return that we get from this source is minimal in the extreme.</P>
    <P>What do we do to encourage labour? Quite the reverse.  We tax labour through the PRSI system instead of directing our money to native enterprise using native labour in larger numbers.  If the money was used to that end it would be a worthwhile change in direction.  It has been signalled by different Governments from time to time but never taken up.  We have tended to take the easy road and rely on foreign enterprise to come in and do the job for us.  Why have successive Governments not undertaken the task and said &ldquo;we will do this our way using our money and people who have expertise in different areas&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>We rely to a large extent on the expertise of our very expensive Civil Service. It is unfortunate that many of the major decisions, costing hundreds of thousands of pounds, have proved to be wrong and disastrous.  I refer to one in particular <Col N="2997" /> which admittedly affects my constituency, but that is not the primary reason I introduce it here.  It was the decision to provide the CIE DART system in the way it was done.  The country went to enormous expense to provide this rail facility.  It was provided on the north-south axis running in a north-south direction servicing areas which, relatively speaking, are sparsely populated.  In west county Dublin the Government have planned for the building of three new major towns, each with a population of approximately 100,000.  In my constituency is the town of Tallaght with a population fast approaching 100,000 people who are concentrated in one area.  The people on the north-south axis are not, on the whole, people who require to use public transport.  I know there are exceptions but, by and large, they are people who use motorcars.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that despite the enormous capital investment that was made this infrastructure will not pull its weight or achieve the use that that degree of expenditure warrants?  The people living in Tallaght have been abandoned without any rail link which would literally transform their lives.  There is not even an adequate bus service provided for them. Such bus service as is provided is at a price which many of them cannot afford, and that is without this latest bus fare increase.  One unemployed person told me it cost him 50p each way from where he lives in Tallaght to travel to Tallaght village let alone travel to Dublin.</P>
    <P>This lack of foresight makes me wonder about the value of the expertise we employ for many of these important decisions.  To come along then and increase the cost of bus fares is something that leaves me at an utter loss.  It is counterproductive and means people are discouraged from using the service, and the income to be derived by CIE from fare collection will reduce.  Would it not be better to maintain or reduce prices?  This would increase the amount of money coming in to CIE.  If an efficient, fast and cheap service was provided there is no doubt but that CIE would treble their <Col N="2998" /> number of customers.  Far from losing money they would end up with a greater income.</P>
    <P>The idea of setting up a new town with a population of 100,000 and leaving them without a rail link is appalling.  I appeal at this stage &mdash; I intend to do it again and again &mdash; for that decision to be reconsidered and for a rail link of some form to be provided into the three new towns in County Dublin.  We have teams of workers who would be ready, willing and able to construct that rail link.  I am talking about the people who worked on the DART project and who now have no work to do.  Would it not make great sense to put those people to work at what they are able to do so well: provide a rail link which would discourage the use of cars which in turn would contribute to a reduction of the appalling air pollution problem we read about in the Dublin area recently as a result of petrol and other pollutants?</P>
    <P>If a proper public transport service, both rail and road, was provided it would make a major contribution to many facets of life in the Dublin area.  If electric trains are exceptionally expensive surely a rail link using some other form of power could be provided at a lower cost.  I am disappointed that in the national plan it is indicated that there will be no major expenditure in the foreseeable future on rail expansion.</P>
    <P>In the course of his address Deputy Wilson referred with some degree of scorn and ridicule to the new right, as he called it, as though Fianna Fáil by some stretch of the imagination has some form of left wing ideology behind it.  That is an idea I find utterly ridiculous when one looks at their record and at what they did in 1977.  They are about to repeat that performance.  All the indications are there.  We have the promises about the abolition of water rates, the reduction of taxation here, more employment there and so on.  The people received a message in 1977.  I am fully confident that they will not fall into the same trap a second time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>In this debate I intend <Col N="2999" /> to address one of the main preoccupations of the last year, and that is the question of Northern Ireland.  At no time since the foundation of the State has there been such a gulf between the two sides of the House as to what the right policy should be, and never in the past 60 years has the policy of the Government been so emphatically the correct policy as it is today.  It gives me no pleasure to say that never in the last 60 years has the Opposition policy on Northern Ireland been so dangerous, wrong and opportunistic as is their policy today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Chequers summit there has been a sustained, aggressive and unscrupulous campaign aimed at conveying the impression that the Chequers summit was a failure.  I say most emphatically that it was not.  The press conference afterwards may have been, but after hours of hard, tough bargaining one of the essential elements in the Forum Report was accepted and written in to the communique, that is the recognition of the right of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland to the political expression of a distinctive nationalist identity.  It was written into the communique.  That was the first time that this has been done in the past 60 years.  Following this the way was and is clear for further developments leading to real and lasting progress.  This point was accepted readily and generously by the hard minded but well informed independent observers of the Anglo-Irish scene.  The <i>Washington Post</i> spoke of the progress made as being encouraging. The <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> saw what happened as positive.  The well informed and friendly <i>The Guardian</i> and the <i>Financial Times</i> drew a very clear distinction between the reality of the Summit and the rhetoric of the press conference. What happened back here?  The ink was dry long before it was possible to get any sort of considered response.  A howling orchestra of hysterical, destructive and savage criticism was unleashed from the side opposite without any regard whatever for the consequences of this irresponsible reaction or for the boost which <Col N="3000" /> such a reaction gave to those who have abjured the constitutional way, the Provisional IRA.  That stream of mindless, anti-national abuse continued in language of bitterness which would have shamed the Civil War generation.  Truly in that shameful reaction Ireland's difficulty was Fianna Fáil's opportunity and Fianna Fáil used the occasion shamelessly, mindless of the consequences of the damage they were inflicting on the country.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the facts of Northern Ireland policy today.  Let us look first at the Forum Report.  It has been very well said that the Forum Report was a historic, hopeful, seminal document, and so it was, but that report was barely launched before we witnessed an attempt, breathtaking in its brazenness and effrontery, by Deputy Haughey to hijack that report when deliberately and cynically, knowing full well what he was doing, he focussed on one option, one section of the report, that section in which all parties expressed their preference for a unitary state.  It was his insistence that this be the only message of the Forum, the only and inevitable solution.  Never before has there been such a brazen, breathtaking, active effrontery as that attempt, which has done great damage to the whole workings of the Forum, to hijack this valuable document.  In the following month we heard the varying degrees of the shrillness and crudeness of the drum-like repetition of what is now no more than a sick slogan, but it is a dangerous slogan and a dangerous approach because it ignores the other detailed, factual lessons of the Forum Report.</P>
    <P>We have heard very little and we have no emphasis from Fianna Fáil on the economic realities uncovered by the Forum or the hard-nosed assessments made in document after document about the cost in £s and in taxes that the people here could be asked to pay to sustain a unitary state.  The figures are there, the cost is staggering, but our ability and our willingness to pay that price find no place in the rhetoric of the party opposite. Nor do we hear very much from the party opposite of their willingness to face up to <Col N="3001" /> the constitutional changes, the changes in law and in attitude which will be part of the unitary, secular, pluralist state which Fianna Fáil say is on offer if only we go looking for it.  In every test case where a change must be made, where there is talk of a change, Fianna Fáil have been tried and found wanting because these changes take courage and could cost votes.</P>
    <P>Do we hear anything from the side opposite about the views and convictions of our fellow Irishmen, the Unionists of Northern Ireland who came down to the Forum and told us, courteously and firmly but loudly and clearly, that they will have no part of a unitary state, they will fight to the death to prevent it?  We have not heard one single idea from the people across the floor as to how their opposition can be overcome or how they can be persuaded.  Apart from the televison programme of Deputy Tunney we have seen little or no contact with these people.  They have become the forgotten people of this country as far as the party opposite are concerned.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, and their deputy leader in particular, talk about this great round table around which we will all sit.  He talks about how generous Unionists will find Fianna Fáil when the day comes when we can construct this great unitary state; but &mdash; ask any member of the SDLP and you will be told very clearly &mdash; we have not had one single idea from the party opposite as to how we are going to get the Unionists around this mythical round table, nor will the party opposite, in their cuteness specify one item that they are prepared to change in the discussions which take place when we sit around this mytical round table.  We are not told how we are going to get Unionists there, what we will talk about when we get them there or what is on offer.</P>
    <P>This might not be serious if it were simply a debate, but we are talking about the reality of life and death and the future of Northern Ireland.  This House owes it to itself to be very clear about the full implications of Fianna Fáil's position here.  They are saying and saying again to the Unionists, &ldquo;You are coming into our unitary state whether you want to or <Col N="3002" /> not.&rdquo;  That is only a very short step from the position expressed recently at Ógra Fianna Fáil at Malahide by a young lady, an officer of the Ógra and never repudiated by that party.  She said, &ldquo;If the Unionists do not like that they can go back to where they came from.&rdquo;  To put it even more crudely, in a celebrated interview in the <i>Evening Herald</i> Deputy Ned O'Keeffe on 8 October said about the Unionists &ldquo;We have already leaned over too far backwards to please them.&rdquo; It said that Deputy O'Keeffe is opposed to any further compromises or concessions to the Protestants and Unionists whom he wants as part of Irish Unity.  In the language of Deputy O'Keeffe &ldquo;If the Protestants do not like it they can lump it.&rdquo;  This is the language of Wolfe Tone, of generous fairminded republicanism. Good man, Ned.  At least we know where you stand on this.  It is manifestly clear even to the party opposite that there is no Unionist consent to a unitary state and there will not be.  If we get our unitary state about which we have heard so much in drum-like repetitions, it will be by coercion and it will mean a repetition of all the mistakes that have been made by the British in Northern Ireland in these past 60 years on a greater, more horrific scale and it will be a sure fire recipe for civil strife and instability.  Yet what do we find?  Fianna Fáil, louder, more insistently, mindlessly keep up their clamour for something which cannot be obtained at this time in our history.</P>
    <P>The members of Fianna Fáil should be very clear about what they are doing. They are committing a great disservice to the decent, long suffering constitutional Nationalists of Northern Ireland, because on the one hand they rule out interim possibilities which could improve greatly the conditions under which those people live and which could be the basis for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. That is more important than anything else at present.  They are ruling out the possibility of better relations between the two parts of this island and between Ireland and Britain, they are doing it in the comfort of their republican recesses, and the further away the louder the voice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3003" /> On the other hand, by setting a target, the unitary state, which cannot be obtained by constitutional means in the foreseeable future, they are deliberately and inexorably strengthening the position of those who have ruled out constitutional means and see the only way forward through the bomb and the bullet. The consequence of their policy is to create a world of fantasy and make-believe within which the Unionists are threatened and the constitutional Nationalists isolated, and the logic of its failure is to strengthen the case of the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>In recent times the voices opposite have become more strident and extreme, and one wonders how much of the reasonableness, the sanity and the decency of Jack Lynch's Northern policy remains or has he, too, with Deputy O'Malley and Senator Eoin Ryan, become a non-person consigned to some island limbo?  It is a very long way from the patriotic and peaceful approach of Jack Lynch to the views of Deputy Ned O'Keeffe as reported in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 8 October.  According to Deputy O'Keeffe there is no difference between the Old IRA and Provisional IRA except that the Provisionals' guns are more sophisticated.  Since then Deputy O'Keeffe has been promoted. His views have not been repudiated. They would have been in Jack Lynch's time.</P>
    <P>By contrast with all this we can judge the approach of this Government.  Our Minister for Foreign Affairs has won the confidence and respect of the Nationalist minority in Northern Ireland in a way that no Minister in the past has done. This is because he has spoken truthfully and honestly on their behalf.  He has done so with courage and persistence, and most of all what he has had to say has been dictated solely and exclusively out of concern for the real interests of the Northern nationalist people and not in the interest of political expediency down here.  The people of the North know that. They know that so far as the Minister for <Col N="3004" /> Foreign Affairs and this Government are concerned, their trust will be honoured. The approach of the Government and of the Taoiseach especially has been based fully and honestly on the analysis provided in the Forum report.  Their one concern is to make progress towards structures.  It does not matter what shape these structures take, whether they be federal, joint authority or otherwise so long as they provide clear and just government, so long as they are structures which bring full freedom to all the people of Northern Ireland and help towards peace and reconciliation.  We in this party will work tirelessly towards that end.  Neither short term political unpopularity nor loud braying from the Opposition will hinder us in that aim.  I am proud of our Government's record of commitment on Northern Ireland.  I am proud especially of their honesty, their courage and their realism.  What is absent most of all from the opposition is any sense of realism in their politics on Northern Ireland. I defy any Deputy opposite to say that he is proud of his party's approach to Northern Ireland in terms of courage, realism or honesty.</P>

There is some element of hypocrisy in the Deputy coming here and making a statement like that.  However I admire him for his courage.  It is the policy of Fianna Fáil that has run through consistent and constant and on which the Nationalists in the North know they can rely continuously.  I note that Deputy Manning did not say the Nationalists could rely on the Taoiseach.  He said they could rely on the Minister for Foreign Affairs</P>

      <P>I was tempted to intervene <Col N="3005" /> during the Deputy's speech also but I refrained from doing so.</P>
      <P>I intend concentrating first on the whole matter of crime.  There has been a tremendous upsurge in crime in recent times.  A certain amount of fire brigade action has been taken to deal with this situation but I am calling here tonight for a comprehensive action programme to combat crime.  Fire brigade action will not solve the present problem.  As soon as one area is tackled the criminals shift their operations to a neighbouring community or county.  There is some evidence that the overall level of crime is not increasing but the present unprecedent incidence of crime and vandalism is far too high.  There were 103,000 recorded crimes in 1983.</P>
      <P>The sense of security of citizens and particularly of the elderly has been shattered by recent events.  The public need to know that there is an effective police force to protect them and they need to see that force on a regular basis within the community areas.  Enough is known about the problem now for the Minister to ensure that an effective programme is undertaken by the Garda without delay. Some elements that I consider should be included in this programme are as follows: first, there is a duty on the Government to provide the manpower and restore overtime where this is required. Many Garda superintendents have been hamstrung by the Minister's across-the-board overtime cutbacks.  It is time for the Minister to review that policy and to ensure that overtime is available in areas where it is greatly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister should discard the ill-conceived rural rationalisation programme and instead maintain a Garda presence in rural districts.  The traditional very low level of crime in rural areas was due to a strong sense of community and obvious presence of friendly and effective members of the Garda. Demands in the cities of a fire brigade nature must not be allowed to cause a reduction in the stability and security of rural areas.  I pointed during the year to this danger.  From the end of last year <Col N="3006" /> rural Deputies had been expressing their concern about the withdrawal of a police presence from some of the smaller rural areas on the basis of the rationalisation programme which was under way and also with the introduction of the little green man we talked about earlier.  Sadly the chickens have come home to roost. The foolishness of this approach has been demonstrated clearly by the widespread panic experienced in country areas in the past week or two.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Minister should accelerate the introduction of neighbourhood and community watch systems and reorganise the approach to policing in order to provide for community policing.  This would involve more gardaí on the beat, intensive neighbourhood policing, police clinics at shopping centres and in blocks of flats and local community areas.</P>
    <P>There are many steps that could be taken, and these should be taken now. We all know of areas throughout the community where such steps should be applied.  It is time that management got on with that job.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, I suggest the introduction of a crash training course in modern methods of community policing for senior Garda personnel.  Knowledge and experience of these methods is now sufficient to allow for their adoption on a wide and uniform basis throughout the country.  I meet many senior members of the Garda who are not aware of what has been happening.  They are not aware of the pilot studies or of developments that have taken place in the past year.  It is time for a uniform approach to be adopted in these matters so that methods which are proving successful in the areas in which they are being tried can be put into operation.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, I suggest that gardaí be freed from routine duties so that they can do the job in the community for which they were trained.  This can be done by way of management making other provisions for such matters as the collection of statistics and signing on for the dole.  Garda stations could still be used in these matters but there is a need to make arrangements of a simpler nature to carry out the work. <Col N="3007" /> Management could make provision also to reduce the amount of time gardaí spend in the courts, for example, by introducing written statements where matters are agreed.  That is possible now within the terms of the Bill we passed during the year.  It is a change that should be implemented immediately because it would have a major effect.  I have been given an indication that the saving in that area could be up to £10 million.  This is the reality of putting some of these measures into operation.  The ideas are there but they are not being put into practice.</P>
    <P>Sixthly, I suggest that the Government's reduced target of 11,400 gardaí be abandoned and that instead the Fianna Fáil target of 12,000 be implemented. The Coalition's pledge on coming into Office was that Garda numbers would be in keeping with the Fianna Fáil plan but the shortfall as outlined in the national plan means that superintendents throughout the country are short of members to this extent.</P>
    <P>My seventh point is that more civil servants be introduced to the Garda force to undertake routine administrative work within Garda stations.  This is long overdue. It would free gardaí for Garda work and for in-service training programmes. There is a whole area of work assigned to the Garda which is not in keeping with their special training.  These extra duties leave them with less time for the work they are trained to do and most prevents them from finding time for in-service training.  At present civilians are not being replaced because of the embargo on recruitment in the Civil Service with the result that the Garda must bear an increased burden of typing and other duties.</P>
    <P>My next suggestion is that the National Community Development Agency who were established with a £2.25 million budget in 1982 by Fianna Fáil and who were scuttled by the Coalition should be restored.  This agency would promote a necessary community response which must accompany any new approach by the Garda.  The importance of voluntary <Col N="3008" /> agencies was emphasised by the recent attacks on elderly people, as was the need for organised community support and involvement.  We can do something about the level of crime.  The fact that more gardaí were appointed is having an effect but a much greater effect is possible if the management is applied to the numbers of gardaí available at the moment and they are given an opportunity to get on with the job.</P>
    <P>The Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1984 introduced by the Minister for justice was put before us and it looked as if it was going to be pushed through at the end of the session. We were quite surprised at this Bill because it has some unusual features, one being that it has no explanatory memorandum. This Bill was introduced very quietly without a fanfare and without a memorandum.  We made it quite clear that we will not agree to it being rushed through the House.  It is a Bill that will need time for debate and very likely substantial amendments will be made to it. The introduction now of this Bill shows how out of touch with reality are the Government.  It is being introduced when the public service are being asked to tighten their belts, when the unemployed are being asked to accept an extremely poor situation where their increases are less than inflation and they are not being given a double week this Christmas and when CIE and other workers have to accept paltry pensions.  The Government have come along with these proposals to arrange for special pensions and benefits in addition to pensions. Already three trade union leaders have described the proposals as outrageous and scandalous.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the Minister taking power to confer benefits on members of the Judiciary without the normal requirement of coming before the House.  By including a provision that it must be put before the House the Government are accepting the control of the House.  The proposals being put forward by the Minister on behalf of the Government represent a serious erosion of the independence of the judiciary and will <Col N="3009" /> give rise to serious argument and debate. These regulations provide for the Minister to confer superannuation benefits. That relates not only to a superannuation scheme but also to a golden handshake or gratuity to any judge who voluntarily vacates his office after five years service. There is a provision for retrospection in the legislation.  The legislation provides for the Minister to bring the regulations into effect on a date prior to the date on which they are made.  The Bill also says that the regulations need only be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas after they are made.  This Bill also deals with regulations for the Master of the High Court, the Taxation Master and the County Registrar.  Those regulations all have to come before the House.</P>
    <P>as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulations is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly,</P>
    <P>In other words as far as those officials are concerned the House will have control in that a regulation may be annulled if the House considers it necessary but as far as the judge is concerned there is no control. This is a very sinister development.</P>
    <P>We have always supported an independent Judiciary.  We have always been prepared to take any action regarded as necessary, in support of the Judiciary. This sort of arrangement must be clearly open and above board.  This measure provides the potential for corruption.  In the future the Minister could ask the judge carrying out an inquiry for a suitable report and say that he will arrange a handsome golden handshake.  Under this legislation the Minister will have the power to make that arrangement and then to lay it on the table of the House and the House will have no opportunity to take action on it.</P>

      <P>We heard today of the nomination by the Taoiseach of a new Attorney General in the purported exercise of his official constitutional powers. We know from reports that the Tánaiste demanded and was given the right to select the person to be nominated.  It is also well known that the Taoiseach disapproved of and tried to resist the Tánaiste's selection as being unsuited, presumably because of lack of experience, for that post.  It is clear that the Taoiseach has abandoned his constitutional responsibilities and tragically may have damaged the constitutional office of the Attorney General.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to some of the other questions involved here.  We oppose the provisions giving increased pensions on voluntary retirement after five years in order to prevent the accumulation of pensions especially where the purpose of retirement is to take another post or employment, rather than on the grounds of age, ill-health or some other usual ground.</P>
      <P>During the course of the year a great deal of time was spent on the Criminal Justice Bill.  It was introduced in October 1983 and finally passed a couple of weeks ago.  Unfortunately, that Bill is now a toothless tiger.  The powers the Minister said he wanted for the Garda, the powers which the Garda said they need so badly, are suspended.  Why are they left in suspense?  Because they must await the introduction of a complaints procedure and regulations for the safeguarding of persons while in custody.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the year and, indeed, back in October of last year, we told the Government there was an absolute need for a complaints procedure and for safeguards in conjunction with the Bill.  If the Minister were sincere and really wanted to give the Garda the powers they say they need in present circumstances, he should have put the two measures before the House and let them be debated in parallel.  It might have been easier for everyone, including the President, in looking at the Bill subsequently if they could see the safeguards in the Bill.  However, that was not done. For whatever reason the Minister did not manage to do it during the year, notwithstanding the fact that we provided him with a complaints procedure fully worked out which he could add to or take from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the year the Minister still has no complaints procedure.  We provided him with a long list of safeguards which would suit the regulations. The net effect is that the Bill has gone through with the main powers suspended <Col N="3013" /> until the Minister can bring in his complaints procedure and regulations.  This must be a disappointment for the Garda. It is a sad failure to achieve the objectives the Minister had in mind in presenting the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>Recently we had the report on the Mountjoy disturbance.  I asked a question about it.  Unfortunately these matters take a long time to come before the House unless they are taken for written reply.  I regard the report as very disappointing, largely because the conclusion did not represent the body of the statements given throughout the report, and concentrated on one aspect only.  This made me question the whole basis of the conclusion.  The report provides valuable reading about what really happened in the disturbance in November 1983 and shows quite clearly that essentially it was an industrial relations problem which suffered from lack of attention by the Minister and the management.  That is spelled out quite clearly in the report.  It is not carried into the conclusion.</P>
    <P>It is also quite clear that the inquiry would have benefited from oral clarification by the parties who made submissions. There was no oral clarification. There were written submissions only.  I found that quite extraordinary.  It highlights the fact that the prison governor went on leave on Wednesday 2 November, the same day as the new escorts were introduced.  It points to the intervention of the Department of Justice at a critical stage on Saturday between 2 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. when they prevented the acting governor from explaining the Minister's withdrawal or suspension of the circular to the prison officers.</P>
    <P>It also confirms that the Minister knew from Thursday about the industrial action but went away to his normal, routine engagements and constituency clinics. The conclusion was incomplete and unbalanced, given the facts established in the report itself.  As a report it seems to be quite factual, but the conclusion does not relate to the report even as the report was presented.  For anyone interested in what really happened, a reading of the <Col N="3014" /> full report is very valuable, but a reading of the conclusion would be quite misleading.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that in the inquiry which we eventually succeeded in getting into the Kerry babies case the Minister refused to include any recommendations. We welcome the establishment of the facts of the case, but we are very disappointed that the Minister has not required the judge who will conduct the inquiry to present his recommendations on the treatment of people in custody and the conduct of investigations which would have been particularly valuable.  I find it hard to understand why the Minister excluded that specifically, especially when the last two major inquiries included that provision.</P>
    <P>We have not time to go into many aspect of crime and justice.  I should like to thank publicly the members of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism for their input and for their very valuable contribution which are clearly evident in the various reports.  Five reports have now been presented and laid before the House.  Another will be ready very shortly.  I would like to thank the staff of the House who helped us with that task and the members from all sides who were also very helpful in the work of that committee. It has been very valuable.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Tánaiste this morning. At page 3 of his speech he described his position very well when he said that all these lofty aims of jobs and health services, social welfare, education and other areas had to be accommodated in the context of the financial situation.  If you ever want to know whether you are following the monetarist or the Thatcherite line there it is spelled out in the Tánaiste's statement.  They have to be accommodated.  There is no room for any policies of this nature.  That is what is wrong at the moment.  We are trying to accommodate everything within, we are not looking out and looking to the future. This is a bankrupt Government, a Government of poverty and hopelessness. Never have so many been unemployed, never was poverty so widespread, <Col N="3015" /> never has a Government had so little to offer because they are setting their targets so low in terms of the real potential and opportunities of this country.  Added to that, this Government are being identified as the Government of patronage at a rate that has never been seen in the past.  If you want to know, ask around the corridors and you will find that the level of patronage this Government is involved in far exceeds anything any Government were ever involved in in the past.  We have seen the merit or lack of merit of this Government.  The sooner the Government go back to the country the better.  The people have no confidence in the Government.  The Government must accept the fact that the people have no confidence in them.  They cannot just cling on and let the country go down the tube.  They should be manly and accept that the people of the country have no confidence in them.  This is a bankrupt Government and, tragically for the young people and the unemployed, this presents a hopeless situation.  I hope that in the new year we will see some improvement preferably by a change of Government and, if not, then by a change of policy on the part of this Government.</P>
    <P>It is Christmas and I would like to wish the Ceann Comhairle and the staff of the House a Happy Christmas and every blessing in the New Year.

      <P>I would like to join with Deputy Woods in wishing you and the staff a very Happy Christmas.  Deputy Woods finished on a very nice note.  It is a pity we do not have the spirit of Christmas more often in the House.  It would appear to me, from the two years I have been here that the Opposition, <Col N="3016" /> whatever opposition they happen to be, spend most of the time promising everything and then when they get into Government spend most of the time giving reasons why they cannot deliver on the promises they made.  I would suggest that is the reason why many people in the country are losing faith in the politicians and in politics generally, apart from the serious unemployment situation.</P>
      <P>We talk about unemployment at this stage as if it were inevitable that unemployment will increase and yet we hear very little attempts being made to put forward positive policies that will help to deal effectively with that.  The ICTU in its document Confronting the Jobs Crisis has made a very serious attempt to put on paper what they believe to be the way forward on the jobs front.  It is ironical that the Fianna Fáil delegation that went to ICTU agreed entirely with the document. The ICTU are meeting various other political parties and it appears that so far everybody seems to be agreeing with the ICTU document.  It will be very interesting to see how many parties make a serious attempt to apply the policies contained in that document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own constituency and in the Border area generally we have lost thousands of jobs.  The Minister for Finance and the Government made a small contribution recently by reducing the price of spirits, but beer, electrical goods and petrol are still at the higher levels of VAT and there remains a very substantial gap between the prices north and south. People continue to flood across the Border in their thousands.  It is not possible, and it never will be possible, to man that Border effectively to curtail to any degree the level of smuggling that is taking place.  In Newry recently and in other towns there were bomb threats, shootings, killings and explosions and still the people continue to flood in, coming even from Cork by bus, leaving Cork city at 6 o'clock in the morning. It is a crazy situation, and still the Government of the day cannot see, and indeed the previous Government could not see, where we are going in this regard. We talk about black holes. This is surely the biggest black hole <Col N="3017" /> of all time.  There are millions of pounds per week going across the Border.  It would be very interesting if the Minister for Finance would be prepared to reduce VAT on electrical goods and excise duty on beer and petrol even on a trial basis. There are thousands of jobs involved. There have been thousands of jobs lost and they can only be replaced if something positive is done about that.  Everybody now realises this any yet we do not seem to be able to do anything about it.  This what I cannot understand about politics.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to taxation and link that with public service pay.  I cannot accept that there should be any interference in the negotiation procedures or the arbitration and conciliation machinery within the public service.  It would be most unfortunate if we allowed ourselves to get into a confrontation situation with the public service, because if we do we will lose out and in my opinion the very basis of democracy will suffer on this one. We are heading in that direction.  If we appoint arbitrators and have labour courts we should be prepared to accept their findings after reasonable discussion and negotiation.</P>
    <P>The Government of the day have said &ldquo;How can we pay these increases in public service pay?&rdquo; The answer, I think, is that we can pay reasonable public service pay awards if we put in a much more effective taxation collection system to start with. We could pay reasonable public service pay awards had we a much more effective taxation collection system. At present there are outstanding millions of pounds in rates, health levies, car tax, even the collection of dog licences &mdash; which have dropped by something like 50 per cent &mdash; even the dogs are gone to the dogs as far as taxation is concerned. There are arrears of taxation on the part of the self-employed, the business community, companies in the industrial field, of hundreds of millions of pounds.  We have a lengthy appeals system which, in some cases, can take a year to resolve, when taxation moneys due lie around <Col N="3018" /> virtually for years before they are effectively collected, by which time many companies will have gone out of business, have changed companies, or engaged in some form of tax dodge or other.  Rarely are they ever pursued effectively.  For example, how many people go to jail for avoiding tax?  What types of fines are applied to offenders?  There is the minimum of fines levelled on those found guilty.  Yet if an itinerant woman went into a supermarket and stole a bag of goods she would probably get a month in jail while these people can get away with thousands of pounds and, in some cases not be fined at all.  They are allowed lengthy periods in which to pay when they have deprived the Government of the day of moneys due to them.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the money is not there for the payment of public service pay increases.  That argument is not sustainable.  The level of staff in the various sections of the Revenue Commissioners dealing with tax collection has been restricted and is not effectively organised.  Indeed the whole system of tax collection has gone out of control, is cumbersome and non-effective.  The only people effectively taxed are those on the PAYE system where moneys are deducted on a weekly or monthly basis. Even then, in many cases, it may not be returned and the people who have paid that tax will not know until perhaps a year later that it has not been paid on their behalf.  Others who are effectively taxed are those old people in receipt of old age pensions or small industrial pensions. They are taxed at source.  Old men and women on small retirement pensions &mdash; who are few and far between &mdash; effectively are taxed on £15 a week pension which means that they are taxed on their old age or widow's pensions.  That is the only place within the taxation system that tax deduction is effectively done.  Of course the other section is the public sector because nobody there can ever get away with not paying tax.  To maintain that it would cost X amount of money to fund a public service pay award is not correct.  Whatever increase may follow the hearings at present taking place, it <Col N="3019" /> should be remembered that certainly 50 per cent of the balance will go back to the Exchequer in one form or another. Therefore it is not true to contend that if an award is to cost £100 million, that will be the effective outcome.  Its probable outcome will be less than £25 million when one takes the total taxation system into consideration.  I should hate to see the Government fall on that issue.  But I would have to have it recorded that I and my Labour Party colleagues are very strong on that position.  The Government, particularly the Cabinet, should think very carefully before saying no to an arbitration, Labour Court award or whatever within the State or semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>Much bad medicine has been dealt us, a lot of it necessary, some unnecessary, but we now await the administration of some good medicine.  What I have been advocating since I came into this House is the implementation of a national pay-related scheme.  Although there was brief reference to it in the course of the debate on the national plan there has not been, as yet, any positive commitment on the part of the Government as to when it would be introduced or what form it would take.  The Minister of State present deals with a very important sector of our community, the under-privileged, under her portfolio.  I am satisfied that the implementation of such a national pay-related pension scheme would eliminate much of the poverty for people like widows and old age pensioners, particularly in the female sector, when women find they must live on pittances when their husbands die and they are left without any pension. It should be remembered that the vast majority of industrial and commercial workers have no pension scheme and must rely on the old age pension.  I would ask the Minister of State to use whatever influence she can on her party colleagues in this respect.  I shall do likewise with mine in order to get home the message that this should be one of the priorities of this Government's term of office.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by the <Col N="3020" /> Tánaiste that, after ten years, we shall have a National Development Corporation. That will not constitute the cure for all our economic ills but it will help in co-ordinating economic planning, hopefully placing the responsibility, particularly in relation to the job situation, in the hands of people with the expertise, skill and dynamism to get us out of this dreadful situation with regard to jobs. Time should be spent dealing with the subject of jobs in this House and in committees thereof, because all of the problems referred to by many Opposition spokesmen relate directly or indirectly to the jobs crisis. Had we less unemployment we would not have the same taxation problem, the same social welfare problem, we would be able to afford much of the social welfare legislation needed and to which this Government were committed in their joint programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>On this occasion it is the credibility of the Opposition that is at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some weeks ago we published our national plan for the next three years <i>Building on Reality</i>.  The credibility of the main Opposition party becomes starker by the hour.  One would have thought they would have learned a lesson from the squandermania of their 1977 manifesto &mdash; that this country was more or less Tír na nÓg and that under every rainbow there was to be found a pot of gold.  It would appear that the Opposition Party learned nothing from history. Deputy Haughey took over the Fianna Fáil Party in December 1979.  He made his famous television speech some time <Col N="3021" /> in January 1980 and, to paraphrase him, he more or less disowned Deputies O'Donoghue and Jack Lynch's manifesto, contending that the country could not go on as it was going, that belts must be tightened and the nation's finances put right.  I wonder where that Deputy Haughey has gone?  Shortly afterwards, in June 1981, there was a general election when the Coalition came to power and, in January 1982, went out of power because they put the country before the Government or parties.  Then Fianna Fáil were elected to power and, in March 1982, they took over.  We had then the sorry spectacle of a Government going down on their knees paying homage to Deputy Gregory.  I wonder what would the late Eamon de Valera or Seán Lemass say were they still alive and knew what was happening.  Deputy Gregory was going to get millions of pounds for the Dublin inner city area.  The media never had it so good.  Deputies Gregory and Haughey, in that order, were running the country, according to the media.  RTE had them on every current affairs and pop programme.  To top that we had Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, when Minister for Finance, presenting a budget which was so exact and correct that he had the money spent early in July, a remarkable achievement even by Cork standards.</P>
    <P>We had a general election.  Fianna Fáil lost.  The Coalition parties had told the people beforehand that we had no gimmicks and no promises, that all we had was sincere government, putting the country first.  One would have thought Fianna Fáil would have learned from that experience.  They did not.  Week in, week out since then they have had Private Members' motions here.  Let us look at their programme of Private Members' motion, each one costing millions of pounds: 26.1.82, agricultural policy moved by Deputy Lenihan; 2.2.83, closure of a railway line, Deputy H. Byrne; 16.2.83, school transport services, Deputy H. Byrne; 23.2.83, Cork-Pembroke ferry service, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald; 9.3.83, price of petrol and oil products, Deputy Flynn; 23.3.83, farming development, Deputy Michael <Col N="3022" /> Noonan (Limerick West); 20.4.83, charges for job applications in the public service, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald; 4.5.83, fruit processing industry, Deputy Noonan again; 24.5.83, school transport, Deputy O'Rourke; 25.5.83, the construction industry, Deputy Molloy; 1.6.83, Verolme Cork Dockyard, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald; 29.6.83, closure of Tuam sugar factory, again Deputy Noonan; 9.11.83, maternity facilities at Bantry Hospital, Deputy O'Hanlon; 16.11.83, Clondalkin Paper Mills reopening, Deputy Lenihan; 1.2.84, general medical services, Deputy O'Hanlon; 4.4.84, Irish fishing industry; we then had a motion on Verolme Dockyard.</P>
    <P>What did that cost?  It did not end there.  Last Monday Deputy Molloy said he would do away with the service charges with a stroke of the pen.  When Deputy Ray Burke was Minister for the Environment he mooted the service charges at a county managers' meeting in Kilkenny.</P>

      <P>It is about time Fianna Fáil Deputies looked into their souls.  Fianna Fáil credibility is non-existent in the country after what they have been saying. Let us look at one of their leading lights, Deputy Lenihan.  Not so long ago he shouted across this House: &ldquo;I have two names for you, Minister, of who bugged Séamus Mallon's House&rdquo;.  When he got his chance to speak here today he did not qualify that statement or tell the people what the situation was.  He wants to run <Col N="3023" /> away from that kind of a situation, and everybody knows why.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Lenihan was a member of a Government he sold off the boatyards for a song and the people who got them closed them and are living in the lap of luxury.  Then we had the very sorry spectacle the other night of 50 Fianna Fáil Deputies trooping into the House before Question Time to pay homage to the real Taoiseach.  Who are they codding? This morning Deputy Lenihan said the country was facing some kind of revolution. Would he be more specific? What did he mean when he said a thing like that?</P>

He was rejected by the people again and again and if the backbenchers over there had not botched up their revolution he would not now be even Leader of his party.

      <P>Deputies contributing to the debate from all sides will be conscious of the very serious economic difficulties facing the nation.  Indeed, there are some who will say that this is not a time for political point scoring, although the Tánaiste's contribution this morning was laden with political overtones and lacked any type of real positive input.  In fact, he used political tactics for the purpose of disguising his failure and that of his Government to introduce a worth-while economic development programme in the last two years.  I was present for that speech and I was present later for the contribution of the Minister for Finance, who treated us to one of his eloquent lectures in economic theory, emphasising the word theory.  In his own way he made a better case against himself than I could. He must now acknowledge that his economic theories have failed.  It is obvious that after two years he is unable to distinguish between theory and practice.  It was interesting to hear his academic lecture, but it is sad to record his performance in his efforts to implement those theoretical practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After two years in office we are fairly <Col N="3025" /> entitled to put the Government on trial. The House, on behalf of the people, is entitled to analyse their performance and deliver the verdict that the people would deliver if given an opportunity.  It is expecting too much from Government Deputies to ask them to join in pronouncing the only verdict the House can credibly give on Government performance. That verdict, inevitably, would have to be one of guilty. The Government are guilty of failing to discharge their duty, guilty of misleading the people into thinking that somehow or other a Coalition of Fine Gael and Labour has some magic formula for dealing with the country's economic ills. They sold that idea under a false guise which they called credibility. That veil of credibility has long since vanished and the people who wore it have been exposed as they try to explain the reasons for their failures in the last two years.</P>
    <P>Government is about managing the economic affairs of the nation.  It is about developing our resources for the purpose of creating employment. It is about providing for the socially deprived in society and about providing adequate protection and security for our citizens, especially the elderly.  Government is also about furthering the cause of our aspirations to see a peaceful and united Ireland.  How has this administration fared under those headings?  After two years it would not be unfair or unkind to suggest that the self-styled Government of national reconstruction has turned out to be a Government of national destruction buried in the debris of their own making which, tragically, is reflected in the growing level of unemployment, factory closures and a depressed agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Members will agree that there is a total undermining of public confidence leading to a lack of investment.  People who would normally invest in our economy run scared from the threat of a penal tax system and the fear of a liquidator if they run into the slightest economic difficulty. We had the national embarrassment arising from the recent Summit which, tragically, was exposed to the nation on our television screens.  Members of the <Col N="3026" /> Government have been pathetic in their performance individually.  Collectively they have been a disaster and are a threat to the future economic development of the nation.  They should take note immediately of what is happening around them, have the courage to admit their failure and leave it to the people to decide their future.</P>
    <P>A few hours ago I heard the Minister for Finance say that the House on two occasions by a majority vote had endorsed the national plan.  If the Minister takes satisfaction from the political achievement I do not begrudge him that pleasure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is democracy, but the ultimate in democracy is the opportunity people have to express their view in the ballot box in a general election.  I have no doubt what the people would say about the Government if they were given that opportunity.  Even at this late stage the Government must have got the message that government is not simply an economic exercise in accountancy but rather a technique in management which calls for judgement, vision and a belief in our future.  The Government lack vision and hope.  Their failure to recognise the plight of the victims of their maladministration is frightening to many people. The Minister for Finance informed us tonight that he took great pleasure from his administration in the last two years. Was it pleasure in seeing 216,000 people unemployed, pleasure in seeing education fees increased, pleasure at presiding over the removal of food subsidies, pleasure at encouraging and bringing about an economic position that forced factories to close their doors, pleasure at the cutback in the health services which at this time finds many of our hospitals totally under-staffed and incapable of providing the level of services needed, or pleasure at watching the liquidation day after day of our many industries large and small? That is the Administration which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, <Col N="3027" /> told us he took great pleasure in presiding over.</P>
      <P>Politics is the art of the possible, but this Government have made it the art of the impossible because they have failed to reach any objective or target they set themselves.  The fact is that the Taoiseach and his Cabinet have lost the confidence of the people, and expecially the young people who at the last election were prepared to give them a chance.  Now these young people know to their grief that this Government are planning for unemployment rather than creating jobs for those very talented young people.</P>
      <P>I regret that my time is limited, but in the few minutes left I would like to refer to a few specific areas of economic development, in particular agriculture.  The outcome of Ireland's negotiations on the milk super-levy was a total disaster.  No recognition was given of the fact that this country had not developed agriculturally to the same level as our European competitors. We heard the Agricultural Institute predict tonight that farm incomes would decline in 1985 as a direct result of the imposition of the milk super-levy. What can one say about the Government's disgraceful performance in relation to the calculations of the 1983 milk output for Ireland?  That miscalculation, on top of the imposition of the super-levy, will cost Irish farmers and workers in the agri-business many millions of pounds.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the Libyan negotiations which were so successfully conducted by the leader of this party when the present Minister for Agriculture was unable to negotiate on behalf of this nation.  What situation would we be in if, following the disastrous super-levy negotiations, we were faced with the closing of the only viable agricultural enterprise left, that is, our livestock exports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have time to talk about the disadvantaged areas.  When we left Government the Minister of State, the late Deputy Cowan, charged with responsibility for disadvantaged areas, had advanced that cause as far as possible, but we now find from the information <Col N="3028" /> coming from Brussels that there is no application on record to have any area of this country designated as severely disadvantaged.  If we wanted any evidence of this Government's commitment to the disadvantaged areas one need only examine the Estimates and one will see that no provision has been made in 1985 for any area of this country to be included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    <P>I regret my time is limited, but I am anxious to share it with my colleague, Deputy Brennan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hyland for sharing his time with me. Nineteen eighty-four was the year of opportunity.  The international rate of growth in the world at large was very exciting.  We held the Presidency of the EC and we engaged in the New Ireland Forum.  At the end of 1984 it is time to take stock and ask ourselves if we used these opportunities to deal with the real cancer in our society today, that is, unemployment. We are almost half way through the decade and the House will agree that the challenges which face this country are greater than they have been for many decades and on the basis of the policies as I see them, they will grow more acute unless there is a radical shift in policies.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the Programme for Government published in 1982.  It said that the unemployment situation with 170,000 unemployed, 50,000 under 25 years of age, required firm and decisive action.  Of course it did.  The latest figures are 218,500, an increase of 50,000 since the Government took office, 66,000 are under the age of 25, an increase of 16,000 in two years, and 84,000 people have been unemployed for more than one year.  The consequences of this are very hard to describe.  They are disillusionment, emigration and poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A section of the community not often discussed, because it is not fashionable to do so, is the new middle class poor. Information available to me from banking institutions indicates a serious level of white collar poverty which is endemic in Irish society.  Many of my constituents <Col N="3029" /> are suffering from this problem.  The Society of Saint Vincent de Paul are helping people to pay mortgages.  They did not do that five or ten years ago.  Families I know had to sell their cars and their houses.  That might not sound like poverty but it is a dangerous undermining of society.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to that type of poverty which is creeping into Irish society.  Most of these middle class families are in enforced indebtedness which, unfortunately, the taxation system makes it very difficult for them to start paying off.  It is a vicious circle.  Most middle class homes today wake up with the dread of an envelope in the hallway from the Bank of Ireland, AIB or some other bank asking them to come and see the manager because of their overdraft.  The difficulties experienced by middle class families are frightening, but never before were they brought to the attention of Dáil Éireann in this very specific way.  There is, of course, a greater poverty which we have to discuss often in the House.  We must ask ourselves whether we are better off than we were two or even ten years ago.  More importantly, we must ask ourselves in what direction we go to get out of it.</P>
    <P>There is no point at this stage in rambling and ranting about the difficulties facing us.  We must put them in perspective and get the country back on the rails. The Commission on Taxation pointed out that our taxation system is muddled, complicated and inefficient and anybody looking at the system objectively would have to agree.  The number of people paying above the standard rate today is now 40 per cent.  A decade ago only 1 per cent paid above the standard rate.  In Britain, 5 per cent. pay above the standard rate which is much the same as here. A major area of new policies must be in the taxation area to get it back into line and to sort out the complicated system. I have called many times for taxation reform to be introduced on a time-table basis.</P>
    <P>Since the PRSI system was introduced in full in 1979, the maximum employers' contribution has increased by 68 per cent in real terms.  The maximum employees' <Col N="3030" /> contribution has increased by 140 per cent in real terms.  Those figures, added to the taxation figures, add up to a frightening taxation regime.  It is not just the responsibility of this or previous Governments.  We are facing great difficulties, and the politicians will not be thanked by this or succeeding generations if we do not get our act together.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance holds the reins of power and the people will decide whether that should be changed.  He has the honour of trying to come to grips with the problem and to stem the tide, because if it is not tackled in the next five years there will be little left to fight about in Dáil Éireann as there will be a decreasing barrel of wealth and jobs, increasing emigration and disillusionment, more white collar poverty and a general abandonment of the objectives we are trying to achieve.  We look to employers to create jobs, but what employer is interested in paying £1,000 per annum in tax on the average industrial wage of £7,000 or £8,000?  It means that an employer with 100 people in his factory would have to pay £100,000 in PRSI.  He would be crazy to open a factory under those conditions as, before he opened his doors, he would have to pay out £100,000.  What kind of policy in this?  What kind of country is it? What kind of madness makes the Government tax jobs so highly?  A much smarter approach would be to tax the employer less for every employee he takes on rather than the other way around.  I cannot see the sense of continuing this measure.  Between the contributions of employer and employee, PRSI accounts for 21 per cent of all salaries before allowances are deducted.  Any attempt to understand the system must start by looking at PRSI under a magnifying glass.  We must tackle the problem creatively, and the Minister for Finance should take his courage in both hands and slash that contribution.  He would get it back, because we are paying £12 million every week in unemployment assistance. If the contributions were halved, I bet my bottom dollar that the Minister would benefit.  The alternative is disastrous, and <Col N="3031" /> it is not enough to say that the Department of Finance need cash flow.  That is not the correct approach.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed in the national plan because it does not provide a basis for turning the constraints which face us into challenges and opportunities.  Does the Minister know that foreign indebtedness in December 1982 was £5 billion?  Twelve months later, it was £7 billion and 12 months later again it was £8 billion.  That does not take into account the reports of the semi-State bodies which put a further £2 billion on those figures.  Our external debt is now 70 per cent of GNP.  In 1979 it was 22 per cent.  Is anybody listening to these figures?  Does anybody know or care about the mess we are in or about the heritage which we are handing on to our children?  Every politician in this House should admit honestly and openly that our nation is facing difficulties, and they should produce realistic proposals to solve the problems.</P>
    <P>I have called for tax reform.  In a speech in Cork in September 1984, the Tánaiste said that tax reform, especially reducing the burden of tax carried by workers on full PAYE, is a major priority of the Government and that any national, economic and social plan which fails to address inadequacies in the tax system is not worth the paper it is written on.  If he meant that the plan is not worth the paper it is written on because it does not include tax reform, I agree with him.</P>
    <P>I wanted to put forward proposals in regard to specific measures, but I do not have much time left.  We must reform the taxation system and realise that we cannot continue to have public spending at 65 per cent of GNP when in 1970 it was 30 per cent of GNP.  It is about 40 per cent in the UK and in the USA it is about 30 per cent.  We must also sort out the semi-State companies to make sure that they are the creators of wealth and not consumers of wealth.  Their debt has risen from £1.5 billion to £4.5 billion in five years.  Let us settle the Central Bank dispute by using section 18 of the Industrial Relations Act which is available if the Government choose to use it.  We <Col N="3032" /> should realise that we can fight among ourselves but the country must earn its keep and the only way to do that is by earning revenue abroad. We have less than one quarter of 1 per cent of all the world markets at present.  If we offered incentives to our companies and young people we could double that figure, which would transform the country.  When we talk about equality, I do not mean the kind of equality that makes us equally poor but that which gives people incentives and initiative and shows them that they can make money in this country and provide employment for themselves.</P>
    <P>Let us concentrate on new companies, small companies, service industries and realise that most of the jobs that have been created in the United States and in England in the past few years have been created in such small companies with less than 100 employees each.  Let us sort out and make efficient the institution of Dáil Éireann, about which we have been talking for a long time.  To take it to the end of this century, this country needs a modern, professional, efficient Legislature. We have not really got down to that yet.  We are still operating the old system.</P>

      <P>First, this kind of debate offers the opportunity to us all to air our views and to take stock of what has gone on over the past year &mdash; in our case over the past two years since we came into Government.  I must compliment Deputy Séamus Brennan on being his usual constructive self.  He is a man who does not throw stones or lay blame unless he is sure as to where the stone should be thrown or the blame should be laid.  He has given us in 15 minutes a very comprehensive view of the difficulties facing us.  He has also given us, albeit in a very truncated form, the philosophy necessary to get us out of these difficulties.  I wish we could hear more of these speeches and that we all together could see to it that we get ourselves out of our present problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot help but think of something which I read last week about a survey carried out in the United States concerning <Col N="3033" /> the second four years of the Reagan régime.  In the survey, many people expressed a pessimism and a degree of worry.  What 70 per cent of them did was express the view that it was time for practical patriotism, that they must hang together and co-operate in getting their country back on the rails.  What is needed here is something along the same lines&mdash; practical patriotism, and I am not talking about flag waving.  I am talking about a common sense approach.  Criticism when it is necessary, but let that criticism be constructive.</P>
    <P>We have published a plan which is a national plan.  It has been voted on in this House and through this House by a majority.  As I told Deputy Hyland, that is the system under which we operate, that is democracy.  In that economic plan, whether we like to admit it or not, is the road back to economic recovery.  It charts the way forward for our people.  It charts the road to economic independence.  We were going down that slope of economic dependence which, if continued, would lead to other people in other places deciding our destiny.  They would decide for us where to spend, where to cut and whom to cut.  That is what we must avoid at all costs.  At that stage we have lost both our economic independence and our independence to act in the way in which we want to act and in which our people wish us to act.</P>
    <P>The plan has been criticised for its lack of optimism.  It has been said that the targets were set too low.  In many cases such criticism springs from lack of understanding of the depths of the problems that face us.  In as much as that is the case, I would accept that type of criticism emanating from that kind of source as being sincere, albeit made in ignorance. However, I must say that the criticism emanating from some of the benches opposite, from the very day on which this plan came to light, falls into a somewhat different category.  It cannot be said to be rooted in ignorance.  To me, it is opposing for the sake of opposition.  It is malicious, it is misleading and absolutely irresponsible. This plan, despite the fact that it has been voted on in this House and passed, <Col N="3034" /> has been waved aside as being irrelevant, as meaning nothing.  Yet I stand here as a member of a Government and say that it is a plan to which we must look for our economic salvation over the next three years.  At least, credit must be given to us that we have had the courage to take this problem by the scruff of the neck and put on paper details of expenditure and allocation in the different subheads in all Departments over the next three years. In that plan we have put down these figures, we have set targets that we feel in the present circumstances are realistic and achievable.</P>
    <P>The criticism emanating from some of the Fianna Fáil benches, and in particular from their front bench, is made without mention of an alternative.  There is no plan on the far side of the House.  Do I assume therefore that the plan, or alternative, to which they point, is <i>The Way Forward?</i> If it is, that should be said.  It should be admitted by the people who make those criticisms.  If it is <i>The Way Forward</i>, it must also be said that some questions should be raised in relation to that document, because when we assumed office two years ago we had a unique opportunity to scrutinise that plan, to examine its proposals and its financial provisions.  We found that, while there were laudable elements within that plan and while there were political and economic decisions put down on paper, there was a serious shortfall in the financial provisions that should have been made to coincide with the political decisions in that plan.  I shudder to think what would have happened if Fianna Fáil had been asked to implement that plan, as they said they would.  Where was the shortfall to come from?  There was no provision made for that shortfall, which was well in excess of £100 million.</P>
    <P>We in Government have to deal with reality.  We have set targets which are realistic and which we hope we can achieve. We must live in a real world, not in an airy, fairy world.  We must make policy decisions that have a price tag.  We must provide for the money to pay that price. We must know from where and when the necessary funds are to come.  We cannot <Col N="3035" /> indulge in ephemeral fancies, in promises or financial somersaults such as we have seen only in the past week &mdash; indeed, a series of them &mdash; when Fianna Fáil got their tails up in the media and we have found the arrogance breaking through in the form of demands for immediate relief in the taxation burden.  The following day we had a proposal to abolish water charges and restructure local authorities, implying that restructuring would bring about adequate financial resources.  We have seen the acceptance of public service pay demands.  We have heard demands to repeal, revoke and reject policies and decisions made by the Government without a shred of evidence as to where the money to meet these promises is to come from.</P>
    <P>Earlier today the Tánaiste calculated roughly and conservatively that Fianna Fáil to date have promised in excess of £500 million extra in expenditure without any concrete proposals as to where the money is to come from.  While all these promises are being made, day after day as a Government we are dragged in here and criticised for cutbacks in public expenditure.  It does not take any degree of economic expertise to know that if you call for reliefs for the taxpayer and at the same time call for extra expenditure there is something radically wrong.  Such a proposal does not work, and we have had experience of how it does not work.  We inherited an economic quagmire and the ripples of that quagmire are still lapping on our economic shores.</P>
    <P>How, for example, do Fianna Fáil view the attitude of the public at present? Their estimation of the public's intelligence must be very low.  They are insulting the public's intelligence by the way they are dishing out this erroneous false economic theory day in day out. I am quite sure the people will not fall for that again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan made the point that we were severely burdened by our tax regime. Of course we are, and in the past year every Minister has, at some time or other, made a public statement to the effect that direct and indirect taxation is <Col N="3036" /> much too high.  It is a disincentive to job creation, and Deputy Brennan is quite right in stating that.  He is also quite right to state that today we have a new poor. We all know of people who five years ago would not fall into the category of needing help from agencies who give alms.  The reason we have that position is that we found an economic morass two years ago and there is a price to be paid for applying the brakes.  If we did not apply them the only people we could look to to keep going would be the same people we say today are overburdened, and that is the taxpayer.  We may borrow money, but if we do that the loan must be serviced and again we have to go back to the taxpayer to service it either by direct input through increased personal taxation or indirect input by increased customs and excise duties or VAT or by increased PRSI contributions.  These are the only sources known to us.</P>
    <P>We have been living beyond our means.  That has become a cliché.  In a famous television speech made at the beginning of his period as Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey made the very same statement.  People felt he was telling the truth and expected him to take appropriate action.  What happened?  No effort was made by him or the Government to apply the brakes and avoid the situation we find ourselves in today.  As everyone knows, we must apply the brakes gently or we will find ourselves thrown through the windscreen.  In order to avoid a sudden deflation we applied the brakes gently, but even that is a painful exercise.</P>
    <P>The approach by the Government to seek financial rectitude has been described as an approach which is cold, lacks compassion and is monetarist.  Various other adjectives have been applied also. If anyone can tell me how to give painlessly the kind of medicine that needs to be given I would very glad to talk to that person.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland asserted that we were indulging in magic formulae.  That is a new allegation.  The one thing we cannot be accused of is dealing in magic formulae. There is no such thing.  We have repeatedly stated that but there are still <Col N="3037" /> people in the House who through their utterances would seem to suggest that there are magic formulae and easy and soft options and that if we wait long enough money will fall off the trees.  It is as if we can get £500 million by a wave of the hand.  That is the kind of irresponsible, irrelevant utterance we hear from many on the far side of the House.  We are not dealing in magic formulae but in reality.</P>
    <P>We should not dwell on the reasons for our present difficulties except to remind people that there are good reasons for the actions we must take.  It would be remiss of me if I did not, as I have done very briefly, outline the reasons for the line we are taking now.  It gives us no pleasure to do this.  However, we are saying that we have now produced a plan and I see no reason why it should not be implemented because the assumptions on which it is based we feel are sound assumptions and the only reason for not implementing this plan and reaching these targets would be if the whole world economy turned upside down &mdash; and I do not think that that will happen.  The assumptions made are reasonable and are based on sound advice which in turn is based on the retrospective ideas of people who have seen this kind of thing happen previously.</P>
    <P>We have a tax regime which is a great burden on our economy and on our people.  Deputy Brennan is quite right in stating that the semi-State bodies should be creators of wealth and not consumers of wealth, yet we have a howl of derision in the House at the whole idea of Government looking askance at any semi-State body, or indeed any body in which the State has any shareholding, when we have doubts about their performance. Let me say that I was involved in this House and dragged in here over a period of a few months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;last year in relation to a certain company in which the State had in excess of a 60 per cent holding and the <Col N="3038" /> Government decided in that case to wind up that company.  We succeeded very quickly in having that company replaced. That new company is now viable and operating successfully in the market place without any State subsidy whatever apart from the normal capital grants available to any company in this country producing a commodity.  That is the kind of company we need, a company prepared to go out and get its markets and prove its viability in the market place.  The day has long gone when the taxpayer should be asked to prop up companies whose performance leaves much to be desired and whose attitude in many cases is one of total contempt for the very people who provide the life-blood of that company, the taxpayers.  Until these companies realise that they are there to create wealth and not consume it some of them will fall by the wayside, and I do not think anybody should make an apology for saying that.</P>
      <P>I would like to deal briefly with a few matters in relation to my own Departments. Regarding forestry, let me say that I have seen in the two years I have been in office one million cubic meters of timber sold in 1983 producing £9.9 million income to the coffers of the State. This year so far up to mid-November I have seen 906,000 cubic meters sold at £12.1 million.  That is a 20 per cent increase in value terms over last year. Now we have two pulpwood using facilities in this country to which we have committed the vast bulk of our pulpwood, and I would hope that these will go from strength to strength.  There are signs that they will provide the kind of utilisation of our pulpwood that is needed badly, that is by adding value to it and exporting the final product.</P>
      <P>We have been engaged in developing our forests, and in relation to that I have seen £1.5 million spent in 1983 in roadworks through forests and £1.3 million spent this year up to last month for the same purpose.  We feel the need to provide the infrastructure for developing industry where we will have doubled our output of timber by the end of this decade, and that is only six years away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3039" /> We must prepare now for it, and that is being done.</P>
    <P>In relation to fisheries, I have seen exports for example, open to Egypt both last year and this year, and exports this year open to Nigeria and, through the efforts of the Minister of State, exports of herring to Poland.  These are achievements in the face of very severe competition from other countries whose fisheries have been seen to be developed far beyond ours.  I have seen the value of exports rise.  In 1981 we exported to the value of £54 million.  In 1983 that increased to the value of £84 million, which is the latest figure I have.  That is an increase of over 50 per cent in value terms of our fish exports.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an nGaeltacht tá áthas orm go raibh an Teach seo sásta glacadh leis an tairiscint go gcuirfí coiste Oireachtais ar bun le leathnú a dhéanamh ar úsáid na Gaeilge sa Teach seo agus sa Seanad.  Bhí díospóireacht an-mhaith sa Seanad i rith na bliana agus sa Dáil cúpla mí ó shin. Maidin inné aontaíodh an tairiscint agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an coiste á bhunú roimh an Nollaig.  Tá a lán le déanamh agus is é an fáth go bhfuil an coiste seo á bhunú ná, tá súil agam, go dtabharfaidh sé dea-shampla do mhuintir na tíre. Ceann de na gearáin atá le cloisteáil ar fud na tíre nuair atá tú ag iarraidh ar dhaoine níos mó Gaeilge a labhairt ná go ndeireann siad &ldquo;Cen fáth nach bhfuil sibh féin ag labhairt na Gaeilge; sibhse na daoine a thugann dea-shampla; sibhse na daoine a bhíonn sna páipéir chuile lá agus is sibhse na daoine atá in ann dea-shampla a thabhairt agus í a labhairt sa Dáil agus sa Seanad.&rdquo; Tá sé sin ina áit, agus tá me cinnte go mbeidh tacaíocht le fáil ó chuile thaobh den Teach i ngeall ar an chomhchoiste seo a bhunú.</P>
    <P>D'fhógraigh mé an tseachtain seo caite go mbeadh breis airgid le fáil i mbliana do mhná tí a choinníonn páistí a théann go dtí an Ghaeltacht le Gaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Seo scéim eile atá á coinneáil ar siúl ag an Roinn, mar ceapann siad go bhfuil an-tairbhe ag baint leis an scéim seo toisc go gcuireann sé labhairt na <Col N="3040" /> Gaeilge ar chumas páistí óga nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu ach mar ábhar scoile. Feiceann siad don chéad uair Gaeilge á úsáid mar theanga teaghlaigh i gnáth shaoil an duine ó mhaidin go hoíche.  Tá sé seo le feiceáil ag na gasúir agus na cailíní seo a théann go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus spreagann sé iad agus tugann sé tuiscint nua dóibh ar an Ghaeilge mar theanga agus úsáid na teanga sin sa ghnáth shaoil.  Ardaíodh an t-airgead atá ag dul do na mná tí sa scéim sin.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin rinneadh athbhreithniú ar na comharchumainn a bhí i dtrioblóid i rith na bliana agus chuir mé os cionn £30,000 ar fáil le cuidiú leis na comharchumainn a bhí i dtrioblóid.  Faoin am seo tá súil agam go bhfuil ceacht foghlamtha ag cuid acu.  Cuireadh coiste ar bun.  Chuaigh siad i gcomhairle leis na comharchumainn agus leis na bainisteoirí ansin agus leis na comhaltaí.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for granting me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment. My purpose in seeking this debate was to indicate to the House that the question is one of some importance, an importance which is beyond the numbers involved, which derives from certain principles and consequently which would indicate that very serious attention should be paid to what I am about to say on behalf of a small group of students.  I am speaking on behalf of those following a course in marine science at the Regional Technical College in Cork and on behalf also of those pursuing a radio officers' course at that institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In times gone by, before we established our independence in this part of the country, the area of Munster was a great recruiting ground for the Royal Navy and the British Merchant Navy.  Those of us who know our history will know that tragedies occurred in that area after we gained <Col N="3041" /> independence because certain people were accused of recruiting for a foreign power.  I instance this specifically to indicate to the House that people from that area of Minister have always been interested in going to sea and in learning the crafts and science of seamanship.  This has been the case for many decades. When the late Deputy Seán Lemass established Irish Shipping in 1941 he had a dream.  The dream was that there would be an Irish merchant navy which would be staffed by people trained and educated in Ireland.  That was a worth-while dream.  Regarding the first group of people about whom I am speaking, the dream became a reality in that they commenced their marine science in the regional technical college in Cork under the auspices of Irish Shipping.  As the House is aware, Irish Shipping were liquidated in the recent past by direct Government action.  That leaves these students ar an dtrá folamh because they cannot look forward to completing their studies without help from the ministry.  I notice that the Minister present is the Minister for Education but my remarks are addressed to the Minister for Communications because the students in the first group to which I am referring were funded by Irish Shipping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that in allowing this matter to be raised, only the education aspect of it is in order.  The whole question of the liquidation of Irish Shipping would not be in order.  I do not know whether that was made clear to the Deputy earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out to the Chair that it is impossible, even for a very finely honed intellect, to make any philosophic distinction between those people who are obtaining their education in the regional technical college and those who had their careers marked out for them in Irish Shipping.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede that.  I would not be able to make the distinction and consequently I crave the indulgence of the Chair to proceed briefly on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to invade the Deputy's time and I shall not do so but the question of the rights and wrongs of the liquidation of Irish Shipping is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in total agreement with the Chair.  I have not referred once to the rights and wrongs of the liquidation. I am simply talking about the plight of a group of students in the regional technical college in Cork who were studying marine science and who now find themselves without their fees.  I mentioned the Minister for Communications because the fees were in that area rather than in the area of education.  However, if the presence of the Minister for Education is an indication that her Department are undertaking to pay the fees of the students who are being financed by Irish Shipping and are undertaking responsibility for the 11 people concerned I shall be delighted.  The number is made up of seven, two and two. Regardless of which Department pay up, it is a mere bagatelle so far as those 11 students are concerned.</P>
      <P>I move now to the plight of the radio officers.  They are in a some what different position.  Members of the House, including the Minister, will have received some correspondence from them.  Their case briefly is that when they have finished their course in the RTC in Cork they must spend six months at sea.  The big difficulty is that they are not regarded as qualified until they have completed those six months.  If they do not succeed in being able to go to sea for those six months they must take the examinations again.  That is the very serious plight of these young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general opinion is that the standard achieved by these students is one of the top, if not the top, qualification in the world.  Apparently the shipping companies have been very impressed by the standard of the young people who have <Col N="3043" /> pursued these courses as they have been by the graduates in marine science.  I understand that in that part of the course which they pursue at Plymouth they emerge top of their class in terms of standard of education and commitment, a standard that was higher than the standard that could be produced in that internationally well known college at Plymouth.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the students they have been active in their own interest but in a sense they do not consider themselves as able to cope with the problem and that is why it is important to bring it before the House.  Agreement was reached last year that Irish Shipping would take these radio officers and that AnCO would pay them a token wage.  This caused some trouble with a trade union.  One can understand a trade union being concerned about having fully qualified members ready to take up jobs while students were being used and being paid at AnCO rates that would be much lower than the full pay for a radio officer.  Consequently, the union fought against the agreement.  The students felt themselves a little overpowered by the company they found themselves in, in an established trade union looking after the interests of its members in the shipping companies.  That is why this letter came to the Members of this House.  The students do not want to interfere with the livelihood of the radio officers or members of the trade union but they too have a problem now that Irish Shipping has gone.  The funding of the 11 students is a mere bagatelle, and the Minister should exert himself to have these students placed with the shipping companies that are left or to have them placed outside of shipping companies. The Irish Continental Line is in a never never land, which is the problem with the whole business.  The B &amp; I is a company which the Minister for Communications runs to a certain extent.  The companies still in operation should undertake to employ these radio officers.  They can be employed alongside older trade union members and need not necessarily cause any trade problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3044" /> I do not know if the Minister for Education's writ covers that area, but she could pass the message on to the Minister for Communications that a system should be immediately devised so that these people can be taken on by Irish Continental Lines and by B &amp; I. There is also the Belfast Ferries which is owned by an amalgam of interests, 49 per cent of it owned by the old Irish Shipping and 25 per cent of the total owned by the AIB. There is enough goodwill in the Department of Communications and in the Department of Education. These Departments with the Department of Labour could exercise themselves to get the 11 students placed in the various shipping companies. I think there will be a residual strategic Irish shipping company established which could also provide them with an opportunity for their six months' training as radio officers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dan Wallace said that he would like to get a few minutes of my time, and I will give him just that.  I have hopes that between the Department of Education and the Department of Communications these students will be seen to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing Deputy Wilson to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Unfortunately the students at the Cork Regional College, the cadets and the radio operators, are the victims of the circumstances surrounding the demise of Irish Shipping. Hardship has been caused to them over the last few weeks by the withdrawal at very short notice of the financial assistance they were getting.  I am sure both the Minister for Education and the Minister for Communications are aware of the effects on those students.  There are only 11 students involved and I am sure the Minister can provide for them without too much cost to the State.  The figure involved is about £33,000 over three years so that the 11 students can complete their training.  There are seven students in the third year class, two in the second year class and two in the first year class.  I would ask the Minister to be as sympathetic as possible in dealing with this case. <Col N="3045" /> I agree that the placing of radio officers is a bit difficult because of the points outlined by Deputy Wilson, but I would ask the Minister for Communications to have a look at this to see if they can be accommodated by B &amp; I or the Irish Continental Line to ensure that the State finance gone into sending these students to college will not be wasted.  Deputy Wilson has covered most of the points but I would ask the Minister to consider what has been said.  It is in our interests that these students would not be affected by the unfortunate events in Irish Shipping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the remarks about radio officers, I will as requested pass on the Deputy's remarks to the Minister for Communications.  I propose to deal with this matter so far as education is concerned. I will outline the provisions for nautical studies made in Cork Regional Technical College before I deal with the matter of the Irish Shipping cadets who were there.</P>
      <P>The nautical studies department in Cork Regional Technical College conducts full-time courses for cadets in marine engineering and study leave courses for serving engineers and deck officers studying for their senior certificates. In addition, short courses which are mandatory for ships' officers are provided. These include courses in radar simulator, automatic radar plotting aid, electronic navigation aids systems and survival.  The department also provide as required programmes of study for the fishing industry leading to skipper and second hand certificates.  Harbour pilots are also catered for.  Special courses in safety and survival for off-shore rig personnel are provided by the department in association with the external training division of AnCO.  Short courses in radar and chart work appreciation are provided for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. The Irish Naval Service also avails of many of the short courses in the department. Ratings are catered for with lifeboatmen and efficient hand courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years courses for marine <Col N="3046" /> engineering cadets were provided for students sponsored by Irish Shipping, the Irish Naval Service and by a number of non-Irish companies for their Irish personnel. Because of the general recession in shipping, there has been a decrease in the number of such sponsored students and, in order to ensure the continued viability of the courses and to provide alternative opportunities for young people, the national studies department in September 1982 extended the course to include provision for a National Council for Educational Awards Diploma in Plant Engineering in parallel with the previously existing NCEA Diploma in Marine Engineering.</P>
    <P>The present situation in relation to marine engineering cadets is that there are two in first year, two in second year and 12 in the third and final year.  With the exception of five Irish Naval Service ensigns in the third year, all third year students are employees of Irish Shipping Ltd.  The remainder of the 51 students in these courses are pursuing the NCEA plant engineering programme.  There are also, I understand, 16 cadets in the deck course in Plymouth.</P>
    <P>The marine engineering cadetship extends over four years and includes a period of nine months at sea in the year following completion of the college-based course.  There are at present seven other cadets who graduated in 1984 and who are now in the sea phase of their cadetship.  The position in relation to the 11 Irish Shipping cadets in the college is, I understand, that the provisional liquidator has undertaken to pay them their normal entitlements to the end of November. A similar position would apply in regard to the deck cadets in Plymouth.

      <P>1984. So far as my <Col N="3047" /> Department are concerned, the course remains in existence in the Regional Technical College in Cork.  I share the views of Deputies regarding the excellence of the course.  The cadets are free to continue with their course there.  The cadets, however, have been receiving substantial allowances from Irish Shipping Limited which it appears will now cease.</P>

      <P>In the case of the four first and second year students, it will be open to them, if they cannot be facilitated otherwise in completing their cadetships, to transfer to the plant engineering programme.  This programme is approvved for European Social Fund aid over the first two years and leads to a college certificate in engineering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of those completing their third year, the question of whether scholarships under vocational education committees could be offered to them could be considered.  The sums available to them under either the European Social Fund or the vocational scholarship scheme would be substantially less than <Col N="3048" /> they have been receiving under the terms of their cadetship with Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
    <P>My Department have been in close touch with the Department of Communications on this matter to see if there is any way in which the cadets can be assisted.  As a result of the contacts made by the Department of Communications, the Irish Chamber of Shipping has expressed interest in providing most of the cadets with the necessary sea-going experience.  This matter and the related question as to whether any arrangement is possible which would enable allowances to be paid to the cadets is being pursued actively and as a matter of urgency by the Department of Communications.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputies' concern about this matter, and I am hopeful that it may be possible to work out an arrangement which will result in the cadets on these courses being in a position to complete the theoretical studies and practical work necessary for them to secure their nautical qualifications.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 14 December 1984.</P>

      <P>The decision not to extend the electrification to Greystones was taken by my predecessor in the Fianna Fáil Government (Mr. John Wilson).  Following representations I met deputations on this subject and listened to the case put attentively.  I undertook a detailed analysis of all the factors before I endorsed my predecessor's decision.</P>
      <P>The extension would cost in excess of £9 million, and would give rise to additional losses on the rail line of the order of £1.5 million annually.  In my view these costs could not be justified, particularly in the current financial climate, and in view of the fact that adequate public transport services will continue to be provided to Greystones.  I have no plans to review the matter.</P>

      <P>On the current side CIE borrowed £14.32 million in 1983.  The board's total temporary borrowings now stand at £36.19 million.  The Government recently decided to provide assistance for CIE in relation to the board's temporary borrowings. As a result CIE will be authorised to convert £30 million of their temporary borrowings into a loan to be redeemed over ten years by an Exchequer provision of £3 million per year commencing in 1985.  CIE will be required to meet the interest charges on the loan and to eliminate the balance of £6.19 million from their own resources.  This will improve considerably CIE's financial position by easing substantially the financial pressures on the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The criteria used in assessing standards for safety in CIE trains are determined by CIE.  The board's principal safety rules and regulations are contained in the CIE rule book, the regulations for train signalling, the working timetable and its appendix, the locomotive drivers' manual, periodic operating notices, the weekly circular and the working instructions for electrified lines.  These documents are up-dated and amended by CIE from time to time to take cognisance of changes in work practices and working conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by CIE that their safety rules and regulations are in accordance with international standards and that implementation is monitored on a daily basis by area inspectors who travel on trains and locomotives.  CIE have also informed me that all train crews and signalmen must be certified by a senior officer of the railway as competent to perform their duties and are re-examined in the rules and regulations proper to their duties on an annual basis.  In general, the methods of railway operation are not covered by statutory regulations. My Department's statutory functions regarding rail safety are mainly related to the investigation of rail accidents and <Col N="2663" /> to the inspection by the Department's railway inspecting officer of new or reconstructed railway installations.</P>
    <P>As regards overcrowding on the 5.30 p.m. Dublin/Dundalk train, I am informed by CIE that the provision of seats for all passengers is not a feature of commuter working and that whilst there is no evidence of serious overcrowding of that train, the number of passengers offering may at times exceed seating accommodation. The board has indicated that crush loading conditions only arise when there is a disruption of services for some untoward reason.  They are satisfied that the rolling stock in such circumstances is capable of withstanding loads likely to be imposed.  The board regrets that such conditions cause discomfort but are satisfied that they do not carry a safety risk.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the electrified rail services between Howth and Bray in July 1984 rolling stock previously used on that line is now being used to provide additional capacity on other routes, including the service in question to Dundalk.</P>

      <P>Up to April 1982 applications for road freight licences received by my Department in respect of Bulgarian vehicles were relatively infrequent.  Since April 1982 a total of 669 licences have been issued in respect of such vehicles. Almost all of these licences were issued for one journey only with an average period of validity of nine days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These licences were subject to the standard general conditions applied to import/export road freight licences, a copy of which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report.  In addition, in <Col N="2664" /> the case of the licences issued since mid-March 1984 in respect of Bulgarian vehicles a special condition has been included restricting them to specified export traffic.  I shall be keeping the situation under review.</P>
    <P>Following is the document referred to:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Conditions</P>
    <P>1.  The vehicle specified herein may be used for the carriage of goods for reward to or from the State from or to destinations outside the State.  Whilst in the State, the vehicle must not be used for the picking up of goods for the carriage to another point in the State.</P>
    <P>2.  Where the Minister for Communications is satisfied that the vehicle specified herein has been used for the carriage of goods otherwise than as specified herein or in contravention of these conditions this licence and any other licence issued under Section 8 of the Road Transport Act, 1971, to the person named in this licence will be subject to revocation.</P>
    <P>3.  This licence is issued by the Minister for Communications by whom it may be at any time revoked and to whom it must be surrendered on demand.</P>
    <P>4.  This licence applies only to the vehicle and person specified in it.  It is not transferable on change of ownership of the vehicle nor may it be transferred to another vehicle owned by the person specified in the licence.</P>
    <P>5.  This licence is subject to compliance by the licensee with the law for the time being in force in relation to the importation of mechanically propelled vehicles and, in particular, to the payment of the duties of customs (if any) chargeable on such importation.</P>
    <P>6.  This licence is subject to compliance by the licensee with the requirements of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and any other Act amending or extending that Act.</P>
    <P>7.  This licence must be carried in the vehicle to which it relates and must be produced on request to any Officer <Col N="2665" /> of Customs and Excise or to any member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>8.  This licence must be returned to the Department of Communications, Kildare Street, Dublin 2 not later than two weeks after the date on which it expires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 77 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the affairs of Irish Shipping Limited are now in the hands of a liquidator appointed by Order of the High Court.  It is a matter for the liquidator to deal with the assets of Irish Shipping Limited to the best advantage and to settle with unsecured creditors. The company's assets includes its 75 per cent shareholding in Oceanbank Developments Limited which owns Irish Continental Line and Belfast Car Ferries.  I have no direct function in the matter and it would be quite improper for me to intervene in or comment on the affairs of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 30 November 1984, officials of my Department met the liquidator at his <Col N="2672" /> request.  He explained that the group of Hong Kong shipowners who recently visited Dublin had asked him to deliver a memorandum containing certain proposals for the financial restructuring of Irish Shipping Limited, purportedly on behalf of all the major unsecured creditors. Subsequently, I understand, the proposals in question were disowned by certain major creditors who were not members of the shipowners' group.  The liquidator was informed by my Department that the Government had already made its decision in relation to Irish Shipping Limited, that the Government's position was that Exchequer support for the company over and above that agreed by the Government in February last was not forthcoming but that the Government would, of course, discharge the State's responsibilities in respect of those of the company's liabilities which are guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>My Department is actively engaged in pursuing the possibilities of having US Customs/Immigration pre-clearance facilities located at Shannon. As I indicated in reply to a parliamentary question on 5 June 1984, the question of introducing such facilities at Shannon was the subject of a meeting between United States and Irish delegations in Washington on 17-18 April 1984.  It was envisaged at that time that further contacts between the United States and Irish authorities would take place at the end of the 1984 summer season.  These contacts are being pursued.  Pending the outcome of these contacts, it is not possible to assess the prospects for the establishment of pre-clearance facilities at Shannon.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 98 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy has in mind the measures taken by Customs and Excise Officers to detect and secure evidence of evasion by licensed bookmakers of the excise duty on off-course betting. As part of the day-to-day administration of the duty, officers of Customs and Excise operate regular controls and measures designed, <i>inter alia</i>, to detect evasion of the duty by licensed bookmakers and they also carry out investigations to detect cases of unlicensed bookmaking. The total cost of administering and collecting the duty in 1983 was of the order of £0.76 million.</P>
      <P>The number of convictions obtained in 1983 in connection with betting duty irregularities and unlicensed bookmaking offences was 26.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the measures used by officers to curb or detect evasion of the duty are necessary to protect the revenue and I am satisfied that these measures are acceptable.</P>
      <P>There is provision for payment of rewards for information relating to excise offences.  However, it is not considered to be in the public interest to disclose details in this regard.</P>

Provisions of that nature should be contained in the general law relating to marriage and they would then apply automatically for tax purposes.  If the Deputy has in mind any particular case which he wishes to bring to my attention I will have the matter investigated.</P>
      <P>Revenue records do not distinguish persons who have remarried from other married persons.  Statistics are not available which would enable the information sought by the Deputy at (a) and (b) of the second question to be provided.</P>

      <P>The vast majority of proceedings for failure to make tax returns are taken in the District Court in respect of PAYE and VAT returns.  These cases are expedited without undue delay at present and there are no proposals at this time for the establishment of extra courts to hear such cases.  In Chapter 6 of the Plan the Government have pledged a more determined approach to dealing with cases where information that is statutorily required for tax assessment purposes has <Col N="2681" /> not been supplied.  The adequacy of arrangements in the courts will be kept under review in the context of this commitment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he agrees that the VAT on point of entry on all goods being imported into this country is contributing to the closure and liquidation of a large number of firms, if he realises that many firms cannot import spare parts for storage here because of this tax until such time as existing stocks have been sold and paid for resulting in long delays for firms being able to supply their customers, particularly small firms, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I accept that the VAT at point of entry system, introduced in 1982, can create problems for industry and business generally. The Government are, however, committed to resolving these problems as soon as possible.  The exemption for raw materials imported by exporting firms, which I introduced in 1983, has been of considerable assistance in this regard. The VAT at imports system has no direct bearing on the cost of maintaining stocks as VAT on business inputs is generally deductible in the VAT return for the period during which stocks were imported, irrespective of when the goods are subsequently sold.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the reason Ireland has not taken up grants available from the EC funds during the last two years; and if he will give details regarding the actual loss in money terms to the country as a whole, and in particular to the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question relates to the difference between commitments entered into by the Community in respect of Ireland and the payments received.  The following tabular statement, which I propose to circulate in the Official Report, shows the commitments and the receipts for each of the main funds concerned, that is, the Regional Fund, the Social Fund, and the FEOGA guidance section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of each of the three funds for which figures are shown in the tabular statement, the amounts received are somewhat lower than the commitments entered into.  The difference arises because the commitments relate to multi-annual programmes and projects, and <Col N="2683" /> payments are phased over the life of these operations according as expenditure is incurred.  Accordingly a certain amount of payments will normally be outstanding.</P>
    <P>In the case of the European Regional Development Fund, the table shows that, while total commitments amounted to IR£75.6 million in 1982, receipts in the same year totalled IR£64.7 million.  The corresponding figures in 1983 were IR£74.3 million and IR£56.0 million, the latter figure being artificially low because a payment of £9.3 million proper to 1983 was not received until 5 January 1984. The balance of the commitments entered into in both years is expected to be fully drawn down by 1985.  Thus, there is no question of any loss arising to the country. As regards projects in the west, receipts from the Regional Fund are not paid to individual projects but are used to increase the overall level of resources available for regional development through the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>In the case of the European Social Fund, the gap between the commitments entered into and the payments received (IR£14.6 million in 1982 and IR£48.2 million in 1983) will, it is expected, be almost completely drawn down by June 1985. Again, there is no question of a loss of money.  Applications for Social Fund assistance are made on the basis of nationwide programmes and are not distinguished by region.  Accordingly no separate figures are available in respect of the west or any other individual region.</P>
    <P>In relation to the FEOGA Guidance Section the table shows that commitments entered into in 1982 amounted to IR£68 million while receipts in that year totalled IR£60 million.  The corresponding figures in 1983 were IR£67 million and IR£64 million.  The balance of the commitments entered into in those years in respect of Exchequer-financed projects will be fully drawn down according as the work is completed.  This satisfactory rate of drawdown applies to the country generally, including the west.</P>

Apart from the FEOGA Guarantee <Col N="2685" /> Section, which finances the various agricultural price support mechanisms and from which Ireland is a major beneficiary, the main funds concerned are the Regional Fund, the Social Fund, and the FEOGA Guidance Section.  Ireland's proportion of Community GDP is under 1 per cent.  By comparison, our shares of the main EC funds are as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Since 1980 Ireland's quota under the European Regional Development Fund has been 5.94 per cent.</P>
      <P>&mdash;In the case of the Social Fund the amount approved for Ireland represented 9.7 per cent of the total Fund in 1983 and is expected to be over 11 per cent in 1984.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in-date cheques are returned uncashed to employers for three main reasons: the cheque has been incorrectly completed or there is insufficient information to bring the cheque to account; the employer has not yet applied to be registered for PAYE/PRSI; the cheque relates to a period which has been referred to the sheriff or county registrar for collection.  Post-dated cheques are not usually accepted by the Collector-General without prior arrangement.

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not intended to increase the overall number of customs and excise officials specifically to deal with the illegal importation of drugs.  As I informed the House on 28 June 1984 in response to a number of questions concerning the illegal <Col N="2690" /> importation of drugs and on 15 November 1984 when speaking on the second report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, it is the responsibility of all officers of customs and excise employed at points of entry to the State to be on the alert to detect drug smuggling and consequently all such officers receive training in the identification and detection of drugs and staff at entry points have been issued with the most modern drug identification equipment available.</P>
      <P>The Customs Investigation Branch already plays a key role in combating illegal drug smuggling and it combines with local staff as necessary in making seizures.  A higher officer and an officer from this branch are specifically assigned to the task of maintaining liaison with the Garda and with enforcement agencies in many other countries and for the gathering and use of intelligence concerning illegal drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are, of course, aware of the new regulation governing the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present my Department is engaged in an examination of the regulation with a view to deciding how best to respond to the various new provisions which it contains in order to ensure that Ireland secures the maximum benefit from the <Col N="2691" /> fund.  The terms of the new fund regulation differ considerably from those of the existing regulation and I am not in a position at this stage to make a comprehensive statement on the lines requested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>However, I would draw attention to the major change involved.  Under the new regulation the existing system of national quotas from the European Regional Development Fund is replaced by a scheme of indicative brackets which stipulate a minimum and a maximum share of the fund for each member state. As a result of considerable pressure exerted by Ireland in the negotiations on the new regulation, it was accepted that in Ireland's case the guaranteed minimum of the range &mdash; 5.64 per cent of the total fund &mdash; would correspond to Ireland's guaranteed share of the fund under the present quota system.  In addition, the top of the range will give Ireland the opportunity to bring its potential maximum share to 6.83 per cent of the fund.</P>
    <P>As regards integrated development <Col N="2692" /> operations, I would repeat what I have said in reply to a number of earlier questions on this subject that for a number of sound practical reasons I have considerable reservations about the introduction of these operations for limited geographical areas of the country particularly since Ireland is treated as a single region for purposes of Community regional policy. I would also point out that the new regulation does not provide for any enhanced rate of grant from the Regional Fund for these operations.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that VAT repayments on farm development projects are not being withheld.  I understand that there are generally no excessive delays in making VAT repayments where claims are properly completed and documented.</P>
      <P>Under the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 17) Order, 1984, claims for refund may be made only in respect of outlay involving a total amount of tax of more than £100.  Since the making of the order, 77 claims for sums of £100 or less, involving a total amount of £4,971, have been received.  The £100 limit was introduced with a view to containing the significant increase in numbers of claims, expected as a result of the removal of the grant aid certificate requirement, so as to make the best use of available staff resources.  Claimants will be individually informed that such claims may be resubmitted when eligible claims totalling more than £100 are available.</P>

    <P>Claims for repayment of VAT are normally repaid within three weeks of their receipt by the Collector-General provided that the claims are in order and that the traders' tax affairs are up to date. More than 50 per cent of claims are, in fact, repaid within eight to 12 days of <Col N="2696" /> receipt.  However, the Revenue Commissioners reserve the right to refer any claim to the inspector of taxes for audit and, where this occurs, there is liable to be some delay in making repayment. Statistics relating to VAT repayment claims are not compiled in such a manner as to enable a classification of amounts due to various taxpayers to be provided.</P>

At about 10.30 a.m. on the day in question Mr. O'Hehir and an NBC crew arrived at the Rock without having made any prior arrangements for filming.  They were informed by the head guide that written permission to film there was required.  The manager of the film crew accepted the need for such permission having regard to his experience in filming in various parts of the world. Mr. O'Hehir, however, expressed annoyance at the position and left the Rock.  In the meantime the head guide set about getting oral clearance for the filming and this was given within one hour of the NBC crew arriving on the Rock.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to alter the existing instructions to the head guide in relation to filming at the Rock of Cashel.  Prior written permission from the Commissioners of Public Works will continue to be a requirement to ensure orderly management of the national monument and to avoid its being used for unsuitable purposes.  I am satisfied that the head guide will continue to use his discretion in the matter of recommending approval should such unusual circumstances arise again.</P>
      <P>The final word in this matter should be left to NBC's European director who was quoted in a Sunday newspaper on 2 September as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 to 157, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, was not specifically restored for use as a conference centre.  The Government approved in principle proposals for the provision at the Royal Hospital of conference facilities suitable for EEC and other international requirements, in August 1978.  The proposals involved (1) the restoration of the Royal Hospital and (2) the provision of a new conference building in the hospital grounds.  Proposals for (2) were deferred in 1981 due to the costs involved.</P>
      <P>Final accounts for the restoration works are not yet available but it is estimated that the final cost will be in the region of £20 million.  The Government announced their decision on the future use of the premises on 26 November 1984.  Details were given by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach in reply to a question answered on 27 November 1984.  The uses decided upon followed consideration of the matter by a special inter-departmental committee set up for that purpose under his chairmanship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements are being made to put the decisions into effect.  It is not possible <Col N="2704" /> at this stage to give an exact date by which the necessary preparatory works and other arrangements will be complete. Some use has already been made of the north wing for conference purposes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific points raised in Question No. 155 the position is as follows:</P>
    <P>1.  The cost of routine maintenance to the premises from January 1973 to July 1980, when the contract for the restoration scheme was placed, amounted to £13,500 approximately.</P>
    <P>2.  The restoration work to the main hospital building has been completed.</P>
    <P>3.  The estimated annual cost of maintenance of the building in use, would be about £100,000 including heating, lighting and cleaning.</P>
    <P>4.  With regard to the use of the premises, I have stated the position already in this reply.</P>
    <P>5.  The building, consisting of approximately 90,000 sq. ft. is quadrangular in shape, enclosing a spacious courtyard.  The north wing is the most impressive one and contains the Chapel, Great Hall and Master's Quarters, with dining and kitchen facilities in the basement.  The remaining three wings are three stories in height and contain 73 rooms, with wide corridors on both the first and second floor levels.  Modern services, such as, heating, lighting, lifts, fire alarm and toilet facilities have been incorporated in the building.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165, 166 and 167 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Government decided, in October 1982, that a review of arterial drainage policy should be carried out so as to ensure that satisfactory returns from investments in this area would be achieved.  Pending the outcome of the review and the Government's decision on future policy, arterial drainage could not be dealt with separately, by way of the national plan.</P>
      <P>Work on the design of a drainage scheme for the Mulcair catchment has been suspended since February 1983, following a Government decision to halt all arterial drainage planning pending completion of the review.  The review, prepared by the Commissioners of Public Works, is being considered by the Department of Finance prior to submission of proposals to the Government. Pending the Government's decision, I am not in a position to say when a scheme for the Mulcair catchment might be sanctioned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204, 205 and 206 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware of the situation regarding drug abuse in the Dún Laoghaire area.  In recent months I have met with representatives of statutory and voluntary groups from the area to discuss the problem.  The position is that the Eastern Health Board employ two drug abuse counsellors full time in the Dún <Col N="2716" /> Laoghaire area who are engaged in counselling and research work.  When the new major £600,000 health centre is ready in mid-1985 at Loughlinstown in the borough area and when the extension to the Shankill health centre is completed additional physical facilities will be available for these services.  I am arranging for discussions between my Department and the Eastern Health Board on the question of incorporating emergency medical facilities for drug addicts into the new out-patient department planned for St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown.</P>
    <P>I have recently indicated to the Dún Laoghaire branch of the National Federation, Community Action on Drugs, that I am prepared to consider favourably any submission which they may wish to make to me on the provision of further services to people with drug-related problems and their families on the understanding, of course, that such services are provided in a co-ordinated professional manner through the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>With regard to the need for further services, the Special Government Task Force on Drug Abuse recognised that reliable information on the drug problem in Dún Laoghaire would be necessary to facilitate the planning of intervention strategies.  Accordingly they recommended that a detailed survey should be carried out in the area.  The Medico-Social Research Board have carried out such a study and I am having it examined in detail at the moment but the following quotation from it points to the fact that efforts to combat this problem have not been in vain:</P>
    <P>While these percentages (of drug usage) are sufficient to indicate that the area has a serious problem with at least one addictive and highly dangerous illicit drug, namely heroin, they fall well short of the corresponding 10 per cent in the same age range reported in the North Central Dublin area study (Bradshaw 1983).  This finding offers some hope that intensive local efforts, over the past year and a half, to counter experimentation with dangerous drugs among the young have not gone in <Col N="2717" /> vain.  The vast majority of young people in the area studied would seem to have accepted the fact that heroin, at least, is one drug that cannot be played with lightly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the greater Dublin area, a range of specialised facilities is available to people with drug-related problems in addition to the services provided generally by the health and social services.  The specialised facilities include:</P>
    <P>&mdash; Jervis Street Drug Advisory and Treatment Centre which provides a 24 hour, seven day week out-patient and advisory service for drug abusers and a nine bed detoxification unit.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Coolemine Therapeutic Community provides a city centre referral service and residential services in Coolemine Lodge, Clonsilla, and St. Martha's College, Navan.</P>
    <P>The Coolemine community have just recently received my approval to the establishment of a drop-in facility for young people in the Dún Laoghaire area. This service will commence next year and I am providing specific funds through the Eastern Health Board, for it.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The Rutland Centre, Templeogue, provides services for drug abusers. The Eastern Health Board are involved in out-reach and counselling services at Donore Avenue and Sherrard Street in the inner city.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The health board also provide counselling services at Usher's Island and in four community care areas.  The board, with my approval, intend to expand the service to other community care areas.</P>
    <P>The number of places available for detoxification will be increased on the recommendation of the task force.  My Department have completed discussions with the authorities of Jervis Street Hospital concerning the provision of replacement accommodation in larger city centre premises for the walk-in drug advisory and treatment centre.  This will <Col N="2718" /> be provided in the immediate future.  In the meantime I made a capital grant available to Jervis Street Hospital which has facilitated the provision of more space for patient care in the drug advisory and treatment centre there.</P>
    <P>I have made funds available to the Eastern Health Board to provide larger alternative accommodation for the Talbot day centre, at present in Sherrard Street.  The new accommodation will enable the centre to provide a greater range of services for people with drug-related problems.</P>
    <P>I also made additional funds available through the health board last year to enable the Coolemine Therapeutic Community to expand its range of services and in addition to the Dún Laoghaire project the community will develop its project at the Lord Edward Street induction centre in 1985.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that I am in the process of reorganising the Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse.  I have sought representation from members of the Dún Laoghaire Community Action on Drugs, National Federation, and I am happy to say that they have agreed to serve on the new committee.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked if I would consider the advisability of recommending the extension of the powers of the Offences Against the State Act to cover drug pushing.  The task force decided against recommending that drug pushing should be brought within the ambit of the Offences Against the State Act.  Instead they recommended a strengthening of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, and a change in court procedures which would involve the assignment of responsibility for all cases involving drug offences in the Dublin area to one judge of the Circuit Court and one district justice.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I recently introduced an order bringing the various provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, into operation.  This Act provides for an increase in the maximum prison sentence for a convicted drug pusher from 14 years to life imprisonment, an increase (fourfold in most cases) in the maximum monetary penalties which can <Col N="2719" /> be imposed on summary conviction and the removal of the penalty limit for serious indictable offences such as drug-pushing. I would like to assure the Deputy that the recommendation about the change in court procedures is currently being pursued with the appropriate authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 236 to 240, inclusive, together.  Blind pension is payable on similar lines to non-contributory old age pension except that blind pension is payable from age 18.  The means test for these pensions is essentially the same but in the case of blind persons there is an additional provision that portion of their earnings may be <Col N="2727" /> disregarded in assessing means.  The amounts of earnings at present disregarded in the case of blind persons were fixed in April 1980 and the question of increases in those amounts is something which would arise in the context of the budget.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the representations made recently by the Irish Association for the Blind seeking very substantial increases in the amount of earnings disregarded in the case of blind persons. The whole area of social assistance provision for disabled persons generally is something which the Commission on Social Welfare will be examining and I would be reluctant, pending the results of this examination, to introduce a major change on the lines proposed which would have implications for other social assistance schemes.  While I have no proposals at present to increase the amounts disregarded, I will however be taking account of the submission from the association in any future review of the conditions for entitlement to blind pension.</P>
      <P>The Department do not maintain information on administration costs for the individual social assistance schemes, nor is there any breakdown of administration costs generally as between the cost of processing claims, means investigation and effecting payments.  The information sought in relation to the cost of means testing applicants for blind pension is therefore not available.</P>

      <P>A total of 1,434 cases were detected in 1983 where claimants to unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit were found to be working while signing for unemployment payments. In all of these cases action was taken to recover the amount of benefit or assistance overpaid to the claimant and where there was sufficient evidence to support prosecution, legal proceedings were instigated.  A number of these cases have already been determined by the courts while more cases are pending.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 10 May 1984, following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work. She appealed against the disallowance and was examined on 28 June 1984 by a different medical referee who also considered her to be capable of work.  Her case has been referred to an appeals officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing. She will be notified of the time and place of the hearing as soon as the arrangements have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 and 245 together.  The national fuel scheme which was introduced in 1980 was designed to provide on a uniform basis for all persons throughout the State who are unable to supply their heating needs from their own resources.  The scheme covers mainly social welfare pensioners living alone or with dependants and payment under the scheme depends on a means test.  Urban fuel schemes have existed since 1942 in certain cities and towns, including Dublin.  Payment under these schemes is automatic for certain categories resident in the areas concerned. These schemes with their separate and more favourable qualifying conditions were retained when the national fuel scheme was introduced in 1980.</P>
      <P>Rationalisation of the fuel schemes and their merging into one scheme would involve either the removal of entitlement to free fuel from certain categories who have entitlements under the urban fuel schemes or alternatively an extension of the categories at present eligible under the national scheme with a consequential considerable increase in expenditure. The merging of the schemes has considerable financial implications and is at present under consideration.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that by failing to furnish details of his means he failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit.  He appealed against this decision and he was given a further opportunity to disclose his means.  The <Col N="2730" /> appeals officer also decided that he failed to furnish details of his means, and he was informed accordingly.  I am satisfied that the applicant was given a reasonable opportunity of co-operating in the investigation of his means and did not do so and that the decisions of the deciding officer and the appeals officer were made in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The examination by medical referees of claimants receiving disability benefit is an integral part of the continuing process of control in the administration of that scheme.  In cases where claimants or their doctors state that they are awaiting specialist, operative or other procedures, the medical referee takes this into account before giving his opinion as to whether the person is capable of work in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Where a medical referee finds a beneficiary capable of work it is normal practice to discontinue payment of benefit.  If the person appeals against the decision to discontinue payment of benefit a further medical opinion is sought from a different medical referee.  If the second medical referee is of the opinion that the person is incapable of work, benefit is restored from the date on which it was discontinued. Otherwise the case is submitted to an appeals officer for consideration and decision.  Where, however, a claimant submits medical evidence of having entered hospital for any purpose whatever, while a case is under appeal, payment of benefit is restored for the period during which he remains in hospital.</P>
      <P>In relation to the application of the foregoing arrangements cases awaiting orthopaedic surgery are not treated any differently to the generality of cases.</P>

      <P>It was announced in the National Plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> that the Government, in line with the commitment given in the Programme for Government, intend to publish a framework for a national pension plan.  As stated in the Plan the proposals will take account of views contained in the Green Papers entitled <i>A National Income-related Pension Scheme</i> and <i>Social Insurance for the Self-employed</i> which have already been published.</P>
      <P>The question of extending social insurance coverage for pensions to the self-employed will be covered, as well as the standard of income which might be considered reasonable and acceptable for pensioners and the extent to which the community is prepared to commit resources to meet the additional costs that will be involved.</P>
      <P>As soon as the details of the framework have been approved by the Government, it will be published without delay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics are not kept of the average length of time taken to process appeals under the various social welfare schemes. There has, however, been in recent months a large volume of appeals in relation to unemployment assistance by small holders whose entitlements have been <Col N="2734" /> reduced on the change from the notional system of assessment to a factual system. In many of these cases it has been necessary to arrange for a further investigation by a social welfare officer arising from the contentions put forward by the person making the appeal.  While cases not involving further investigation can be dealt with relatively quickly, delays may occur in those cases where further investigations are required.  Every effort is being made to deal with these cases as quickly as possible and the situation in this regard should be considerably improved over the coming months.</P>

      <P>Changes to the various means tests applied by the Department and by other state agencies would be dependent to a large degree on a rationalisation of the various schemes in respect of which the means tests are operated.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare established in August 1983 has a mandate to review and report by August 1985 on all aspects of the social welfare system and related social services and to make recommendations for their development having regard to the needs of modern Irish society.</P>
      <P>Rationalisation of the means testing would be a large and complicated task which could only be fruitfully undertaken when the proposals from the Commission on the various assistance schemes are to hand.</P>
      <P>Interaction between the various agencies involved including interaction between their computerised services would, of course, be a factor to be considered in rationalising the various means tests.  Computer developments at present taking place in the Department are being designed in such a way as to open up the possibilities of facilities of this nature should they be considered necessary or desirable.  They will have to await computerisation of the various assistance schemes in the Department, a process which will take several more years to complete.</P>

This review will involve discussions with the banking institutions and An Post who are involved in the payment of various social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The review is particularly relevant at the present time as the Department is undertaking a large programme of computerising its major payment areas. Arrangements are being made to ensure that its new systems will be able to avail of the most modern methods of payment including electronic fund transfer.

      <P>The only major schemes at present operated by the Department's local offices are the unemployment benefit and assistance payments and decisions in relation to these schemes are made in most cases by locally based deciding officers.  Decisions which are referred to headquarters are those of a complex nature relating mainly to means-testing and cases of doubtful entitlement to benefit.  There has been a programme underway for some time to devolve as <Col N="2742" /> many of these decisions as possible to local employment exchanges and considerable progress has been made in relation to certain large exchanges in Dublin and Cork.  This process, however, does impose an extra burden on the offices concerned which are already heavily burdened with their current workload. Extension of the process will be made to other exchanges as circumstances permit.</P>
      <P>Formal decisions on claims under the Department's remaining schemes for pensions, benefits, assistance and allowances are made by statutorily appointed deciding officers in the Department's headquarters in Dublin.  In many cases decisions are based on the reports of local officers who interview the claimants in their own homes or in the local offices.  This arrangement is designed to provide advantages relating to impartiality and a degree of uniformity on the part of deciding officers in addition to certain economies of administration. No changes are planned in these arrangements in the near future.</P>
      <P>Because of the complexity of the various schemes and the necessary interaction between them, local offices could not be expected to deal with all the schemes in advance of computerisation of their operations.  While computerisation is being planned for, it will not be available to the local offices for some considerable time.  Nevertheless, visual display terminals linked to the Department's computers have been installed in a number of local information offices to provide a rapid inquiry service in relation to disability benefit claims and other services as they become computerised.  It is intended to extend this inquiry service as quickly as resources allow.</P>

      <P>A claimant for a social welfare payment of benefit or assistance who does not obtain his payment immediately may apply for a supplementary welfare allowance to meet his needs until payment commences.  Every effort has been and is being made in my Department to eliminate delays but the high volume of claims, particularly unemployment claims, combined with the effects of the Government staff embargo has inevitably meant that the time taken to deal with these claims has increased and a higher number of persons may therefore have to avail themselves of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme while their claims are being decided.</P>
      <P>This situation has created administrative difficulties for health boards both in dealing with the increased claim load and in implementing the arrangements whereby the amount of supplementary welfare allowance paid as an interim measure is recouped by my Department. There is no evidence however that the finances of health boards are being seriously affected and the recoupment arrangements are in general operating satisfactorily.</P>

A routine review of the continuing entitlement to the payment of the allowance is accordingly an ongoing feature of the administration of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">

      <P>Applicants for social welfare non-contributory pensions and related allowances are given formal notifications of the decision in their cases which give details of how the rate of entitlement is made up.  Where means have been assessed, the amount of means is given together with the sources from which the means are obtained.</P>
      <P>In the case of unemployment assistance applicants, the person is normally furnished with a qualification certificate setting out his total means assessments. Those who require additional information can generally have it by inquiring at their local office or by writing to the Department.  Because of certain difficulties which arose in the changeover of smallholders from a notional to a factual method of means assessment, arrangements were made earlier this year to have all such small holders informed of the gross income assessed and the gross expenditure figures from which the net income is derived which is the basis of the means assessed against them.</P>
      <P>The provision of more detailed information would, because of staffing constraints arising from Government policy in relation to the reduction of numbers in the public service, create serious problems. Staff are finding it difficult to cope with increasing workloads and because of the very large numbers involved, the preparation of additional information in each case could only result, in present circumstances, in further delays in the processing of claims.</P>

    <P>disabled persons maintenance allowance, infectious diseases maintenance <Col N="2750" /> allowance, blind welfare allowance and domiciliary care allowance for handicapped children.</P>
    <P>These are the same categories who benefited from a Christmas double-payment in each of the last four years 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983.  In all some 414,000 persons benefit from the extra payment at a cost to the Exchequer of some £20 million.</P>
    <P>As in previous years no provision was made in the original Social Welfare Estimate for the double-payment at Christmas.  The necessary provision had therefore to be found within the Government's overall spending targets for 1984 and the maximum amount that was available was some £20 million.  It would not be possible to dispense it strictly on the basis of financial need without having an across the board means test for all recipients.  It was necessary therefore to choose in terms of broad categories of recipients and the Government decided to give the double-payment to those who benefited in past years i.e. pensioners and those in receipt of equivalent payments.</P>
    <P>The extra cost of giving a double payment to receipients of unemployment benefit and assistance would be about £11 million.  Those on long term unemployment assistance had received in October 1983 a special 5 per cent increase in their payments and in July of this year a further 1 per cent increase above the general level of increase for social welfare beneficiaries. Those special increases are equivalent to an extra weeks payments to those on long term unemployment assistance. As regards unemployment benefit pay-related benefit in many cases provides a high overall level of payment.</P>

      <P>The person concerned <Col N="2752" /> claimed injury benefit from 20 August 1984 in respect of an incapacity resulting from an alleged accident at work on 19 January 1984.</P>
      <P>Pending examination of the claim he was allowed disability benefit on an interim basis from 24 August 1984 the fourth day of certified incapacity.</P>
      <P>There was a delay in payment in respect of the period 27 August to 4 October due to difficulties in clarifying the amount of supplementary welfare allowance advanced by the Western Health Board which was recoverable from the benefit due.  Disability benefit amounting to £546.25 in respect of the period from 27 August to 4 October was withheld and refunded to the health board.</P>
      <P>Disability benefit has been paid regularly on receipt of medical certificates in respect of the period since 5 October.  A deduction of £4.91 a week is being made from his benefit of £104.75 leaving a balance in payment of £99.84 a week.  A balance of supplementary welfare allowance advanced is being recovered by means of the deductions.</P>
      <P>Injury benefit is statutorily confined to a maximum period of 26 weeks from the date of the accident.</P>
      <P>The claim to injury benefit was therefore rejected on the grounds that the period of certified incapacity (from 20 August) was outside the injury benefit period, which ended on 18 July.</P>

On the marketing side, I would expect some improvements as the impact of the levy is felt in other member states and as the effects of the international recession decline.

      <P>The decisions to increase the co-responsibility levy on milk and to introduce a quota system in the Community milk sector were taken by the Council of Agriculture Ministers during the farm price negotiations earlier this year.  They were part of a general package deal with rising expenditure and structural surpluses on a number of agricultural markets.</P>
      <P>In the milk sector failure to contain production would in a short period have threatened the viability of the whole market system with very serious consequences for dairy farmers throughout the Community.  The super-levy system was seen as the most effective way of tackling the problem.  The Deputy will be aware that the agreement eventually reached took special account of Ireland's particular situation with regard to dairying.  The general co-responsibility levy was increased to help offset the rising budgetary costs of the milk policy and, in particular, to take account of the fact that the quotas fixed for 1984-85 were generally higher than those for future years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 300 and 301 together.  In the fertiliser year ended 30 June 1984, 360 samples were taken by eight authorised officers and analysed in the State Laboratory.  Seventy-three of the samples were found to be at variance with the statutory standards.  Discussions have taken place on the subject with the IFA and fertiliser manufacturers.  The position regarding composition, sampling and analysis is being examined by my Department in consultation with the State Laboratory and further discussions with the producer and trade interests are envisaged.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 311 and 312 together.  The overall acreage of vegetables for sale on the fresh market has increased steadily in recent years but certain individual crops, notably early tomatoes and onions, have declined in the face of competition from imports. There is scope for recovery in these areas and also for further expansion of other crops such as carrots and cauliflowers to meet the increasing market demand over a longer season.  In the industry as a whole there is an urgent need for greater organisation to meet modern market conditions with emphasis on providing high-quality produce in continuous supply over an extended season.  This would enable the industry to meet the increasing pressure of competition from imports and to develop its full potential.</P>
      <P>The question of organising the marketing of vegetables is primarily a matter for the industry itself but a number of initiatives in this direction are being taken by the sections of my Department which deal with horticultural matters.  For example, financial aid is being provided towards the employment of a market coordinator by the glasshouse industry.  Aid is also available towards the formation of producer groups in the vegetable sector. The horticultural development group is advising on the development prospects, and the inter-departmental committee on food imports has pinpointed the import substitution possibilities for vegetables.  I would like to see the horticultural industry responding with a greater degree of urgency to the opportunities presented by these various measures.</P>

    <P>Imports of fresh vegetables of the type grown in this country dropped from 124,000 tonnes in 1982 to 69,000 in 1983, the main reduction being in potatoes. Efforts are being continued by my Department, An Foras Talúntais and An Comhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta (ACOT) in conjunction with the growers' organisations to seek ways of further reducing imports by the application of new production technology and the <Col N="2766" /> improvement of marketing arrangements. Imports of apples, the main fruit grown in this country, continue to increase.  Progress in this area will be slower as it would require the plantation of new orchards which take some years to reach commercial production.</P>
    <P>The precise opportunities for import substitution have been identified in the report of the interdepartmental committee on food imports.  The framework for progress exists in the financial inducements provided by my Department such as the aid towards the formation of a national co-operative for potatoes; aid for market co-ordination for glasshouse crops, and aid for setting up producer groups in the general fruit and vegetable sectors.  The scope for progress and expansion exists and it is a matter for growers and other interests in the industry to exploit these opportunities and avail of the supports so as to reduce unnecessary imports.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions 326 to 338, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the western drainage scheme the area which may be the subject of field drainage is limited by the EC to 150,000 hectares.  Up to a recent date approval had issued for 162,000 hectares, and there were some 10,000 applications on hands from persons interested in carrying <Col N="2771" /> out field drainage under the measure. Making due allowance for projects which for various reasons would not be carried out, it had been estimated that applications received up to 30 September 1981 would account for the full area allowed. However, by not claiming reimbursement from the EC for certain less-intensive joint works, (except in conjunction with a claim for field drainage), it will be possible to increase the amount of field drainage which can be carried out under the EC measures, and thus cater for applications received up to about the end of 1981.  Processing of these applications will commence without delay and they will arise for payment in 1986 and 1987. This course has become possible as a result of the additional funds made available under the national plan.</P>
    <P>The rate of grant under the western drainage scheme is 70 per cent of the approved cost subject to a maximum grant of £560 per hectare.  Applications under the scheme are dealt with strictly in order of receipt and this will continue. When approval is issued for a drainage project a time limit is imposed for the completion of the work, and failure to meet the deadline can result in cancellation of the approval and loss of grant-aid. Such time limits will continue to be enforced.  There is no question of moneys available from the EC under the scheme remaining unclaimed.  In accordance with normal procedure claims are forwarded to the Commission each year in respect of sums disbursed by the State under the scheme.  An examination is being made of the options available for dealing with outstanding applications which cannot be catered for within the extension of the scheme now proposed.  When a decision is reached on this and on the matter of <Col N="2772" /> future drainage in the west, an announcement will be made.  As regards arterial drainage, this is a matter for the Office of Public Works.  The Corrib-Mask-Robe, the Boyle and the Bonet catchments are included in the western drainage scheme and there are no proposals at present to include further catchments.</P>

      <P>While evidence of antibiotic residues has been found in pigmeat the recent reports on the levels of such residues are open to different interpretations.  Nevertheless, the indiscriminate use of antibiotics and growth promoters at producer level is a cause for concern, and there is a need to ensure that these substances are administered only under strict controls.  Comprehensive regulations on the use of antibiotics and growth promoters in livestock production will be introduced early next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 354 and 355 together.  Northern Ireland has a scheme under which potatoes may be withdrawn from the market and dyed in order to render them suitable only for stock feed.  Under EC rules potatoes from Northern Ireland have access to our market only if they are accompanied by <Col N="2779" /> a phytosanitary certificate.  Officials of Customs and Excise and of my Department will, of course, be vigilant with regard to possible illegal imports.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 78 on 14 December 1983, one of the difficulties about establishing a new Garda district is the need for additional manpower on indoor duty at the expense of outdoor operational duty.  There is a similar difficulty about the establishment of a new Garda station.  Accordingly, before embarking on structural changes or establishing a new station in any area, it is necessary to look at the possibility of providing an improved Garda service for that area by the allocation of additional manpower and other resources within the existing organisational arrangements.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, one extra Garda has been allocated to each of the stations at Celbridge and Maynooth and new communications equipment has been installed at both centres as part of the new national radio network. Final testing of the equipment is at present in progress and the new network is expected to be in operation early in the new year.  The current Garda strength at Lucan is 47 as compared with 37 at the end of 1981 and, in addition, part of the area formerly served from the station is now served from the station at Ronanstown which opened in January last.</P>

Three of these became vacant as a result of retirements or resignations and are posts which, in the normal way, could not be filled.  The other three are new posts.  Of the six, three have already been filled and arrangements are in hand for the filling of three more.  I am keeping the position under review.</P>

      <P>The precise arrangements for the policing of individual areas are a matter for the Garda authorities.  They report that night patrols are operated in Ardee by the local station party to the maximum extent possible, having regard to available resources and other demands on Garda services, and that the area is covered from the district headquarters at Navan outside the hours when the local members are on patrol.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the fatal incident referred to in Question No. 397 took place shortly after 3 a.m. at a time when local gardaí were not on duty but that the local sergeant was on the scene very quickly and three other members of the Ardee station party arrived a short time later.</P>
      <P>I understand an additional Garda was assigned to Ardee station on 2 November 1984 and that this has enabled the local patrolling arrangements to be improved. The current patrolling arrangements for Ardee are generally in line with those in operation in other similar sized towns.  I am informed that it would not be practicable to extend patrolling hours at present having regard to overall resources but the police needs of the area will be kept under review.</P>

The delay in dealing with some categories of cases is not significant.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that successive Governments since 1981 have found it necessary, because of the financial situation, to adopt a policy of reducing staff numbers in the Civil Service &mdash; a policy which manifests itself as an embargo on filling certain vacancies.  The effect on the Land Registry is that the current authorised staffing of the registry is approximately 14 per cent lower than the authorised level prior to the introduction of the embargo.  In addition, the most recent estimate of the volume of work being dealt with by the registry shows an increase of 9 per cent approximately, over the 1980 level, the year of reference to which the staffing level was fixed. Everything possible is being done by the registry to speed up the processing of applications within the staffing constraints involved in the general policy on Civil Service numbers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): It would be wrong to think that it is feasible for the prison medical officers or for prison personnel to provide elaborate therapy calculated to cure addicted prisoners of their addiction. Even if pressure on the accommodation in the closed prisons were not a problem, treatment techniques, which rely very largely on the commitment of the person concerned to overcome the addiction, cannot easily be applied in the prison setting.  On the other hand, a proportion of the persons treated for drug addiction in the available clinics and centres, including Coolmine Lodge and its sister centre, St. Martha's, is, in fact, composed of persons released from the prisons temporarily for the purpose of receiving treatment.</P>
      <P>Where, for one reason or another, a prisoner cannot be referred for treatment to one of the clinics or centres, the prison medical officer provides whatever help he can to enable the prisoner to cope with the enforced withdrawal from the use of the drug to which he had become addicted.  In addition group therapy sessions are conducted in the prisons where practicable.  In due course, the courts will be able to commit suitable offenders direct to a custodial treatment centre designated by the Minister for Health under section 28 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, rather than to a prison.</P>
      <P>A study entitled &ldquo;Drug Abuse in the Dublin Committal Prisons&rdquo; by officers of my Department, which was published in 1983, is available in the Library.  It contains useful information on various aspects of the matter, including the problems connected with treatment.</P>

The No. 2 Act which had a life of five years to 31 July 1982 was extended, subject to increased fees, for a further year in 1982.

      <P>Various precautions are already being taken and Governors are free to add to them.  On the other hand neither I nor the prison authorities would wish to add unduly to the restrictions that prisoners and detainees are subject to in order to make absolutely sure that a few drug abusers do not come into possession of drugs while they are in custody.  Thus, for example, it is not proposed to introduce a barrier between all prisoners and detainees and their visitors though such a barrier is provided in Mountjoy Prison in the case of prisoners known to be drug abusers.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The precise arrangements for the policing of individual areas are a matter for the Garda authorities and the allocation of manpower between patrol duty and other duties is a matter <Col N="2795" /> for the local Garda officers having regard to available resources, local circumstances, other demands on Garda services and the time of day or night.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are aware of the concern of residents of Donnycarney about incidents of crime and vandalism in the area and that Garda officers at Raheny have had a meeting with local residents about the matter.  I understand that malicious damage to a local school gave rise to particular concern and that eight young boys &mdash; roughly in the ten to 12 year old age bracket &mdash; who were involved in that incident are being dealt with under the juvenile liaison officer scheme which provides for an alternative to prosecution for young offenders subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>As regards measures to deal with the incidence of crime in the Donnycarney area, I am informed by the Garda authorities that special anti-vandalism patrols have been introduced and that the area is receiving regular attention from mobile patrols operating from both Clontarf and Raheny stations.  These measures will be kept under review by the local Garda officers so as to ensure that resources are being deployed to best advantage in combating crime and vandalism in the area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will now consider introducing legislation which would oblige the Director of Public Prosecutions to state reasons for which he arrives at a decision to prosecute or not to prosecute in the type of case relating to a person (details supplied).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; While I have no statutory or other responsibility in relation to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, I am aware that the general refusal of the director to give, publicly, reasons for decisions not to prosecute is not based on any reluctance to be accountable for his decisions but on the fact that a policy of giving reasons would inevitably, in very many cases, mean serious damage to the reputation of individuals.  The same attitude was adopted over the years by successive Attorneys General who, before the appointment of the director, discharged the functions now discharged by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The text of the question, however, <Col N="2797" /> refers to a particular &ldquo;type of case&rdquo;.  If the suggestion is that reasons should be given in and only in rare cases where there are very exceptional circumstances the position may be somewhat different. I am aware that the director is in principle prepared to consider giving reasons in such very exceptional cases if some satisfactory means can be found of defining or otherwise categorising them so that the giving of reasons in those cases and the refusal of reasons in other cases would not lead to inferences being drawn in those other cases that could be as indefensibly damaging to individuals as the general giving of reasons would be.  I am informed that the question whether something could be done to isolate and identify such very exceptional cases has been under consideration but that no satisfactory means or formula has yet been found.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, it appears to me that any issues of public interest that might have been raised by the case referred to in the question have effectively been resolved by the fact that, since the question was first put on the Order Paper, certain details of the evidence of what led up to the incident have been published in a newspaper.  While it is not for me, as Minister for Justice, to defend or explain the director's decision, it seems to me that anybody who has read that newspaper report and who is familiar with what is legally required to sustain a charge of manslaughter (not to mention murder) would need no further explanation.</P>
    <P>The question also refers to decisions to prosecute.  Except in circumstances where it is later decided not to proceed &mdash; in which case the comments already made apply &mdash; a decision to prosecute is explained by the presentation of the evidence in court.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): It is contrary to long established practice to disclose information about the numbers of gardaí involved in any policing operation or to give information as to cost which could be used to quantify the number of personnel involved. I can say, however, that, so far as the occasion referred to in the question is concerned &mdash; in which, incidentally, the Garda role was essentially concerned with normal policing rather than protection &mdash; it was necessary to employ a number of gardaí on overtime and the estimated cost of this, over and above the cost of normal salaries and allowances, was £1,200.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I take it that the Deputy is referring to the review of policing requirements in the Dublin Metropolitan Area which was carried out by a team consisting of representatives from the Garda Síochána and from the Operations Research Section of the Department of the Public Service.  This team has produced a report containing a number of recommendations of which some have been implemented and others are being implemented or are still under consideration.</P>
      <P>I want again to make a point that has already been made about reports of this nature.  This report is a confidential document prepared to assist those with responsibility for the management of the Garda Síochána and, in accordance with normal practice, I do not propose to publish its contents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say, however, that the recommendations made in the report have been <Col N="2799" /> taken into account, for example in the introduction of a new rostering system designed to have extra gardaí on duty at times when there is greatest need for their services and in the assignment to particular stations of extra Garda strength as it becomes available.</P>
    <P>I want also to make the point that reviewing the system of policing in the Dublin Metropolitan Area and elsewhere is, of course, an on-going process.  Garda arrangements are continually under scrutiny to ensure that the police service provided is as effective as possible in all areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 425 and 426 together.  I am aware of the attacks which have been taking place on the homes of elderly people in County Donegal in recent months, one of which resulted in a man's death.  Unfortunately, there have been somewhat similar attacks in some other areas as well &mdash; one of which has resulted in the death of a woman &mdash; and it would be unrealistic to respond to these questions by reference only to County Donegal.</P>
      <P>The seriousness of those developments does not need to be underlined, nor does the fact that they affect the well-being of many more people than have been the object of attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2800" /> I am informed by the Garda authorities that two Garda centres have been set up to deal specifically with the type of attacks referred to in these questions. A detective inspector from the Garda Technical Bureau is in charge at each centre assisted by a number of detectives from the bureau.  One centre was set up in Sligo on 3 December to co-ordinate Garda activity in the north-west and the other centre was set up in Roscommon on 6 December.</P>
    <P>Special Garda check points have been mounted in the north-western counties in an effort to pinpoint the movement of vehicles likely to have been used in the perpetration of attacks.  The local Gardaí have instructions to pay particular attention to the homes of elderly people during the course of their patrols and to call to advise them on matters of security, in particular against the dangers of keeping large sums of money in their homes.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, a person was convicted and sentenced some time ago in connection with the death in County Donegal and a person has been charged in connection with the very recent death in County Roscommon.  In addition, detections have been made in relation to several other attacks in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>The Garda have mounted a publicity campaign locally and have involved local community groups in an effort to make people more security conscious and to report the movements of suspicious persons and vehicles.  The Garda report a good response to those efforts.</P>
    <P>I would add that, in relation to all the affected areas, the general response of a number of organisations, including community groups, has been very positive and helpful and that, with such an approach from them as well as from the Garda Síochána, there is every reason for confidence that the problem will be met.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have seen the report in question, as well as other associated material elsewhere in the same issue of the newspaper.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have no evidence that would substantiate in any way the allegation in the report that two British security officials were in Dundalk on 7 and 8 November &ldquo;looking for&rdquo; a particular person. I am also informed that the only British personnel who had any contact with the Garda Síochána at the relevant time about the case were two British police officers who were in Dublin in the first half of that week &mdash; up to Wednesday, 7 November &mdash; on official business in connection with the relevant warrants, which they had brought with them. Discussions between the two sides about warrants are confidential but, in any event, it will be clear from what I have said that the discussions in question took place either entirely or mainly before the period referred to in the newspaper article, not after it as would be implied by the article if it were to be taken as referring to those officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be noted that the British Embassy have issued an official statement denying that any British personnel were involved in Dundalk as alleged in the newspaper article.  That statement also indicated that the only British personnel who had come here in connection with the case were the two British police <Col N="2802" /> officers who had come to deliver the warrants and then went on to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In view of what I have said, the issues relating to rights and procedures that are referred to in the second part of the question do not really arise but, since the matter has been mentioned, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a Private Notice Question on 13 November (Official Report, Volume 353, column 1700) which related to the same case.  In the course of that reply I took care to draw particular attention to the fact that fundamental legal requirements must not be ignored or overlooked and that rights must be respected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The dismissal of the former superintendent concerned, which took place in 1928, was very fully considered some years ago &mdash; in 1977-1978 to be precise &mdash; as a result of representations made to the then Minister for Justice by the man concerned.  The outcome, however, was that no evidence could be found that would enable the Minister to be of any assistance in the matter.</P>
      <P>What has been said in the course of the latest representations does not include anything of a substantial nature that is new.  The reference in the text of the question to a favourable statement by a former chief superintendent is, I am afraid, incomplete.  Whatever was said by the former chief superintendent in a favourable sense was subsequently withdrawn by him on the stated basis that the earlier comment was made only because he had been pestered, and the effect of his statements, taken together, was hardly supportive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only official record about the dismissal is the record of the decision to dismiss &mdash; there is no official documentation available as to the background. Whether the background information was ever recorded is not clear.  Relevant papers, if they existed, would have been liable to have long since been pulped. Every effort was made to get information about the circumstances of the dismissal and all the material that was available, including press-cutting etc., was considered by the then Attorney General as well as by the Minister for Justice.  The result of all the inquiries was that there <Col N="2804" /> was no adequate basis for rescinding the dismissal.</P>
    <P>The then Minister wrote to the man concerned on 31 May 1978, to give the result of his inquiries and to explain, in detail, why no action was possible.  He explained that it was not open to him to decide that a dismissal of some 50 years earlier was unjustified or even open to doubt because the information on which the authorities of that time acted was not still available to be evaluated &mdash; that, otherwise, numerous past decisions no matter how well justified would have to be rescinded because the evidence on which they were based had, in the normal process, been lost through the periodic pulping of old papers.  The Minister mentioned the steps he had taken to get information and gave the results of those inquiries.  The clear intention was that the recipient was to feel free to publish the Minister's letter if he thought it helpful to himself to do so.</P>
    <P>In the absence of evidence that would substantiate the former superintendent's contentions I regret that I am not in a position to advance the matter further. As was said by my predecessor, it is a situation where those who know the man concerned or have read the evidence will make up their own minds.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he now recognises the need for a Garda station on the east side of Galway city in view of its rapidly growing population; and if he will give a commitment to the establishment of a Garda station on the east side in view of the fact that the new station on the west side of Galway is almost complete.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The new Garda station to which the Deputy refers is being provided to replace the existing station at Eglington Street which is no longer adequate to meet Garda accommodation requirements.  I am informed that the transfer of gardaí to this new station will not result in any reduction in the police <Col N="2805" /> service which is already being provided for the east side of the city.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of providing a Garda station on the east side of Galway city, I do not accept that the provision of an extra Garda station is necessarily the best way to improve Garda service to an area.  The manning of an extra station tends to absorb considerable Garda manpower resources which might be better employed on outdoor patrolling in the area.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the police service for this part of the city has in fact been improved recently by the deployment of a Garda full time in the Mervue and Ballybane areas.  The question of providing a new Garda station in this area will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 438 and 439 together.  The regional technical colleges in this country were set up to serve designated regions, each region comprising a number of counties or parts thereof.  The southern part of County Kildare is served by Carlow Regional Technical College while the northern part of County Kildare including Naas is served by the city of Dublin third level colleges.  The Government have given a commitment to the establishment of new regional technical colleges in the Greater Dublin area, one of which will be located in Tallaght.  There are no plans to provide a regional technical college in Naas.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of determining the payment of special allowances to teachers in respect of qualifications, my Department recognise as honours degrees, in the case of Irish and British universities, degrees classified by the universities concerned as first, or second class honours.</P>
      <P>Where Master degrees are unclassified by the awarding university and the results published as pass, or fail only, as in the case of the MA degree awarded by the Queen's University, Belfast, the practice of my Department has been to determine the appropriate level of allowance attaching to the Master degree by reference to the level of primary degree held by the claimant.  The allowance at the honours rate in respect of the unclassified Master degree is payable only where the claimant also holds a first, or second class honours primary degree; otherwise the lower pass rate of allowance applies.  I do not propose to alter these arrangements.</P>

      <P>I have already responded to proposals put to my Department by Town of Tralee Vocational Education Committee regarding the purchase of extra land for Tralee Regional Technical College.  In this connection I understand that the total area of the site at Clash is 28.666 acres on which stand the sports complex, the vocational school and the regional technical college.  When deduction has been made for the vocational school and the sports centre, the area of the college site is in the order of 18 acres.  This compares favourably with the area of the sites in the other regional technical colleges and accordingly I am not prepared to sanction the purchase of the additional land being requested by Town of Tralee Vocational Education Committee.</P>

I have also decided in response to representations from school and parents' organisations that the fees for the 1985 certificate examinations may be paid in two instalments.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  The organisations involved in the running of school transport during the 1983-84 academic year were the Department of Education and Córas Iompair Éireann.  CIE administer the scheme at local level in co-operation with the management authorities of primary schools and with the chief executive officers of vocational education committees who act as transport liaison officers in respect of school transport to post primary schools.</P>
      <P>(b) The net amount paid to CIE in respect of the operation of school transport for the 1983-84 academic year was approximately £28.6 million.</P>
      <P>(c) Excluding capital expenditure of £345,000, the total cost of school transport in 1983-84 was approximately £31 million.</P>
      <P>(d) The total number of children who availed themselves of school transport during 1983-84 was 162,000.  Of these, 149,000 were eligible for school transport under the terms of the school transport schemes, and the remainder availed themselves of concessionary fare-paying transport on special school services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 489 and 495 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A quota of 3 per cent was decided by the Government in 1977 as the target for the employment of disabled persons in the public sector.  Progress is being achieved through holiday special recruitment competitions confined to disabled persons and by giving special consideration to suitable disabled persons in the case of jobs not filled by competition.  Up to 300 disabled persons have been recruited so far through special competitions in the <Col N="2822" /> public sector.  At the end of December 1983 the total number of disabled persons in the public service, including those who became disabled since recruitment, stood at 2,700.  Some 600 of these were employed in the Civil Service representing 0.94 per cent of its workforce.</P>
    <P>The last special examination to recruit disabled persons to the Civil Service was held in April 1983.  A further special competition for appointments as clerical assistant was announced by the Civil Service commission on 14 November and will take place early in 1985.</P>
    <P>While I am satisfied that significant progress was made initially I am aware that the restrictions generally on recruitment to the public service have had serious repercussions for the quota.  At my request, the special competition for the recruitment of disabled clerical assistants to the Civil Service mentioned above is being held.  I also understand that the Department of Health raised the issue recently with the chief executive of the health boards and exhorted them to take all steps possible to increase their intake of disabled persons.  I have also asked the inter-departmental committee which is responsible for reviewing progress on the quota to consider what further steps should be taken to increase the intake of disabled persons to the public service.</P>

      <P>The position regarding the sales of surplus EC butter and grain to the USSR is that there have been no sales of grain in recent years to the USSR at subsidised prices from intervention stocks and that no such sales are under consideration.  There have been sales of butter from intervention stocks at subsidised prices.  However, this product is not suitable for use for practical reasons as food aid to developing countries.</P>
      <P>As regards food aid, the Community will this year provide more than a million tonnes of cereals and more than a hundred thousand tonnes of milk powder as well as smaller amounts of other suitable products as food aid to developing countries. The cost of this to the Community's development aid funds is some five hundred million European Currency Units. In fact, the Community is one of the main providers of food aid to developing countries.  It provides, in addition, financial assistance for other forms of emergency help such as improvements to the transport system for distributing food aid within developing countries.  Of course, all this is in addition to actions undertaken directly by member states individually.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I would like to express my gratification at the magnificent response the Irish public are making to the plight of the Ethiopian people.  I understand that the amount raised by the voluntary agencies on their behalf is now approximately £7 million.  For its part, the Government has already contributed £310,000 for emergency relief activities in Ethiopia, most of which has been used to transport emergency supplies to that country.  Further grants for famine relief will be announced before the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both I and the Minister of State at my Department, Jim O'Keeffe, are in constant contact with the voluntary organisations involved in the relief operation to Ethiopia.  We have taken an active part in providing back-up support for their activities for example by funding the transport costs for a shipment which left Dublin on 1 December, consisting of 1,500 tons of emergency relief supplies collected by several voluntary organisations. This consisted of 750 tonnes of grain, 140 tonnes of milk powder, 100 tonnes of cement, 100 tonnes of building <Col N="2833" /> materials, and several tonnes of other materials such as medical supplies, grinding mills, blankets and high protein foods as well as trucks and other vehicles.</P>
    <P>It might be thought that the number of organisations involved in fund raising would entail poor co-ordination of delivery of aid, but this is not the case as there is, in fact, good co-ordination in the field in Ethiopia.  For example, Trocaire and GOAL are providing funds and supplies to the Christian Relief and Development Organisation (CRDA) which works in close collaboration with Concern, Christian Aid and other organisations.</P>
    <P>At European level, we have sought to use our Presidency of the EC to persuade the Community to increase its aid to the famine stricken regions of Africa.  We first raised this question at the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers in September and we said that, while we appreciated the European contribution thus far, we felt that the Community could do more. As a result of our efforts, the Community allocated an additional 32 MECU (IR£23 million) in emergency aid and an additional 100 tonnes of grain in emergency food aid for Africa in October.</P>
    <P>Last month, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  TD, visited Ethiopia on behalf of Ireland and the European Community, to assess the situation there and report on what needed to be done.  On his return, he reported to the Foreign Affairs Council on 26 November and he also made a report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries on 4 December.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency also raised the famine situation in Africa at the European Council on 3/4 December.  As a result of this, the European Council concluded that the Community and its member states should provide a total of 1.2 million tonnes of cereals to Africa between now and the next harvest.</P>
    <P>This will undoubtedly go a long way towards meeting the needs of the African countries affected by famine.  However, the Irish Government will continue to monitor the situation closely and will take any further action considered necessary <Col N="2834" /> including support for the voluntary organisations.</P>

These facilities are an important factor in making Dundalk more attractive as an industrial location and the town will continue to be promoted.

      <P>I am aware of the statement referred to by the Deputy.  I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that there are almost 80 projects involved and details of the individual projects in respect of which grant payments will be made will be published in future IDA annual reports.  I should add that details of additional employment or new products to be provided by individual firms and the period over which such employment will be provided would not be disclosed without the prior agreement of the firms concerned.</P>
      <P>The IDA does not provide particulars of job losses on a constituency basis. However, in the Dún Laoghaire area approximately 700 jobs have been lost in industries grant-aided by IDA over the past three years.  The details are set out in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  The IDA is continuing to promote the Dún Laoghaire area for suitable overseas and domestic industrial projects.  A major international business park comprising a site of 70 acres has been developed in nearby Leopardstown for international service industry.  The first office unit of 14,000 sq. ft. has been completed and is fully reserved.  In addition, a further two acres on the park have been reserved by three further companies to construct their own facilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 547 and 548 together.  Following my statement in Dáil Éireann on 3 April last about the Irish Civil Service Building Society, the Bank of Ireland sought discussions with my Department.  Arising from these discussions which took place over a period of several months, the bank made certain proposals to me in a letter of 15 August on the future structure and operation of the society as a means of obviating the need for the legislation. The bank proposed changes in the rules of the society, which among other items, gave voting rights to ordinary shareholders and effectively extended the principle of mutuality to the society which has not hitherto operated on this basis. Additionally, the bank gave undertakings <Col N="2844" /> of a policy nature on the future running of the society.  I have placed a copy of the bank's letter in the Library.  The bank's proposals were acceptable to the Government. The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism made an Order on 16 August under the Mergers, TakeOvers and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, permitting the takeover subject to the implementation of the rule changes proposed.  The society has gone ahead with the proposed changes to the rules but I understand that the Registrar of Building Societies, in exercise of his statutory functions, has refused to register the altered rules.  The society has a right of appeal to the High Court against the Registrar's refusal under Section 12 of the Building Societies Act, 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the felling of trees at Dorney Court, Shankill, as part of the development of land for housing.  The planning permission for this development permitted the removal of certain trees and contained conditions requiring tree surveys, measures to protect the trees being retained from possible damage during building operations, and the planting of new trees.  The permission also provided for approximately 3.8 acres of open space in an area which contains a substantial number of the mature trees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2849" /> I have been advised by Dublin County Council that in monitoring the application of the conditions relating to trees, they became aware recently that some 12 trees on the site had been felled without consent under the terms of the planning permission or under a tree preservation order which relates to the area.  The county council immediately instituted proceedings in the High Court against the developer under section 27 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, and secured an injunction on 10 December 1984.  I understand that the court's order (a) requires that no trees on the site be felled without the consent of the planning authority, and (b) in relation to a site for which a separate permission was given for the erection of a single house, that no further development was to be carried out under that permission.  The effect of the court order is to reinforce the conditions of the relevant planning permission in relation to the preservation of trees and the consent procedures under the tree preservation order.</P>
    <P>The issue of guidelines to planning authorities in relation to tree preservation is at present under consideration in my Department and the possibility of improving the law in that regard is being kept under review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 569 and 570 together.  The main source of the level of radioactivity in the Irish Sea is the discharge of radioactive effluent from the Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, Cumbria, England.  While scientific evidence, available to date, does not indicate adverse effects to the Irish public my view and the view of the Irish Government is that the discharge operations at Sellafield should be discontinued as soon as possible in view of the possible long-term effects of such radioactive waste disposal.  This view has been made known to the UK authorities, in particular on the occasion of the Tánaiste's visit to London, last February to meet Mr. Patrick Jenkin, UK Secretary of State for the Environment.</P>
      <P>Since that date we have been in continual contact with the UK authorities regarding their plans to reduce discharges from Sellafield.  Discharges have been reduced annually since 1975 and a significant reduction in the current levels of discharges to the Irish Sea is expected in 1985 when the new effluent treatment plant is brought into service.  In addition, a major revision of discharge limits is planned and is expected to be carried out in 1985.</P>
      <P>The levels of radioactivity in the Irish Sea are continually being monitored by our own Nuclear Energy Board.  The programme includes the sampling of analysis of fish (landed in ports such as Clogherhead and Skerries), seaweeds, sediments and seawater.  These samples are also analysed independently by our universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2855" /> The most significant route by which exposure of the Irish public could occur from radioactivity, in particular caesium, is through the consumption of fish and shellfish.  Caesium is among the radio-nuclides present in the effluents discharged from the Sellafield plant to the Irish Sea but its contribution to radiological risk is small by comparison with other radionuclides such as plutonium which remains in the waters close to Sellafield and does not travel to our coasts.</P>
    <P>The results of the Nuclear Energy Board's monitoring programme show that the radiation doses to members of the Irish public, including doses arising from the consumption of fish, are very small and are likely to be less than 1 per cent of the dose limits advised by the International Commission on Radiological Protection and of the European Community basic radiation safety standards. The board's monitoring programme also includes the measurement of radiocativity levels in air and precipitation.  The results indicate that the levels of radioactivity continue to be low and there is no evidence to suggest a hazard to the Irish public.  A copy of the board's most recent report in this matter has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Further studies dealing with the effects of radiation exposure to the Irish public are being carried out by the Department of Health.  There are two studies involved. One concerns an investigation into the incidence of Downs Syndrome in the eastern part of this country.  The other will examine the incidence of childhood leukaemia in order to establish whether there are any unusual patterns here.  This examination is a prelude to considering whether there might be any links between such patterns and the radioactive discharges from the Sellafield plant.  I can confirm that my Department will be in regular consultation with the Department of Health and will be informed of all developments in these studies. I suggest that in view of the work being carried out by the Nuclear Energy Board, the universities and the Department of <Col N="2856" /> Health in this area, the commissioning of an independent body would only be a duplication of effort.</P>

I do know, following a recent meeting of the Ireland-UK Contact Group on Nuclear Matters, that measures are being taken by the UK authorities to comply more fully with the principle enunciated by the International Commission for Radiological Protection, of reducing discharge levels to &ldquo;as low as reasonably achievable&rdquo; (ALARA), and the UK Department of the Environment intends to submit a paper shortly to the Paris Convention outlining plans to reduce discharges to &ldquo;ALARA&rdquo; by using the best available technology.</P>
      <P>I have also been advised, following that meeting, that the UK authorities expect discharges from Sellafield to be significantly reduced when the new ion exchange effluent treatment plant (SIXEP) is brought into service which is expected to be commissioned in mid-1985. The UK authorities are also to revise discharge authorisations early in 1985 to provide for more specific and more stringent controls on discharge limits.</P>
      <P>At the contact group meeting, we reaffirmed the Government's view that discharges to the Irish Sea should be reduced as quickly as possible to &ldquo;ALARA&rdquo; and that they should be discontinued completely as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure you that we are in regular contact with the UK authorities on matters relating to the Sellafield plant. The two most important channels of communication in these matters ar present are the Ireland-UK Contact Group and an Ireland-UK Exchange of Information Agreement on nuclear matters, which is currently under discussion.  The former was set up following the Tánaiste's meeting with the UK Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. Patrick Jenkins, in London in February last to provide more formal contact at both technical and administrative levels between the two countries on matters relating to Sellafield which could affect the people of this country, this contact group has since met on two occasions, once in London and once in Dublin; further meetings will be held twice yearly.</P>
      <P>There is an existing agreement between the Nuclear Energy Board and the UK Health and Safety Executive on the exchange of information on nuclear matters with regard to the Irish Sea.  This forms the basis for the proposed formal Agreement between Ireland and the UK on Exchange of Information on Nuclear Matters.  Discussions have taken place at official level between representatives from this country and the UK towards the conclusion of this formal bilateral agreement.  Other contacts include meetings between Government Ministers at EC level and contacts with the UK at various international fora, for example meetings of the Paris Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution from land-based sources (1974) and the London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Waste and Other Matter (1972).</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if the Government is informed when ships carrying potentially hazardous nuclear waste enter the Irish Sea; if <Col N="2858" /> he will give details on the number of such vessels during the past year; and if he will outline the contingency plans there are to deal with radioactivity emanating from a collision, a shipboard fire or sinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are not informed when ships carrying nuclear waste enter the Irish Sea and so we are not in a position to give details of the number of such vessels during the past year.  However, arrangements have now been made with the UK authorities to provide us with information regarding the transport of spent radioactive fuel through the Irish Sea to and from the UK.  This is in the context of the UK-Ireland Contact Group, established following the Tánaiste's visit to the UK Secretary of State, in February, last.  For over twenty years the safety standards for the national and international transport of all radioactive materials by all modes of transport have been embodied in regulations recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency of which Ireland and the United Kingdom are members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the particular case of international marine transport the regulatory authority is the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).  Ireland and the UK, like most other maritime nations, have implemented in their domestic legislation the IMO's dangerous goods code which in the case of radioactive cargoes fully reflects the IAEA transport regulations. IAEA standards are essentially directed to ensuring that the safeguards appropriate to the nature and quantity of material are built in to the design of the container to be used irrespective of the mode of transport.  The container used for the transport of spent radioactive fuel is specially designed to ensure that no radioactive pollution shall occur in the event that the container sinks to the seabed. The design of these containers is intended to minimise the risk of radioactivity emanating from a collision, a shipboard fire or sinking.  In the highly unlikely event of radioactivity emanating from such an accident, and the radioactivity affecting this country, the emergency <Col N="2859" /> would be dealt with by all relevant State agencies acting on the advice of the Nuclear Energy Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 578 and 588 together.</P>
      <P>In 1983 my Department spent £39,520.30 under the subsidy arrangements in respect of the removal of slurry from the Lough Sheelin area.  A provision of £16,000 for the continuation of this subsidy was included in my Department's Vote in the current year but it is anticipated that the amount claimed from and paid by, the Department will not exceed £4,000.  I propose to make a provision of £5,000 in my Department's Vote for 1985 to meet any outstanding claims in respect of slurry moved to 31 December 1984.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in the years up to 1980 the quality of water in Lough Sheelin had deteriorated to such an extent that the continuation of the lake as a valuable fishery was seriously at risk.  Towards the end of that year, a scheme was introduced for the transport of slurry from the catchment and a special State subsidy was made available towards the costs involved. This scheme has been effective in restoring water quality to a satisfactory condition.</P>
      <P>Initially it was envisaged that the State participation in the scheme, including the payment of the subsidy, would last for two years (viz. 1981 and 1982) by which time the pig producers would have established a pattern of demand among recipients which could be continued on a voluntary co-operative basis by the producers themselves.  In the event, special arrangements were made to continue the scheme during 1983, and again in the current year, incorporating a phased reduction in the level of State subsidy. These arrangements were intended to further strengthen the export pattern and to give the pig producers concerned sufficient time to adjust to the ending of State subsidisation and to take over responsibility for the voluntary operation and financing of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Continuation of subsidy payments in 1984 was conditional on the pig producers giving an undertaking that they would assume full responsibility for the financing of the slurry transport arrangements <Col N="2862" /> from 1 January 1985.  A written undertaking has been given by the Sheelin Farmer's Association on behalf of its members that it will assume both administrative and financial responsibility for the slurry transport scheme as and from 1 January 1985.  The association also agreed to participate in the new management committee which will oversee the implementation of measures necessary for the preservation and protection of the lake.  Statutory responsibility for pollution control will, of course, continue to be a matter for Cavan County Council and the Fisheries board.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the orderly manner in which the transitional arrangments leading to the transfer of responsibility to the pig producers have been implemented provides an ideal basis for the continued protection of the lake, given a co-operative and responsible approach by the producers.  There is no reason why producers in the Sheelin catchment should continue indefinitely to be treated differently to others engaged in agriculture (or, indeed, industry) in the rest of the country.  Given the initial State encouragement and funding of the scheme, the onus now rests on the pig producers to accept their responsibility and legal obligation to dispose of wastes in a manner which does not lead to water pollution.</P>

      <P>Health boards can make contributions under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, to voluntary organisations providing services similar or ancillary to the boards' <Col N="2870" /> services.  The Eastern Health Board is the appropriate funding authority in the case of HOPE.  I understand from the board that £43,000 was allocated to HOPE this year.  The board have recently arranged for a review of the operation of the hostel including care policy, occupancy, staffing and salary levels.  Decisions as to the future level of funding for HOPE will await the outcome of this review and will of course have to have regard to the board's financial position in 1985.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare has received an application from HOPE for assistance from the £500,000 provided in this year's budget for voluntary bodies in the social services area.  The application is at present being considered and I expect to be in a position to make a decision in the matter shortly.</P>

An application on her behalf from St. Vincent's centre was received by the South Eastern Health Board on 11 June 1984.  She was granted a disabled person's maintenance allowance which was paid from November 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of retrospective payments is still being considered by the health board pending clarification of her date of entry to the hostel in 1983.  As she was in full time residential care in St. Vincent's centre, Lisnagry prior to that <Col N="2871" /> date, she would not qualify for a disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was <Col N="2880" /> disallowed on the grounds that his means derived from land exceeded the statutory limit.  The decision to disallow his unemployment assistance claim was made on the basis of a social welfare officer's report which showed the gross profit of his holding less the expenses incurred in earning his income and the net amount of earnings on which means were assessed. He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and in the light of contentions made by him in support of his appeal his case was referred to a social welfare officer for further inquiries.

      <P>It has been decided that the person concerned is entitled to an old age pension at the maximum weekly rate of £70.80 which includes an adult dependant allowance of £20.75 plus a dependent child allowance of £8.75.  Notification of the decision issued to the pensioner on 12 December 1984.  The appropriate pension books payable from 7 December <Col N="2884" /> 1984 issued on 11 December 1984 and a payable order covering arrears of pension due for the period 26 October 1984 to 6 December 1984 will be issued shortly. The delay in dealing with this case is due to the fact that the person concerned claimed contributory old age pension.  It was not until it had been established that he was not entitled to that pension that arrangements were made to investigate his entitlement to a non-contributory pension.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed an old age contributory pension on 12 November 1984.  His insurance record shows that he would have an entitlement to an old age contributory pension, at a reduced rate, on reaching age 66.  According to the records of the Department he entered insurance in January 1936 and quoted his date of birth at that time as November 1919, but did not give any verification of this.  He has, however, now quoted his date of birth on his claim form for pension as 14 September 1918.  In the circumstances, since a birth certificate is not available, the Department would be prepared to accept a baptismal certificate or other reliable written evidence which he might be able to obtain, for example, a certified extract from old school records.  The person concerned has been notified to this effect.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed a retirement pension on 7 November 1984.  He reached age 65 on 8 May 1984.  One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts, requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance under the Acts, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  The person concerned does not satisfy this condition as the Department's records show that he had a total of 259 Irish contributions in the relevant period, equal to a yearly average of only eight.  Neither will he qualify for old age contributory pension under the Social Welfare Acts at age 66; a yearly average of at least 20 is required for this latter pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned also has a total of 1329 British contributions since 1953. Under EC regulations where a person has been employed in another member state his insurance record in that State may be combined with his Irish record to enable him to qualify for a pro-rata <Col N="2888" /> retirement pension calculated on the basis of his number of Irish contributions in proportion to the combined total.</P>
    <P>In accordance with these regulations he has been awarded a pro-rata retirement pension with effect from 10 May 1984 on the basis of his 259 Irish contributions in proportion to the combined total of 1588.  The weekly rate payable to him is £7.35 from 10 May 1984, increased to £7.85 from 5 July 1984.  A pension book containing orders payable at the latter rate from 4 October 1984 has been issued to the designated post office for collection by him and he has been notified accordingly.  The arrears from 10 May 1984 will be issued within the next few days.  He is not entitled to an increase in pension in respect of his wife as she is in receipt of a non-contributory pension at a rate which is higher than the adult dependant allowance to which he would otherwise be entitled.  He is also in receipt of a retirement pension from the British Department of Health and Social Security.</P>

      <P>An applicant for unemployment benefit who is a landholder but does not satisfy the contribution condition of having 78 contributions paid in a three year period is not entitled to unemployment benefit if the income from his holding exceeds £2 daily.  The person concerned is a landholder who does not satisfy the 78 contributions condition.  His case has been referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of the income of his holding and inquiries are still being made in the matter.  When the investigations are completed his entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of the income derived specifically from his holding.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the legislation governing the unemployment assistance scheme the value of benefit which an applicant derives from board and lodgings in a relative's home must be taken into account as means.  The amount assessed for this purpose depends on the income enjoyed in the household and each case is determined on its own particular merits.  The person concerned was assessed with means at £20 weekly derived from the value of board and lodgings on her cousin's holding.  She is accordingly in receipt of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £11.75, being the appropriate rate payable to her £31.75 less means £20.</P>
      <P>Her case was last reviewed on 26 October 1984 when her means were reinvestigated by a social welfare officer and following this she was again assessed with means at £20 weekly.  It is open to her to appeal against the amount of means assessed against her and to have her case determined by an appeals officer.  A form for this purpose may be obtained at her local office.</P>

The condition which provides that the prescribed relative must not be engaged in employment outside the home of the applicant was not fulfilled.  This decision was upheld by an appeals officer <Col N="2891" /> on 30 March 1984.  The pensioner reapplied for the allowance on 28 September 1984.  Inquiries by the social welfare officer established that the circumstances had changed and that these conditions were again satisfied.

His son reached 18 years of age on 22 September 1984 and the payment of unemployment assistance was reduced to £20.95 from that date.  No increase in unemployment assistance is payable for a qualified child after he attains 18 years of age.  Weekly payments are continuing to be made as they fall due.</P>

      <P>My Department are constantly reviewing and strengthening all preventative procedural and control measures in relation to the threat presented by the increasing spread of rabies in western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we have managed to stay rabies-free since 1903, the protection of our country against the introduction of the disease is a constant on-going exercise <Col N="2898" /> which requires the greatest possible vigilance at all times and by all people concerned. To this end my Department annually mount publicity campaigns in the press and on television to alert our own people to the dangers involved and to their responsibilities in helping to prevent any illegal imports of animals from the Continent and other rabies danger zones.  Supplies of leaflets and posters are provided for distribution and display at ports, airports, yachting clubs, marinas, etc.  The veterinary service of my Department organise lectures and seminars for customs officers, gardaí, local authorities, portal and airport personnel to keep them up to date and alert.  Lectures are also organised for members of the Defence Forces prior to their departure on tours of duty with UN forces.  Veterinary officers travel occasionally on ferry boats operating between this country and the Continent to brief crews on our rabies import regulations and alert them to the necessity for vigilance.  These activities are intensified with the approach of and during the tourist season and their overall effectiveness is reviewed on an on-going basis.  The co-operation of the authorities at Continental points of embarkation for Ireland is sought and readily given.</P>
    <P>On the international front we maintain the closest possible liaison and co-operation with our counterparts in Britain, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands all of which, like us, enjoy freedom from rabies.  Periodic meetings are held to co-ordinate action and exchange views on developments.</P>
    <P>On the home front we have comprehensive contingency plans to be put into operation in the event of a suspected or confirmed case of rabies.  Construction of a high security diagnostic unit for rabies at the central veterinary research laboratory at Abbotstown, County Dublin, has been completed and arrangements are proceeding for its equipment and operation.</P>

      <P>The allocation of £1,196,000 for 1984 included a provision of £300,000 made in the 1984 budget out of which £250,000 is a non-recurrent factor in 1984.  This figure of £250,000 is made up of £140,000 to the Olympic Council for the 1984 Olympics; £100,000 to the Gaelic Athletic Association in respect of Centenary Year and £10,000 for the Olympics for the Disabled. On this basis the base from which any comparison should be made is £946,000 (i.e. the original Estimates provision of £896,000 plus a special budget provision of £50,000 given to various sporting organisations).  The figure of £1,085,000 for 1985 thus represents an increase of £139,000 or 14.6 per cent over the corresponding 1984 provision.</P>
