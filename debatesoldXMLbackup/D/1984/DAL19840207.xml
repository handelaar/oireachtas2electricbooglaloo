    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will ask the National Planning Board to recommend short-term emergency measures to alleviate unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) when the report of the National Planning Board will be available; (b) the status these recommendations will have; (c) when the Government will issue their own proposals arising out of the report; and (d) if the Dáil will be allowed sufficient time to debate the report in full.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the relationship there is between the National Planning Board and the group preparing the industrial strategy plan; and if he has made arrangements for co-ordinating both approaches to our economic difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The alleviation of unemployment will be one of the main objectives of the recommendations being prepared by the planning board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Planning Board intend that their report will be ready by end <Col N="1794" /> March-early April next.  The recommendations in this report will be for consideration by the Government.  Pending receipt of the report it is obviously impossible to say when the Government will issue their own proposals arising from its recommendations.</P>
    <P>The question of making available time for a Dáil debate is one for consideration in the normal way between the party Whips and could perhaps best be discussed when the report becomes available.</P>
    <P>As far as the industrial policy dimension of the National Planning Board's proposals is concerned, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism has met representatives of the National Planning Board on two occasions recently to ensure a co-ordinated approach to this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has answered three questions together, so I should like to put a number of supplementary questions to him, if I may.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew the Ceann Comhairle would be considerate.  I want to ask the Taoiseach in view of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>All these figures are not impeding us, I see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;yesterday's figures, which show that the number of unemployed have increased by 7,600 in just one month, that there are now 67,000 under the age of 25 unemployed and that we have lost over 12,000 jobs in our manufacturing industry in the past 12 months, would he not now agree that there is an economic unemployment emergency here?  Would he instruct the National Planning Board not to wait until April, but to give him some immediate proposals to deal with unemployment which is now at a critical stage?  Industry is falling apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A question, please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1795" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot wait until April for conditions to improve.  Would the Taoiseach ask the Planning Board to give him specific measures in the next week or two, to try to reduce unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that that would be a sensible way to proceed.  The board's terms of reference are available to the House and set out what we have asked them to do.  That is in the context of preparing a medium-term economic programme and to attempt to divert them from that task to produce <i>ad hoc</i> solutions in reaction to particular figures would be inappropriate and foolish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the figures published yesterday demonstrate a very drastic situation? When the numbers were 50,000 less, he described it as a disaster.  With 50,000 more, it is obviously more of a disaster.  Therefore, pretty urgent measures are necessary, not measures which will be part of a mid-term plan.  Before the Taoiseach replies to that question, he announced some time ago the setting up of a ministerial task force to tackle unemployment. How many meetings have they held and what progress have they made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, I would need notice of the question to ascertain precisely when the meetings were held.  The task force have made progress and have announced some schemes already.  They have at the moment other schemes under consideration, some of which will mature in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>With regard to the planning board, I do not think that they should be diverted from their function.  I recognise that the unemployment figures in December and January have shown a sharp increase.  As in preceding months since March, the increase for these two months has been less than for the same period last year. We can take only limited consolation from that in view of the magnitude of the rise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach please outline to the House what steps his Government have taken since coming into office 14 months ago to create jobs for adults and young people? How many have been created by this Government in that time?  What steps do his Government intend to take in view of the fact that the total figure has gone up by 45,000 since they assumed office and that the number of young people unemployed has grown by 20,000?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result various State bodies were misled into scales of investment which have involved hundreds of millions of pounds, indeed I would estimate probably about one-and-a-half billion pounds of expenditure, which has been either wasted or was premature.  Therefore, I do not propose to follow that particular course.  The budget contained a number of measures related to employment.  Details of them will be found set out in that part of my speech which deals with the employment generating effects of the budget and I would refer the Deputy to it.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach read the Programme for Government which his Coalition partners put together when he said that they would take decisive action in relation to unemployment?  Will he now take responsibility for the 45,000 people who have become unemployed since he became Taoiseach since 14 December 1982?  Furthermore, is he aware that 17,500 people aged under 25 years became unemployed since he became Taoiseach?  Will he state one step which he has taken to create one job for our people?</P>

      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's statement today, and I quote him, when he said that it is impossible to say when the Government will issue their own proposals &mdash; will the Taoiseach reconcile that statement with the one made in the joint programme of over 14 months ago when unemployment stood at 45,000 less than it is now?  At that point the Government were proposing and promising firm and decisive action &mdash; 14 months ago &mdash; and the Taoiseach is today telling us that it is impossible to say when the Government will issue their own proposals. I might add one further question: in the statement issued by the Government yesterday in response to this latest appalling increase in unemployment, it was said and I quote it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when it was said that the only means, in the view of the Government to deal with this appalling human problem is improved competitiveness.

      <P>On the second question, with regard to measures designed to create employment by improving competitiveness, yes.  On the first question, with regard to the difficulty of saying when we will produce our own plan, I hope that the wording there does not suggest that there will be any delay in that.  It is impossible to say precisely &mdash; because until we have the text of the national plan, the draft that we will receive from the National Planning Board, we cannot say exactly how long it will take the Government to examine this and produce their proposals.  However, I have pointed out to the Government today, when we receive this document, the urgency of proceeding very rapidly to produce the plan based on that document. I can assure the Deputy that there <Col N="1801" /> will be no delay and that it will come out as soon as possible afterwards.  But, until we see the text, one cannot be precise about the exact amount of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that precise point, would the Taoiseach agree with me and the House that the primary responsibility in an area of major social and economic importance such as employment and particularly that of our young people, must relate to the Government of the day through the instrument of the budget? Would the Taoiseach further agree that in the budget statement of his Minister for Finance there was no reference whatever to this serious problem now looming larger and larger?  Finally would the Taoiseach agree that submitting this sort of serious matter, for which the Government bear primary responsibility, to a quango, such as the National Planning Board, constitutes no real answer to the problem and is an indication of the abdication of the Government with regard to their primary responsibility in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have primary responsibility and will take it. However, the Government believe &mdash; whatever people on the other side of the House may believe &mdash; that they do not have all the wisdom in these matters, that it is useful to get advice from bodies of this kind and to build on it.  Indeed that was how this country's initial economic recovery from the disastrous stagnation of the fifties was generated, on the basis of a document prepared by Dr. Whitaker, on his advice to the Government of the day, published by the Government and made the foundation of the First Economic Programme.  At this stage does the Deputy repudiate that and say that that was a wrong way to proceed?  I do not think he does.</P>

      <P>In view of the very tragic nature of the figures released yesterday and the very human, critical story they tell of the many thousands of our people, would the Taoiseach consider doing two things: first of all, bringing forward urgently sections of this plan, or the plan itself, as a short-term measure to tackle the tragedy of yesterday's figures? Secondly, would he bring forward quickly some proposals of his task force to put a hole in this?  It is not a matter of politics, it is a matter of human tragedy faced by thousands of people on the streets of Ireland today.</P>

      <P>I accept the sincerity of the point the Deputy made.  I am glad to avail of the opportunity to make a clear distinction between the work of the National Planning Board, which while primarily directed towards the question of employment is directed at it in the context of the medium-term, and the Government's responsibility for doing what it is possible to do in the short-term to deal with the problem, which included a number of other measures in the budget related to the industrial sector which received much welcome from that sector. It also includes other measures which will <Col N="1803" /> be announced by the task force which has responsibility for bringing forward proposals in the interim, pending the preparation of the medium-term plan.  I am glad to have had the opportunity of making that clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>Grants are made from the Special Border Areas Programme Fund to the IDA and Údarás na Gaeltachta for the establishment and development of craft industries in the Border counties.</P>
      <P>Grant payments totalling £155,832 for the development of craft industries in Border counties have been made by the IDA and Údarás na Gaeltachta under the programme.  The take-up of such grant assistance is, of course, determined to a large extent by the initiative of persons concerned in submitting suitable projects.</P>
      <P>At present the IDA are also constructing, with funds from the Special Border Areas Programme Fund, a craft centre near Donegal town which will provide work units for craft operators and an outlet for their finished products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards facilitating students who have an interest in craft manufacturing, I understand that AnCO and the VECs have run some courses in the craft field in the Border counties.  While the introduction <Col N="1804" /> of such courses is largely determined by the demand for them, I will bring the Deputy's question to the attention of the relevant authorities to see whether any further development of these courses would be appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure that Government agencies with responsibility for administering such funds will be monitored very closely?  To date I do not believe they have made every effort to ensure that the £5 million allocated is used to the best advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The take-up of these funds is determined to a large extent by the initiative of persons concerned in submitting suitable projects.  To that extent, of course, we have to wait for the demand.  On the other hand, I will certainly give the Deputy every assurance that all the agencies involved will make the utmost efforts to make sure that everybody knows what the facilities are under the fund so that people who have such ideas will be able to bring them forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, under the criteria laid down, only local authorities and Government agencies have the responsibility for administering this fund?  Is it not time that other involved and interested bodies should get an opportunity to make an input?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent other interested bodies who have an input to make from doing so.  We have discussed on at least two previous occasions during Question Time the administration of this fund and, since those discussions, I have not changed my mind about the administration of the fund except to repeat that if there are bodies other than those directly involved in the administration who feel that they have an input to make, they know by now after all the exposure the matter has got here, who they should talk to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

However, V A T law contains a number of measures aimed at providing relief for the estimated amount of VAT borne by farmers on their purchases of goods and services and it is considered that the amount of relief granted under these measures is approximately equal to the VAT borne.  In the case of farmers registered for the tax, relief is allowed by direct claim by the farmer in his VAT returns.  In the case of unregistered farmers, relief is allowed through the flat-rate compensation system operated through traders purchasing farmers' output.</P>

      <P>No bookmaker's licence was revoked as a result of these convictions and no licences were revoked in those years for any other reason.

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the amount of illegal betting is rather high &mdash; some people estimate that 80 per cent of all betting is illegal?  Does this explain why the <i>per capita</i> amount spent on gambling in Ireland is only half of that spent in the UK and one-third of what is spent in Northern Ireland?  We all know that a higher amount is spent in gambling here as compared with the UK and yet the returns show that we spend only half the <i>per capita</i> amount compared with the UK.  Does the Minister agree that this bears out the suggestion that as much as 80 per cent of our gambling is done on an illegal basis and that the Minister, therefore, is getting tax only on 20 per cent of the betting total?</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that there is a substantial problem in relation to illegal betting here.  However, it would be highly speculative to put a figure on it and using crude amounts of money <i>per capita</i> would not necessarily give a proper indication of the amount as there would have to be adjustments made for differences in income levels <i>per capita</i> and other factors.

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the extra Exchequer revenue collected in 1983 as a result of the tax avoidance measures implemented during the past year; the total number of extra staff employed in implementing these measures; the cost of implementing these measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to the measures which I introduced in the Finance Act, 1983, to deal with tax evasion and to impose increased penalties for a wide range of Revenue offences.</P>
      <P>These measures were enacted in order to give the Revenue Commissioners additional powers to carry out their duties in countering tax evasion.  The question of providing staff for specific implementation of these measures did not arise.  The use of the new powers is an integral part of the pursuit of evasion and cannot be distinguished in the general process of the administration of taxes.  It is not, therefore, possible to separate the cost of implementing these measures from the cost of the other operations in which the office is engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The package of Finance Act measures included stricter provisions with regard to the admission of late appeals, terminating the hearing of Supreme Court and High Court proceedings <i>in camera</i> and improved arrangements for reporting details of deposit interest, nominee shareholdings and returns of property. There was also provision for the publication of names of defaulters.  There were a number of other provisions and administrative <Col N="1809" /> arrangements have also been made for reporting to the Revenue Commissioners particulars of payments made by Government Departments and public authorities.  I am at present considering requiring the production by firms of a tax clearance certificate as a condition of obtaining public contracts.</P>
    <P>This was a wide-ranging series of measures which must necessarily contribute in a major way to the overall operations in the anti-evasion area.  The nature of the activities against which these measures are directed is such that it would not be possible to isolate a particular amount in the overall increase in the tax revenue as being attributable to any or all of the measures.</P>

      <P>I am not telling the House anything of the kind.  We provided for an increase of 104 in the total staff of the Revenue Commissioners.  As I explained, because of the nature of the measures it is not possible to put an exact or even an approximate figure on what the result of the operation of the measures would be.  Because of their nature some of these measures would not begin to produce extra revenue until the end of the procedures in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to formulate a precise target for new jobs in 1984 because of the uncertainty regarding the pace of international recovery and its likely impact on the domestic economy. Even with favourable external developments, the extent to which employment can be expanded to absorb the labour force increase and reduce unemployment will depend on the success of efforts to improve competitiveness and expand productive investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously telling the House that because of the uncertainty, as he called it, in the international climate &mdash; which, incidently is improving &mdash; it is not possible for the Government to set precise targets for this <Col N="1813" /> year?  Is he seriously saying we have to wait until all this happens before we get precise targets?  In view of the Taoiseach's statement in the House a few moments ago that the December and January figures have shown a sharp increase in the level of unemployment, how can the Minister reconcile that statement with his own statement on budget day, less than two weeks ago that the unemployment trend has already improved?

I have no difficulty whatsoever in reconciling what I have just said with the Taoiseach's statement earlier this afternoon and my own statement on budget day.  I said in reply to this question that we cannot formulate a precise target for new jobs in 1984 because we do not know what the total effect of the international recovery is likely to be on our domestic economy, nor can we forecast at this point the effect of improving competitiveness and productive investment. I ask the House not to be led into the very simple and apparently attractive process of saying that in this year we will set out to create whatever number of new jobs it is felt desirable that we should create.  We have had efforts like that in the past.  They have not worked out because there is no way a Government, or a sector, or a firm, can give a guarantee at the beginning of the year on how many jobs they will be able to create or maintain for the remainder of the year.  I am bound to say questions of that kind miss the point of the total business of planning.</P>

      <P>The country would be very surprised if we were to get a guarantee from the Government as to the number of jobs.  Does the Minister not think that the public, particularly the unemployed, are entitled to expect that there will at least be a target?  Is the Minister not aware that the IDA seem to have a target of 1,000 jobs in manufacturing <Col N="1814" /> industry this year?  If that is their target, will the Minister not acknowledge that it is not in any way adequate to meet the continuing increase in unemployment, particularly among young people? Every month the Government say that competitiveness is the only answer but surely lack of competitiveness cannot be charged against the 67,633 young people recorded as being unemployed, never mind those young people whose names do not appear because they have never had a job.  Can they be accused of undermining the potential for employment through lack of competitiveness when they do not even have jobs?  Will the Minister not wake up to the reality that we must have a plan?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not.  If we were to arrest the growth in unemployment we would need to create about 20,000 new jobs net per annum.  The way to create anything like that number of new jobs is to make goods and services produced here more competitive.  If the Deputy regards that as cant, that is his affair.  He was the one who first talked about cant. It is the fact that we do not have that competitive edge which has resulted in the present level of unemployment and if the Deputy seriously wants to make the case here or elsewhere that our level of competitiveness does not matter and is not what determines the level of unemployment, then he is welcome to it and the best of luck to him.

What I have called cant is the statement by the Government that it is the only factor.  There is a great distinction <Col N="1816" /> and the Minister will not misrepresent me in this.  Competitiveness is vitally important but it is not the only factor.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to an article in the media (details supplied) indicating an unrecorded outflow of £800 million from the country in 1983; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the newspaper <Col N="1817" /> article to which the Deputy refers.  The article quotes the residual amount in the balance of payments estimate for the period from end-1982 to mid-November 1983, as set out in the Central Bank's Winter Bulletin, 1983 and it speculates on its composition.  As pointed out in &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget 1984&rdquo;, the coverage of the statistics for the international balance of payments is being reviewed by the Central Statistics Office and the results, which should be available later this year, could require the estimates of the current account deficit for recent years to be revised.  However, the revisions are unlikely to alter significantly the improvement in the trend to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant that the Minister is acknowledging that there may be need for revision.  Does he agree that the article specifically points out that there is a black hole in terms of outflows in view of the fact that the net public sector external financing has increased by £959 million, net inflows to banks have increased by £500 million and that what turns up as being an increase in external reserves of only £285 million should be an increase of over £1.1 billion?  Does the Minister not acknowledge that there was an unrecorded and unexplained outflow of £800 million last year and that this is a matter of very serious concern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the residual figure has been referred to not just in that most recent article but by the Central Bank in their autumn 1983 quarterly bulletin and by the OECD in their economic survey of Ireland.  The bank pointed out in their most recent quarterly bulletin that the residual figure of necessity also reflects, as well as private capital outflows, the sum of errors in the balance of payments including the under-estimation of the current deficit due, for example, to unrecorded trade with Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emergence of a residual item of that kind in the balance of payments is not a recent development.  There has been a substantial negative residual in the balance of payments statement for <Col N="1818" /> several years.  There is possibly a wider problem of definition.  It is quite a common thing to find residuals of this kind in the balance of payments figures.  In some countries they are very large.  The OECD recently estimated that for the world as a whole there is a discrepancy on current account balance in the order of $100 billion while on classic definitions there should be no discrepancy whatever because the flows should even out.  As to the reasons for the level of the residual flow and changes in the residual flow in recent years, we could speculate about the different factors involved, for example, the narrowing of interest rate differentials <i>vis-á-vis</i> other countries and expectations about the likely future pattern of exchange rates, both of the punt and of other currencies.</P>
    <P>There is also a factor which can affect this, the change in practices in relation to trade credit from suppliers.  As I pointed out in my initial response to the Deputy, the existence of this residual and the composition of it is being reviewed by the CSO.  I hope that some time later in the year we will have the basis on which any revisions which may be necessary in the current account deficit figures will be clarified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister has indicated that the existence of this residual is not new this year he must acknowledge that the scale of it is altogether larger and more alarming than anything that has ever been indicated before this.  Does the Minister not acknowledge that the reason for the alarming growth in this unrecorded residual is as a consequence of policies?  He mentioned the unrecorded trade with Northern Ireland, which everyone is very much aware of, the repatriation of profits by multinationals because of the bad investment climate here &mdash;&mdash;</P>

Does he not acknowledge that this particular Deputy has not made any comment on the bond washing, which is referred to in that article as one of the elements involved?  Does the Minister not recall that when he charges me with irresponsibility that his Taoiseach &mdash; I am not so sure that the Minister had responsibility at the time &mdash; after my budget indicated that a very small drop in the price of gilts the following day was evidence of a total undermining of confidence in the country?  That is what they said that day but what has happened now is very much more serious.  I, as spokesman for Finance for my party, have not even made any critical comments.  The Minister should never again accuse me of any degree of irresponsibility like that. He should go back to his Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say if the information contained in the tabular statement shows considerable acceleration of borrowing by State companies in the last year?  Is he concerned about that acceleration?  Is he now aware that semi-State companies account for £1.5 billion of the total borrowing of some £6 billion, and that they now account for 25 per cent of all foreign borrowing in the State?  Is he satisfied with that situation? Will he confirm that it has accelerated considerably in 12 months?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister share my concern at the rise?  No doubt he has the tabular statement in front of him and a quick glance will show him that what I am suggesting is actually the situation and he should be concerned about it.  An increasing proportion of State foreign borrowing is coming through semi-State companies.  That to me is a matter of concern because it is not announced in the annual budget and the Minister should be concerned about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing procedures are effective in ensuring full co-ordination of the foreign borrowings of semi-State companies.  Each semi-State company may borrow only with the approval of the relevant Minister and the Minister for Finance.  Before such approval is given great care is taken in ensuring firstly, that the borrowing activities of the semi-State companies concerned, whether foreign or domestic, cannot conflict either with each other or with the Exchequer and, secondly, that the best possible terms are obtained in each case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister look at a suggestion which will entail a better co-ordination of the borrowings of the semi-State companies, whether a borrowing situation might be considered and, more particularly, whether companies that are earning foreign revenue might co-operate with those semi-State companies which are repaying loans in foreign exchange?  Will the Minister look at a situation like that because I am not happy that the thing is co-ordinated to the best effect?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern about getting the best value for money in borrowing of this kind.  As I said, I consider the existing arrangements for a co-ordination of borrowing of this kind to be effective.  We have got a procedure which ensures that the semi-State companies, to the extent that they are borrowing abroad, get the best terms available.  They have been known on occasion to get rather better terms than the Government get for particular types of borrowing owing to movement in the market.  I do not think that bulk borrowing would necessarily get a better deal because that would lose us the advantages of tailoring the particular terms to the needs of the company in question.</P>

The Government are satisfied that the British authorities are fully aware of the Government's view.</P>
      <P>A message on behalf of the British Government was delivered orally to the Department of Foreign Affairs at official level this morning which confirmed the statement issued on Saturday last by the British authorities and which stated that while the British Government regretted the controversy which the visit had created, they had no choice but to respond in the terms used in their public statement.</P>

Unfortunately, this is one of the problems that makes such difficulties between the Irish and United Kingdom Governments.

      <P>At this stage I should point out that there have been many visits to the North of Ireland over a great number of years by members of the British Royal Family which did not provoke the kind of response from various Governments here that we felt was necessary last week-end.  It was only because of the sensitivity in relation to the barracks which the Duke of Edinburgh chose to visit last Friday that we felt it necessary to make our views known to the British Government.  If such a comparable set of incidents should occur in the future the Deputy can take it that the Government would consider their response and it might be along the same lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put a final supplementary to the Minister because this is a matter of great significance and importance to us all.  Does the Minister for Foreign Affairs attach, as I do, significance to the fact that there was a visit by the British Prime Minister to this locality followed by a statement by the British Secretary for Northern Ireland, Mr. Prior, to the effect that the unity of Ireland should not be contemplated in the foreseeable future, followed by this visit by a member of the British Royal Family?  Does the Minister see these as inter-related?  Does he see them as an attempted indication by the British Government that we in this part of the country, and the Irish Government in particular, should not be attempting to pursue a change in the situation in Northern Ireland with a view to the unification of this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not.  I see them <Col N="1828" /> as three entirely separate things.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West)</i>: The budget has been described as a non-event not alone by this side of the House but in some sections of the media.  Listening to the contributions from the Government benches, one would imagine that there has been a big reduction in unemployment, but the January figures indicate that unemployment has increased by 7,000.  The Minister for the Environment told us about a major achievement last year, with a substantial reduction in inflation, a massive improvement in the balance of payments and a significant increase in industrial output.  He said that there has been a slowing down in the growth in unemployment.  Of course he was not aware at that time of the increase in the figure.  He told us that the budget strategy will ensure a continuation of this. One does not know whether he means a growth in unemployment or an upturn in employment.  He said the budget would create a climate for job creation.</P>
      <P>The building trade has never been so bad.  Thousands of men have been laid off since the Government took office and the remainder are on a three-day week or a week on and a week off.  People who have worked all their lives in the building trade say it has never been in such a depressed state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There does not seem to be any plan in the budget to encourage people to be set up in business.  Some Government Departments should take responsibility to improve the food industry.  Fewer food items bearing the Irish brand can be seen in shops here today than those processed in Britain and continental countries.  I do not think the Government have seen the need to develop small industries because they have done nothing in this respect in the past year.  They say it is impossible to attract foreign industry at a time when we should be encouraging new industries, and our own people particularly.  It is unfortunate that if our people set up businesses they will be crippled with taxation <Col N="1898" /> and the high rate of VAT.  They will simply become tax collectors.</P>
    <P>Since the Government took office the Revenue Commissioners have been behaving like vultures.  They are snooping into people's businesses.  The same can be said about social welfare inspectors who are moving into businesses, particularly in regard to the small farmers. Their actions could be described as an infringement of privacy.  Senator Higgins of Fine Gael recently expressed his concern about this in a statement to the media.  I would remind him that this has been happening since the present Government took office.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House did not object to the introduction of the youth levy because we thought the Government were sincere, that the levy would be used to increase youth employment.  However, £11½ million from the fund has been transferred to balance the Government's books, all of it deducted from the pay packets of those who work, and contributed by employers, for the sole purpose of creating youth employment. The Taoiseach said on one occasion that the creation of jobs was a priority of the Government but he also said that their priority was to reduce our debt, and that unemployment would have to wait.</P>
    <P>Many people are concerned about crime and vandalism, particularly in our cities.  The high incidence of crime and unemployment are interlinked.  Young people who are unemployed become depressed.  Since the Government took office they see no hope for the future. The Government put an embargo on recruitment in the public service and as a result vacancies are not being filled. Even recruitment to the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána has been stopped.  I hope this will not give rise to a situation we had under a former Coalition Government of one-man squad cars.  At that time there were many squad cars and motor cycles parked outside Garda stations with nobody to use them. When Fianna Fáil came back to office they changed all that.  They had a massive Garda recruitment campaign.  There was an increase in the number of gardaí on <Col N="1899" /> the street and squad cars were manned by two gardaí.</P>
    <P>I was born in the west and I am very disappointed that the Government did not allocate the required £3½ million to complete Knock Airport.  Many people, particularly business people, looked forward to the opening of this airport.  One of our biggest meat exporters is located in the west.  He was particularly disappointed at the Government's decision. Monsignor Horan has done great work since he was appointed to Knock.  He turned Knock into an international shrine and he was responsible for bringing the Pope to this country.  The Government have shown no appreciation for all the work he has done.  He uplifted the west. If the airport was completed thousands of people would come and it would be a great boost for tourism.  People who wished to see Knock would have been able to travel directly to it.  It seems as if the Government are not concerned about the people in the west.</P>
    <P>As regards social welfare payments, when a husband deserts a wife and she can prove that she does not know where he is she is entitled to deserted wife's benefit.  That is not the case where a wife's deserts a husband.  In this case the husband is penalised since he is taxed as a single man.  In my constituency there is a case where a wife deserted a husband and left him with seven young children.  He is responsible for rearing and educating the children.  He is taxed as a single man.  I hope the Minister will look into this matter because it is a serious problem.  In the past we heard a lot about discrimination against women but this is a case of discrimination against a man simply because he is a man.  I hope the Minister will do something about this.</P>
    <P>Our industrial and business outlets are unable to compete with those in Northern Ireland, England and other European countries.  Deputy McGahon, in a statement to the press recently, expressed his concern about the number of coaches going through his constituency on their way to the North.  I share his concern. According to reports, people from the South spend £2½ million per week in the <Col N="1900" /> North.  The Deputy should have thought about that before walking into the Government lobbies and voting for this budget, which will increase the number of people travelling to the North.  The 8 per cent VAT on clothing will ensure that more people will travel to the North.  The increase in the number of clothing industries which were forced to close here in the last year is quite evident.  This number will increase now that people will have to pay 8 per cent VAT on clothes.</P>
    <P>We hear great talk from the Government side about the increase in social welfare payments.  The 7 per cent increase becomes effective from 1 July while increases in income tax are effective overnight.  It has been suggested by Government speakers that there is only limited scope in the present economic climate for tax concessions.  The cutbacks in social welfare and in medical cards is a regular occurrence.  I recall the outburst by the Minister for Health when the then Minister, Deputy Woods, announced a reduction in the number of items available on the medical card.  He made this reduction because he was aware of abuses.  The present Minister described his action as outrageous.  He said it was a war against the poor and the working class and that when his party came to power they would restore medical cards to old people.</P>
    <P>The decision by the Eastern Health Board to transfer one of the dentists who operates in Ballymun is of great concern to the local people.  This matter was raised during the week.  I know the Deputy who raised it was ruled out of order.  I hope I am in order in bringing the matter to the attention of the Minister now.  As a result of this decision there is only one dentist to look after the whole area of Ballymun which has a population equivalent to that of three counties.</P>
    <P>Although there are two dentists there, there is a long waiting list for treatment and the decision of the Minister and of the Eastern Health Board will increase out of all proportion the number of people on the waiting list.  I am appealing to the Minister to have this matter examined with a view to the permanent <Col N="1901" /> appointment of a replacement dentist to serve the people of Ballymun.  People who have inquired from the Eastern Health Board about the situation have been informed that because of Government cutbacks only one dentist will be available for the Ballymun area but that there will be another dentist operating on an on-off basis.  That is not an acceptable situation.</P>
    <P>While Fianna Fáil were in power and while Deputy Woods was Minister for Health every person reaching the age of 65 had automatic entitlement to a medical card and the same situation applied to students, but now, despite the high costs involved for parents in sending their children to second and third level education, medical cards are to be withdrawn from students.  It is true that the facility was not used extensively by young people but the explanation from the Government side is rather strange.  Some people opposite have said that parents who can afford to send their children to second or third level education must be rich and, consequently, in a position to pay for medical services for their children.  That is a peculiar explanation from a Government who are supposed to be a caring Government and who promised to look after the less well off.  Apart from the loss of the medical card facility, most students now have to pay the full cost of school transport. One must compare this situation with the record of Fianna Fáil in the field of education. Fianna Fáil in Government introduced free education.  Since the coming into office of this Government there has been an increase, too, in the fees in respect of the leaving certificate examination.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from the budget speech that the Government have no financial or economic targets.  We must all be seriously concerned with what happened on the Stock Exchange last week.  That financial crisis was an indication of a serious lack of confidence in the Government. It is for the Minister to ascertain the areas in which there are tax loopholes but he must decide where lie the best interests of the Exchequer.  At all times the Irish money market must be strengthened <Col N="1902" /> and developed and be seen as a basis of trust and confidence.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance tells us repeatedly that our level of foreign borrowing is too high and that the Government are trying to reduce the budget deficit at the rate at which they are committed to reducing it.  Continually, they blame Fianna Fáil for the whole problem in relation to borrowing and several members of the Government have stated that our party in Government were responsible for creating the high deficits. Because of these accusations I was pleased that our leader, Deputy Haughey, was able to come here and give facts and figures to clarify the situation. He was able to tell us, for instance, that between 1974 and 1976 the debt rose by between 80 and 90 per cent.  These were years in which another Coalition were in power.  They were years during which budget debts and borrowing soared.</P>
    <P>The high rates of VAT and excise duties are a matter of great concern especially in the business and industrial world. Such a situation provides no encouragement to employers to give employment. The television and radio business is collapsing. Many outlets in that trade are being forced to close as a result of the high VAT rates and high excise duty.  On a recent television programme we heard that the excise duty on a television set here is £120 and that in addition VAT at 23 per cent must be charged on the total. This puts the price of an ordinary television set up to double the price at which it can be purchased in the North.</P>
    <P>A similar situation prevails in the motor trade.  The number of people involved in that trade has reduced drastically in the past year.  In Great Britain and in Northern Ireland there are two rates of VAT whereas there are at least four in this country.  Our high rates of VAT are destroying any incentive there might be for people to stay in business. The increase in the price of petrol will mean an increase also in the cost of living generally.  Many of my constituents tell me they find since the budget that foodstuffs are increasing daily.  Obviously, the increased cost of delivering goods consequent <Col N="1903" /> on the increased petrol prices is in turn being passed on to the customer.</P>
    <P>The number of closures in the business world has had a big impact on employment. The Minister should have had regard to this and should have to some extent reduced the VAT rates and the excise duty.  He should now review the situation.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government they set up a warning system that was designed to give an indication of firms who were experiencing difficulty. I do not know whether that system is being operated.  In the past year or so some long-established firms have gone to the wall.  In Cork alone the situation has been very bad with the closure of Fords and of Dunlops.  There has been the closure also of the Scarriff chipboard factory, of Clondalkin Paper Mills and of Ranks Flour Mills.  Exceptional efforts should have been made by the Government to prevent these industries from closing.  We now have a situation in which all our paper, chipboard and flour requirements are imported.  I am reliably informed that the reason Ranks decided to close here was that they could import flour £20 per tonne cheaper and they were not prepared to remain open.  The proprietors and management of industry have a duty to employees and to the community to make every effort to keep industry going.  The Government share that responsibility.</P>
    <P>When Fine Gael and Labour came into Government unemployment was around 170,000 and in their joint programme they promised to deal with the problem. In a statement issued at that time the Taoiseach said unemployment was the first priority for the Government.  We have heard about the task force to deal with unemployment but we wonder what it is doing.  Since this Government took office the unemployment figure has increased by 45,000.</P>
    <P>The Government are concerned only with a bookkeeping exercise and this was obvious in the case of £11,500,000 that was supposed to create jobs for young people.  Instead, it was transferred to the Government to help them to balance the books.  The Coalition parties must be <Col N="1904" /> aware of their unpopularity with the public even though the recent poll might have indicated to them that they were making progress.  I have no confidence in these polls.  The real indicator was the result of the Dublin Central by-election.  This was an area in which the Labour Party held a seat for many years but in that election they were in fifth place behind the Communist Party.  That must be a matter of grave concern to the Labour Party members in Government.  It was an indication of what the people thought of the Labour Party and of their performance in Government.  I have no doubt that the result of that by-election was the real reason for the postponement of the local elections.</P>
    <P>The general opinion is that this budget was an non-event.  It reminded me of a magician who comes out on stage empty-handed, after a few minutes on stage he produces various items such as coloured handkerchiefs, pigeons and rabbits but at the end of the show all these things disappear and the magician walks away empty-handed, the same as when he came on stage.  That is the way I would describe this budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to respond to some of the points made by Deputy Barrett.  Quite rightly he mentioned the concern that there might be discrimination against anyone in the social welfare system on grounds of sex and I share that concern.  I would point out that the Government have indicated clearly &mdash; and the Minister for Finance also indicated this in this debate &mdash; their intention to implement the EEC directive on the equalisation of social welfare.  This will be enacted by way of legislation before the end of the year, thus complying in full with the EEC directive.  The Deputy was quite right to say unintentional areas of discrimination that arise as a result of a provision to deal with one problem should be ironed out. He said that there were cuts in medical cards for the old and for the young.  I must remind the Deputy that in the budget speech it was announced that far from cuts in medical cards for the elderly a special allowance is being introduced <Col N="1905" /> for them.  In the income guidelines for medical cards there is a special allowance of £5 for a single person aged 66 years and over and £8 if the person is over 80 years.  For a married couple there is a special allowance in the income guidelines of £10 for those aged 66 years and over and £16 for those aged over 80 years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett mentioned the case of people whose children heretofore travelled free on school transport.  Those charges were designed by Fianna Fáil but without the special hardship provisions on which I insisted.  Deputy Barrett is once more engaging in the Fianna Fáil tradition of turning their back on their own Estimates.  With regard to examination fees which were referred to by the Deputy, when Fianna Fáil increased the examination fees they did so without any hardship fund which I introduced this year for the first time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the £11,500,000 transferred to the educational system from the Youth Employment Agency.  It is important to point out that this sum went into the area of pre-employment courses in the vocational system.  These courses are directly related to the work of the Youth Employment Agency and are most necessary if young people are to have a chance of finding work.  That is a very good use for those funds.</P>
      <P>I believe that the 1984 budget will make an important contribution to regulating our financial affairs and at the same time allowing for the gradual but steady improvement in our economic fortunes. It has been described &mdash; by the Minister for Finance himself &mdash; as a &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; budget.  It represents a finely tuned balance between the many demands to be met, many of which are in perpetual potential conflict with one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there will be criticisms &mdash; no budget can avoid that.  We are all familiar enough with the many calls on Government for a special hearing, motivated &mdash; not necessarily improperly &mdash; by the particular interests of the group in question.  Some would have us spend more; others less.  Some would have us tax more or in another way; others cry for an easing of the tax burden.  Amidst <Col N="1906" /> the myriad demands the Government must walk the tightrope and exercise a considered judgment about which policies to pursue.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, widely recognised that the scope for manoeuvre in financial decision-making is greatly constrained &mdash; principally because of our massive debt problems which others have wished upon us.  We are all only too conscious of the calls to cut public spending &mdash; and that is an option to be grappled with if we are to achieve the room to allow for tax reform.  Yet no one should underestimate the difficulties which trying to cut public spending pose &mdash; and I do not mean political difficulties or the problem of facing unpopular decisions.</P>
    <P>Having sat at the Cabinet table with my colleagues and looked very closely at all areas of spending I know only too well where the money is going and I also know how much that money is needed and the extent to which the services provided are depended upon by so many people.  I am particularly conscious, for instance, of how much this is the case in my own area of special responsibility &mdash; education.  It is all very well to talk of having to cut back, as many Fianna Fáil Deputies said, on large spending Departments such as Education but one cannot send children away saying that we cannot afford to educate them until times are better.  I have heard the calls for less overall spending often enough but I do not hear people prepared to identify which educational services we can afford to do without. As a people, we rightly value our educational system.  Although I am convinced that everyone wants the best service possible, I also know that everyone will agree that we must have the most efficient system possible, and that means planning our priorities carefully.</P>
    <P>The budget itself is the final piece of the jigsaw which reveals the overall financial intentions of the Government.  The specific proposals announced by the Minister for Finance on budget day must be judged in association with provisions in the Book of Estimates and the Public Capital Programme.  This is where I believe the careful balance can be seen at work for 1984.  We have moved in the <Col N="1907" /> direction of making some crucial and necessary reforms, yet have planned spending in such a way as to protect essential services and basic living standards &mdash; and above all to protect employment.  In many cases, particularly education once again, cost-cutting would lead to a loss of jobs and thus this option has not been taken.  At the same time spending must be curtailed within the obvious limits imposed by what the country can afford, that is, by what the taxpayer has the will, or should be asked, to pay for.</P>
    <P>It is fitting at this time to look at how the education system is faring.  Let me assure all as we enter 1984 that the education system is alive and well and receiving a generous share of the nation's financial cake.  Twenty years ago public funding on education amounted to £25.4 million representing 14.8 per cent of total public expenditure.  This year we will be spending a nett £924 million on education, or 16.5 per cent of total Government expenditure.  This is well above average on any international comparison. That we have reached this level of funding of education is a tribute to successive Governments who saw a well educated people as potentially our greatest national asset.</P>
    <P>By way of further comparison, I was struck recently by some statistics from the 1966 population census.  At that time some 60 per cent of the adult population had only primary education, and only 73,000 in all had any third level qualification. Current figures for direct comparison are not available but the progress made since then may be gauged from the level of attainment of those leaving the education system in 1982.  Of the 62,000 who left school in that year, 5,500 had no qualification, 16,600 had reached group or intermediate certificate and a high 64 per cent or 39,900 leavers, had reached leaving certificate.  Thirty eight per cent of those completing leaving certificate last year have proceeded to third level programmes.  This is a quite remarkable level of transfer to third level education. Ten years ago it was about 26 per cent but at that time the number completing the leaving certificate was only half the <Col N="1908" /> current numbers.  As a result, we now have over 11,000 students annually leaving the education system with a third level qualification.  These increased student outputs at second and third level have been part of a quite dramatic increase in enrolments&mdash;student numbers in second level schools increased from 143,000 in 1966 to 325,000 in 1983 and from 20,700 to 47,000 in third level institutions.  Of particular importance is that the development of the third level sector has focused attention on ensuring our capacity to meet the economy's demand for technicians and technologists.  It may be of interest to know that about 70 per cent of all students in third level aided institutions, other than colleges of education, now follow science or engineering or commercial programmes.</P>
    <P>The figures I have given above will illustrate that we are now at a point where the education system is quantitatively well-developed.  Further quantitative development is likely to be at a much more modest pace, generally in line with population growth.  Overall we may expect enrolment growth of about 5 per cent over the next five years, though with the possibility of much higher growth in percentage terms at the third level.  I should say that we cannot predict with any certainty the degree to which the present high transfer rates to third level will continue &mdash; for example, whether they will be affected by improved job prospects for leaving certificants in the future.  However, let me make one thing quite clear.  The Government intend to make third level education available to as many young people as possible and in doing this will give special emphasis to science and technology.  They are already giving ample evidence of this commitment.</P>
    <P>Construction of the second phase of the development of the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick is well advanced and when completed will double the capacity of the institute.  The further development of the NIHE in Dublin has also been approved to provide an additional 400 places.  A succeeding phase of development will add a further 1,000 places.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1909" /> As the House will be aware, a £7 million development for Tralee Regional Technical College has recently been approved.  Planning of extensions to the Dublin Colleges of Technology in Kevin Street and Bolton Street is now well advanced while planning of a new College of Marketing and Design is underway.  These developments will meet inadequacies in existing accommodation but will also provide an extra 1,200 places.  Arrangements are now being finalised for the acquisition of a site for the regional technical college in Blanchardstown. Sites have been acquired already in Tallaght and Dún Laoghaire and planning of the colleges for these three locations will commence this year.  The three colleges would provide between them 3,000 new places.  A review of accommodation needs at existing regional technical colleges is underway.</P>
    <P>I have already assured the authorities of Cork Regional Technical College that planning of an extension will commence as soon as the present constructive dialogue with them indicates the additional accommodation needed.  All of these projects have as their major aim the provision of additional places.  There will be other projects approved according as the financial capacity to meet them is determined in the context of the overall Public Capital Programme.  What this Government will not do is to embark on projects or promise projects with a total disregard for the financial consequences.</P>
    <P>As part of a Government effort to determine where we are going in all sectors, a full costing of all proposed third level projects was undertaken, both for designated institutions under the HEA and non-designated institutions.  We came up with a startling £240 million as the amount required for these projects by 1990.  In view of this it would be irresponsible to proceed on the basis that funds would be available for all of these projects in the short-term, no matter how desirable they may be individually.  At least now we have a picture which will enable us with the HEA to establish priorities, with special emphasis on the provision of new places, when the level <Col N="1910" /> of possible funding is known later this year.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to another aspect of educational provision, and, I venture to say, a much more important element at this stage, that of the quality of our education service.  Here my expectations are high in view of two important recent events &mdash; the establishment of the Curriculum and Examinations Board and the publication of the Government's Action Programme for Education.</P>
    <P>I consider the Government are fortunate to have as chairman of the Curriculum and Examinations Board the talented and energetic Dr. Walsh of the NIHE, Limerick, and to have persuaded a wide range of expertise in education among the members who have already set about their task in an exemplary manner which inspired me with confidence in the future of their work.  In regard to the Action Programme for Education, the input by educational bodies was extraordinary and dedicated.  I would like to express my gratitude for their help.  Both of these developments are interrelated.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Action has identified areas requiring particular attention which will come within the remit of the new board.  I am confident that the board will address these matters speedily and effectively.  I should say here in the context of the Programme for Action that we are stressing planning and action as a continuum.  Within an overall strategy we will be taking action in priority areas, advised as appropriate by the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  What are these priority areas?  They are detailed in the Programme for Action and I would urge all concerned with education to study the programme carefully.  Let me try to summarise my priority concerns.</P>
    <P>Caring for the disadvantaged must have first call on our attention and our resources.  By disadvantaged within the education sector I mean, first, those who are mentally and physically handicapped. The action programme details positive action which will be taken to assist the mentally handicapped in developing their full educational potential.  An important factor which has emerged from recent studies is that the tailoring of curricula to <Col N="1911" /> individual needs but, more importantly, the availability of highly qualified specialist teachers can help even those who are severely mentally handicapped. Needless to say, the ongoing and proposed action to provide a more effective educational service for the mentally handicapped has my full support.  We have the benefit of a recent Departmental report on the education of physically handicapped children and a number of the measures recommended have already been implemented.  The question of implementing other specific measures will be kept under review.  On a more general basis, the question of suitable access for the physically handicapped has been made an absolute requirement in the planning of all new schools.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there are those who are educationally disadvantaged.  This is a problem which has many faces and one on which our information base is not as good as it should be if we are to take informed decision.  In general such children would be classified as in need of special remedial attention whether at the primary or post-primary level.  The possible reasons are diverse: it may be because the child has a low ability level, but, alternatively, it may be because of poor motivation or attendance due to personal apathy arising perhaps from emotional problems, or adverse peer-group influence or, more commonly, unfavourable home backgrounds.  It may be because the child has a physical handicap (dyslexia, or short-sightedness or minor hearing impairment etc.) though this factor because of general awareness is likely to be a declining problem.  Failure of a child to achieve basic literacy and numeracy skills at primary level may cause that child to drop out at the post-primary level or to become a truant or to be turned off even if still remaining at school.  Indeed the question of the degree to which the education process itself may turn-off some children who never achieve their full educational potential must be faced.</P>
    <P>I referred above to the 5,500 children who left school in 1982 without any qualification. I would consider that we had <Col N="1912" /> failed if we did not address the needs of children such as these more effectively within the period of the Programme for Action.  The factors I have mentioned above are illustrative only of the diversity of cause which may lie at the root of educational disadvantage.  Many worth-while steps have been taken to address the problem and I applaud all such efforts.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about now is a wider orchestration and more concerted action to address the problem at all levels. I shall explain briefly what I mean.  A better link between school and home is paramount.  This consideration extends far beyond that of educational disadvantage. Parents are the primary educators and must be afforded an effective voice in the education of their children.  The proposed establishment of a National Parents Council and the wider involvement of parents in boards of management will be important steps.  I will be consulting with the parents council in due course as to further appropriate steps.</P>
    <P>Action in this area may not go far enough, however, in identifying special home problems.  I am aware that some other countries have brought social workers within the education system to forge a link between the school and in particular the problem home.  We shall be looking at what our resources may allow us to do in that area.  The second consideration is to improve our assessment techniques so that we may identify potential problems at the earliest possible time.  This question is being addressed in my Department who are also identifying more precisely the various target groups.</P>
    <P>The third consideration is the degree to which the education process itself may help to alleviate educational disadvantage. I have already asked the Curriculum and Examinations Board to report urgently in this area.  What they will be examining will be alternative forms of curricula and teaching programmes.  The Humanities programme of the Curriculum Unit under the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee is a very useful example of such a programme. Combined with this they will be examining alternative forms of assessment, <Col N="1913" /> including the use of project work, and will devise a new unified assessment system to replace the group and intermediate certificates.  I am quite excited at the prospects these developments will open up not only for the disadvantaged but in enhancing motivation and indeed sense of achievement generally.</P>
    <P>There is another form of disadvantage to be considered, that arising from discrimination in any form.  The Hannon report on sex differentation has clarified just how widespread the problem is.  I am personally committed to tackling this problem and the immediate measures proposed are set out in the Programme for Action.  Other measures are under study in my Department.  The most basic consideration, however, is an attitudinal one and we must all combine to redress sex stereotying inside and outside the school.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of social discrimination.  We all welcome the recent publication of Drs. Greaney and Kellaghan's study on educational opportunities in the context of the different socio-economic groups.  The study makes a valuable contribution to the literature and assists in providing a better perspective on the problem.  But a problem does exist to the extent in particular that there is quite a low level of participation by the lower socio-economic groups in third-level education.  As the Programme for Action notes, the problem is not unique to Ireland and has not proved easily amenable to change.  It is one, nevertheless, which must receive special attention during the period of the Programme for Action.</P>
    <P>Finally on the subject of disadvantaged, if I may extend its scope somewhat, I should like to talk briefly about those who terminate their education at the end of the compulsory cycle or who proceed beyond that to leaving certificate programmes which are not geared to their needs.  Again I shall be looking forward to the advice of the Curriculum and Examinations Board on: (i) the most appropriate form of education for those terminating formal schooling at the end of the compulsory cycle; and (ii) alternatives to the traditional leaving certificate <Col N="1914" /> programmes whether in the form of pre-employment courses of varying duration or any other form.  What I am referring to here is establishing a better interface between schools and the world of work.  Indeed, I do not see this as a one-way movement.  I shall be strongly urging that business and schools should establish a two-way dialogue to their mutual benefit and that these links should be further extended and strengthened in higher education.</P>
    <P>I have talked at some length about the question of the disadvantaged.  In listing the problem areas I would wish to repeat my opening statement.  The education system is alive and well and we can be justly proud of our achievements.  I have detailed the problems of the disadvantaged in the Programme for Action which states as follows:</P>
    <P>Priority in the use of available resources will be accorded to a programme to assist disadvantaged pupils. The funds will be used to finance additional teaching posts, the development of curricular initiatives, special improvement and equipment grants, special in-service courses, special grants towards the cost of school books and requisites and the development of home school links.</P>
    <P>It will have been clear from what I have said, however, that much of the action required is not one of resources but of better orientation of programmes and teaching.</P>
    <P>From the wide variety of other questions addressed in the Programme for Action I should like to make specific reference to two.  I have mentioned the need for closer home-school links and a better link between the school and the world of work.  The third element in this scenario is the role of the school in preparing students to take their place in society.  I believe I cannot overstress this aspect of education.  The school cannot perform this role effectively on its own and it reinforces the need for a partnership in education, school authorities, teachers, parents, business, and, let me add, students.</P>
    <P>The fostering of our linguistic and cultural <Col N="1915" /> heritage, which as the Programme for Action points out should be at the core of our education system, would form a major strand in preparing students for life.  In the curriculum context preparation of students for life will need to be supported by a programme of social and political education.  I have asked the Curriculum and Examinations Board to prepare such a programme.  I should add that I am also seeking a programme in health education and it could well be asked how time can be found for such subjects in an already congested curriculum.  I believe it suggests that we should be looking afresh at our curricula, to define them in terms of objectives in which subjects could be comprehended within broader bands at the intermediate level: for example social studies to include history, geography and social and political education, a new creative arts programme to include woodwork, metal work, arts and crafts, home economics and health education etc.  Specialisation would not then commence until after compulsory education.</P>
    <P>I offer these comments in a tentative way as one possible approach; The Curriculum and Examinations Board will be reporting to me in due course as to what provision is appropriate and how it can be provided.  I shall in addition be urging school authorities to foster the concept of preparation for life in all aspects of school activities.  This would take in the involvement of students to the maximum extent in managing school activities and in a better process of consultation whether through a student council or whatever mechanism of consultation may be found to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>The other question is that of delegation of authority.  I am anxious to see as much responsibility and authority as possible delegated to the local level as part of an overall effort to achieve a full partnership between all the interests involved in education.  Greater freedom will be given progressively to schools in the development of alternative curricula and programmes. Greater freedom will also be given in the expenditure of allocated funds subject to overall norms and guidelines. <Col N="1916" /> The development of these norms and guidelines is a subject to which the Department will be addressing themselves over the next twelve months.  In this context also I shall in due course be announcing the appointment of a team of consultants to carry out a study of costs in third-level institutions as an aid in allocating resources and their more effective use.</P>
    <P>Inevitably I must return to the somewhat painful subject of limitations on resources.  We simply cannot expect a significantly greater share of total resources to be devoted to education. This means that we must husband our resources more effectively if we are to achieve our targets in the priority areas we have identified.</P>
    <P>There are very compelling reasons for re-examining the use of our educational resources.  At the post-primary level, if we are to achieve equality of educational opportunity for all, if we are to make adequate curricular provision particularly in the context of emerging new needs at the post-compulsory stage, then we must look at the total resources collectively in each school catchment area so as to cater for the needs of all children equally and equitably.  We have a rich diversity in our school provision but we must ensure that this does not result in discrimination against some.</P>
    <P>At the third-level the Programme for Action has identified a wide variety of areas where scope exists for more effective use of resources and these will form the basis for a series of consultations and analysis in the near future.  The cost studies I have referred to earlier will be part of the input required to ensure that well-informed decisions are taken.  I should add that it is in everyone's interest if we can find a more cost efficient base for each of our third-level programmes. It must surely enable us to provide a better educational service within acceptable limits of resources.  It must also reduce the financial burden to be shared between the community generally and our third-level students.  This is particularly important as we appear to be reaching a stage where students must <Col N="1917" /> bear an increasing share of the escalating cost of third level programmes.</P>
    <P>In conclusion let me confirm what the Government are already demonstrating by their actions.  They will provide the resources to meet the growth in enrolments in primary and post-primary schools and to replace unsatisfactory buildings on a phased basis.  Similarly the Government are committed to necessary third level development, on the basis of priorities which will be determined on an ongoing basis.  Within this context the path we will follow has been charted in the Programme for Action.</P>
    <P>I should stress that this is not only my Programme for Action.  It is the Government's programme.  Despite major constraints, despite major funding problems, the Government have through the budgetary provisions maintained the high level of funding for education to ensure that the programme will be implemented progressively.  They have already taken positive steps by allocating additional resources of £7.0 million to launch the programme this year.  This additional allocation was agreed in the course of the discussions on the Estimates for my Department, supplemented by the additional funds provided within the budget. These funds provide £4.4 million for primary schools to speed up the replacement of unsatisfactory buildings and by way of increased capitation grants, £1.5 million to secondary schools in the form of higher grants in lieu of school fees, £0.5 million for micro-computers for second-level schools an extra £0.3 million for sport and an additional £165,000 for inservice training of teachers.  Funding in priority areas will continue to be provided.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat, however, what I have said earlier.  Much of what the programme seeks to achieve does not require additional resources.  We have identified as a result of an extensive series of discussions, with all interested parties the aspects of our education system which need to be addressed in a new and more concentrated way.  We are also looking for a better use of resources so that we can provide the best possible educational service for our nation's children.</P>
    <P>Discussions will continue on an ongoing <Col N="1918" /> basis.  Some fundamental issues must be resolved concerning particularly the age of entry to school, the age of transfer to second-level education and the duration of the junior and senior cycle in second-level education.</P>
    <P>As I explained when announcing the Programme for Action, position papers will be prepared for general discussions as an essential element in our decision-making. I look forward to these discussions as part of a constructive dialogue with all those concerned so that we can make that Programme for Action a reality.</P>
    <P>The programme has been welcomed as a serious attempt to set out priorities in education.  In some respects it follows up and develops ideas raised in the White Paper, published by the then Government in 1980.  Unlike the White Paper, however, it is action orientated.  Instead of being largely a statement of how things are, our programme proposes definite action on a range of fundamental and important issues.  I am of course well aware that boards and committees are only a beginning and not an end, and the same applies to action plans.  Therefore a rigorous monitoring of progress in each area is being undertaken in my Department.</P>
    <P>All this progress and initiative must be seen in the context of the budgetary constraints which apply to all Departments. The children and the young people will not thank us for our plans and improvements in education, if they emerge into an economy which is not soundly based and in which enterprise and business do not flourish.  Like all my colleagues, I join in the intricate balancing act between essential public expenditure and the need to control the economy.  We certainly do not expect thanks for it, at least not until history looks back at this Government &mdash; but certain signs and indicators have established in our first year in office that we are serious about the job, and that our grasp of the real needs of the country is appreciated by business and by financial institutions, and those with the potential to give employment.  I was sorry to hear Deputy O'Kennedy, spokesperson on Finance for the main Opposition <Col N="1919" /> party, describe as cant the intention to make business competitive.  That is a measure of desperation by a very weak Opposition.</P>
    <P>In discussing the fundamental approach to the economy which the Government are taking it is necessary to point to some comments of independent commentators &mdash; Fianna Fáil dislike this &mdash; of a particularly distinguished kind on what has brought the country to its present position.  Dr. T. K. Whitaker published a book recently entitled <i>Interests</i> in which there is an essay entitled &ldquo;Financial Turning Point&rdquo;.  In language which is extraordinary for a person who is usually mildly spoken he described the three Fianna Fáil budgets brought before the House by Deputies O'Kennedy, Fitzgerald and MacSharry, when respectively Ministers for Finance, as &ldquo;the disastrous course of events that nearly ruined the economy&rdquo;.  He also described the 1977 election manifesto of Fianna Fáil as &ldquo;full of irrational optimism which was such as to undermine credibility&rdquo;.  Those objective comments &mdash; there were many more in that essay &mdash; indicate the scale of the problems we inherited.  They pinpoint the trends we had to struggle to reverse so as to restore economic stability once more.</P>
    <P>This is no abstract theory.  A strong economy is the only way to create jobs and I suspect that the outcry from Opposition benches is because they feel the pain of knowing that the Government are restoring a strong economy.  A strong economy should be the real interest of the Opposition party but every day in the House, and in every reaction piece in the newspapers, and on the media, I hear Opposition spokespersons saying that each and every budget or Estimates provision designed to strengthen our economy should be rejected and resisted. Earlier today Deputy Barrett appealed to the Government to pour millions of pounds into Knock Airport.  We have heard pleas to restore all the education economies although Fianna Fáil had them in their programme.  Fianna Fáil want to give all students free medicine, irrespective of parents' means; to take all <Col N="1920" /> VAT off clothes: to reduce VAT on everything else; to remove excise duties on drink; to reduce everybody's tax burden; to build millions more houses and open hospitals everywhere.  The list of catch-all demands grows and grows and the dizzy expenditure which is a sort of addiction within Fianna Fáil would grow and grow if they ever got control of our economy again.</P>
    <P>Behind all this is the one real and enduring truth: the damage started by Fianna Fáil in the 1977 election manifesto and compounded hugely by the 1980-81 spending spree by the Fianna Fáil Government led by Deputy Haughey from December 1979 which is the greatest single barrier to job creation for our young people.  Who threw away their chance of major tax cuts and incentives for employment?  Who set out to increase artificially the numbers in the public service?  Who cynically endorsed the boom and bloom confidence trick while basing that &ldquo;boom&rdquo; on a double, external borrowing requirement until the Department of Finance finally got so alarmed that a sharp and sudden brake of the most damaging kind was applied &mdash; too late? Young people who look to this House to ensure their future must feel very bitter when told of the cynical manipulation of the economy for political gain that went on in those years.</P>
    <P>It is my view that all the scandals and grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented happenings under that Government fall into the halfpenny place when compared to the systematic and reckless dismantling of a recovering economy which had been established before 1977.  This Government took up in 1983 where it had left off in January 1982 and have maintained with a cool head their programme of steady and sure progress throughout the last year.  We will go on with the job, undeterred by those obsessed by self-interest, to restore the economic viability of our country and to ensure a worthwhile future for all our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education in the course of her contribution did not refer to the unemployment crisis in <Col N="1921" /> the country.  Indeed, the Minister has contributed to this by dismantling the career guidance system in our secondary schools.  The Minister has done a great disservice to the future of our young people by that action.  The opportunities of those young people have been damaged by her decision to reduce the facility of career guidance in schools.  To put forward the type of waffle that she has done is an embarrassment to the Department of Education.  The Minister produced a stereotyped Department speech at a stage when our unemployment figures have increased dramatically.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that 215,600 people are unemployed and that 67,633 of the registered unemployed are under 25 years of age.  By June next a further 17,000 to 18,000 young people will be available for employment but they have little hope of securing a job.  The budget has been described by commentators and politicians as a non-event and a disaster.  Those descriptions are true.  It was a major disappointment that the Minister for Finance introduced a budget bereft of imagination, planning or hope for the many people who looked to the House for some plan to bring the country out of the unemployment crisis.  Our people listened with great expectation to the live broadcast of the Minister for Finance from the House but they were disappointed because the Minister only increased taxation, revenue on petrol and diesel oil and put VAT on some clothes. He did not mention the unemployment crisis.  He ignored our greatest problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unemployed expected the Minister to fulfil commitments made by the Taoiseach when he took office on 14 December 1982.  At that stage 170,000 people were unemployed and 50,000 of those registered were under 25 years of age.  In the course of their Programme for Government the Coalition partners said they would take firm and decisive action to tackle the unemployment crisis. In the last 14 months the crisis has increased to an intolerable and unbearable level.  It is no harm to repeat that the unemployment figure is a massive 215,600 and that the figure increased by 7,500 in January alone.  If this trend continues <Col N="1922" />&mdash; it is obvious the Government are not putting forward plans to tackle the crisis &mdash; by the end of 1984 we will have at least 300,000 unemployed.</P>
    <P>The number of unemployed now exceeds the number employed in manufacturing industry.  We have in the region of 196,400 employed in manufacturing industry: in December 1979 that figure was 211,000.  At the moment the number of unemployed exceeds even the December 1983 figure by a considerable amount and it is increasing every day.  Yet the Government are standing idly by and the Minister for Education, now in the House, when she sits at the Cabinet table must have a sense of shame because of the difficulties the country is in and to which she has contributed.  There are 45,700 people more on the dole now than when the Government took office.  The Minister for Education is responsible for caring for the future of our young people who will be leaving school next June and seeking work.  But the jobs are not being created despite the golden opportunity the Government had in the budget to bring forward imaginative job creation proposals.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that every week we are having 816 extra people unemployed; every day we have 117 people more on the dole.  They are depressing, sad figures, an indictment of Government policies.  Imagine, in every 24 hours that pass 117 more people will be unemployed, tomorrow, every day this month. The same trend will continue and has been continuing since 14 December 1982.</P>
    <P>Of our young people under 25 years, 67,633 have never had a job, have never had an opportunity to work.  If present Government policies continue they will never have an opportunity to go to work. If the Government are not prepared to take action those young people will be forced to mobilise, unionise among themselves, take decisive action, and I am afraid this will arise in 1984.  Responsibility for it, for the 45,700 extra unemployed since 1982, rests squarely with the Taoiseach and his Cabinet.</P>
    <P>We have a national emergency and the Government should declare a state of <Col N="1923" /> emergency in relation to unemployment. It is the greatest emergency the country has been faced with in its history.  We have a young increasing population.  It is a great asset to have such a highly educated, articulate work force, but we are not mobilising that great asset to build up the country and consequently we have a major crisis.  The Government, given the responsibility on 14 December 1982, instead of tackling that crisis have contributed to its worsening by this budget.</P>
    <P>I believe the only possible solution and hope for the unemployed is an early change of Government.  Fianna Fáil have the personnel and the policies to tackle the cause of the crisis.  In the interim, I suggest respectfully that the Government first of all should declare a national emergency on unemployment and should delegate top priority to a solution.  Second, the Government should appoint a Minister for Employment who would be given the exclusive task of mobilising all possible resources for job creation.  The Government have not got such a potential Minister.  The setting up of such a Ministry could be arranged by the amalgamation of the Departments of Public Service and Labour.  However, there is not in the Cabinet one person capable of becoming Minister for Employment, one person who has the imagination, the policies and the determination to head such a Ministry.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest that the Government should look outside this House for such a candidate.  They should look to the Seanad for a Minister without portfolio, a person who would not have constituency considerations, who would be given the responsibility to monitor the situation and to provide the policies for job creation and job preservation.  A person without constituency work to intrude would be in a better position than Deputies.  We know that the majority of Government Deputies and Ministers are more concerned with their constituency commitments than with ministerial responsibilities. They are concentrating on constituency work and neglecting their more important considerations &mdash; they <Col N="1924" /> are available at every crossroads in their constituencies instead of looking after the responsibilities given to them in December 1982.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest we look outside the House for a person with qualities of leadership to tackle this crisis.  In addition we should set up a joint committee, composed of Members of both Houses, exclusively to consider the job crisis. Such a committee should have Members from all parties and, in consultation with the Government's task force, should be answerable to and work with a Minister for Employment, such a Minister using the committee as an advisory group, as a sort of mini-cabinet to look into the employment crisis.  They would also have available to them outside membership, adequate research and other facilities to enable them to plan for short-term and long-term jobs.  One possibility in the short term which would have long-term repercussions would be a reduction in the retirement age.  I was disappointed that the Minister for Finance did not reduce the retirement age from 65 years.  He could have reduced it over a period of four or five years so that in 1988 it would be 60 years.  That would give people time to adjust to the new retirement age. Deputies, Senators, Ministers or the Taoiseach should not be excluded from early retirement.  The law should be the same for all.  Early retirement would create much needed job opportunities. There are 1,668 civil servants who are over 60 years of age.  That information was given in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 24 January 1984 at column 540 of the Official Report.  That alone would create in the region of 1,668 jobs.</P>
    <P>If we were committed to early retirement we would create much needed employment.  People who are 60 years of age are at the maximum of their pay scale.  They could be replaced by young people who would be starting at the minimum of the scale.  The saving between the pension and pay would easily compensate for the employment of young people.  The Government had an opportunity to make provision for this proposal in the budget.  It has been talked about for some time.  Civil servants, members <Col N="1925" /> of local authorities, State boards, and semi-State organisations would welcome this proposal.  In 1984 it could be reduced to 64 years and by 1988 it would be 60 years.  There could be also voluntary retirement under that age where it was required.  This would create a number of jobs.</P>
    <P>The structure of local development teams could be utilised to assist in the preparation of plans for job creation.  In every county we could have sub-committees of the Dáil comprising all the Deputies in that constituency and Oireachtas members who would take part in local development team work.  They would have responsibility for monitoring the unemployment position in each county and putting forward constructive policies to create the necessary jobs.  The suggestion has been made &mdash; I fully agree with it &mdash; that we should use the employment fund for job creation.  For every 1,000 people unemployed we have an expenditure of £2.5 million.  The fund could be used to create jobs even if people were working only a two or three day week.</P>
    <P>The dole should be changed so that anyone signing on would be entitled to a job.  A job is an essential ingredient for a worth-while future.  The Government should use the funds necessary to create jobs.  In every local authority we could create in the region of 1,000 jobs quite easily by transferring funds from social welfare to local authorities.  Local authorities are starved of funds.  The whole infrastructure is breaking down.  During a recession we should concentrate on improving the infrastructure &mdash; sewerage, water schemes, roads, drainage and so on.  We would have a return in the long term for investment of this kind.  This recession will end and we will have demands on our labour force.  It will not happen in the short term or while this Government are in office but given a change of Government, imagination and planning, things will happen.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility to look at the crisis as it is and utilise all the State's resources to tackle the problem.  The Minister for Education has contributed to this debate.  She did not refer to one area of development in education. <Col N="1926" /> Fianna Fáil provided computers in 313 second level schools in 1981 at a cost of £895,766.  In another 194 schools further enhancements were effected to enable them to provide computers.  These computers should be fully utilised and linked to a master computer to provide career guidance. A master computer should be located in the Department of Education which would provide up-to-date information on job opportunities.  Unfortunately these computers are not used to the fullest extent.  The Minister should look at this whole area and see if they could be better utilised to provide a better service.</P>
    <P>The school year could be extended by introducing an extra year after the intermediate certificate.  A transition year has been introduced in many schools and has proved a great success.  It has geared young people towards a realisation of job possibilities.  Students get tremendous experience by participating in short-term work experience programmes.  The Minister should come forward with proposals to extend the school year.</P>
    <P>As regards natural resources, the Government should give top priority now to creating jobs in this area.  In relation to forestry, we could set up a new semi-State organisation.  We recently set up two new semi-State organisations to manage the postal and telecommunication services.  There is total mismanagement of forestry at present.  It is evident from the Government's handling of the situation that developed in Clare that the Scarriff Chipboard factory should be retained on a semi-State basis similar to Bord na Móna and the ESB and that linked to that should be a development organisation which would utilise our present resources in forestry and which would plan for future development.  There remains a considerable amount of land that could be used for the production of timber.  I hope the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy D'Arcy, will give serious consideration to this proposal.  It is a proposal that has been put forward from various sources in the past few years.  A former Minister, Mr. Seán MacBride, on a recent television programme made a very good contribution <Col N="1927" /> to the present debate.  He has contributed many articles concerning this area of development.</P>
    <P>Another area in which we could create much-needed employment is the area of import substitution.  During my time as Minister of State in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I reactivated a programme which was initiated by Deputy Reynolds and which related to import substitution.  We had begun a series of exhibitions, some of which had taken place in Cavan, Roscommon and Dublin. These exhibitions were designed to indicate precise possibilities for the creation of jobs in the area of import substitution. It is necessary that there be a comprehensive catalogue giving details of everything that is imported and that there be market exhibitions on the lines of the ones I have been talking about though not perhaps as elaborate but at which modern technology in the form of slides and so on could be used to point to the possibilities for employment in this area. This is a task that the IDA could undertake. It would involve their travelling throughout the country, organising meetings in order to get the message across. It is a national scandal that we import so many items that could be produced at home and which in many cases would involve small industries which could be IDA-assisted.  This was an area to which we gave priority when I was in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  We had assistance then from the IDA and from other State agencies.  I suggest that the Government reactivate that area of development and take it a step further by talking to people who are in a position to provide the necessary technology for the production of goods that can be produced here but which are being imported.</P>
    <P>There is gross neglect by the Government, too, in the area of horticulture.  It is unacceptable that we are importing potatoes to the value of up to £80 million per year.  Surely we have the ability and the resources to produce sufficient potatoes for the home market but no effort is being made by the Department of Agriculture in this matter.  There is a budgetary provision of £100,000 for the potato <Col N="1928" /> marketing board but that sum is totally inadequate.  It would not be sufficient to provide office accommodation or staff for the board.  Such a paltry sum is an indication of the Government's lack of commitment in this area.  They should give this matter the priority it deserves.</P>
    <P>In relation to further development of our food industry we are providing jobs throughout Europe by our exports of carcases which should be processed further here.  The position is that there is no incentive in terms of the creation of jobs in the food industry.  We need a special agency to deal with this industry, an agency that would formulate policies.  It is an area that has exciting possibilities and hugh potential in terms of job creation. The cost of maintaining an unemployed person is in the region of £2,500 to £3,000.  Would it not be better if that money were used to create jobs for those people by way of developing our natural resources?</P>
    <P>There is a lack of co-ordination in respect of Manpower, AnCO and youth employment schemes.  The 1 per cent employment levy has been mishandled by the Youth Employment Agency.  It has not resulted in the creation of worth-while jobs.  Indeed, it has not resulted in the creation of jobs at all.  The fund has been used by the Government to finance other schemes which are not related directly to youth employment.  The whole question of the Youth Employment Agency should be reviewed because new ideas are needed in that regard.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have produced an imaginative new alternative to the budget proposed by the Government.  Our plans have been published in <i>Irish Business.</i> We have indicated clearly our stand in relation to the type of budget we would bring forward.  We have indicated the need for more imaginative planning in the area of providing much-needed employment.  Because of the increase of 45,700 since 1982 in the number of unemployed, the increase in benefits has been £114 million.</P>
    <P>Apart from the hardship being created by the level of unemployment, there is hardship, too, resulting from the situation of unemployment benefits.  It may <Col N="1929" /> not be noticed by the Government that when the dependants of those who are in receipt of unemployment or sickness benefit reach 18 they are regarded no longer as dependants though the majority of them may still be attending second or third-level education.  The age limit in this respect should be increased to 20. There is a case, too, for extending the age in respect of children's allowances so as to ensure that payments continue to be made in respect of young people who are continuing at second or third-level education.</P>
    <P>Another area which is causing major hardship for the unemployed is that of repayments of local authority and building society loans.  There is need for a reassessment of the repayments in respect of those who are unemployed with a view to having a situation in which there would be a freeze on repayments for the duration of the period of unemployment. I would envisage this freeze applying across the board &mdash; to local authorities, to building societies and to the new Housing Finance Agency.  The choice facing many people today is one of either providing food for their families or of repaying their housing loans.  Naturally, the loan repayments must take second place to the needs of the family. The time has come for the Department of the Environment to review the repayments system in so far as local authorities are concerned.  Many county councils are owed millions of £s by people who are not in a position to meet their loan repayment commitments.  The Department should review the system of repayments to take account of today's crisis situation.</P>
    <P>Before being returned to office, the people opposite told us repeatedly that the level of the national debt was unacceptable. I accept that fully but they said also that financial rectitude was their priority and that the reduction of the national debt was their first priority.  The public were impressed but they should be made aware now that between the end of 1982 and the end of 1983 the national debt increased by £2.9 billion.  The devaluation of the punt on 21 March 1983 cost us an extra £810 million in terms of our national debt.  Surely that money could <Col N="1930" /> have been used for the creation of jobs. The policy pursued by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, in the devaluation of our £ at that time was the most damaging decision ever taken by any Minister for Finance.  The idea of financial rectitude has gone out the window. This Government are no longer committed to carrying out the necessary measures in relation to our national debt.</P>
    <P>In my constituency and in the adjoining constituency of east Galway we are awaiting a Government decision in relation to the provision of funds for a briquette factory at Derryfadda, Ballyforan, County Roscommon.  In the Public Capital Programme for 1984 there is a provisional allocation of £15.4 million for the briquette factory at Ballyforan subject to a review.  That review has been going on since we left office in December 1982.  At this stage the Government should make a firm decision in favour of the erection of a briquette factory at Derryfadda.  The factory would employ 110 people when in production.  During construction it would employ initially 75 people and that would be expected to increase to 180. The factory would utilise the natural resources of the Derryfadda bogs where Bord na Móna have acquired 10,000 acres for the development of peat.  Unless the factory is erected, the production of peat in the area will be in jeopardy and jobs in Derryfadda will be at risk.</P>
    <P>Here is an area where the Government have direct responsibility for job creation but they have delayed for more than 12 months before making a decision.  I am confident they will decide to continue with the project because any other decision would be criminally negligent on the part of the Government.  Fianna Fáil provided the capital and the necessary expertise to allow the project to go ahead. Three Fianna Fáil Ministers &mdash; Deputy O'Malley, the late Deputy Colley and Deputy Reynolds &mdash; approved and supported the project.  It was expected to go into production in January 1985 but this has been delayed by at least 14 months. Unless the Government go ahead with the matter in the very near future the project will be delayed until 1986 or early <Col N="1931" /> 1987 and jobs will not be provided for a further period.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government and to the Minister for Energy, Deputy Spring, to proceed with the project.  We have the natural resources in the area.  We have harvested the milled peat, the project is ready to proceed, the funds are there and Bord na Móna are enthusiastic about it. They have provided the necessary funds to allow the project to go ahead.  The Minister and the Government are responsible for an increased cost of the project in the region of £2.5 million, money that could have been used to provide more jobs in the region.  The whole area of Ballyforan is depending on the Bord na Móna project.  It is one area in which we can create much needed jobs. It is a place that has been deprived of employment since the foundation of the State.  We in Roscommon have provided the necessary infrastructure for the development of housing and water and sewerage facilities in the adjoining village of Ballyforan to accommodate the increase in the work force in Derryfadda.  We are looking forward to an early decision by the Government.  We look forward to the expenditure of £15.4 million in 1984 to allow for recommencement of the project that was started in 1982 by Fianna Fáil. A sum of £5 million has been spent on site preparation and development and this money will be wasted if the project does not go ahead.</P>
    <P>In the past week or ten days a factory in Castlerea announced its closure with the loss of 35 jobs.  The firm of Fenner Stone Limited have stated that 35 people will be removed from the payroll at the end of February 1984 but the Government have not taken any action to alleviate the crisis in the Castlerea area. Some months ago there was a loss of 16 jobs when IDE Fashions closed.  I am asking the Government and the Minister involved, Deputy Bruton, to take the necessary action to provide jobs in County Roscommon, and particularly in an area where job losses have occurred over the past few months.</P>
    <P>The IDA are responding to representations but they have difficulty in convincing <Col N="1932" /> the company concerned in the latest closure to retain employment in the Castlerea area.  They should look for an alternative company to take over the running and management of the factory concerned and ensure that the 35 workers will be kept in employment after the end of February 1984.  This is a major blow to my constituency.  Jobs were created in the area under the Fianna Fáil administration and we gave priority to job creation. The country is losing jobs at the rate of 117 per day.</P>
    <P>The Government should ensure that there is an early warning system in operation. The IDA should be aware of difficulties that may present themselves at a later date.  They should react urgently to problems in industry and should be able to alleviate any difficulties that may arise in the future.  Unfortunately the early warning system previously in operation seems to have been dismantled by the present Minister, Deputy Bruton. The IDA have changed considerably since this Government came into power. In the midlands region of the IDA a regional officer was responsible for all industries in that division but the programme of this Government has meant that decisions have to be taken in Dublin. The decentralisation we were planning has been terminated by the Government. This has resulted in a lack of communication between factories that may have difficulties and the IDA.  The local IDA officers were in a position to monitor developments in their own regions.  Now they have no responsibility whatever for existing industries and, unfortunately, all decisions have been transferred to Dublin.  This has resulted in the difficulties experienced at present in my constituency.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of job creation in the budget.  We have had a public relations exercise in regard to closure of an area of tax avoidance in the bond system. Unfortunately that system existed.  I can see the point in terminating it but under pressure from the Stock Exchange the Government have agreed to further tax concessions in the issue of £200 million tranches in the Stock Exchange in the past seven days.  The public relations <Col N="1933" /> exercise has worked very effectively and the Government public relations officers have given the impression that in some way the Minister for Finance has plugged a tax avoidance hole.  There was not one mention in the Budget Statement of the extra funds which will come from this exercise.  This has been a public relations sham.  Unfortunately, no statement was issued by the Minister and I believe he should come clean at this stage and say what was agreed with the Stock Exchange officers when they discussed bond washing. I understand the Minister made a special tax deal with the Stock Exchange which has not been reported to any great extent but which attracted the necessary funds for the £200 million issue.  In my view the Minister has made a major error in this area because the advantages from the removal of the bond washing provision have been far outweighed by the fact that overseas investment has been reduced.</P>
    <P>A large amount of money is invested in our Stock Exchange by successful Irish emigrants who are not liable to pay Irish income tax and who receive their dividends without deduction of this tax.  This is a very attractive area for investment and it is an advantage for our Government to be able to raise funds directly from the Irish public.  This is a cheaper way to raise loans than by borrowing internationally.  In my view the Minister has damaged confidence in the Stock Exchange and has gained nothing in return.  As I said, the public relations exercise has been extremely successful in conveying the impression that the Minister has closed a tax loophole which will benefit the taxpayer generally, but this is not a true situation.  Eventually the taxpayer will have to pay more because of a reduction of investment from abroad.</P>
    <P>National loans have been used by successive Governments as the principal method of obtaining finance from the domestic investor.  This type of investment should be given special consideration because this money is the result of hard work.  I know of many emigrants in America and Britain who invested a considerable amount of money in our Stock Exchange so that it would be available to <Col N="1934" /> the Government to create employment. I believe further stock issues should be made specifically for job creation.  If extra bonds were issued at special rates they would attract a large number of Irish investors.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made an effort to plug another tax loophole.  Section 84 of the Act allows the banks to give special concessions to people leasing equipment and machinery in return for the bank obtaining tax concessions.  The leader of the Confederation of Irish Industry warned that the removal of this section would cost industry millions of pounds. The Government changed their minds and it appears that the Minister made an error because he has now extended the facility until the end of February 1984. He should review this area because this money for the purchase of machinery and equipment would help to create jobs. Unless we give them an incentive like this, many people will have second thoughts before they invest in machinery. This was a most attractive feature of previous budgets.  When the Minister introduces the Finance Bill I hope he will review Government policy in this area because this facility has been availed of by businessmen to provide much needed employment.</P>
    <P>On budget night we opposed the 8 per cent VAT on clothes.  Over the last few years many thousands of jobs have been lost in manufacturing industry.  In a submission to the Dáil the Apparel Industries Federation said they were concerned about possible job losses as a result of the imposition of VAT.  They said their members give employment to more than 17,000 people in the clothing and footwear sections.  They said there had been 8,000 job losses in the industry over the last few years and that the imposition of the 8 per cent VAT on clothes would create further job losses.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we are fortunate enough to have a very successful clothing industry in Roscommon and Athlone. We had a successful clothing industry in Castlerea.  The managing director of Chickwear, former Senator Peggy Farrell, has provided much needed employment in the area and has been named the <Col N="1935" /> Businesswoman of the Year 1983.  She has made a major contribution to job creation in the region, but the imposition of VAT will impose a particular burden on her firm and every other firm engaged in the manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>The operation of this VAT will create special difficulties for the retail trade.  On budget night we went into this question in great detail and the Taoiseach was unable to give any help or encouragement in identifying a ten year old as opposed to an 11 year old.  In the Finance Act the Minister should review the imposition of this 8 per cent VAT on clothes which will come into effect on 1 May 1984 because in its wake we will see further job losses in that industry.  The Apparel Industries Federation have given the Government a clear warning.</P>
    <P>In our period in office we gave a £5 a week subsidy for each person employed in the clothing manufacturing industry. This industry is, and has been, threatened by Third World imports.  This industry has a very large work force and has to carry the costs of PRSI and so on.  In relation to the PRSI system a sliding scale should operate &mdash; the more people you employ the less the employers' contribution should be.  This is a tax on employment. Let there be no doubt about that. The more people you employ the more the employers' PRSI contribution should be.  PRSI and PAYE together represent a major burden on those in employment and are a disincentive to work.  Consideration should be given to allowing concessions to the PRSI contributor similar to concessions given by car insurers.  A &ldquo;no claims bonus&rdquo; for PRSI contributors would be an incentive towards a reduction in the number of claims.</P>
    <P>The increase in PRSI in recent years has been a major burden on employment. Where numbers employed in a particular firm have been increased, the employer's contribution should be decreased on a sliding scale.  I would favour the complete removal of the employers' contribution because of the disincentive to further employment.  The whole matter should be seriously investigated.</P>
    <P>The Government should introduce a <Col N="1936" /> pension scheme for everyone.  This was proposed some years ago in a White Paper but has not been put into effect. The majority of the self-employed would welcome the extension of the PRSI system to those who wished to avail of it.  I would suggest a scheme which initially would not be compulsory.  Many people would welcome the opportunity to contribute to a national pension scheme.  The present system of old age pensions is totally unacceptable.  Those who have funds are deprived of pensions and this is inequitable.  A national pension scheme based on earnings should ensure an automatic pension at the age of 65 or 60.  This would reduce the burden of PRSI on those now contributing and there would also be a reduction in the level of surveillance by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>This budget is a major disappointment in the light of the crisis now facing us. The Minister has let people down by his lack of imagination.  It is a compromise budget which is being sold to the public as progressive.  I ask the Minister to reconsider in the Finance Bill many of the budget provisions and to bring forward new policies.  The only solution for the Irish people is a change of Government and I hope the Taoiseach will respond and call an election as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker made a reasonably constructive speech, with the exception of his call for the resignation of the Government and the replacement of same by the party opposite who, Deputy Leyden believes, have the personnel and the policies to resolve the country's problems. It has been suggested by the same Deputy that 177,000 people were unemployed when this Government took office.  The natural progression of the argument he put forward would be that if his party were back in office there would be another 177,000 people added to the number already employed within four to five years.  I know that nobody would take the Deputy too seriously.  If they did so it would be a terrible catastrophy for the people who have to bear the burden of the decisions taken over a <Col N="1937" /> number of years which culminated in the disgraceful state into which our economy was allowed to drift.</P>
      <P>This has been called a neutral budget and that is the kind of budget which is necessary this year.  So-called independent commentators have indicated that there will be a reasonable growth in the economy this year, as in the economies of Europe and the United States.  The obvious progression is that we should not do anything more to increase taxation or to change strategy dramatically.  That is the line followed in the budget.  If the upturn in the economy materialises, as promised by independent commentators who are usually much wiser after the event, then the budget is couched in such a way as to take advantage of it.  Only time will tell and I do not pretend to be in any way prophetic.  We will have to wait and see.</P>
      <P>This budget looked after the poorer sections of the community.  It did not give them the increases many would have liked but at the same time it recognised their plight and gave them sufficient increases to tide them over to better times.  The calls from Members opposite have been for far greater increases in all areas and at practically every level.  At the same time they call for a reduction in taxation and an improvement in the standard and scope of services.  The Irish public are fairly well-educated and astute and the Opposition are doing themselves no great service by making such contradictory statements.  The sooner they recognise that the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that there is an employment crisis.  Some of us have made various suggestions as to how we might go about resolving the problem.  It is without doubt the greatest single problem facing us, no matter which party are in Government. There are three spheres in which the problem can be tackled.  The private sector depend for processed goods or services on the market and the market can only bear what it is capable of withstanding at any time.  Much has been said about the need for the provision of more services which would resolve our employment problem.  Services are related to <Col N="1938" /> what the productive sector can bear and one cannot go on indefinitely increasing the scope and extent of services without relating it in some way to what is being produced.  If everybody went over to providing services and nobody was in production obviously we could not succeed.</P>
    <P>Given the existing incentives, the work of the IDA and the work of the other State agencies involved in job creation, I believe there is further scope for the private sector to forge ahead and provide very vital jobs at this time.  At the same time they would provide for their own management and investors a very realistic source of revenue and an improvement in our balance of payments.  I believe the public sector has gone as far as it can go by way of employment creation in the old sense.  Every time you increase the number employed in the public service you have to make provision for paying them and for their pensions and bonuses at the end of the day.  There are only two or three sources from which this money can be found.  It can be found through taxation or borrowing.  For a number of years we have been borrowing for those reasons and obviously that particular area is not a realistic one to pursue any longer.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of Deputies on both sides of the House have suggested over the last few years that there must be something wrong, in a country where there is so much work which needs to be done and at the same time there are so many people unemployed.  A classical example is that various local authorities throughout the country every year have a certain sum of money set aside after great heart searching for amenity purposes; they hand out a few pounds to various voluntary bodies who may embark on landscaping projects, improvement of public buildings or some similar works.  It looks like a contradiction in terms when you see people embarking on such jobs in their spare time, late on a summer's evening or during holiday periods and you could have anything up to 200 people unemployed in the same town or village.  Surely somewhere along the line we should ask ourselves are we not duplicating services <Col N="1939" /> and should we not find other ways to alleviate this problem?  I believe that in the emergency employment situation we have there is need to create a third tier besides the recognised public and private sector, along the lines suggested by Deputy Leyden whereby the Departments of Social Welfare, Education and Labour with the Youth Employment Agency and AnCO could pool their resources and make grants available to local authorities who could employ people to do the kind of jobs I have suggested.</P>
    <P>When I mentioned this at a public meeting in my constituency some time ago I was castigated.  It was suggested that I was putting forward a theory that would be totally objectionable to young unemployed people whose expectations were far higher than becoming involved in mundane tasks such as landscaping, the restoration of open spaces, the restoration of public buildings and work like that.  I do not believe that is true.  In jobs like that there is need for a fair degree of expertise.  There is need to employ draughtsmen, architects, technicians and colour consultants.  There is a whole field of professions which could be employed on a temporary basis and massive inroads could be made into the number unemployed. This would particularly refer to young people under 25 years who have not yet had a chance to work and who do not know what it is like to go home at night and feel they were engaged in gainful and productive employment, that they were doing something for themselves and for the country.  It is most important to be able to fire the imagination of those people.  If we do not do that they will have so much time on their hands that they will lose confidence in the system being capable of doing anything for them by leadership and chartering a course for them which they could follow.</P>
    <P>I believe this is one area where fairly dramatic inroads can be made into the number of people unemployed.  I know of many cases of people on social welfare assistance who were on unemployment benefit for one or two years before that. Those people have families and they <Col N="1940" /> would be glad to do something along the lines I have suggested.  As well as the works I have mentioned there is also restoration work to be done on our canals.  There is obviously need for the provision of recreational amenities for the vast number of young people we have.  I am thinking particularly of the Royal Canal which is near where I live. It is ridiculous, when we have so many people unemployed that we cannot get sufficient impetus to make a major impact on the amount of work which needs to be done along our inland waterways. I am not talking about the use of mechanical diggers but about the annual work which needs to be done.  This requires a great labour input.</P>
    <P>People can say that type of work is non-productive.  It may look non-productive but we are spending large sums of money on social welfare payments and incentives.  I believe the time has come when we should ask ourselves if we can afford that kind of policy any longer and whether the people I am talking about would like an opportunity to find out what it is like to work a full day and come home feeling they have done something good for the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden spoke about the failure of the career guidance system.  I do not know if it has failed but when you find so many highly qualified young people coming to clinics held by the various public representatives every year we would do those people a far greater service if during the period they are in receipt of career guidance they are told that there is a good possibility that at the end of the day there will not be jobs for them.  Those people could take a decision then and pursue different careers.  Our educational system will have to address itself to that. We all pay lip service to the great investment that our young highly educated people are but we seem to have given those young people the impression that nothing is too good for them.  We have put them on a far higher pedestal than any of their forebears have had the pleasure of being on.</P>
    <P>We are not doing youth any great service by doing that.  We should tell them that the people on whom they will <Col N="1941" /> have to depend most for their future are themselves, that they have a great opportunity if they depend on their own intelligence and entrepreneurial skills instead of sitting back waiting for the State to provide something that is not there. Many speakers on the opposite side of the House say that the Government should do this, should invest more money, should do many things, but one thing the Government are not responsible for is providing jobs.  The Government are responsible for creating the kind of atmosphere in which jobs and employment will flourish, but the Government are not responsible for producing the jobs.  It can encourage, it can give the incentives, but if it gets into the arena where it must provide the jobs also then our system will be in danger of breaking down and we will become totally dependent on the State.  That is not desirable.  In a crisis in employment we can and should depend on our own skills and on the private sector who should be reminded also that in times gone by fairly substantial profits were made in that sector and now when times are hard we should expect those people to reinvest their money and show their confidence in the State and by doing so alleviate some of the problems that we have.  I could go on for quite a long time in relation to the problems we have and could blame the people on the opposite side of the House for them, but I do not think that will serve any useful purpose from the point of view of inspiring young people, or middle-aged people for that matter, today.  We must stand up and be counted. We can put forward our various theories as to how to tackle our problems and at the end of the day the people will decide who is right or wrong.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the local authorities as a way of absorbing some of the people who are unemployed.  I mention that for the reason that Deputy Leyden mentioned it, that the problem over the last five years has been that each year at estimates time in every local authority there just is not sufficient money to employ people, or to buy materials for carrying out the usual work in which local authorities are involved, and we come back again and <Col N="1942" /> again to the shortage of funds.  This also applies to all Government Departments. If we have in excess of 200,000 people unemployed surely we must accept that by way of social welfare, Youth Employment Agency incentives or whatever we are spending money on that vast group of people who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why some of those funds cannot be transferred to those local authorities.  I ask the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment this year, in the very near future, to give some consideration to that theory.  Many people may say that it will not work, but at least we deserve a chance of seeing whether it will work.  While it may not be the answer to all our problems, it is an attempt to do something about them. With all due respect to the people opposite who claim now that we on this side are not doing anything about it, I do not think they did very much either.</P>
    <P>Another area is agriculture.  Incidentally, I welcome the reintroduction of the farm modernisation scheme in the sense that it is a constructive contribution to agriculture and a recognition by the Government that agriculture has a major role to play in the job that the Government are faced with.  Again it comes back to employment this time in the food processing sector.  A few facts come to light on a booklet entitled <i>Consumer Foods: Ideas for Development</i> published by the IDA and dated January 1984.  It outlines a number of ares where perhaps we could provide a number of jobs.  Reference has been made to this already, but I will quote from that booklet regarding food processing and the possibilities of import substitution:</P>
    <P>Irish vegetable acreage has declined from 10,200 tonnes in 1975 to 3,000 tonnes at present.  The market is being increasingly supplied by imports. Imported tonnages of carrots, turnips, brassicas and potatoes have grown at an annual average rate of 700-800 per cent.</P>
    <P>That must be fairly frightening to the people here who are charged with the business of guiding the national ship through the storm.  It continues:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> Some of these imports could be reduced if proper grading, packing and marketing operations were established here.</P>
    <P>The only thing I can say to that is that is has been obvious to all of us over the last few years and that that very important business of marketing a product has been neglected for quite a long time.  You can produce as much as you like but unless you market what you produce properly nobody will buy it.  If you do not market it attractively or packet it attractively again the consumer will be taken in and will go for those goods that are attractively packed and presented.  That document continues:</P>
    <P>The market in Ireland for potato produced goods such as waffles, croquettes and hash browns is valued at IR£0.75 million.  The U.K. market has grown from virtually zero to £30 million in the last three years.</P>
    <P>This is an indication that there is a market there for such goods if we are prepared to invest in that area and provide the goods that are required in that market.</P>
    <P>I can recall numerous meetings that I have attended in my constituency where people have said, &ldquo;Ah yes, but Irish industrialists do not get the incentives that the multinationals get.  It is a different story really.  The multinationals have all the advantages to do so&rdquo;.  This is ridiculous. The IDA give very considerable assistance to all industries and have a special section dealing with small industries. Sufficient attention has not been focused on that area and not sufficient people are showing interest.  The next question we must ask is why are they not showing interest?  Is it because we have become totally dependent on the system and each and every one of us is waiting for somebody else to make the first move?  Surely it is time that we all recognised that we have our destiny in our own hands and if we really want to make a go of it we can do so.  The agencies that assist us are there.  We have only to go and ask.</P>
    <P>I do not represent a maritime county <Col N="1944" /> but I would like to refer to a few figures from that document.</P>
    <P>At present, only around 12 per cent of the Irish fish catch of 200,000 tonnes is processed to a secondary stage.</P>
    <P>That is amazing.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>The fish processing industry could make a very valuable addition to the economy if this was increased significantly. The raw materials for secondary processing such as food ingredients and packaging could mainly be sourced in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the case of some species, the value of a ton of fish could be trebled through additional processing.</P>
    <P>Obviously, we are exporting the raw material and having it processed abroad to be returned here.  There is great scope for job creation in that area and it has not been exploited to the full extent.  I am not making that suggestion as a criticism of the Government but I am putting it forward as one attempt at a resolution of a serious problem.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>If 35 per cent of the catch was processed to a secondary stage then the output of the Irish fish processing industry in Ireland could increase by IR£45 million to IR£94 million per annum.</P>
    <P>That is the answer to those who ask if there is a market for these products.  The market exists in that area but we are not exploiting it.  We should do our utmost to ensure that we focus attention on those areas and bring this to the attention of investors.  We must do everything possible to ensure that those people take up the slack that has occurred in our economy in general.</P>
    <P>Dealing with agricultural produce the report, under the heading &ldquo;Fresh Vegetables and Fruit&rdquo; states:</P>
    <P>The growth of imports of fresh vegetables and fruit has been of particular concern in recent years.  Imports totalled about IR£80 million in 1982. Of this IR£27 million were fresh vegetables, up from just over IR£10 million in 1980.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1945" /> Those figures are startling.  Obviously the trend is to import produce that we have grown at home for many years.  Up to a few years ago there was no competition on that market but because of imports from other EEC countries we are having great difficulty.  Our consumers are falling into the trap of supporting imports to the detriment of home produce.  That is a scandal and is something we must face up to.  We must set about rectifying the position.  I had occasion to buy a pair of shoes recently and I had to call to at least six shops before I found a pair of Irish made shoes.  I am sure that the average Irish consumer going on the same trail would not bother going to the second shop.  The shopper should not be expected to.  If we are serious about getting support for home produce then our home industries must wake up to the fact that they must have their goods on display in the market place.  Irish goods must be of a standard that is at least comparable to that of their competitors from other countries.  It is highly unlikely that those competitors will display their worst products in our shop windows. Obviously, they will compete with us with their most highly finished product.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about the 8 per cent VAT on clothing.  I do not intend to go into the merits or demerits of that because I am sure the difficulties can be resolved, but in regard to clothing if any Member assumes he or she will find Irish made clothing in many shops in the city they are wrong.  We must wake up to this because in practically all areas of manufacturing we have to face serious and highly organised competition.  We must compete with them.  There is little use in saying that we are not able to complete because we do not have the same sophisticated techniques or cheap labour force that other countries have.  We have expertise in those areas but we are not using it properly.</P>
    <P>There is room for improvement in regard to home industries, particularly in the production of quality woollen goods. That market can be exploited further and it is possible to create quite a number of jobs in that area.</P>
    <P>Another area that should be considered <Col N="1946" /> is the construction industry.  I accept that the construction industry is under some pressure and, in fairness to the Government, it must be said that the budget does not militate against it.  It has been suggested by representatives of the industry that there is no incentive in the budget but if the Government descend into the area of subsidising that will not resolve the problems of the industry.  It will create a situation similar to that which existed in 1977 after an artifical injection was given to the business.  As soon as that assistance was withdrawn the industry went into decline again.  When I met representatives of the industry recently I asked about their failure to use all Irish products in their constructions. I was informed that they could buy cheaper and better products from abroad.  It was pointed out to me that if they did not buy from abroad their finished product would not be acceptable to the consumer, the person buying the house.  That is sad.  Surely in the area of timber production we should be able to perfect our products.  We should be able to give a little more attention to that at a time of high unemployment.  It should not be said that we are not able to compete with a foreign product.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has a bearing on the construction industry is planning and development.  A lot more could be done for the construction industry if we had proper regional planning instead of development taking place where services exist.  It has been held that it is economic to develop areas that are near proper water and sewerage facilities.  That is wrong because we would do a lot more for the country if we spread our development. We should have proper regional planning to allow for phased development over an entire region.  If we continue with the present type of development for another 20 or 30 years the best land in the country will be covered with concrete and we will be heading in a westerly, southerly and northerly direction. At the end of the day we will have one vast urban sprawl and at the same time we will have created more problems for the agricultural and horticultural industries.  If we do not discard such <Col N="1947" /> short-sighted policies we will end up with all of our best land under concrete and the less fertile areas left to meet our agricultural requirements.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of the need for those who had made profits in Ireland to show they have confidence in the nation and are willing to put their money back into the system and at the same time provide much needed jobs.  Bond-washing was referred to.  I fully appreciate that people in high risk businesses would feel that if they follow that avenue they will be taxed and will therefore react, but in the past they obviously made profits and therefore they should have the courage of their convictions and continue to invest so that these kinds of scares will not be created in this difficult time.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have spoken of our responsibility to young people.  I wish to refer to that subject simply by saying that we should all be very wary of saying to young people anything that might be misconstrued as a guarantee that we have a panacea for their problems and the general problems of the country.  None of us has the ultimate answer.  If we are honest and say that, we will get a far better response from young people than if we try to fob them off with remarks aimed at getting publicity but which will be of no benefit to our people.  We must appeal to them to co-operate with our efforts for the provision of the jobs they require.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden suggested a joint committee on unemployment.  The time has gone for talk of such committees.  We require dramatic action, and nobody on any side would suggest that we have not a serious problem.  Recognising and accepting that is the first step towards a solution: the most important part of treating an ailment is first to diagnose it and then accept the steps that must be taken towards its cure.  Deputy Leyden also spoke of the retirement age, particularly in the public service.  That is a worth-while, constructive proposal but I do not know if it will produce extra jobs. I have heard a figure of £200 million mentioned for the payment of lump sums and I submit that any such proposals are <Col N="1948" /> advisable only if we can find money to fund them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power and I come from the Kildare constituency where considerable unemployment has been caused in the past couple of years.  Some of our problems have been resolved, but some have not been.  We have a population of 107,000 and it behoves us to try to retain the jobs we have and try to encourage further investment.  In that regard we must get the IDA to do their utmost.</P>
    <P>Recently we have had a problem in relation to the power stations, with possible closures if the ESB strategy report is to be pursued.  I appeal to all Ministers responsible to do everything in their power to ensure that the lives of the power stations will not be shortened.  In Allenwood, for instance, there are 150 jobs directly given in the station and approximately 450 outside working for Bord na Móna to provide the raw material for the station.  Therefore, it would be a major tragedy if anything were done to close these stations prematurely.  I use the word &ldquo;prematurely&rdquo; advisedly because it is accepted that in 10 or 15 years these power stations will have reached the end of their viable lives and that afterwards alternatives will have to be found.  There is no sense in waiting until these alternatives can be provided. We should have been thinking of this for a long time.  There are thousands of acres of cutaway bogs which should be utilised for horticultural production or for beet and grass production.  We cannot allow that valuable resource to be wasted.</P>
    <P>Roadmaking is another source of employment as well as satisfying the need for a proper road network.  I accept that the cost of upkeep and running costs will be high but in areas like Kildare, geographically close to Dublin's large population, emphasis should be placed on the provision of a proper road network, a basic part of our infrastructure.  Improving and making roads in these areas will also provide much needed work in the service area and would speed up the transport of goods to and from the country, as well as alleviating the intolerable traffic bottlenecks which have been building up in the past ten years.  I compliment <Col N="1949" /> especially those responsible for the Naas by-pass which is certainly a road for the eighties.  I appeal to the Ministers for Finance and the Environment to ensure that that impetus will not be lost.</P>
    <P>I said earlier, and was criticised for it, that the concept of the dole is all wrong. The whole concept of giving money to people for doing nothing is wrong.  We must examine that matter.  Many areas of the country are disadvantaged and I accept that these have to be subsidised. The people in these areas need to supplement their income.  Whether it means a minimal increase in production, keeping another cow or growing another head of cabbage, they should have to do something for the money they receive.  Why can we not devise a system which would reward effort rather than the soul destroying system we have at present? People are totally dependent on the State and their children and their children's children will have that attitude.  It is time the whole system was changed.  I am not saying that funds should be stopped because I accept that people need to have their incomes supplemented.</P>
    <P>The private sector could do a lot by way of providing major road networks, bridges and so on.  The Minister for the Environment might consult with the various interests involved.  I understand some interest groups have already indicated their willingness to embark on such a road programme.  There is need for major road improvements particularly in the Leinster area where there is a great concentration of traffic.  The private sector should be encouraged to do what they claim they can do.</P>
    <P>Another area which it has been suggested should be developed is forestry. The Minister of State in that Department has some very constructive proposals. It is odd that in a country which is ideally suited both geographically and climatically that we lag so far behind our competitors in the production of timber. We can grow trees faster than our competitors and it is odd that we have not acted imaginatively or been able to capitalise on this vast resource.  I do not understand it.  I am sure other Members are worried that we have not developed <Col N="1950" /> this industry sufficiently.  I hope the proposals which are to be brought forward on the development of the forests are sufficiently imaginative to attract investors so that we will have a worthwhile national asset.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of medical cards from those in the 16 to 25 age bracket who are dependent on their parents' income has received wide publicity.  The Government did not take that decision lightly. We have heard a lot of scaremongering. We heard about the hardship that decision would create.  However, the various health boards have authority to investigate any case where hardship has occurred or is likely to occur and they have authority to issue medical cards in these instances and have often done so. It could happen that where a family were marginally over the income guidelines the whole family would quality for medical cards.  We should not overlook the fact that while the medical cards have been withdrawn out of necessity there is provision for hospital services for students and those in need.</P>
    <P>Many people will put forward alternative theories.  That is the job of Opposition, and rightly so.  However, the Opposition should be realistic.  They can put forward any idea they wish.  They can call for greater expenditure but they do not have to find it.  That is the difference between Government and Opposition.  I appeal to people on all sides to pool their resources and be as constructive as possible. We must try to grasp the imagination of all those who feel hard pressed in the community and we must combine our efforts to try to solve our problems.  I am sure that no one party has a monopoly of the ingenuity required to face up to these problems.</P>
    <P>In these straitened times today's population would expect us to have the courage, at least within this House, to co-operate to the greatest extent possible in the interest of solving that problem.  I say that because the opinion the general public have of public representatives and of the institutions of the State is not great. This may stem from one or two reasons. It may be because of something we have said or done or because of something we <Col N="1951" /> have failed to say or do but it may come from a failure on the part of the public generally to recognise the constraints within which Government and Opposition alike must work.  The public must realise that there are limitations to what can be done and that in present circumstances there is no point in calling on the State to provide goods or services that will cost more money while at the same time bringing about a situation of lower levels of taxation.  The two are not compatible.</P>
    <P>If we are to overcome our major economic problems we must convince a great number of people that their expectations are too high.  I am not suggesting that people should regard as acceptable the high level of unemployment but they must appreciate that they, too, have a responsibility in making efforts to resolve our problems.  The concept of self-help is all important, but it is a concept that seems to have become outdated.  People tend now to rely far too much on the system to resolve everything.  There is a tendency to blame the Government for all our problems.  An example of this situation manifested itself a couple of years ago at the time of heavy snowfalls. The Government of the day, who happened to be a Coalition Government, seemed to be blamed for the slowness with which the snow melted, for burst water pipes and so on.  One wonders what the people would have done if they had found themselves living in some of the Scandinavian countries or in Alaska or North America.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many references in recent times to the question of whether we were right to have joined the EEC.  It is argued sometimes that if we had stayed <Col N="1952" /> outside the Community we would have avoided the harsh competition with which we must live and that we would not have lost so many jobs.  That is true and it is true also that we became members basically to be able to avail of the benefits we were told would accrue to the agricultural industry.  It appears now that many of those benefits will be eroded unless we exercise extreme care.  I refer to the current discussions regarding the whole area of the CAP and the so-called milk super-levy and so on.</P>
    <P>However, if we had not joined the EEC we would not have been able to avail of the several thousands of millions of pounds that have accrued to us in the past ten years because of our membership. Without those injections, our economy might be in a very much worse position.  That is a factor that we should not forget.</P>

      <P>My first reaction on hearing the Minister's budget statement was one of sadness.  I drew an analogy between the situation with which we were being presented and that of the emperor who was discovered to have no clothes. I regarded the budget as a reneging on principles.  Last year I was inclined to believe that the Minister meant business and that he was intent on doing what he set out to do.</P>
      <P>To all intents and purposes the 1983 budget could be regarded as a Fianna Fáil budget, a budget that was revamped somewhat by the Coalition and adopted practically <i>in toto</i> by them.  In other words, there was a pooling of resources last year even if the measure did not prove to be all that effective.  I have heard a backbencher from the Fine Gael Party say that no party have the monopoly when it comes to ingenuity.  Perhaps the most appropriate collective noun for geniuses would be galaxy.  In any case, I am glad to find that the people on the backbenches opposite have come to realise that their side of the House do not have a galaxy of geniuses.</P>

      <P>Or even a shower of geniuses.  Last year much stress was put on the need to rid ourselves of current budget deficits.  We were told the matter would have to be resolved in a short time, that that was the main target of the Government.  Indeed, the whole issue resulted in an ideological row between the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance as to whether the deficit should be eliminated within four years or within seven years.  The gullible public were even prepared to give the Government the benefit of the doubt and to think they were serious in what they were saying, that that was their reason for being in Government.</P>
      <P>It is obvious now that the over-riding principle in so far as this budget is concerned is for the Coalition to remain in power for the full term.  Not only has the Minister done U-turns but he has done triple somersaults in respect of what he has laid down as the guidelines he intends following.  Why is it that what was so important in regard to financial matters, to fiscal rectitude and so on, is now being discarded?  I see every evidence of compromise in this budget.  In saying that I realise from my own experience that even within single-party Government there will be tensions and strains as between different Ministers and different Departments, with each Minister trying to do the best he can and to that extent endeavouring to get the best deal possible for his Department, but in this case I cannot understand what has happened.  The inter-departmental tensions are understandable but it is obvious now that the agonising that transpired between the different partners in Coalition resulted only in very long sessions in Barrettstown Castle and elsewhere and that the mountain produced a very meek mouse after all the agonising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this has proved that Coalitions do not work.  People are inclined to forget that, although they learn the lesson after the election of each Coalition.  This fourth Coalition, after one year are shown to be a distinct sham.  Very often Coalitions are likened to a mule.  They are stubborn but beyond that it might be <Col N="1954" /> dishonest to compare them with the mule, an animal which is regarded generally as being hard working.  Perhaps the comparison with a jennet might be more appropriate since that animal arrives in this world as a result of the coming together of two almost incompatible elements. In the case of the Coalition we might regard Fine Gael as being the more dominant, taking the part of the horse.  It would appear from this budget that the poor unfortunate Labour Party represent the ass that was left holding the baby. The only solace one can give to the plain people of Ireland is that Coalitions, like jennets, have not the capacity to reproduce themselves.  Never before in the history of the State have there been two successive Coalition Governments.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of this Government to produce any policies to create new employment opportunities particularly for young people.</P>
      <P>This Government stand condemned for their total failure and neglect in the area of employment and job creation.  They have not taken any positive steps to improve the appalling situation that exists with regard to job creation and the deterioration that has occurred is alarming. In their 14 months in office the Government have not applied themselves seriously to treating the greatest cancer in our society, that of unemployment and especially youth unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should start with the programme drawn up by both parties in Government in the halcyon, euphoric days when the Labour Party and Fine Gael were busy hammering together a programme they hoped would enable them to grasp the reins of power.  I will quote two paragraphs from that programme.  The first <Col N="1955" /> paragraph, which was the introduction, was as follows:</P>
    <P>The unemployment situation with 170,000 unemployed, 50,000 of them under 25 years of age, and the state of the public finances facing a new Government taking office at the end of 1982 are alarming.  Both require firm and decisive action by such a Government. The dual task of halting and reversing the growth of unemployment, while phasing out the current budget deficit, poses a greater challenge than any Irish Government has faced domestically since the early years of the State.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Power, has dealt with the U-turn with regard to the budget deficit and I do not intend to dwell further on that.  However, I wish to draw the attention of the House to the decisive and firm action that was going to be taken by this great new Government in those euphoric days to tackle the unemployment problem.  Let me refer the House to the unemployment figures issued yesterday. The 170,000 referred to in the joint programme has become 215,552, an increase of 45,000.  Unemployment among the under 25-year olds was 50,000 but now it has become 67,633.  Let me quote the second paragraph from the joint programme under the heading &ldquo;Planning for Economic Recovery&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Permanent structures will be established by the Government to ensure effective economic and social planning.</P>
    <P>1.  The new Government will set up an employment task force of three economic Ministers led by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste through which the two parties in Government will share responsibility for initiating the immediate employment generating process.</P>
    <P>What progress has that much-lauded and often mentioned task force achieved?  I want to know from the Minister of State in the House how many times that group <Col N="1956" /> of Ministers met with the task force and how many jobs they have created.</P>
    <P>I referred to the growth in the unemployment figures as announced yesterday. Before going further I want to draw the attention of the House to the wordy amendment submitted in the name of the Minister for Labour.  The amendment states:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;, while greatly concerned at the continuing high level of unemployment and in particular its impact on young people, notes that the rate of growth of unemployment has been halved since the election of the Government in December, 1982 and approves the actions and plans of the Government which, in conjunction with an adequate response from every section of the Community, will provide the necessary framework to combat unemployment successfully&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Will the House be told what are the actions and the plans of the Government? Has ever a more negative amendment to a motion been put before this House? What an achievement to halve the rate of growth of unemployment.  This is said after a month in which we had the highest growth in unemployment.  Shame on the Minister of State in the House, shame on the Government and shame on an unimaginative Minister who could not find a better formula of words to amend our motion.  It proves their lack of interest in solving what I stated was the greatest cancer in our society.</P>
    <P>We are talking of 215,000 people unemployed but that does not include many of the closures that have been announced and that have taken place in the past week or so.  It does not include the young people who will come on the employment market in a few months, probably somewhere in the region of 19,000 to 20,000.  When we consider those people we are talking about 250,000 and when we realise that fewer than 196,000 are employed in manufacturing industry we must become very alarmed at the figures.  Despite all this, <Col N="1957" /> the Government are proud they have halved the rate of growth of unemployment. In their 14 months in office there has been an increase of 45,000 in the unemployed, including 7,500 for the month of January which was the highest total ever recorded for January.</P>
    <P>The second budget introduced by this Government gave little or no hope to the unemployed or to those whose jobs are in jeopardy.  Neither did it give any encouragement to employers to increase their number of workers.  If we realise that each additional 1,000 persons on the dole queues costs us in the region of £2,500,000, that gives us some indication of the inadequacy of the budget with regard to lack of planning.  This budget had one objective, namely, to keep the Labour Party and Fine Gael in Government for a little while longer.  The budget did not have any plan or programme to try to arrest the enormous growth in our unemployment figures.  The Government are leading the country on a dangerous downward trend.  Confidence and optimism have been shattered and it is becoming increasingly apparent that the budget was aimed to devise ways and means to keep these two parties in office.</P>
    <P>Let me recollect some of the comments of these parties in those days of October and November 1982.  Fine Gael said they would halt and reverse the trend of unemployment. Would those people who like to talk about U-turns compare the comments of those days with this evening's amendment?  Labour said they were going to have a voice in Government that would be heard.  In fact, they went much further.  They said:</P>
    <P>The Labour Party offers such a radical programme in this election.  We represent ordinary working people,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>They do not represent very many working people today &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;not big business, large farmers, or land speculators.  Our policies are different.</P>
    <P>Labour does not accept the prospect of continuing mass unemployment. But young people must have the legitimate hope of worthwhile work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1958" /> Labour stands for planned economic development and for a jobs programme led by the public sector.</P>
    <P>In their comments on the economy and jobs they said:</P>
    <P>LABOUR'S POLICY IS:</P>
    <P>1.  active public sector involvement in job creation in industry with rigorous projects appraisal to ensure lasting productive jobs;</P>
    <P>What has become of that public sector job creation programme?  What has become of that rigorous project appraisal?  In the second paragraph they said:</P>
    <P>2.  a strong, effective and independent National Development Corporation, with powers to invest up to £500 million in equity capital in industry and with borrowing powers of £1,000 million.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation we have heard about for so long has obviously been put to bed or laid to rest, but no longer forms a plank in a Government who do not have any commitment to job creation or to rescuing the legitimate hopes of young people to whom Labour promised so much.  The figure 50,000 people has become 67,000, with a further 20,000 school-leavers to come on the market within the next few months.</P>
    <P>I will now discuss the task force.  First, a Government are elected to govern, not to blame task forces, having appointed them, not to set up review bodies, and not to set up committees to examine what are really Government problems and decisions.  With this Government we have had jobs created, but they were jobs for the ardent party faithful by way of advisers, committees, review bodies, task forces and State board appointments. They are the only jobs we have seen emanating from this inefficient Government.</P>
    <P>This Taoiseach, with the help of highly paid handlers, has been avoiding the main problems and has placed a heavy reliance on public relations as a substitute for Government.  These handlers, highly paid and well provided for, are the people <Col N="1959" /> who decide what the media, the press and the public are to be told about certain proposed and hoped for Government actions.  This situation has become so ludicrous that I will quote from one of the papers prepared by these handlers &mdash; the <i>New Democrat</i>, a Fine Gael Party paper.  On the front page there are a number of engagements and I congratulate the lucky persons involved but there the joy ends.  On the front page there is a heading &ldquo;Take off: Up, and Away, say Economists&rdquo;, &ldquo;By a Special Correspondent&rdquo;. Even a Fine Gael member was ashamed to put his name to this production. He did not have the audacity to put his name to the dishonest rubbish written in this paper.  He said:</P>
    <P>One year after taking office the Government has turned around the economy and positioned it to achieve real growth for the first time in the '80s.</P>
    <P>Now the Budget of Finance Minister, Alan Dukes, will consolidate the economic gains of the past 12 months and fuel recovery in 1984 and beyond.</P>
    <P>Is this what the 250,000 people who are unemployed want to read?  How far can Fine Gael go with this dishonest rubbish? There must be some limit.  This argument goes on to say that national pride has been restored.  What do they mean by that, particularly when there are 67,000 young people under 25 years unemployed &mdash; 14 months ago that figure was 40,000. This special correspondent is obviously one of these very eminent and highly paid handlers whom this Government believe are the top priority and whose greatest concern is to provide stories for the general public.  As Deputy Power said very effectively, the general public are not easily taken in by stories of this nature and the only luck this country ever had is that it never had successive Coalition Governments.  Would it not be dreadful if such a prospect faced the people?</P>
    <P>Let us compare this with the criticism at the time of the motion of no confidence at the end of 1982?  We had succeeded in producing a plan, <i>The Way Forward</i>.  At that time the challenge facing us was the same as it is today &mdash; how to provide <Col N="1960" /> employment for our young people and still make growth and investment while working within the financial constraints imposed by a severe and unexpectedly prolonged recession.  This is the challenge from which this Government are retreating, hiding behind the National Planning Board or the task force, whichever one likes to call it.  How many meetings have this committee had with the Minister or the sub-committee of Ministers over the last 14 months?  I call for immediate Government leadership and direction to bring together all the State agencies with a view to giving top priority to job creation. This is urgent.</P>
    <P>If this motion succeeds in doing nothing else but getting some action from this Government who have been sitting on this very important issue, it will have served its purpose.  We must convince the people behind the Minister that this type of approach is not good enough.  This Government have set a record because the unemployment figures for January have been the highest since we began keeping records.</P>
    <P>There are a few suggested ways and they are among the many possibilities; one could go on and on.  There must be some imaginative people in that Government. Yet why was the chance lost?  At present we have a building and construction industry on its knees to an extent not experienced even in the fifties.  Unemployment in that industry at national level is in the region of 50 per cent and, in my region, has gone even higher.  Surely a further investment of, say, between £100 million and £200 million in public capital projects would have more than paid for itself because of the immediate impact that industry can have on job creation and its resultant activity; one could say almost self-financing.  It has been agreed that probably it is the fastest industry to provide jobs and a great one to stimulate activity in the economy generally.</P>
    <P>What about the Fianna Fáil agricultural plan?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I would advise the Minister of State not to be flippant because I am talking about a very serious matter.  I shall come to some of his areas of activity in a moment.  Mind you, I resent officials in the House sniggering when I speak.  I have been in this House a long time &mdash; I have not yet experienced that, madam Chairman, and I protest, please, that if officials are allowed sit in the House they do observe a neutral stance while in the House.  At least as long as I have been here that has been my experience and I hope it will continue.  There is also the danger that the &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo; syndrome in this Government may well be inclined to change that neutral stance and that would not help our democratic process.</P>
      <P>Also we could be selective in our tax cuts particularly in regard to the liquor industry.  Here I speak for a city and region extremely hard hit by unemployment at present where the only traditional industry with which we are left is the liquor industry.  They are very big employers.  Of course in this city also there is the old traditional brewery, an exceptionally big employer.  There are many smaller breweries in some of the other towns in the provinces.  That industry of itself can generate jobs.  As the House is aware, there is the problem of cross-Border smuggling.  I believe such tax cuts would help prevent that also.  We are all aware that such smuggling practices have reached serious proportions for the liquor industry.  Of course it would have an impact also on the tourist industry in need of stimulation and which can also provide jobs quickly through the stimulation of such activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other areas in which this Government appear to have either not the will or perhaps have a traditional hesitancy &mdash; I am not quite sure but for one reason or the other &mdash; one such being the area of &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo;.  In our time we had established in two Government Departments special sub-committees to find ways and means of examining first of all, what was being purchased by State bodies that could be purchased at home, and what was perhaps being encouraged <Col N="1962" /> from abroad where import substitution could play a major role.  We took this matter very seriously and made a lot of progress but a lot remained to be done. Somehow or other of late one hears very little of &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; or of import substitution. In this whole area we as a small nation can benefit a lot.  I admire the IDA for what they have done.  They have served us well although it is in recent times only they have acceded to the requests of many politicians to go more for the smaller industry than they had been inclined to do in the past.  I am glad of this development and I encourage them in this respect.  With regard to my own hard-hit area and the Cork region generally a more flexible approach was needed by the IDA, at times involving greater risk-taking than has been the case to date.  I said as a Minister, and say again now in Opposition, that the other agencies are also in need of some loosening up.  Here I refer particularly to the Industrial Credit Company and, at times to An Fóir Teoranta, at a time when unemployment is high and it is difficult to attract new industry.  At times like these there must be greater risks taken by those bodies in the interests of creating employment.</P>
    <P>My colleague will expand on the subject of food imports, he having greater knowledge in that area.  But they have reached alarming proportions.  I think I am right in saying they are now second in the league of imports.  As a nation surely we should be in a position to produce so much of our food at home.  There was a question asked today of the Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding some meat consignments being held in France.  Very little progress appeared to have been made.  I understood they would be released this evening anyway but at 3.30 or 4 o'clock this afternoon the Minister for Foreign Affairs had no information that they had been released.</P>
    <P>I did say I would revert to the area of responsibility of the Minister of State in the House and pose some questions to him.  If there has been a scheme introduced by somebody else which I believe to be a good one I will not always be critical, I will support it too, as I have <Col N="1963" /> always done.  In this respect I believe that the enterprise allowance scheme was quite a helpful one.  I cannot understand, however, why in the budget no additional money was provided for that scheme. Rather we were treated to a lot of platitudes. If the Minister of State tells me that he has got money I shall be delighted.  But a lot of platitudes were advanced by the Minister for Finance in the House about this great scheme, maintaining that on further examination, he would ascertain whether money could or would be made available for it.  I believe this to be a good scheme.  As Deputy Power said a few moments ago there is the galaxy of geniuses.  I accept also that the entire galaxy of geniuses or ideas does not lie on these benches here; there are some across the floor.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand why the Minister or his Minister of State was not in a position to say: look, we want more money for this scheme.  As the Minister of State well knows, there are people in my constituency seeking aid under that scheme who as, of now, do not qualify. I hope the Minister will have good news for me in this respect.  I see him fumbling through his papers and, if he has such good news, I shall be delighted.  But I was disappointed that the Minister for Finance in the House on budget day did not give money to that scheme.  It is pathetic if that is an indication of the commitment of the Minister for Finance to a scheme I believe to be a helpful one, one I believe can be of some assistance in a very difficult unemployment scene, when every viable or worthwhile scheme must be examined and supported.  Unless it receives such support and the essential finance then it cannot be the success one would like.</P>
    <P>I want to know somewhat more about this famous Youth Employment Agency. When it was established I supported it because I believed that any steps taken would be useful in the interests of youth employment.  I supported it when I went back as Minister in March 1982 although other Ministers in my shoes might have been tempted, because of the obvious politicking that was going on in the days <Col N="1964" /> and hours before the take-over of that Government in March 1982, to say: &ldquo;This is too much of a political body now being set up.&rdquo;  I accepted all that I was handed &mdash; an agency whose board were fighting because of the circumstances of the appointment of their chief executive. Probably there was a vested interest there also in the light of subsequent development. I stood by that decision of my predecessor, in the interests of young people.  What have that agency done in a positive way since then?  I respect the chief executive who is hard working, sincere and committed, but from the very beginning the problem with this agency was that it was the birth child of a hastily prepared Labour Party document for the 1981 general election.  It was conceived in haste for that manifesto and delivered at the Gaiety Theatre conference which followed.  It was a premature birth, as was obvious when one got to the nitty gritty details of the agency.</P>
    <P>The agency have to date, acquired fine offices and have built up a reasonable staff level.  They have helped in a number of areas but I believe that this smacks again of appointing an additional agency to do something which could have been done by one or other of the existing agencies, or perhaps a combination of some of them.  The agency were given a co-ordinating role and obviously, because of well known internal Cabinet strain and open conflict between the Coalition Minister for Education and Minister for Labour, it was decided one heady day last summer to appoint consultants.  That was announced publicly &mdash; I read of it in the press &mdash; but that decision was reversed, I understand.  The Minister shakes his head but I read it in the press. Subsequently this appointment was withdrawn, or not confirmed.  The intended purpose, according to the report, was that the consultants examine the YEA with a view to deciding their co-ordinating role specifically.  Perhaps those who were handling this decision went prematurely to the press and should not have done so so soon.</P>
    <P>The ordinary working people are paying a 1 per cent levy.  Nobody will complain if that is genuinely going towards <Col N="1965" /> the employment of youth, but we must remember adult employment also.  There is a very strong need at present to examine both areas of employment and a moral responsibility.  We all have in our constituencies, in addition to the sons and daughters who are unemployed, the mature person who has lost his or her job in the late forties or in the fifties who will have extreme difficulty in getting further employment.  If the 1 per cent levy were being used to that end, that would be good, but it is not.  This levy was introduced in the 1983 budget by the present Minister for Finance and was retained by him in the recent budget.  Here we have the Youth Employment Agency established for political reasons, to which I gave my blessing and support in the interests of young people.  The Minister of State must know that it has not made the progress or had the impact expected of it. There are tensions in many of the areas in which it works.  One must ask is this idea of other agencies, task forces and committees the answer to the nation's problems?  I suggest that it is not.</P>
    <P>I want from the Minister a commitment to the enterprise allowance scheme and to its extension impressing on the Minister for Finance why it must be extended. The Minister was very critical a little over a year ago of the manner in which the agency money was allocated, but I want him to outline how much of that 1 per cent levy of this year was allocated directly to the use of the Youth Employment Agency and in what areas of expenditure.</P>

      <P>Can somebody spell out to me what are the steps, action and plans of this Government in the area which is most important to all of us? There are 215,000 idle, certainly on the way towards a quarter of a million people; in manufacturing industry the number of unemployed is 196,000 people &mdash; every thousand extra on social welfare costing in the region of £2½ million.  These are the stark realities.  What answers are <Col N="1966" /> being provided at present?  I suggest none.  I referred earlier to the joint policy for Government and the famous comments in the Labour Party document and in the Fine Gael document.  I have been reluctant to refer to my own area, which particularly during the present time is going through a very traumatic period, especially for the young, and where there is a growing need for Government action and response.  How do the Government respond?  With another task force, although it will be welcome if it produces results.  We have so many agencies, task forces and committees that soon we shall not see beyond them to where the real problem lies.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State must be aware that the real problem lies in those who are unemployed at present, adult or young.  They deserve better from this Government who have a responsibility to face the task handed over to them and assumed by them 14 months ago.  To date, they have handled it badly.  No amount of public relations and no expenditure on handlers by way of direct payment, expenses, or anything else will compensate for what is expected of the Government &mdash; the provision of jobs.</P>
      <P>How many jobs have been created by the Youth Employment Agency?  How many applications have there been under the enterprise allowance scheme?  How many have been accepted and how many are outstanding?  What other plans have the Government as a matter of urgency, because this surely is an emergency?  The Government must stop waffling, claiming credit for halving the growth of something which would be already miles too high even if it were reduced to one-tenth. The growth in the month of February of 7,500 is the highest growth rate for that month since records began.  That is the stark reality.  I ask the Minister and the Labour Party to withdraw the amendment which is before them and to accept our motion:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of this Government to produce any policies to create new employment opportunities particularly for young people.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;, while greatly concerned at the continuing high level of unemployment and in particular its impact on young people, notes that the rate of growth of unemployment has been halved since the election of the Government in December, 1982 and approves the actions and plans of the Government which, in conjunction with an adequate response from every section of the Community, will provide the necessary framework to combat unemployment successfully.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not the least interesting aspect of this motion is its timing.  Last Wednesday, <i>The Irish Times</i> published an opinion poll showing the Opposition languishing in some difficulties.  Last Friday, the Opposition spokesman on Labour tabled this motion.  Perhaps that is a coincidence and perhaps not.  One could speculate as to the origin of this motion.  One can see it now.  The centurions of the legion of the rearguard assemble on the fifth floor, and in struts the boss to review the progress on the opinion poll.  &ldquo;We are in trouble on the opinion poll.  What are we going to do?&rdquo;  The collective wisdom of the centurions is &ldquo;Unemployment.  They must be vulnerable on unemployment. Unemployment is still going up&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Put in a motion on unemployment,&rdquo; suggests <Col N="1968" /> the boss.  One can even speculate how Deputy Gene Fitzgerald might have responded to such a suggestion.  &ldquo;A master stroke, boss, it is only yourself could have thought of it&rdquo;.  That would be the suggestion from the centurions of the rearguard.</P>
    <P>The tone and attitude taken by Deputy Fitzgerald in this debate are strikingly different from the attitude taken by his party colleagues in the Seanad who debated similar motions.  In the Seanad there was some attempt to grapple with the problem and to offer hope to young people who look to this House for leadership. On this occasion there has been nothing but platitudes and clichés.  The speech we have heard from the Opposition benches, had it been delivered by a young county councillor hoping for a chance of the third place on the ticket, might have earned marks for effort. Made as it was by the Opposition front bench spokesman and former Minister for Labour, it deserves marks for audacity. Does Deputy Fitzgerald expect the House to forget that it is not so long since he occupied an office on the fourth floor in Mespil Road, that he did so between March and December 1982, that he took office when unemployment stood at 148,004 and left office when unemployment stood at 179,867, an increase during the seven-month period of 31,863 or 21.5 per cent?  I do not think anyone will be fooled.  People expect of us a little better than that.  They expect us to approach this problem in a serious and rational way and together to offer some hope and some indication of where lies our way out of this morass.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful to begin by attempting to identify the sources of our present problem.  Basically these sources are four in number.  We have an international recession and we have an increase in the labour force.  There has been a decrease in competitiveness through the increase in labour costs.  Constraints have been placed on us by the state of public finances, constraints on our capacity to finance job creation measures on the scale we would wish.</P>
    <P>Let us look briefly at each of those four factors.  The impact of the international <Col N="1969" /> recession can be seen by the fact that unemployment in the EEC has risen in virtually unbroken sequence since 1972. The growth in the labour force is capable of being measured very accurately because those who will be entering the labour market between now and the end of the century are already born.  The best estimate we have is that during this period there will be an increase in the range of 18,000 to 20,000 a year.  Our ability to maintain people in jobs or to create fresh jobs is directly related to our ability to sell Irish goods in the supermarkets of Croydon or Finchley or the supermarkets of Donaghmeade or Cornelscourt. In the twenty-third round it is true that most of the settlements were responsible and took account of the capacity of the companies involved to pay and of our capacity as a society to bear the cost.  There were some examples of very unfortunate capitulation, some from those who in the past had been amongst those most assertive in a position or moral superiority.  Regarding public finances, the resources are not available to us to expand the economy or finance the kind of job creation measures we would wish.</P>
    <P>Everybody in this House must accept that our ability to reverse the trend in unemployment depends upon a sustained growth rate.  The Government's economic strategy has as its central objective the creation of conditions in which employment will be available to our people and the weaker sections of the community will be protected.  It has become fashionable from the benches opposite to dismiss us as being concerned with book-keeping or whatever.  Our entire economic strategy is designed to achieve that central objective &mdash; the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>This debate takes place at a time when the economy is delicately balanced.  The severe measures of last year's budget have begun to produce buds.  Our industrial exports grew by about 14 per cent in volume in 1983.  Agricultural exports were up 3 per cent and manufacturing output expanded by about 6 per cent. Our inflation rate, which had been out of control, has been curbed.</P>

      <P>Now more than ever it is absolutely essential that the search for self-sustaining employment is undertaken against a backdrop of appropriate economic planning and that is central to Government policy.  The Government respond in the short term, the medium term and the long term.  In the short term the National Planning Board has been established, comprised of a small number of experts of the highest possible national repute.  As the Taoiseach today asserted in the House, the alleviation of unemployment is one of the main objectives of their report, now in course of preparation, which will be before us by early March or early April.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald has referred to the activities of the task force of key economic Ministers and dismissed them.  He then spent a substantial portion of his time congratulating them on their wisdom in producing the enterprise allowance scheme.  I will not satisfy Deputy Fitzgerald by telling him what the Government intend in that regard.  I suggest that he could do worse than read the budget speech of the Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn, if he wants some indication.  In any event, the Minister will be intervening later in the debate.</P>

      <P>The IDA continue to be in the forefront of our job creation strategy.  Reference was made to a change of emphasis.  With regard to overseas industries, the IDA have been properly concentrating on the attraction to Ireland of high technology, electronics, the health care area, chemicals, but at the same time they are actively pursuing a policy for the development of our existing domestic industrial base and a major part of that effort is directed towards the development of small native industries.</P>
      <P>The Government &mdash; they have done this in common with all our partners in the OECD &mdash; have taken a number of selective measures in the manpower area, particularly in the area of training, work experience and temporary employment schemes.  In that context I was interested to hear Deputy Fitzgerald refer to <i>The Way Forward</i> because I understood that document had more or less been publicly burned at this stage.  I was glad to hear that it has not been because <i>The Way Forward</i> suggested targets in a number of areas, some of which have now been forgotten.  One of the areas it addressed itself to was the participation rate that was expected in the various temporary employment and training schemes.  It asserted with some confidence at page 107 that in 1983 30,250 young people would participate in one or other of those schemes.  The House will be interested to know that that figure of 30,250 was bettered and that in fact 34,633 young people participated.  Let it be said that is on the basis of comparing an actual achievement as distinct from a projected target.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1984 what progress did they propose to make?  They were going to increase their participation rate from 30,250 to 32,400.  This year we will achieve a participation rate of 41,300, a 27 per cent increase on the targets set, <Col N="1972" /> never mind achieved by the party opposite. We have not been satisfied simply to increase the participation rate because that is not an answer in itself.  We have been determined to improve the quality of the experience available to the young people participating in those programmes and to ensure that those programmes are targeted at those most in need, those who can be objectively determined as being the most disadvantaged. That has been done with the assistance of the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
      <P>I want to turn my attention to the area of entrepreneurial development.  It is recognised that in Ireland young people find special difficulties in establishing their own business.  For example, they are said to have a lack of experience, a lack of a proven track record and, therefore, they have difficulty in getting access to State or private funds.  They also have insufficient personal finance to put into a business.  At the same time, with high levels of youth unemployment prevailing and access to traditional salaried employment more restricted, more and more young people in Ireland are considering, and are being invited to consider, self-employment as a career option.  It was graciously acknowledged by Deputy Fitzgerald that the recently introduced enterprise allowance scheme had a very large response and provides the basis for many unemployed people, including young unemployed people, to find productive self-employment, something that would otherwise be denied to them.  I have already indicated that that is an area which I expect the Minister for Labour will be developing at greater length tomorrow.</P>

      <P>Representing the country at a conference on employment and job creation.  In addition to the published range of supports and incentives available from the IDA, other State organisations and private finance agencies, there are a number of measures and incentives particularly designed to help young people.  There is, first of all, the <Col N="1973" /> innovatory job creation projects.  A number of pilot schemes are supported by the Youth Employment Agency including schemes in Cork, at Carrigtwohill, in Dublin at Glasnevin and in the mid-west.</P>

      <P>It is very curious how Deputy Fitzgerald never finds it possible to use Question Time but he is always eager to avail of any other time that is available in the House.  These schemes are in progress at present and will be evaluated once completed with a view to determining their wider application. There is also the community and youth enterprise programme aimed at directly involving community, voluntary and youth organisations in creating economically sustainable employment for young people and raising the general level of enterprise and self-help among young people.  The approach of the programme is essentially to help communities to help themselves and to do that by providing, first of all, advice to groups who want to take a community enterprise initiative.  There are planning grants for groups wishing to identify and investigate goods and services which might be provided locally.  There are enterprise workers recruited by local community groups to be funded by the Youth Employment Agency for up to 12 months.  The enterprise workers must be under 25 years of age and must have been <Col N="1974" /> unemployed prior to being recruited. There are linkages into that programme and grant aid schemes and other State and commercial activities, direct financial aid for groups at the point of starting, specifically to contribute towards capital and revenue requirements and project management costs for up to 12 months. The agency have already provided funding for the employment of enterprise workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>A number have already been recruited and after being recruited go on to complete a nine-week training course in the National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin.  In a number of other cases planning grants have been approved already.  The youth self-employment programme is designed to assist unemployed young people who want to set up a business by enabling them to get a bank loan without security or without being able to establish a track record.</P>
      <P>The Youth Employment Agency guarantee 60 per cent of outstanding capital payments on individual loans offered under that programme.  The loans are being provided by the Bank of Ireland up to a maximum of £3,000 per person repayable over three years at the normal bank lending rate and subject to normal repayment conditions.  A condition of the loan is that recipients cease to draw unemployment benefit or assistance and that they register for VAT and pay-related social insurance.</P>
      <P>On the broader issues of long-term risk capital I want to draw the House's attention to the comments of the Minister for Finance in his budget speech.  It is believed that specific tax encouragements are desirable.  Investment is urgently needed, particularly to support an expansion of activity in small manufacturing industry which has proved to be a valuable source of employment.  It is proposed to allow income tax relief up to a specific ceiling each year for individuals who provide long-term risk capital for new manufacturing enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, in addition, job creation <Col N="1975" /> programmes which are funded, though not operated, by the Youth Employment Agency.  The first of those is the young scientist and technologist employment scheme.  This is designed to promote the employment of young people with science and engineering qualifications and to assist firms to increase their technological capabilities.  The scheme is run by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the National Board for Science and Technology.  In 1983, the first year of the scheme, 80 engineering graduates and diploma holders participated. The second scheme I want to refer to is called Marketplace and is operated by the Irish Goods Council.  It was launched in the latter half of 1983.  It is a job creation programme for young marketing graduates with the objective of encouraging companies to employ marketing graduates by providing them with grants of up to 60 per cent of the salary in the first year.  The only condition for interested companies is that they give an assurance of their intention to retain the executives at the end of the one-year period.  Already a number of young people have found employment under that scheme.  All of those opportunities for young people complement the extensive help being provided through vocational training and employment schemes as well as the wider range of activities of the Youth Employment Agency to which my colleague, the Minister for Labour, will address himself tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Clearly relevant here is the whole area of our entitlement to participation in the Social Fund.  On the question of the European Social Fund, following its recent review it was agreed that at least 75 per cent of the total credits available would be allocated to operations for young people under 25 years of age.  The guidelines for the management of the fund are laid down by the Commission and are reviewed annually.  The draft guidelines, however, provide, firstly for the operations immediately after the end of full-time compulsory education to further the employment of young people under 25, consisting of basic vocational <Col N="1976" /> training including work experience leading to a real prospect of stable employment in a framework of a programme lasting a total of at least six months; secondly, operations to further the employment of young people under 25 whose qualifications have, through experience, proved inadequate or inappropriate, consisting of full-time or part-time vocational training aimed at equipping them with higher skills and qualifications adapted to labour market developments, facilitating the introduction of new technology in particular and leading to real prospects of stable employment; thirdly operations concerning recruitment to additional and permanent jobs or concerning employment in projects for the creation of additional jobs which will fill a public need. The programmes for young people under 25 at present being carried out with fund assistance in Ireland will continue to benefit under the rules of the new fund.</P>
    <P>Ireland has maintained its position as one of the six super-priority regions within the Community.  Those are the regions to which 40 per cent of the fund is to be devoted and the regions which qualify for aid at the rate of 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate before concluding that I should refer to the whole question of co-ordination in the area of Manpower training and education services.  This area has received considerable attention in the past year.  Some people have argued that, due to the rapid expansion of youth programmes and other job creation measures, the area of responsibility within the education world and the world of training has become somewhat blurred.  There has been a degree of uncertainty about the role of the Departments of Education and Labour and the Manpower authorities <i>vis-à-vis</i> the overall context of youth education and training.  Following the Government's concern over the perceived duplication and overlap in those areas, it was decided in December of last year to appoint me to be Minister of State at the Department of Education and at the Department of Labour with additional responsibility &mdash; more specifically responsibility for co-ordination of education and training.  Since then the Government have considered the matter <Col N="1977" /> further and it was decided that I should, in conjunction with the Ministers for Education and Labour, prepare a number of agreed recommendations as soon as possible.  The areas to be covered would include the various Manpower authorities, for example, the NMS, AnCO, YEA, CERT and other agencies as well as certain sections of the Department of Education.  Already I have been in contact with a large number of relevant organisations requesting their views and comments on this whole question of co-ordination. My examination&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One area that has not been touched on in this debate but which is of some relevance is the whole area of State support for the voluntary youth sector.  When we took office, it will be recalled, the Estimates of expenditure had been published by the outgoing administration.  Those Estimates showed the scant regard in which the voluntary youth sector was held by that Government.  They provided for an increase of 1 per cent in State support to that area.  We entered Government with a commitment to regard that area as a priority and we delivered on that.  Last year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it was possible to increase the Estimate originally provided for by the outgoing administration by £550,000 at a time when the people most immediately interested in the National Youth Council had been seeking an increase of only £500,000. <Col N="1978" /> This year it has been possible to increase that purse further and the Estimates published provide for a 13 per cent increase in the grant-in-aid subhead.  In addition to that it was possible to provide a further £100,000 in the budget aimed at those dealing with disadvantaged young people, specifically disadvantaged young people in major urban areas.  This is directly relevant to what we are talking about.  Deputy Fitzgerald has been mumbling on a few occasions about how many jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can end my speech by telling Deputy Fitzgerald and the House a story of a visit that I made quite soon after my appointment. It was to the Limerick Youth Service which is under the charge and control of Sister Joan, a nun who, personally and almost single-handedly, directs and takes responsibility for their activities.  She saw a serious problem of youth unemployment in Limerick and she was dealing with those worst affected and hardest hit. Many of them came from broken homes and all of them came from areas with unemployment rates above the national average and, indeed, above the city average. Some of them had been in trouble with the law.  She determined for herself to do something about it.  She identified the fact that her youth premises was in an area of office buildings and she decided to employ two or three young people making sandwiches for workers in those offices and so found work for two or three young people.  Taking it a step further, she opened a canteen providing lunches for those office workers, and that was work for three or four more.  She did not leave it at that.  She thought of the many other voluntary organisations and community groups in Limerick all of whom must require to have printing done, so she got herself a printing press and two or three people are employed in that.  The net effect of that one nun's determination and commitment is that 80 young people have now found employment in Limerick, not all of it of a permanent <Col N="1979" /> nature it is true, under her auspices. That kind of drive, selflessness and commitment is what this country needs and we must all address ourselves to sparking that if we are to make real progress in eliminating this scourge.</P>

      <P>I listened attentively for about 29 of the 30 minutes of the contribution of the Minister of State to hear if he had any new plans, programmes or strategy to combat this social cancer that is afflicting the country.  He tried to give us a lecture and his presence fairly represents the type of commitment the Government have to tackle unemployment in general and youth unemployment in particular.  The Minister concluded his contribution by telling a story about Sister Joan in Limerick but I can tell many stories in a similar vein about a sister, who shall remain nameless, in the town of Granard who has done equally as good.  However, the 69,000 young people want to know a little more from the Government.  In an effort to find out what the Government intend doing about unemployment we tabled a motion drawing attention to the lack of commitment and concern by the Government in the area of youth unemployment contrary to what they misled the people to believe in the last two general elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our constructive role as an Opposition we tabled this motion but the first response from the Government by the Minister of State did not leave me any wiser than I was before he commenced. Indeed, the young people who were anxious to get an answer or a direction from the Government will be amazed also.  It strikes me that the Government do not know where they are going.  There is an <Col N="1980" /> old saying that if one does not know where one is going any road will get one there and that is in line with Government thinking.  The Minister told us tonight that the unemployed can have a little bit of this and a little bit of that, a bit of this scheme and a bit of that one, but he was not able to project the impact the schemes he mentioned would have on the unemployment problem.  When the Minister calls on the House to give a commitment the first thing the people outside are entitled to ask for are the facts, not fairy tales.  The Minister should deal in the truth of those facts and he should not try to continue to mislead the public as to what they are about and what the Government think they are doing.  We are aware that the Government have at their disposal one of the best propaganda machines going, but all the propaganda in the world will not hide the reality that there are at least 69,000 young people who do not know where they are going. The Government, if they continue to misrepresent the facts and mislead the young people, are only fooling themselves at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State told the House that foreign borrowing had reduced.  I wonder why he is trying to convince anybody about that when we are all aware that foreign borrowing for 1983 increased by £100 million.  That information came from the Department of Finance, and I wonder why the Minister has tried to mislead the country on those figures.  The Minister's contribution was nothing more than &ldquo;more of the same&rdquo;. The Government since they took office have sacrificed our young people and the unemployed on the altar of political expediency.  They have refused to take the decisions they know are necessary in our economy.  They have preached financial rectitude but practised the opposite. They tried to convince the people that they have not borrowed any money abroad and spoke about financial constraints, but I should like to know if they can tell our young people why the national debt increased to £2,900 million in 1983 without anything to show for it. Such serious questions are being asked by the unemployed because they cannot <Col N="1981" /> see any results.  The Government should not try to con them into believing that they are not borrowing money.  They should tell the truth, that they refused to take the decisions in the day to day running of the country but reduced capital spending because it is the soft option. The Government refused to take the hard decisions that are necessary and that is our real problem.  When the Government decided to exempt the public service from cuts in spending they commenced their journey on the road to nowhere and will sink the economy further into the depths of disaster.</P>
    <P>We now have 750,000 taxpayers and the balance of our population are totally dependent on them.  The Government told us of giving relief in the area of taxation and they con the people into believing that they have got such relief, but when they get their pay packets next April they will know that those earning between £6,000 and £12,000 will receive in the region of 86p per week.  If that amounts to relief the Government can have it.  The Government have failed to show any direction in the budget.  Since they took office they have failed to take any hard decisions.  The greatest indictment of the Government is that when the screws came on in Barrettstown last July the Government took the soft option and put back into the Exchequer £11½ million voted for youth employment.  The Government told us then that they did not know what to do with that money.  I put it to the Minister of State that the YEA have lost their way.  The are bankrupt in their approach to the problems they were established to solve.  The Government are bereft of any idea as to where they should go.  If they think that by trotting out more of the same tonight to our young people they will accept it, they are wrong.  Our young people know they are being conned and the sooner the Government realise that the better.  The Government should get down to reality and tell the facts.  They should then get down to the job they were elected to do. If they do not want to do that job or feel that because of the compromise situation in Government between the two parties they cannot do it, they should step aside <Col N="1982" /> and let the people decide once again who they want to run the country.</P>
    <P>The first approach to any problem is to analyse the depth of it and quantify it.  I do not believe that the true figure of young people unemployed is 69,000.  I do not think anybody else believed it.  The official figures state that 69,000 young people are unemployed but I reckon that approximately 11,500 young people who are living at home with their parents do not qualify to be on that list because of the regulations.  That depresses the real figure.  How many thousand young people are engaged in temporary employment, whether it is youth employment, employment incentive schemes, environmental works or training?  How many of them will get real jobs when they finish?  In addition to the 80,000 young people I reckon are unemployed I can add at least 20,000 young people who will be unemployed when they have finished the various training courses.</P>
    <P>How many young people have decided to stay an extra year at school because they do not see any hope of getting a job? Many thousand young people who pursued night courses cannot get jobs and are following full-time day courses in an effort to equip themselves for a job in the future.  Have we any statistics to tell us the true figure?  Are those unemployed categorised into different areas?  If we get those statistics we will be able to quantify the problem and prepare a plan to tackle it but those statistics do not exist.  From a bureaucratic and Government point of view it is useful not to produce them.  It is nicer to cloak everything in a &ldquo;mumble jumble&rdquo; of figures so that nobody can grasp what the real position is.  There is no point in trying to con young people or their parents who have been left without hope for the future.  Parents do not even know which way to direct their young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State would have us believe that the Government are worried about young people.  What did they do? First of all, the Minister for Education did away with career guidance in schools with fewer than 500 pupils.  If ever schools needed career guidance it is those with fewer than 500 pupils.  For this, she will <Col N="1983" /> save the princely sum of £440,000. Another Department handed back £11½ million to the Exchequer from the employment levy.  Could they not have told the Minister for Education: &ldquo;Here is £440,000 and keep the career guidance courses in schools&rdquo;?  These courses are needed now more than ever because of the scarcity of jobs and the different components in employment these days.  We all know that the £11½ million was handed back to the Exchequer so that the Government would not have to take hard decisions in Barrettstown in July when they met there and when they should have been taking the decisions to make some impact on current Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>They have tried time and again to get the public, and anyone here foolish enough to believe them, to think that they are reducing current expenditure when in fact it went up by something like 14 per cent last year.  The budget has put it up 10½ per cent this year.  They speak of the expenditure deficit reduction as a percentage of GNP.  We all know that GNP cannot be compiled this year: it will be the end of 1985 before some of it can be compiled, and before the job is completed it will be towards the end of 1985 or into 1986.  Yet the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach would like us to believe that they will reduce the current budget deficit by a percentage of GNP. If they give us facts they might get some response from ordinary people.</P>
    <P>The Government need a response, but until they can manage proper leadership and motivation they will not tell the people the truth.  People should not be misled with propaganda, but if the Government told the truth they might get the people to go along with them.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the four headings the Minister of State emphasised when talking about constraints on the Government in regard to solutions for our problems. I said at the beginning that we need to analyse the problems, to categorise the different sectors of the community and then to set about solutions.  I will deal with that later.  At the moment I will deal with the four constraints the Minister <Col N="1984" /> spoke about.  First, he spoke about recession.  When will we hear the end of the recession as a cause of our problems? Deputy Gene Fitzgerald referred to <i>The Democrat</i> and its assertion that the recession is over &mdash; it was up, up, up and away with the economy.  Yet the Minister of State comes in here to tell us that the recession is the major problem.  The recession will always be the major problem here until we elect a Government who know the way out of recession and who are prepared to put us on the right road out of recession.</P>
    <P>Last week I heard the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance saying there is light in the tunnel.  I asked them last week if they were sure the light is not of another train coming from the opposite direction. <i>The Democrat</i>, their paper, tells us it is up, up and away with the economy.  The Minister tells us our primary problem is the recession and that we can do nothing about it.  I will tell him later how he can do something about it.</P>
    <P>His second complaint was about the growth in the labour force.  Nobody can deny that there is a very big growth in the labour force, between 19,000 and 20,000. Then we come to the great long-playing record of the Government since they came to power, that is competitiveness. I am sick and tired of this being trotted out from over there.  I am sure the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State read the OECD reports.  A recent report spells out clearly and unequivocally what the position is, and they indict the Government completely for our lack of competitiveness. The Government have been talking about a drop in earnings.  During the past ten years we have had a real drop in earnings for the workers.  The drop has been 4 per cent or 5 per cent in real earnings.  The real reason, as spelled out by the OECD, for our lack of competitiveness is Government taxation, direct and indirect.  Do not try to con people into believing that it is the workers who have created the problem of uncompetitiveness. They have not.  It is Government taxation, direct and indirect, that has caused our lack of competitiveness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1985" /> Anybody who denies that is only codding himself.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke about the increase in exports.  Did he ask himself where this has come from?  It comes from three areas, agriculture, pharmaceuticals and computer electronics.  Are we to have a major surge forward in agricultural exports this year?  We do not know, and we will not know it until the Minister for Agriculture finishes in Brussels, but from the way he has begun and the way he is going now I am not so sure how he will finish up &mdash; well, I hope.</P>
    <P>Of all the sectors in industry, we come back to pharmaceuticals and electronics as the two areas that have helped our exports because they represent factories coming on stream.  The were established by the IDA in the last couple of years. Now we must ask, how many were established in 1983?  I have not heard any magical announcements from Deputy Bruton in the last 12 months.  He admitted to me in the House the other day that the financial pipeline to the IDA is dry because international investment is not there.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government should not rely on the huge lift in exports this year or last year from the two areas I have mentioned.  Future supplements to those will not be there.  The Government have told us investment is not there.  The target of the IDA is 1,000 manufacturing jobs per year: only 1,000, with the labour force increasing by 19,000 to 20,000, with job losses the whole time.  That is the target, yet the Government speak of the IDA as making a major contribution.</P>
    <P>The IDA have spent a lot of money, and did a good job for the country in the last 10 years, but any Government who would accept from them a target of 1,000 jobs a year at a time when 215,000 people are known to be unemployed, will have to look elsewhere.  We must look elsewhere, because the IDA cannot do the impossible.  We must look at our own resources, and here I will come to the Minister's fourth point, labour costs.  In Ireland labour costs <i>vis-à-vis</i> those of the EEC, including social contributions, etc., are 40 per cent less.  It is not labour costs that are our worry but productivity as a <Col N="1986" /> return for what workers are being paid. The Government, instead of complaining about labour costs, should be matching productivity with the money being paid out.</P>
    <P>We welcomed foreign industry in the past as we would in the future as a contributor to the solution of our unemployment problems, but in the end our problems can be solved only by ourselves from now on.  We may get contributions from outside but we must start to plan our own salvation.  But the Government have not got a job creation strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share some of my time with my colleague, Deputy Treacy.  It is significant that it is the Minister for Defence who is present to deal with this matter, but I am sure he will deal with it in the impartial and bipartisan way in which I hope the whole issue in the Philippines will be treated in the House.  I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In raising the question of delays which have already prolonged the trial of Fr. O'Brien and the agony of Fr. Gore and his co-defendants, I do so in an effort to express solidarity with the people not only of the Philippines but of the Third World, Latin America, Africa, Asia and the oppressed people of the world who are at the mercy of the multinationals and the transnationals.  As one of the 26 richest nations in the world we have an obligation to express our solidarity with Fr. Niall O'Brien, who symbolises everything that came from Vatican II and Pope John XXIII, the compassion and feeling for humanity that our missionary fathers, lay workers and voluntary organisations in the Third World have had over the years.  Fr. O'Brien is a son of Vatican II. He is an Irish priest who has done great credit to an awareness and education of the true nature of the oppression of the multinationals and the people who exploit the people of the Philippines, <Col N="1987" /> Central America, Latin America, the Caribbean and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I do not have to tell the House what the case is about.  In a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> it is stated:</P>
    <P>For the last ten years Father O'Brien has devoted himself to human rights issues in the province of Negros, land of sugar plantations, where pitiful wages are paid to the sugar-cane cutters, malnutrition is widespread, unions are suppressed and popular discontent is checked by brutal military forces renowned for their murder tactics.</P>
    <P>The Catholic Church of the Philippines has strongly backed these priests, who claim they are being persecuted for carrying out their Christian duty in building &ldquo;basic christian communities&rdquo;, encouraging people to stand up for their rights and for preaching a very practical Gospel concerned with issues of social justice.</P>
    <P>What is happening to these missionaries is happening to hundreds of thousands of victims of oppression around the world. Fr. O'Brien has caught the imagination &mdash; it is not the first time that a missionary priest of the calibre of Fr. O'Brien has caught the imagination &mdash; of the Irish people.  Death and destruction is an everyday thing for people like him. Oppression, murder and exploitation in the interest of the multinationals and transnationals are commonplace and an everyday occurrence.</P>
    <P>Along with all the Irish people I applaud Fr. O'Brien for the action he has taken.  I raised this question before by way of a motion on the Order Paper seeking solidarity with the oppressed and minority people in the Philippines to whom Fr. O'Brien and other Columban Fathers and missionaries have been ministering. Unfortunately it was not taken in the House for good and practical reasons at the time.  Consequently I am delighted to have this opportunity to express what I believe is the unanimous view of the House that a travesty of justice, just one out of the many thousands which are occurring around the world day <Col N="1988" /> and night, has been highlighted.  It has caught the imagination and compassion of all Members.  The country at last understands what is happening in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Philippines is ruled by an absolute dictator.  The masses are exploited in the interests of a small and select oligarchy. The Philippines has the dubious honour of containing the biggest army base in the world in Scuba Bay and is financed and supported by the United States.  There is child prostitution there on a scale never before seen in a Third World country. There is virtually slavery there and daily murder is rampant by the so-called security forces.  President Marcos has already got dictatorial powers and with the stroke of a pen and on the urging of his paymasters in Washington he could address himself to the problems, remove the injustices and exploitations and ensure the evil forces which prevail there are brought to justice.</P>
    <P>The Philippines are a major recipient of western aid and it is within our power to influence President Marcos to bring about an end to the fraudulent trial of Fr. O'Brien, Fr. Gore and the other co-defendants. I am heartened to learn that Seán MacBride and Senior Counsel Dermot Kinlen are to attend the trial for the International Commission of Jurists and also that the most admirable of Third World organisations, Action From Ireland, which operates from the heart of the city in community care and concern for the Third World, are being asked to attend at no small expense to their personal welfare and health and to the voluntary groups sponsoring them.  Frankly I do not think the House can be satisfied with the response from the Government. In Australia the Foreign Minister has offered to go to the Philippines and deal with the situation there.  All the indications are that the Australians are taking the matter far more seriously than we are.  The idea of us sending a First Secretary from the Embassy in Canberra is, to say the least, ludicrous in view of the seriousness and delicacy of the situation. What should happen is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should go either to the Philippines to meet his counterpart <Col N="1989" /> there and make urgent representations to him or alternatively he should go to Washington and make the necessary representations there.</P>
    <P>The reaction I have had from people I have spoken to is one of concern and admiration for what Fr. O'Brien and the Columban Fathers have done.  I suggest to the Minister that the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister of State should attend in the Philippines to do the duty that would be expected of them in the circumstances.  I am glad that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries passed a unanimous vote of solidarity with Fr. O'Brien and the victims of the brutality, murder and violence that is occurring in the Third World.</P>
    <P>The purpose in raising this is not to cause division or acrimony but rather to express the views of the Members of the House and the Irish people, views which would express solidarity with Fr. O'Brien, what he symbolises and represents. Our reaction, I regret to say, is not the type of reaction we would expect in view of our tradition of supporting our missionary people at home and abroad. I suggest, belatedly as the Government came to take the issue seriously &mdash; perhaps for very good reasons they did not wish to cause any unnecessary trouble &mdash; at least they are half way there.  I urge the Minister to request either the Minister for Foreign Affairs or his Minister of State to visit the Philippines to attend the trial.  The trial has been postponed and will continue to be postponed until the international press begin to lose interest in it.  Last week I attended a Council of Europe meeting at Strasbourg.  There was much discussion and a great deal of interest expressed about this very important issue at the committees of political affairs.  The issue is not confined merely to Washington, to the Philippines and to Ireland.  It has caught the imagination of the developed world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity of speaking on this very important international issue and I wish <Col N="1990" /> to thank Deputy Andrews also for allowing me to use some of his time.</P>
      <P>I wish to place on the record of the House the history of the situation in the Philippines in so far as this current issue is concerned.  Father O'Brien was ordained a Columban priest in 1963 and went to serve in the Philippines in 1964. He has followed in the footsteps of all those illustrious Christian missionaries of all denominations and from both parts of this island.  He has made a major contribution in this field.  He has worked with an island people in Negros, a people who have been exploited and oppressed by a corrupt system.  The state, the military, the judicial and the financial systems are totally corrupt in that part of the world. Along with his colleagues, Father Brian Gore and Father Vicente Dingan who is a Philippino priest as well as a host of other Church workers, Father O'Brien has been the champion of these people.</P>
      <P>On 22 February 1982 Father O'Brien left Negros island to attend a Christian conference in Manila.  The conference was convened by the Superior General and the regional director of the Columban fathers, Father Nicholas Murray, who is a personal friend of mine.  Father O'Brien spent a month at a special course which was convened in Manila after the conference and he was then admitted to hospital there for medical treatment.  He returned to the island of Negros on 22 April.  Therefore, he was away from the island for two months.  During that time and prior to then, the mayor of the local town who was a friend of Father O'Brien and also of Father Gore and who, by standards in the Philippines was a good man but who, in terms of ordinary international humane standards would be a bad man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A situation known as salvaging had developed in the Philippines whereby people were taken out of their homes at night and not heard of again.  This had happened on two occasions.  In one instance two people were taken away and in the other the number taken away was seven.  There is a special organisation which comprises the Church, the military and the people and of which the Bishop, with the Commander-General of the military <Col N="1991" /> forces is the co-chairman.  The organisation is a voluntary one.  After the seven people had been taken away a public meeting was convened and it was the unanimous decision of that meeting that whoever was responsible for these people's lives would be brought to justice. The Bishop and the Commander-General of the forces, as a symbol of solidarity and of their total unanimity about bringing those responsible to justice, shook hands before the crowd.  A special investigation was then carried out and following on that the mayor of the town was under suspicion, was summoned and brought before the courts. Obviously cases in the Philippines are conducted over a long time.  This man was to be convicted but one night after a court hearing, that was 12 March 1982, this man with his driver and security men were ambushed by guerrillas and killed. An illegal organisation known as the New People's Army claimed responsibility for the killings.  At that time Father O'Brien was attending a conference in Manila and did not return to the island until 22 April. Obviously, therefore, he could not have had hand, act or part in that situation.</P>
    <P>Father O'Brien and his colleagues have been educating the people there as to their rights and how their situation might be improved.  The priests have helped them to improve their lot by developing and cultivating the land for themselves instead of continuing to work for a very meagre subsistence for the millionaire sugar cane farmers.  These millionaire people, by the use of the corrupt system and of the entire military and state system brought about a situation whereby the priests were to be charged with the murder of the mayor and his colleagues. There was a bail hearing which continued for 35 days and which was attended on two days only by the Consul-General for Ireland in the Philippines who is a Philippino and also a millionaire restaurant owner.  His connection with this country is that he is married to a very nice woman from County Kerry.  It is because of that that he holds the honorary title of Consul-General for Ireland in the Philippines. He is one of the two people <Col N="1992" /> representing this country at the trial. During the bail trial the judge was taken ill and took 30 day's leave of absence but came back unexpectedly during that time and reached an unorthodox and unrealistic decision whereby he offered bail to the Philippino priest and to the six Philippino Church workers but would not offer bail either to Father O'Brien or to Father Gore.  The Philippino priest and the workers could not accept this standard of justice and turned down the bail.  Consequently, the three priests and the six workers remained in jail.  This case has been going on since 1982 and Father O'Brien and the other people have been in jail since.</P>
    <P>In the past six months various efforts have been made by the Columban Fathers, by the Irish community in the Philippines and by many other people to pressure our Government into ensuring that a fair trial would be available to Father O'Brien by way of our Government being represented properly in Manila.  The situation is that we are sending in the First Secretary of the Irish Embassy in Canberra and also the Philippino restaurant owner to whom I have referred to observe the trial, but in a system so corrupt as that which prevails under President Marcos this type of representation is completely inadequate.  That is why I am appealing to the Minister this evening to have either our Minister for Foreign Affairs or our Attorney General or Chief State Solicitor attend the trial to ensure that at least there are present people who understand the legal system and that the Government are in a position to have a full report of the trial.  We must ensure that a priest who is one of the finest Irishmen of our time is given a fair trial and that justice will prevail for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The court this morning was adjourned because the millionaire sugar cane farmers thronged the court, some issuing death threats to the priests.  This has been objected to by the solicitor for the prosecution but has not been accepted in the court.  That is the type of justice that prevails there.</P>
    <P>I was accused here last week of playing politics with the situation but I have personal <Col N="1993" /> family connections with the Columban Fathers and I have personal friends in the Philippines so I know the situation firsthand.  I am not playing politics with this very serious matter but I am appealing to the Government to take immediate action and to do as I have outlined.  The Australian Government are sending their Foreign Minister to the trial and they have suspended an offer of a £100-million loan to the Philippines until this case has been dealt with.  The Australian Government and all the state agencies are united in endeavouring to ensure that justice will be done in the case of Father Gore.  I am appealing to the Minister for Defence, on behalf of all the Irish people, to ensure that our Government are represented by their more senior people at the trial so as to ensure a fair trial for this great Irishman and his colleagues whether their trial takes place next week or in the next 30 to 40 weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government share the concern of Deputies opposite which led them to seek an Adjournment debate on this important and tragic issue.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the facts and I do not propose to follow Deputy Treacy in his narrative except to say that the accuracy of his narrative is not entirely 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>I wish to use this opportunity principally to assure the House that the Government have been concerned for some time about this matter and are keeping it under close and continual review.  The Government have taken various steps from time to time, steps which they consider appropriate having regard to all the ramifications of this issue and they are satisfied that the steps they have taken are the appropriate ones.  I would respectfully suggest to Deputies opposite that in a matter such as this the Government, with their resources of advice from people experienced in the diplomatic world both here and abroad, are in a better position to make a value judgment on the appropriate action to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that the representation which we have arranged <Col N="1994" /> to attend the trial in an observer capacity is appropriate and proper.  For the information of the House, I wish to state that in addition to the observers from the Government there will be observers from many other interested parties: the International Commission of Jurists, the Law Asia Society, the Philippine Bar Association, the Australian Government, the Australian hierarchy, not to speak of the Irish and Australian media.  Deputies can be satisfied there will be a strong, independent presence at the trial.</P>
    <P>It is our judgment that it would be inappropriate for our official representation to be other than at the level arranged and that is our view at this moment.  To correct something that has been said from the other side, I wish to state that the Australian Foreign Minister, with whom my colleague has been in contact, said publicly last weekend that it would not be appropriate for him to go to the area while the trial was in progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just saying what he said last weekend, that it would not be appropriate for him to go to the area while the trial was in progress.  The level of representation we have arranged is what we consider to be the appropriate level.  I have to say to the other side that not all the suggestions made about what should be done are necessarily helpful. They are not designed to be unhelpful but they are perhaps unwittingly, unhelpful. The proposal by Deputy Andrews that a third country should be asked to intervene might not be at all helpful at this time because such an action, implicitly and explicitly, could be seen as an attempt by this country to impinge, through the involvement of a third country, the judicial and legal processes of the Philippines and this might prove detrimental to the interests of Father O'Brien. Let us remember that in this matter what <Col N="1995" /> we are concerned to do is to serve the interests of Father O'Brien in the best way we can.  We are not in the business of scoring political points.</P>

      <P>In a radio interview this afternoon, when the question of a third country intervention was raised with him, Father O'Brien said &ldquo;It is a very powerful lever but it could work the other way.  I will explain that.  It could work the other way because obviously you cannot touch the pride of a country.  People have their legitimate national pride so there must never be the appearance of pressurising in such a way so as to interfere with the internal workings of another country.&rdquo; Father O'Brien's feelings on the scene are that it would be inappropriate and possibly unhelpful to call in aid, if that were possible diplomatically, the intervention of a third country.  I have to reject Deputy Andrews' suggestion in that regard.  I cannot comment on the case as it is in progress and for that reason I cannot follow or correct in detail Deputy Treacy's narrative.</P>

      <P>It is disappointing the trial has been postponed because of over-crowding.  We are anxious to see the drama brought to a speedy and happy end.  We understand that the judge and the defence and prosecution lawyers have agreed to petition the Supreme Court to have the trial transferred to the provincial capital.  There is optimism that the trial can recommence next week and then proceed <Col N="1996" /> at a pace faster than is normal for trials in the Philippine system.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House what my colleague said here last week, that the Columban Fathers, who are in a position to know what is being done by way of assistance and to understand its efficacy, have indicated publicly and privately to him and to his Department their appreciation of what has and is being done.  Their regional superior, to whom Deputy Treacy referred, and the superior general have expressed their gratitude at what the Government are doing.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the House that the Government share the deep concern expressed here by the Deputies opposite, a deep concern that is felt nationally. Because we share that concern we will continue to do everything that in our judgment is the most appropriate to do in ease of Father O'Brien's situation.  I have to ask the Deputies opposite to appreciate that in a delicate matter such as this, in an issue taking place many thousands of miles away, in a jurisdiction the procedures of which would be strange to us and with overtones that are diplomatically delicate, they will have to accept that the monitoring of this situation is something that can be done best by the Government using their sources of information and expertise.  I can assure the Deputies, the House and the country that the Government, using all these sources and all their resources, will continue to do everything they consider to be in the best interests of Father O' Brien.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising the matter and giving me an opportunity to reiterate the Government's position and concern.  I have to apologise for my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is abroad on official business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the accidental discharges of radioactive effluent from the Sellafield plant in November of last year, the Nuclear Energy Board immediately <Col N="1833" /> expressed Ireland's concern to the relevant UK authorities.  They also carried out two radiological surveys of beaches on our eastern coastline.  The results of the surveys show no traces to date of the contaminants reported on the beach near Sellafield.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Environment, I expressed our concern at the discharge levels to the UK Prime Minister during the Anglo-Irish Summit talks.  The Department of Energy have also been in contact with the UK authorities in the matter and meetings at ministerial level are proposed for the near future.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board have an ongoing programme of monitoring designed to provide information on the distribution of radioactivity in the Irish Sea.  Samples of fish are analysed by the board and also independently by our universities.  The Department of Fisheries assist in the provision of fish samples. The results continue to show that the radiation exposure of a member of the public arising from the fish consumption pathway is less that one part in a hundred of the safety limits recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection and the EEC.  Consequently risks, if any, arising from fish consumption in Ireland, are negligible and can be discounted.</P>

The council have informed my Department that their engineering staff are examining the position to determine the extent of the problem and prepare a detailed estimate of the cost of repair.

      <P>There are seven such proposals with my Department for locations at Arklow, County Wicklow; Ballina, County Mayo; Ballybofey, County Donegal; Carlow; Carrickmacross, County Monaghan; Donaghmede, County Dublin; and Roscrea, County Tipperary.  None of these proposals is at the stage where an allocation of finance can be made.  The miscellaneous environmental services provision of £11,662,000 <Col N="1839" /> for my Department includes a provisional allocation of £500,000 for the construction of swimming pools.  Maintenance costs of swimming pools have traditionally been met from local sources but loan charges payable by local authorities on swimming pools qualify for State subsidy of 50 per cent.  It is estimated that the subsidy payable by my Department in 1984 will amount to £360,500.  I cannot say at this stage what projects may commence in 1984.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of monopoly at this stage.  The project group (set up under the review body for computerisation in Government services) were satisfied that McAuto's integrated system represents the correct choice at present.  If alternative systems become available in the future, there is absolutely nothing to prevent their evaluation and selection.</P>
      <P>The project group went to considerable lengths to establish the stability and reliability of any supplier or product chosen.</P>
      <P>I must explain that what was being sought for Irish hospitals was an integrated system, one which would administer the different areas of a hospital, viz patient recording, pharmacy, X-ray, laboratory, catering etc.  It must be made quite clear that the product in question is simply not &ldquo;made&rdquo; in Ireland.  There is no question of being able to buy it from an Irish company (other than as agents).</P>
      <P>While the PDP-11 range first appeared in 1970, the PDP-11/44, for the hospital area, is a more advanced development in the series and was first produced in 1979. It is, therefore, a machine which has been on the market for the past four years, which hardly suggests obsolescence.</P>
      <P>During 1982 a total of 1,529 PDP-11/44's were sold by DEC on the European market alone and world wide sales of PDP-11/44's in 1982 was of the order of 5,000 configurations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Digital is committed to the parallel development and sale of the PDP-11 and <Col N="1851" /> VAX ranges.  In fact the PDP-11/44 was announced as a new product at the same time as the VAX 750.</P>
    <P>Over 300,000 PDP-11 computers have been installed which will ensure its support for many years to come.  Digital guarantee seven years' maintenance support on all products from the date of the last customer shipment.  Digital point out, however, that the PDP-8 which preceded the PDP-11 series and was first produced in 1965 is still in widespread use and still enjoys full on-call maintenance support after almost 20 years.</P>
    <P>The integrated system chosen provides administration for the laboratory area and, as appropriate, will interface with any specific items of equipment such as auto-analysers.  There is, therefore, no need at this stage to seek tenders for laboratory computerisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of unemployment benefit payable after the first six months of entitlement depends on whether the claimant has 280 contributions paid over the seven preceding contribution years. If this additional condition is not satisfied, a reduced rate of unemployment benefit, equivalent to the basic urban rate of unemployment assistance, is payable for the remaining maximum period of nine months entitlement.  The payment is not subject to a means test as would unemployment assistance and pay-related benefit is payable in addition.  At the end of 15 months payment of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance is payable, subject to a means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The urban fuel schemes operate in certain areas and are administered by the local authorities in those areas.  Entitlement to a fuel allowance under these schemes is automatic for certain categories of social welfare recipients, one of which is unemployment assistance recipients with dependants.  Receipients of <Col N="1869" /> unemployment benefit at the reduced rate are not covered by those schemes.</P>
    <P>As previously indicated in reply to parliamentary questions, proposals are being prepared for rationalising the existing fuel schemes and introducing a single unified scheme for the country as a whole with uniform standards of entitlement.  It is hoped to have this scheme ready for the next heating season.</P>

He failed to satisfy the qualifying contribution condition for benefit which required the claimant to have at least 26 contributions in the governing contribution year 1981-82, in respect of the period before 2 January 1984.

A notification was received in the Department on 5 January 1984 that she had lost her invalidity pension book.  A replacement book was issued to her payable from 19 January 1984 and inquiries were made regarding the lost orders.  Arrears were due in respect of the period from 29 December 1983 to 18 January and a payable order for £119.25 covering the amount due was issued to the person concerned on 3 February 1984.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare when an invalidity pension will be awarded to a person (details <Col N="1876" /> supplied) in County Cork, as she has been on disability benefit for the past 15 years.</P>

      <P>The regulations provide that the claimant, apart from satisfying the contribution conditions, must be regarded as permanently incapable of work, in order to qualify for invalidity pension.  The person concerned was examined on 17 September 1983 by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was not permanently incapable of work and asked to have her referred again for a further examination in six months time.  Her entitlement to invalidity pension will be reviewed in the light of this further examination.  In the meantime she continues to receive disability benefit at the maximum rate of £34.80 appropriate to a single woman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the problem of people working short time for whom PRSI deductions at the maximum rate are not being paid, when they apply for unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>A person who works systematic short time, by arrangement with his employer, would pay PRSI contributions at the Class A rate and would be covered for all social insurance benefits, including unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>Similarly employees who have part-time jobs, as distinct from persons on systematic short-time, would pay Class A contributions: (a) if they work for 18 or more hours a week or (b) if they work for less than 18 hours a week but are mainly dependent for their livelihood on the earnings received from the employment. Such persons would likewise be covered for all social insurance benefits, including unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, an employee who has a part-time job which is for less than 18 hours a week and who is not mainly dependent on the earnings received from the employment for his livelihood is, under the regulations, insurable at the Class J contribution rate which provides <Col N="1877" /> cover for occupational injuries benefits only.</P>
    <P>A person who is not qualified for unemployment benefit may, depending on his means, qualify for unemployment assistance.  Such a person should therefore apply for a qualification certificate at his local employment exchange or employment office.</P>

      <P>According to the Department's records the person concerned did not satisfy the contribution conditions during the contribution year 6 April 1981 to 5 April 1982 which governed her entitlement to payment of unemployment benefit from 23 September 1983.  A new benefit year commenced on 2 January 1984 and as she satisfied the contribution conditions during the contribution period 6 April 1982 to 5 April 1983 her claim was allowed at the weekly rate of £30.60 being the maximum rate appropriate to her case.  All arrears due have been paid and further payments of £30.60 will continue as they become due.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned does not satisfy the contribution conditions for entitlement to unemployment benefit on the basis of her Irish contribution record. She was last employed in the United Kingdom and claimed unemployment benefit there from 14 October 1983.  The claim was, however, disallowed by the United Kingdom authorities on the grounds that she left her employment voluntarily without just cause.  She returned to Ireland and claimed unemployment benefit on 1 November 1983 <Col N="1878" /> under the EEC provisions but because she had no entitlement to benefit at the time of her departure from the United Kingdom she does not qualify for a transfer of that benefit here.</P>
      <P>Under the EEC Regulations the person concerned cannot apply for a transfer of her United Kingdom contributions for the purpose of qualifying her for unemployment benefit in this country until she has first taken up insurable employment here for which the appropriate contributions have been paid.  The person concerned was notified of the position on 9 January 1984.</P>

    <P>&mdash;information concerning the total work-force capacity of companies involved and the number of companies who participate on a regular basis is not available.  Guidelines for the operation of the scheme have been revised and include provisions to prevent continuous participation and any displacement of permanent employees.</P>
    <P>The work experience programme was designed to assist first-time job seekers to gain first hand and practical experience of the world of work by placing them in employers premises for a maximum of twenty-six weeks.  It was envisaged that the experience gained would enhance their opportunities of securing suitable employment.  Indications are that the programme has proved successful, with approximately 60 per cent of participants securing permanent employment following their participation &mdash; about half with the firms which initially provided the work experience.  I am satisfied that the programme is being operated satisfactorily to the advantage of the young persons who participate.</P>

      <P>The employee concerned has claimed a redundancy lump sum from the Redundancy Fund.  However, under the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts the obligation to pay a redundancy lump sum to a redundant worker rests primarily with the employer by whom the worker was employed.  It is only when the employer fails or refuses to pay that the question of payment from the fund arises. The person mentioned in the Deputy's question should, if he has not already done so, apply to his former employer on form RP77 for payment of his lump sum. <Col N="1894" /> If the employer refuses to certify the employee's redundancy by giving him a redundancy certificate, the employee may then appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal to establish his entitlement. If the employer certifies the redundancy or if the employee's entitlement is decided by the tribunal, and the employer still refuses or fails to pay, the employee should then apply to my Department for payment of his lump sum from the redundancy fund.</P>
      <P>I am writing to the Deputy immediately to explain the procedure for claiming a redundancy lump sum in this particular case and supplying the necessary forms.</P>
