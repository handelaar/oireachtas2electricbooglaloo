      <P>Lest the Chair be misunderstood, I ruled this out yesterday but I have received notice this morning under Standing Order No. 38 that the Taoiseach proposes to make a statement today under that Standing Order.  That puts the matter in order, and it is now only a question of fixing the time of the statement.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste whether they consider they misled the Dáil last week when they stated they would bring legislation for local radio before the Dáil prior to the summer recess?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to legislation. The reason I am raising the matter this morning is that the Labour Party &mdash; a case of the tail wagging the dog &mdash; stated yesterday that they have their own proposals for local radio.  This is in total conflict with the Government's proposals. It is a shot across the bows for the Minister for Communications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach misled the Dáil, surely this is an opportunity for him to put the record in order by stating whether the Bill will be before the Dáil prior to the summer recess or whether he will consult with his Labour colleagues before bringing forward a Bill to suit that minority party in Government.</P>

I asked the Taoiseach if he would ask President Reagan to include Ulster. It is unusual that all of the three provinces are included but Ulster is not.  They are paying lip service to Ulster while they are in the States and they are not prepared to visit Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan or the Six Counties when they are here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved the adjournment of the debate yesterday I was referring to remarks made by Deputy Séamus Brennan that people were forced into the black economy due to the high taxation prevailing.  I said that in my view that was not the reason that a black economy prevailed.  It was generally confined to people who were in a small way of business and who entered the black economy whether or not taxation was high.  That in itself was not a cause of the huge black economy which exists in the country at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> There were some genuine efforts made by speakers on both sides of the House in this regard, and Deputy Brennan tried to put forward positive suggestions which could be considered by the Minister in trying to improve the business climate. One of the examples he gave was that where companies had very few employees and made excessive profits maybe we should consider taxing those companies or giving an advantage to companies who had a larger number of employees.  That is just an example of the genuine efforts being made and the recognition in the House of the difficulties that exist in the economy, how business needs to be supported and the climate changed in order to provide more jobs.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to add a further 93 pages of legislation to the thousands of pages of tax legislation already in existence. The administration of these thousands of pages of legislation involves large numbers of civil servants, accountants, solicitors, estate agents and others in an enormous amount of pointless, detailed work in order to comply with rules dreamt up by people who very often had no experience of commercial life. That is not a criticism of the people who drafted them, but it is a fact that they may not have experience of commercial life.  While accepting that a tax system must be complicated, it is admitted that the gobbledegook included in the Finance Bill is difficult to understand and in many cases capable of different understandings which may end up in court if the amount involved is significant and gives rise to an awful lot of unnecessary work.</P>
    <P>A perfect example of this can be found in page 45 of the Bill at subsection (b) (ii) which states:</P>
    <P>notwithstanding subsection (2) of the said section 318 (but without prejudice to paragraph (a) and to the order in which income is to be treated as reduced under subsection (2) (a) of the said section 307), the claimant may specify the extent to which any reduction of income treated as occurring by virtue of the said section 307 is to be referred to so much of the loss as is <Col N="1351" /> attributable to the loss, if any, actually sustained in the trade of leasing, the specified capital allowances or any other capital allowances, and, where the claimant so specifies, section 320 of the said Act shall apply in accordance with the claimant's specification and not in accordance with the said subsection (2) of the said section 318.</P>
    <P>The meaning of this sentence is impossible to understand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is dealing with the Bill and, to that extent, he is in order, but he is now dealing with a matter which would be much more appropriate on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to dwell on it.  I just referred to it as an example and I intend to move on.</P>
      <P>As suggested by the Commission on Taxation and following the lead given in the UK budget, I suggest that the Minister should simplify the system by reducing the tax rate and cutting out all the reliefs which the Government grant, which parliamentary draftsmen frame and which those involved in business try to understand.  I know that may not be possible immediately, but in the last 15 months the Minister's actions may have set the scene so that he could attempt it in the future.  I hope he will be able to do that and to at least make a start next year to reduce the allowances and widen the bands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to specific references in the Bill, I should like to deal first with the business expansion scheme.  I agree with the proposal that it should be attractive for people to invest money and get a tax write off to encourage them to do so. However, the relief as drafted is only available where the company invests in and carries on a manufacturing activity and where employment grants are given by the IDA.  This has been referred to by other speakers, and I should also like to bring it to the Minister's attention as it gives rise to differences of opinion between the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners, because what constitutes manufacturing is not defined and <Col N="1352" /> is probably incapable of definition as its meaning changes continually over the years.  If one goes back to the Control of Manufactures Act &mdash; which I think was introduced in 1932 &mdash; when Eamon de Valera tried to set up a self-sufficient state, the matter was dealt with in broad terms; but it is capable of much wider application because of the high technology involved in today's industry.  I should like to give some examples of those changes.  In 1960 the metals and engineering sector, which includes the electronic industry, employed 21,000 people. In 1974 it employed 49,000 people and it now employs over 60,000 people.  Similarly, the chemical industry now employs 12,000 people compared with 5,000 in 1960.  The technology-based industries have exhibited strong growth while most other sectors of industry are stable or have declined.  In the last five years technology-based industries have expanded by 15 per cent per annum while the manufacturing industry only grew by 2 per cent.  The pace of the growth of these industries is forcing structural change, and it is important that our policies should be geared to accommodate and accelerate this growth and not to inhibit it.  That is why I seek a different emphasis so that it should not be confined solely to what we consider our traditional manufacturing industries.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the Confederation of Irish Industry's comments on developing the new technology growth centres.  They have expanded at a rate of 15 per cent over the last five years.  They now account for one-third of the total output of the manufacturing sector. The achievement of such rapid growth during an international recession clearly demonstrates that these industries, comprising electronics, electrical engineering, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, have the potential to expand at an even faster rate over the next five years. The output, for example, of office and data processing equipment was 70 per cent higher than in the same period last year.  Unlike most European countries Ireland is a strong net exporter of new technology products.  These new technology industries have also become major <Col N="1353" /> contributors to employment and now account for over 40,000 manufacturing jobs, and employment has continued to grow during the recession.  There are about 3,000 people employed in internationally traded services such as computer softwear, engineering, architectural and management consultancy.  The majority are in computer softwear, and employment in this sector is expanding by about 30 per cent per annum.  The European market for computer software is now £4,000 million.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the business expansion scheme extended to include those, and it is worthwhile referring to a table which was printed in the CII <i>Newsletter</i>, volume 39, No. 22, on 4 October 1983. The average annual increases from 1973 to 1983 are listed as follows &mdash; office and data processing &mdash; 39 per cent; chemicals &mdash; 10 per cent; instrument engineering &mdash; 7 per cent; electrical engineering &mdash; 4 per cent, whereas all manufacturing was 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>In employment, the average annual increases from 1978 to 1983 in office and data processing were 24 per cent; instrument engineering, 9 per cent; electrical engineering, 3 per cent; chemicals were 2 per cent and all manufacturing was - 2 per cent.  As a percentage of total exports from 1978 to 1983 chemicals increased from 12 per cent to 14 per cent, office and data processing from 4 per cent to 13 per cent, electrical engineering from 3 per cent to 4 per cent, professional and scientific from 1 per cent to 3 per cent. The new technology sector increased from 20 to 34 per cent.  We must take account of those changes and encompass them in our economic planning for the future.</P>
    <P>It is absurd that a person engaged in an enterprise giving employment should have to get into a hassle with the Revenue Commissioners as to whether he is engaged in manufacturing.  I suggest to the Minister that any investment in a company that means an increase in employment should qualify for relief.  For example, why should not the relief be available to building firms?  It is constantly <Col N="1354" /> said that the building industry is the backbone of the economy.  That is a bald statement and one has to analyse it but perhaps we should agree to give the relief to the building industry and expand it on a much wider basis.</P>
    <P>The Government have done good work in the past 15 months.  The climate is now right for us to try to improve the job creation programme and increase employment.  That should be the aim of all of us for the duration of this Dáil. Most investors would be reluctant to put £25,000 into one company.  However, funds will be established by the banks and others so that people can invest in them and this money can be further invested in companies.  This will enable the individual investor to spread his risk. The begrudging attitude of the parliamentary draftsman is shown in the fact that the maximum expenses payable to people to launch the fund is 1 per cent of the amount subscribed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to take it back.  I am not talking about a particular person but it appears from the outside that there is a begrudging attitude.  I shall leave out the words &ldquo;parliamentary draftsman&rdquo; and will say that this Bill seems to show a begrudging attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I meant.  The <Col N="1355" /> various Finance Bills comprise thousands of pages and this year a further 96 pages are added.  I heard other people in the House refer to the niggardly and begrudging attitude.  There is a constant witchhunt of people who are trying to run a business and make a living.  There seems to be an anti-business, anti-profit and anti-investment attitude in the legislation. These measures are compiled by people.  I do not know who they are: they are probably working in the Civil Service and in the Minister's office.  There seems to be an almost Churchillian fight going on in that their attitude seems to be that they will fight people with income tax, corporation profits tax, property tax, capital acquisitions tax and advance corporation tax.  It is the politics of the lowest common denominator.  Every time a person makes a success of his business and makes a profit there is a begrudging attitude shown towards him.  A change is needed here.</P>
      <P>The day before yesterday there was a request by the Minister for Labour, the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister for Finance to companies to put profits or available cash into job creation. However, if they want people to do that they must create the right climate and environment.  People are so crucified by taxes it is difficult for them to even consider investing.  In any event, I think advance corporation tax should be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Labour spoke about the 30,000 redundancies in 1983.  At the same time there was talk of an incentive which it was considered would be of interest to workers in co-operatives who might wish to invest £25,000.  There is a negative and unrealistic approach here, that industries will close and, as a result, the workers will invest their redundancy money.  Workers do not invest their redundancy money in businesses.  It is unrealistic to think that people will invest this money, especially in a sector that nobody wishes to invest in, namely, a capital-intensive industry.  If a person is willing to take a risk and invest his money in order to create employment he should <Col N="1356" /> get tax benefit.  The prevailing attitude shows clearly that there is no understanding of how private enterprise works.</P>
    <P>Another example of this niggardly attitude relates to the provisions of section 23 which ended on 31 March and which related to the apartment building sector.  I checked on this matter with the Department of Finance and they put me on to the Revenue Commissioners.  I asked them what criteria they would use to decide what qualifies for relief under section 23.  They said solemnly: &ldquo;Oh, construction is the operative word and we will stick strictly to construction&rdquo;. They said that whatever portion of the building or apartment was erected at that time would qualify for section 23 prior to 31 March and whatever was not built would not qualify.  I asked if they were going to measure it and they replied: &ldquo;Yes, it will be brick upon brick&rdquo;.  Can one imagine the inspectorate or officials from the Department trying to examine a half built apartment building or trying to find out whether there were two bedrooms, half a bedroom or a room without a ceiling to make up this calculation as to whether a person was entitled to this or not?  What is that but niggardliness, instead of being generous about the whole matter and saying: &ldquo;if a building was being constructed before 31 March that qualifies&rdquo; and stop this nonsense? They will probably have 100 people running around for the next six months fighting with developers as to whether or not something qualifies.</P>
    <P>In relation to the £25,000 that one is unlikely to put into one single company I should like to say that the begrudging attitude is shown in that the maximum expenses payable to people to launch the fund is 1 per cent of the amount subscribed and the maximum fees they can get out of it is 5 per cent in dividends. Obviously, the people who drafted this are unaware of the fact that most places where money is invested are not in a position to pay dividends for some years. This makes it very unattractive for banks, and others, to set up such funds.  Again, it reflects &mdash; I do not like using these words &mdash; the Civil Service mind.  Accordingly, <Col N="1357" /> I should like to ask the Minister to throw open the relief to any person who can increase employment.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the position of section 84.  Section 40 deals with the changes proposed for section 84 and it runs to four pages.  It sets out to withdraw section 84 relief and ends up by granting so many exemptions that section 84 financing continues in effect unchanged. I should like to know if the Minister is in a position to state the amount of revenue that will be gained by those four pages of what we would call at college waffle.  The Minister should be aware that section 84 financing is really only attractive to exporting companies because the introduction of advance corporation tax made it unattractive.  It is submitted that the changes introduced by section 40 are absolutely irrelevant.  I am aware that it is different from the original budget proposals, and that shows to my mind that the section was ill-thought out.</P>
    <P>Similar comments apply to preference share financing which is the precusor of section 84.  One either recognises these as incentives to people to borrow money for investment purposes or one does not. In effect it is the State subsidising people to borrow money at low rates.  Business people, however, would not see it that way.  They see the State as a grabber, taking money from them, and they feel they are entitled to use the legislation to obtain cheap money.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the leasing provisions in the Bill.  Broadly these provisions are introduced because many tax-paying companies, for example chain stores, who would have a massive cash-flow but very few allowances because there are no write-offs for buildings and shopping centres, were in a position to avoid paying tax by entering into leasing transactions.  In practice chain stores would buy the equipment and lease it on to the lessee.  The chain stores would get the allowances and write them off against the profits from the supermarket, if it was a supermarket.  The provisions in the Bill provide that the write-off on the leased equipment is only available against profits generated by that equipment.  From now on the write-off will be available <Col N="1358" /> only in the case of equipment grant-aided by the IDA.  It is difficult to argue with that provision.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to argue with the provisions in the area of bond washing.  I should like to point out to the Minister that people who are crucified from paying tax will try to avail of loopholes to reduce their liability.  That is how bond washing grew up.  It should be open to people who make investments to be taxed only on any real income generated from those investments.  For instance, if the income generated from a £100 investment is £10 the amount taxable in my view should be £10 reduced by inflation.</P>
    <P>Another section in the Bill to which I should like to refer is the restriction on the sale of a principal private residence. This is another example of begrudger legislation.  To anyone who sells a residence and gets an additional amount for it because it is nearer development I would say good luck.  In the Bill the Minister wants to tax that person on the additional amount he gets.  One can see how complicated that provision is if one looks at the memorandum produced by Stokes, Kennedy, Crowley and Company on the Finance Bill, dated March 1984 (No. 26).  An example of the computation necessary to arrive at the figure is given in that memorandum.  A person has to go through a complicated procedure to arrive at his or her liability.  It would not be appropriate for me to give an example in the House because it would be difficult to grasp it.  In the main it involves in the case of a person making a disposal valueing his or her house at April 1974 on a residential basis and on a development basis.  Further valuations have to be obtained on the house at the time of sale between its residential value and its market value.  There follows then a complicated formula to work out the tax on the development aspect of the property.  I cannot see any real sense in that type of approach.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the capital acquisition tax aspects of the Bill. Broadly the capital acquisition tax is levied on gifts and inheritances made by Irish domiciled persons and which consist of Irish assets, and the Finance Bill proposes <Col N="1359" /> to change the method of calculation of the tax in a manner which will result in a significantly higher tax charge in many cases and extend the tax of certain types of discretionary trust which do not suffer the tax at present.  The amount of tax payable up to now depended on the relationship between the donor and donee. There were different tax free thresholds and different rates of tax applicable to four classes of relationship.  The Minister has reduced that number to three.  The revised proposals in the Finance Bill in relation to gifts and inheritances taken on or after 26 March 1984 provide for the reduction to three in the number of classes of relationship for tax-free threshold purposes.  They also provide for the abolition of the distinction between classes for the purpose of ascertaining the rate of tax payable so as to provide a new single rate structure in lieu of the present varying rates; that the revised classes of relationship are a spouse, a child, a minor child or a deceased child; brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, grandparents and more remote ancestors.  There is another class, &ldquo;all others&rdquo;.  The tax-free thresholds for the respective class relationships mentioned are £150,000, £20,000 and £10,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>I submit that these are probably the most penal aspects of the Bill and have very significant ramifications for people, particularly those in business who want to pass on assets to their sons or daughters. In effect, the thresholds between the people are telescoped and the tax is made significantly more penal than it has been.  This is not generally known because people have not concentrated on it.</P>
    <P>I will refer again to the memorandum, page 11, where the main points of the Bill are summarised as well as the procedure. I refer also to section 107 of the Bill and particularly to the last line on page 86 which states that &ldquo;provided that the tax so chargeable shall not be greater than an amount equal to 55 per cent of that taxable value&rdquo;.  Section 107 is concerned with defining a new method of levying the tax, but the thing became so complicated that the draftsman had to put in at <Col N="1360" /> the end of the section: &ldquo;The tax chargeable shall not be greater than an amount equal to 55 per cent of the taxable value&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the thing were readily understandable such a provision would not be required.  It has to be said, because this has been going on and evolving for a period, that the tax on discretionary trusts is a confiscation.  That is what I think it amounts to, but I have heard stronger words mentioned, like extortion. It seems to me to be a confiscation because in effect what it means is that if assets are in a trust where the person is dead and the children are older than 25, the State is saying to the trustees, &ldquo;Give us 3 per cent of your assets&rdquo;.  What is 3 per cent this year, of course, could be 5 per cent next year.  Supposing the trust had not the cash to pay, it would have to sell assets to realise the cash.  There is a further snag because this sale of assets is a disposal for the purposes of capital gains tax on which further tax will be paid.  Therefore, if the trust got investment income and sold its investments and decided to pay the 3 per cent out of them, it is still not good enough because the trust is liable to a surcharge of 20 per cent on its income.</P>
    <P>That is an unfortunate piece of legislation. It is another example of why all Finance Acts have to be looked at and brought up to date, in the same way as property law has to be looked at.  When the Minister has got the major problems out of the way, when things are settling down, when the time comes right, there will be an opportunity for the Government to sit down and examine these areas.  It would be difficult, if there were changes of Government in a short period, to make a serious effort to do something like that but there are examples of things being started by Ministers with very good ideas and because they were beneficial to the populace at large were continued. Deputy Wilson was one with different portfolios who was involved in a continuing process, though his ideas might have come to fruition under the aegis of another Minister in a different Government. The legislation is extremely complicated, it will give rise to much difference of opinion and probably lead to very <Col N="1361" /> little revenue.  I look forward to discussing the different sections on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start by expressing appreciation of what Deputy Skelly had to say with regard to the complications of finance legislation, and in particular one must pursue certain sections backwards in time to one Act or another.  It is difficult, without doing major research, to get out of any Finance Bill its clear meaning just by reading the Finance Bill.  One would hope for some format or publication which would include the current Finance Bill and section of Acts referred to in their original or amended forms. Such work is done by research scholars. This Bill is bulky as it is, but I argue that it should be even bulkier because it would help to clarify what the Minister for Finance is trying to do.</P>
      <P>My main criticism of the Bill is directed at its tone, the use that is being made of it or not being made of it in the current economic situation.  It is a <i>deja vu</i> Bill, there is no <i>sursum corda</i> in it, no attempt to use taxation or revenue collecting as an instrument for reviving the economy, for increasing employment, though the Minister referred in his speech to the need for increased employment.</P>
      <P>It is a very disappointing document. The Minister said that the forecasts made in his Department for this year were accurate&mdash;that the revenue and expenditure were more or less on target.  If one reads the commentaries in the newspapers or listened to the comments from this side one would be doubtful and sceptical about the Minister's claim.  I have a copy of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> for 27 March 1984 which gives the receipts, which I will go through quickly to indicate to the House why the Minister could not have been convinced that what he was telling us was the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 23 March 1984 the customs receipts were £16,900,000 compared with £15,600,000 in the same period in 1983. The excise collected in the same period was £220,940,000 about £20 million down in the same period last year which brought in £239,112,000.  Not merely have you to take account of the difference, <Col N="1362" /> almost £20 million, but you must also take into account that you were in a different inflation period between 1 January 1983 to 25 March 1983 and January to March 1984.  Estate duties are also down from £584,000 to £198,000. There was no residential property tax last year but £127,000 was collected this year: in this context, peanuts.  Capital taxes are down from roughly £5.5 million to £5.185 million this year.  Stamps are up to £2 million.  Income tax on the other hand has risen from £413.7 million in the first quarter of 1983 to £462.9 million this year.  This indicates where the shoe is pinching in our economy.</P>
    <P>Corporation tax, significantly, yielded £25.4 million last year and £25.5 million this year.  In real terms that is a major decrease.  The income levy reads at £18.6 million this year and there was nothing for the corresponding period last year. Again the unfortunate customer is filling the gaps.  Value-added tax this year yielded £330 million against £277.7 million last year.  Inflation applies in this area as well.  It is significant that income taxation and value-added tax are the items which show significant increases, as do agricultural levies at almost double what they were in the first quarter of last year &mdash; £3.7 million as against £1.9 million.</P>
    <P>Motor vehicle duties are also up by £7 million, from £23.9 million to £30.9 million. The youth employment levy is down &mdash; probably indicating that fewer people are employed and contributing &mdash; from £12 million to £11.6 million.  The Post Office is out of the reckoning this year but it contributed £47.2 million last year. The figure for Miscellaneous &mdash; always an interesting customer like A.N.  Other on a football team &mdash; is down to £15 million this year.  Mr. Miscellaneous was much more productive last year when he accounted for £21 million.</P>
    <P>I agree that the vagaries of when payments come in can affect the overall figures, but three months is not a bad indication of what is happening in the receipts field as far as this year is concerned.  I know various factors have to be taken into account and that various receipts come in bulk at different times of the year, but nevertheless one can take it <Col N="1363" /> that, losing on swings what one is gaining on roundabouts, there is some indication in those figures.</P>
    <P>I am not confident that the Minister for Finance is right when he says the whole system of monitoring of both revenue and expenditure has improved.  The total receipts for that period were £1,163,733,766 and the issues for the same period were £1,565,888,166 or a gap of £402 million.  Four hundred and two million pounds for a quarter would indicate £1,608 million for the whole year.  Again taking into account the vagaries of receipts and making allowance for them it is still a substantial deficit at this time of the year.  On the issues side there is a figure which interests me, that is, the pay out under the Transport Acts, 1964-81 of £3,853,000.  If the Minister has time I would like him to tell me exactly what that covers.</P>
    <P>There has been great stress on restoring order to the public finances.  This has been made a fetish by the present Government.  We contend, and we can back it up with facts, that there is no significant impact being made on the deficit on current account and that the finances in general are not being improved by the policies of the Government. Some financial people in Europe are interested in bringing order into finances at international level.  I have spoken &mdash; a voice in the wilderness &mdash; in this House about the desirability of doing something about the relative rates of exchange.  Recently we had the advantage of a drop in the price of petroleum products, particularly petrol and diesel because our currency had strengthened against the dollar.  For the last number of years we have been on the receiving end of a very strong dollar.  The point I made already, and which I repeat now, is that no matter how good our Minister for Finance may be, no matter how good his advice in the Department may be, no matter how cannily financial policy is decided by our Government, these are factors over which we have no control.</P>
    <P>The Bretton Woods Agreement drawn up by a number of people &mdash; a man who is not very popular nowadays, Keynes, <Col N="1364" /> played a large part in drawing it up &mdash; served us well up to the early seventies. Now it is of no use.  It has been discarded since then but there are aspects of that discarding which have benefited our economy.  My contention is that there should be at international level &mdash; when I say &ldquo;international level&rdquo; I include not merely the EEC plus Britain, who stayed out of the EMS, but the United States and Japan &mdash; an attempt made to bring some kind of order into the rates of exchange.  I spoke some time ago about a meeting at Williamsburg.  People hoped that some form of international agreement, no matter how loose, would be reached as a result of that conference but nothing emerged.  Many economic commentators expressed disappointment.</P>
    <P>In the current issue of <i>The Economist</i> an interesting proposal is put forward by a man called McKinnon in which he wants to involve the yen, the Deutschemark and the dollar.  I will not go through the details.  He is a monetarist but nevertheless he sees the need for a formula whereby some kind of order can be brought into international finances.  From our point of view it would have been desirable for the United Kingdom to join the EMS.  They chose not to do so but not all of the establishment there are satisfied that they did the right thing in this regard.  There are still strong advocates of the UK joining the EMS.  Our exporters have benefited from our being in the EMS and the fact that the pound sterling is stronger than our punt.  Very few commentators or whiners among the exporters call attention to this.  The only journalist who called attention to it was the economic correspondent of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> some time ago.  There is a 20 per cent advantage in the UK market.</P>
    <P>Later I will refer to our loss of competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> the countries in the EMS, a fairly serious matter which is referred to by the people who put together the ESRI report, edited by Kennedy and Cunniffe, on employment and unemployment.  This document did not get the attention it deserved from this House or from the economic commentators. It was cast aside by people who are purblind, concentrating like hypnotised <Col N="1365" /> rabbits on one thing only, balancing the books, and not directing their attention to the unemployment scene which is a running sore in our society.  It must be remedied.  It cannot be done overnight but we must be seen to be thrusting in that direction.  If not, we on all sides of the House are failing in our duty to the country, particularly to our younger citizens.</P>
    <P>McKinnon believes that exchange rates powerfully affect real economic activity and that if they are misaligned they will increase protectionist demands. I do not subscribe to monetarism and I do not believe anybody on either side of this House subscribes to the full, bare, naked, Stone Age central theory of monetarism, although the Government have obviously taken most of the monetarist philosophy and are trying to put it into effect.  McKinnon wants to make monetarism international so that it recognises what every banker knows but most monetarists ignore, that demand for a country's currency is not confined within its border.  This is a very short article and I would recommend Members to study it and to try to get the Minister and his officials working along the lines which will save us from what is happening with regard, for example, to what we are paying per annum for oil.  In farming you can do all the right things and the weather will let you down.  You can do all the right things in finance and the exchange rate may let you down, affected by the interest rate in the United States.</P>
    <P>The opening paragraph of this article states:</P>
    <P>After a dozen years of floating exchange rates, much of the argument about the results is sloppy and stale. Some (mostly Keynesians) want to return to fixed rates,&mdash;</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;fixed rates&rdquo; might be too strong for what I am advocating.  The EMS is perhaps the best in that there is a kind of constricted float between the currencies.  The article continues:</P>
    <P>&mdash;saying that they helped to bring the steady growth and low inflation of the 1950s and the 1960s.  Others (mostly <Col N="1366" /> monetarists) want a squeaky-clean float giving each government absolute freedom to choose its own fiscal and monetary policies without importing the effects of others' policies via a semi-managed exchange rate.</P>
    <P>That is all right if you are in the big league but it is a horse of a different colour if you are paying, as we are, for all our fuel in dollars.</P>
    <P>If the GNP of all EEC countries was added together, including that of the UK, it would be greater than the GNP of the United States.  Because of that, there is no reason whatsoever why we should not have a European currency &mdash; call it, perhaps, the ecu &mdash; which we could use for buying oil.  It should be as strong as the dollar.  It would mean that the UK would have to join so that there would be a ten-country pool or basket.  I know from reading some EEC documents that there are financiers in Europe who are interested in this.</P>
    <P>The Minister says in his speech that the first requirement is to secure the right financial and economic climate for the creation of employment.  That is the one thing which was not included either in the budget or the Finance Bill.  There is a story told about the couple who waited to get married until they could afford it. The door of the church was opened and a clanking of crutches was heard as the two approached the altar.  If you wait until the finances are right for making a drive to create employment then you will have waited too long.  You will not be able to achieve the purpose which was supposed to be the basis of your financial activity in the first place.  The reference to the couple who waited to get married until they could afford it is apposite and to the point.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about wage cost competitiveness.  I agree it is very important. We are inclined to talk about our borrowing as a percentage of our GNP. We must also talk about our borrowing as a percentage of our exports of goods and services.  As has been said by Deputy Skelly, our exports have been particularly buoyant, but the buoyancy is on a narrow base, mainly in the chemical <Col N="1367" /> industry.  In the data office equipment electronic area we have been very successful over the past year.  There are other areas as well.  We must never forget our agricultural exports, and so on. Reckoning borrowing as a percentage of our exports of goods and services may carry certain little dangers, seeing that the export is so narrowly based.  It is important to take cognisance of it, and it is important that the Minister for Finance should take cognisance of it.</P>
    <P>There is a table in this week's <i>Economist</i> giving the interest payments on external debt as a percentage of exports of goods and services.  The story the graph shows here is a sad one, in that the percentage is as high as 45 in some countries. I am sure every Member of the House who takes an interest in economic affairs would be able to name the countries. In Brazil the interest they pay on their exports of goods and services is up to 45 per cent.  In Argentina, Mexico, the Philippines, Sudan, Costa Rica, Turkey, South Korea, Nigeria and Yugoslavia the percentage goes down to a little over 10 for Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>I have a question down to the Minister about this.  I do not know whether it has appeared on the Order Paper yet.  If we are looking for a grain of optimism in dealing with our economic affairs, perhaps we could look at that.  I may be wrong.  We have big interest payments per annum.  I should like to see the figure. I do not think we are in the kind of league I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to cost competitiveness and price competitiveness.  I referred already to the advantage we have in the UK market because the punt reads roughly 80p as against sterling.  There are disadvantages when we are importing raw materials.  I suppose the ideal would be to import raw materials from areas where the punt is a stronger member of society, so to speak, perhaps the EMS if possible, although transport costs would come in there, and to export to where we have the exchange rate advantage.</P>
    <P>In the context of the discussions which are about to begin with the trade unions and the volleys which are being fired by <Col N="1368" /> the Government at the trade unions and the Congress of Trade Unions, and the counter volleys, perhaps we are attaching too much importance to the issue of wages and salary only in relation to competitiveness.</P>
    <P>On page 88 of the ESRI Employment and Unemployment Policy for Ireland we have indices of the price competitiveness of Irish manufacturing exports.  It is a strange story, because we were more than highly competitive in the UK market.  I have here a graph which nearly went through the ceiling in 1980-81 for competitiveness in the UK.  The very strange thing is that in the EMS from 1975 to the present time, with a little spurt up here and there, we have been losing our price competitiveness.  We should think about this.  I am sure the 20 per cent advantage we have in exchange rates is responsible for a great deal of the high price competitiveness in the UK market.</P>
    <P>I am quoting from page 90:</P>
    <P>The decline in competitiveness against the EMS countries, and the gain in competitiveness against the UK, remain the main features if such adjustments are made.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting table 6.1 on page 90 which gives unit wage cost competitiveness indices for Irish manufacturing industry from 1975 to 1982.  It has its own lessons with regard to the Finance Bill.  I do not intend to go into it, but on costs it says:</P>
    <P>There is relatively little information on non-labour costs in Ireland compared with other countries.</P>
    <P>That is a deficiency we should try to make up.  The reason I am talking about this is that the only thing referred to is the labour costs, the wage deals, such and such a round.  Energy, telecommunications and transport are all highly relevant also, and others about which, as the study says, we do not have very much information. The report says that the conventional wisdom is that electricity charges are very much greater in Ireland than in other EEC countries.  This was not always the case.  In 1978 at comparable load factors electricity charges here were relatively <Col N="1369" /> cheap by EEC standards.  Since 1978 there has been a deterioration to the extent that, at comparable load factors, charges in Ireland in 1982 were close to the very highest in the EEC.  I am talking about this in the context of what is starting up &mdash; a row between the Government and the trade unions.</P>
    <P>The report says that since 1982 the situation has deteriorated.  There are all kinds of implications for the production of energy.  I want to refer to a lecture Dr. Whitaker gave recently in which he pointed out the massive capacity for over-production the ESB have, and the problems which will arise from that.  The House already knows about some of those problems, for example, in connection with the turf generating stations in the midlands.  I will come back to that again.</P>
    <P>In regard to oil they say that residual fuel oil carries the second highest EEC selling price.  Again, so far as cost competitiveness is concerned that must be taken into account.  The report says: &ldquo;Diesel oil selling prices are also second highest in the EEC.&rdquo;  Again, this is highly relevant to the Finance Bill because that Bill has provision for increasing the prices of diesel oil.  &ldquo;...there has been a marked deterioration in the position relative to the UK and West Germany over time.  This deterioration has resulted because of taxes and duties, since excluding these the base price improved its relative position.&rdquo;  The UK are a big market and West Germany are a growing market. &ldquo;Heating fuel oil selling prices of Ireland were the lowest in the Community, only because of the relatively low level of taxation on that particular fuel.&rdquo; Again, there are telephone costs.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about competitiveness as the Minister is, we must not talk either about cost competitiveness or price competitiveness in isolation.  We must not home in on the wages and salaries end alone, important as they may be.  One could perhaps argue that they are the most controllable factor, on which we can make the most impact, but that is not an excuse for ignoring the other factors.</P>
    <P>I refer to the exercise, which I think <Col N="1370" /> would be illuminating as far as this House is concerned, of reckoning our interest payments as a percentage of export of goods and services.  It is important to find what makes success in exports &mdash; cost and price competitiveness yes, but there is more to it than that.  I quote from the report:</P>
    <P>In relation to export performance it needs to be said that the statistical relationship between competitiveness and export is not a neat and tidy one.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that.</P>
    <P>The determinants of export capacity in the long run have related largely to the decisions of firms (mainly foreign) to locate in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Costs &mdash; and wage costs in particular &mdash; are important to our developing exports, but they are not the exclusive factors to be taken into consideration.  I am repeating myself there, but doing so deliberately.</P>
    <P>...it would be simple-minded to expect that a strategy which relied on improvements in relative costs alone would lead to a resolution of the employment and balance of payment difficulties facing the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Even when an economy has a comparatively favourable cost position in products that are already being manufactured, exports do not take place without a measure of entrepreneurial and marketing effort.  <i>A fortiori</i> they do not take place automatically for products in which the country has a potential cost advantage which remains to be exploited.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that.  I shall give from the commercial world one example which has a strong relationship to my constituency.  Bailey's Cream is one of the great commercial successes of recent years.  There are, of course, Bailey's, Emmets, Waterford, Carolan's but the market leader is Bailey's.  We had excellent grass-produced cream, not an artificially induced production.  We had the whiskey which to my mind is the only whiskey in the world, but I am prejudiced. <Col N="1371" /> Whiskey started here and, to my mind, it still stays here.  We did a little harm by weakening its strength down to 13 u.p., supposedly to help the tourists, but I believe the best way to help the tourists would be to leave the whiskey stronger.  We had the 24 u.p. whiskey, we had the cream and the formula.  However, it is a splendid exercise of marketing which put that product into every hotel and every bar that think anything about themselves.  It is an up-market product in Europe, and particularly in the United States where it was the thing to have in the cocktail cabinet, although that is perhaps a dated description.  We had advantages &mdash; the splendid raw materials, the idea, but above all we had a powerful marketing effort in that regard.  As this study says, you may have an excellent product but the world will not come to get it.  You have to go out and sell it.  The conclusion, therefore, is that cost competitiveness is a necessary but not an exclusive condition for success on the export market.</P>
    <P>I am again hanging my remarks on the reference made by the Minister to the damage done by absenteeism and industrial disputes.  Again, we tend to hammer our work people.  I shall read to the House some statistics on this matter in a moment which will indicate that we are not as bad as we believe ourselves to be. I opened a factory in my constituency where the main interest is a European one.  I should not have been listening to a conversation which took place immediately following on the formal ceremony, but overheard one European asking his man on the ground in my constituency about Monday morning absenteeism.  No doubt the man questioned did not tell the local trade union official this, but his reply was &ldquo;We are much better here than you are in the mother factory&rdquo;.  I was pleased to hear that, but made no comment because I was earwigging.</P>
    <P>I have here all the articles written criticising the report.  I am not holding a brief on the report but am saying that it is trying to do probably what all should be doing, thinking out every possible way for creating employment in our society. <Col N="1372" /> We have that duty and obligation and I am not speaking in a party political sense. That is the duty of the Government because that is where the power lies.  That is the duty of the Opposition, because we were elected to this Parliament, and that is the duty of every citizen.  We tried to get that message across through an overt Fianna Fáil programme at Christmas to get people to buy Irish goods, so that more would be employed in Irish manufacturing.</P>
    <P>The House will be interested to hear the absentee rate in the following countries: The Federal Republic of Germany, 5.7 per cent; Sweden, 5.6 per cent; Czechoslovakia, 5.5 per cent.  They are the top of the league, according to Table 6.4, page 98 of the report.  There is nobody in this House who is not aware of the achievements of the Federal Republic of Germany in manufacturing, in exports, in giving strength to their economy.  Many people hold up Sweden as the paragon of western democracies as far as development is concerned.  Czechoslovakia, 5.5 per cent &mdash; that is a country where the ideology is different &mdash; but apparently they are in the top three of the league; France 4.6 per cent, Norway, 4.6 per cent, Ireland 4.6 per cent, the United Kingdom 4.3 per cent, Yugoslavia 4.1 per cent, the Netherlands 4 per cent, Spain 3.8 per cent, Austria 3.7 per cent, Belgium 3.2 per cent, Italy 2.6 per cent, the United States of America 1.9 per cent and Canada 1.1 per cent. Obviously that is the most recent information available to researchers.  Therefore from the point of view of absenteeism we are not the best but we are far from being the worst.</P>
    <P>The study is narrower in relation to sickness rates and gives cause for worry. In 1954 the sickness rate in the Republic of Ireland was 6.6 per cent, in Northern Ireland 6.8 per cent and in Britain 4.5 per cent.  In 1966 it was 7.9 per cent in the Republic of Ireland, 8.1 per cent in Northern Ireland and 4.8 per cent in Britain. By 1976 we were deteriorating, and badly, in that the rate in the Republic of Ireland was 8.5 per cent &mdash; the first time we had a higher sickness rate than in Northern Ireland &mdash; almost double the <Col N="1373" /> rate in Britain.  It must be remembered that our society was not subjected to the kinds of pressures to which people were being subjected in the Six Counties &mdash; in 1978 the rate in the Republic of Ireland was 10.5 per cent, in Northern Ireland 9.6 per cent and in Britain 6.1 per cent. If we are talking about competitiveness those are areas of which we must take cognisance.</P>
    <P>In the second paragraph of the Minister's introductory remarks &mdash; and this is related to my theme &mdash; he said there are provisions in the Bill before the House designed specifically to encourage employment, that there are now grounds for optimism, that the worst is over &mdash; but the melody lingers on &mdash; and that the employment outlook will gradually improve.  I hope that is true but it appears to me to be flummery.  There is no specific provision in this Finance Bill, nor was there in the budget speech, plan or policy to indicate hard thinking with regard to the encouragement of employment. Deputy Skelly even referred to the niggardliness of the few little references in the Bill with regard to employment.  The Ceann Comhairle had to take him to task because, in order to be easy on his Minister, he turned the blame onto the draftsmen. There is no <i>sursum corda</i> in this Bill, as there was not in the Minister's budget speech; there is no <i>sursum corda</i> with regard to the improvement of the employment position here.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House accused the Government of having swallowed wholesale the diabolical economic policy of Milton Friedman.  I suppose we are not being totally just to the Government in that they are not 100 per cent sparkling blue monetarists, but the general principles of monetarism are those that are being applied.  I do know that in our schools of economics there has been a bit of a heave towards monetarism.  I suppose this is something one might expect, as Deputy John Kelly might say &mdash; what they do in the United Kingdom today we try to do yesterday.  I should make it more colourful &mdash; I am doing an injustice to Deputy Kelly by using such pedestrian language &mdash; but the fact is that those are the lines on which our economic wagon <Col N="1374" /> has been travelling.  I want to tell the House what the harbingers of monetarism are doing.  One of the basic principles is the control of money supply.  I will give the money supply and its percentage rise of a year ago for the two countries in the world at present pioneering monetarism. The narrow money supply in the USA &mdash; one can call it what one likes; there are different names for it in different countries &mdash; was plus 8.5 per cent in the past year, and the broad, plus 9 per cent. In the United Kingdom it was plus 10.5 per cent on the narrow and plus 9.9 per cent on the broad in the last year.  I think I read last evening that with the exception of Italy and Australia, that constitutes the greatest expansion in money supply there has been over the last year in the following countries: Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, West Germany, Holland, Italy, Japan &mdash; the narrow figure is not available for Sweden but the broad was 6.8 per cent (and it must be remembered that Sweden is a socialist country), Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.  If we want an argument in this House to impact on the Government about their fiscal and monetary policies one has one there where the godfathers of the system are expanding money supply.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his introductory remarks also referred to the Commission on Taxation.  I have sympathy with the Minister &mdash; he is not a man who attracts sympathy <i>a priori</i> anyway &mdash; with regard to the recommendations of that commission. I would go along with what he says for the most part, that one cannot do it in a hurry.  What Deputy Skelly said about policies being started and then continued is significant and relevant in these circumstances, namely, that to do something with regard to income taxation one needs a consistent and fairly long spread of government.  Of course the fact is that the spell in government is short and we on this side are very anxious that it should be even shorter and, as Joxer would say, <i>vice versa</i>.  There is no doubt at all about that.  But the shortness of the spell is one of the weaknesses and I appreciate what the Minister said.  He will give his views, <Col N="1375" /> he said, on this report on another occasion.</P>
    <P>To have a radical overhaul of the taxation system in any particular year is not perhaps so simple since the budget and the Finance Bill are taken for only one year.  It is a very difficult situation.  I admit that.  There is no question about it.  In a sense a dictator who has ten years in which to plan is in a stronger position. However, if he is on the wrong line, as I think this Government is fiscally and financially, then there is no way of shifting him.  That is the weakness in that system.  I think it is a pity that Dr. Miriam Hederman's work has not been put into effect.  I read the first volume.  We have just got the second volume on our desks. It would really need all-party agreement in order to have anything effective done with regard to taxation and the figures I read out from <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> would indicate the necessity for a very hard look.  There we saw there was a fall back in customs and excise, a fall back here, there and everywhere, but income tax is up and so is value-added tax, both carrying the can for everything else.</P>
    <P>The relief in regard to the £25,000 for long term risk capital &mdash; I take the point Deputy Skelly made &mdash; should be welcomed by both sides since it can lead to new trading or the expansion of existing trading.  In this regard there has been some change from the date of the budget. Certain services were mentioned.  When we were in Government we were considering the whole area of services.  I understand that seven out of ten employed in the United States, a strong country economically, are employed in services of one type or another.  For that reason we should not be ashamed of extending our services in order to increase employment. We seem to have pitched services into a kind of corner.  We adopt hushed tones when we talk about increasing employment in the services.  I just cannot understand it.  I do not think it is a valid approach.  I think we should encourage the development of services.  When we were in Government there was talk of some international services, like the American Express, getting headquarters <Col N="1376" /> here.  We should attract people like that because they will bring development and in that development there will be employment.</P>
    <P>I have had a letter from someone who was recently in Ethiopia and the writer said CIE had a chance of getting a contract in Addis Ababa for a development there.  I do not want any cynical remarks with regard to that.  Some semi-State bodies have already exported their services to the Middle East and so on.  I just make the point about CIE to indicate that all our semi-State bodies should be trying to get contracts, contracts designed to give employment to our citizens who, according to this report, will be coming on the market at the rate of a future 25,000 to 26,000 extra qualified personnel per annum.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister dealt with groups of workers and co-ops in his speech.  I know the co-ops were very worried about some of the sentiments expressed in the budget speech of the Minister.  Those Deputies who peruse the co-op magazine will have noticed how many co-ops are in the top 500 companies at the moment.  Everything that can be done to strengthen them, particularly in their job creation activities, should be welcomed.  I was glad to hear on the news on the way in to the House today that Bailieboro Co-op had about a 45 per cent, £1.5 million, profit last year.  Now there you have diversification.  You have an engineering section.  You have a cream section, a food section as well as the basics associated with a co-op.</P>
    <P>There is a beauty of a sentence here. In relation to bond washing the Minister said the announcement brought on a strong overreaction which temporarily disrupted the fiscal market but that the market had settled down and is now functioning normally having absorbed the change.  I think the last sentence is a beauty.  It is, of course, one of the functions of the market to adjust to change. I think that sentence has the genius of simplicity.  I agree with the Minister in what he did.</P>
    <P>With regard to tax relief for money expended on education and the arts I welcome that provision.  Here I would <Col N="1377" /> like the House to take note of what Mr. Potterton has said very bitterly recently about the weakness in our legislation in that we cannot stop very valuable works of art from leaving the country.  We have no law to stop them.  He was, I think, referring to a statue of Venus in Westport House which turned up at an auction in Christies.  This is an area to which we should direct our attention.  Works of art are capital and, if they are allowed to leave the country, it means capital is scattered and lost to the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the relief for toll roads and bridges, I think this is an excellent idea.  There is a labour content in the construction of bridges and toll roads.  In these there is a strong employment content, and I would hope the coverage here would be extended.  The House will remember we had a major programme of decentralisation involving many provincial towns up and down the west coast, in the north midlands and midlands, in the south and particularly in some areas in my own constituency along the Border. I would appeal to the Minister to extend this tax relief for that particular sector and encourage privatisation so long as that decentralisation is conserved.  It would be a welcome boon to the moribound construction industry.  At regular intervals we get statistics from the Central Statistics Office on the numbers unemployed.  Sticking out at between 40,000 and 50,000 month after month is the huge number of skilled people in the construction industry who are idle.  This is a haemorrhage which can be staunched by intelligent investment in worthwhile infrastructure.  I shall refer to Dr. Whitaker's lecture later.  That is one of the recommendations he makes.</P>
    <P>If I could sow the seed in the Minister of State's mind or in the minds of his officials to have a look at that it would be a good day's work.  I am not advocating any kind of foolish investment or one from which there did not flow direct economic and social benefit to the country. The energising of the construction industry must carry economic and social benefit to the state.</P>
    <P>Section 84 loans has been covered adequately by various speakers.  I am glad <Col N="1378" /> that services activities are included.  However, nobody spelled out which ones, and if I remember correctly the Bill stated &ldquo;certain activities&rdquo;.  I do not know if it is tied to &ldquo;international&rdquo; or not.  It is to be welcomed if the end result is an increase in employment.  My stamina is reasonably good but I nearly collapsed when reading through all the provisions in which this section 84 concession is wrapped.  It is there in paragraph after paragraph, as if there was a crowd of chefs around a dish and one saying add another little ingredient there to block off this chancer and another saying add this little ingredient here to stop that chancer.  It is hedged with caution, but no one can cavil if the main purpose is to protect the nation's finances and see to it that the concession is used to the benefit of the community.</P>
    <P>Great play was made about principal private residence and developments.  I have no argument with what was done. Is there any idea of what the gain to the Exchequer will be as a result of this?  It looks like something to catch the eye, with very little relevance.  Only a few people will be affected, but it is good as a propaganda exercise.</P>
    <P>To be quasi-parochial for a moment, I have written down in my notes &mdash; pints, petrol, electrical goods and electronics. I do not have to tell the House what they mean with regard to Border areas.  The price of all those and tax, whether VAT or excise duty directly imposed by the Government, has put us at risk as an economy.  I do not want to sound alarm bells.  I and my fellow Deputies from the Border areas have spoken about this so often that there is a great danger of the wolf, wolf syndrome applying.  I put it on the record that the effect on business is catastrophic.  As far as my constituency and other areas around the Border are concerned, when one adds to that the gash that has been inflicted regarding the development of the dairying industry one gets an idea of our economic plight as of now.  Our young farmers were on a course to raise productivity from the national average of 700 gallons per annum per cow to 1,200 gallons.  Many of them had achieved that and many were on a five year plan to achieve it.  That has been <Col N="1379" /> guillotined.  This is an area which has been bled by emigration since the Famine and has lost 30,000 or 40,000 people since we won our last All-Ireland.  That is something which should give the House thought and the Government should take direct and positive action to try to remedy it.</P>
    <P>It is a reflection on the Minister's speech that there was so much time given to talk about betting duty.  No comment, a Cheann Comhairle.  The Finance Bill and the budget should be an instrument of resurrection and hope.  It should be a stimulus to an ailing economy.  The money supply in the UK and the US has been increased by respectable percentages in the last year and they are the powerhouses of monetarism.  Could the Minister not look at something other than the books?  Could he not get something else?  Make no mistake, he is a cold fish; but he is an intelligent man.  He knows exactly what should be done.  I am sure, unless they have become dumb altogether, the Labour Members of the Government must be telling him that the unreformed Scrooge should not be the leading philosopher with the country in the plight it is in.</P>
    <P>There is 8 per cent VAT on clothing. In the area I referred to that was the only sector where we had a little advantage and, damn me, but they took it off us this year.  The best of boxers, like Cassius Clay, get punch drunk at the end of their careers.  The economy in my area, as blow after blow lands on its head, is becoming punch drunk.  There can be no doubt about that.  I am not exaggerating.  The Minister is giving extra powers to VAT inspectors, God save the mark.  They must get the powers to do their job.  For God's sake, let him get somebody of reasonable courtesy and urbanity in his Department.  I am sure they are there. Poets, writers and philosophers have come out of the Department of Finance, believe it or not.  I hope the Minister will get someone to teach his inspectors what to say, something that the Minister for Social Welfare did not do before the last blitz on the unfortunate people who were drawing unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> In my area, where they are trying to push ahead a little with tourism, if they go to buy an overcoat that cost £100 last year it will cost £108 this year, and they will wear it to protect them when the weather gets bad on the Sheelin or Oughter or any of the other lakes or rivers.  I am glad that there was a reduction from 23 per cent to 18 per cent on the hiring of boats, etc.  I am glad also that there has been a continuation of relief with regard to inheritance by young farmers.  That has exercised the minds of Macra na Feirme, the ICMSA, the IFA and the Department of Agriculture, and there was a danger that if this was not continued the transference from father to son would be delayed again on many farms.</P>
    <P>The final paragraph of the Minister's speech is a joke.  The Minister must have left the room and the only humorist left in the Department of Finance wrote that final paragraph.  The Minister said that this Bill was important legislation which provided for substantial improvement in our tax code.  He said that in the course of his Budget Statement he set out the principles that would determine the Government's tax policy over the next few years.  In regard to Dr. Miriam Hederman's work he said the direct opposite, that he would make a statement some other time.  He said that we were working towards a more equitable and efficient tax system based on a wider tax base and lower rates of taxation.  I will not let people in my constituency read that paragraph because my credibility would be gone; indeed, if I took that speech in a bag to a meeting my credibility would be gone.  The Minister said that we had a long distance to go yet before we could claim that these objectives had been achieved but progress was being made and the Bill before the House was evidence of this.</P>
    <P>I said that I would refer to a lecture that Dr. Whitaker gave recently.  I want to make way for a man who has particular expertise in agriculture and I do not want to deprive him of an opportunity to speak.  Dr. Whitaker in an address which he gave to the Confederation of Irish Industry's National Council recently had <Col N="1381" /> a number of things to say.  In fact, one could talk for two hours on what he had to say in that address.  I will tell the House in a moment why I am referring to it. Criticising the budget and so on he said:</P>
    <P>Although current expenditure nearly held in real terms, the current budget still tops £1,000 million...and seems impregnable....  The national debt is now 120 per cent of GNP and involves debt service which takes 37 per cent of tax revenue....</P>
    <P>I was referring earlier to a percentage of export of goods and services.  We should have a look at that, and anyhow I have put down a parliamentary question about it.  Dr. Whitaker continued:</P>
    <P>The State's borrowing requirement is still high and vulnerable to exchange losses....</P>
    <P>And also vulnerable to what happened in 1983, namely devaluation which added to the external debt.  Then he said, and I wish he had expanded on it a little:</P>
    <P>The public capital programme, although down in real terms, still contains doubtful items....</P>
    <P>He did not exactly specify them.  Now I will give the reason that I said I would refer to this.  He talks about pay and the need for moderation, and the trade unions themselves will admit that.  My main thesis in the earlier part of my speech today was that it was not the only thing that impacted on competitiveness, whether cost competitiveness or price competitiveness.  Again I refer to the ESRI report which in this House, because it did not fit in with the philosohpies of the Government, did not get the credit it deserved in addressing itself to employment and unemployment problems.</P>
    <P>Dr. Whitaker in the course of this address talked about productivity being good.  I want to make a point about that which occurred to me years ago.  I do not know whether it is practicable, but we are all agreed on the importance of exports.  We are all agreed that manufacturing industry for the most part produces what we export.  On the agricultural side <Col N="1382" /> it should be more than it is.  However, what if we showed our appreciation of the importance of the exporters by giving the workers in manufacturing industry, whose products are exported on which we all live, some income tax concessions? We give the entrepreneur an income tax concession.  Could we not think of giving a concession to the worker in manufacturing industry?  That would have several effects.  It would point up the importance in our economy of manufacturing exports.  It would recruit very good people for the factories concerned because if they were getting a tax advantage they would be very anxious to work there.  It would raise consciousness of the importance of this sector in the community. It would attract to the industry the very best people who would be anxious to be well paid and get these concessions. I can hear people asking why they should have that advantage, and so on.  All right, I am prepared to argue that also.  It would be discrimination amongst citizens, but we discriminate amongst manufacturers for the advantage of the manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Regarding the capital side Dr. Whitaker said:</P>
    <P>Telecommunications outlay has passed its peak.  Energy expenditure has left huge overcapacity in ESB.</P>
    <P>Moneypoint will cause a great deal of trouble, apart altogether from the overcapacity and the trouble it may cause in the generating stations in the midlands and the west.  Also, it is in a south-westerly corner.  I intend to put down a parliamentary question today about acid rain.  The emissions from such generating stations have caused a great deal of acid rain and damage to forests and the environment all over Europe.  The ESB should be cognisant of it and take steps to remedy it.  However, that is an aside. Dr. Whitaker continued:</P>
    <P>The probable tailing off of some large expenditures&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy, this Bill deals with taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about taxation in the sense of how it is used when it goes into the Exchequer.  We know, for example, that the county councils are crying out for money for road works. However, in deference to the Chair I will move on from that.</P>
      <P>Dr. Whitaker talks about competitive tendering for specified works.  That is something we should pay attention to also.  He talks about the Commission on Taxation and the Minister refers to that commission also in his speech so I am safe enough in making reference to them.</P>
      <P>Dr. Whitaker talks, too, about increasing revenue and checking expenditure and says that this scissors movement, expenditure being held and revenue surging up, would do more to phase out the deficit than would any conceivable cuts in public sector expenditure.  The people in the Department of Finance should take note of that.  We have had enough gloom and darkness so far as that Department are concerned.</P>
      <P>I shall conclude with the following quotation from Dr. Whitaker:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the prospects for the future, I see no need for despair.  We have taken our problems in hand and are beginning to get the better of them.  We are not alone in our difficulties: low growth and high unemployment are features common to the member countries of the EEC.  They are not necessarily a permanent or universal affliction. Indeed, in the US in recent years there has been a steady rise in output and in employment (particularly in services and small industries).  There is no need to conclude that a goal of reasonably high employment is no longer attainable because of automation, competition from the Third World, or any other reason.  A good deal more industrialisation <Col N="1384" /> is possible before our society attains &ldquo;post-industrial&rdquo; status.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Department of Finance, of which Dr. Whitaker was once a part, and also the Minister for Finance would ponder those words.  There is a <i>sursum corda</i> in them.  There is a dispelling of the gloom.  I do not wish to indulge in any kind of falsely-based euphoria, but we need something other than what we have been getting from the people who control our fiscal and financial policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise mainly to compliment the Minister for the cautious approach he has been adopting to our financial problems since coming to office.  Most of the provisions of this Bill are expressed in a rather reserved way.  While the Minister admits that some progress has been made he tells us that we must be cautious as to the future.  I would contrast that with the performance of the Minister's predecessors during the past ten years, a period that has been termed by some commentators as a wasted decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as Dr. O'Riordan was concerned, that decade was beset by three serious problems &mdash; a rapid growth in Government deficit and current account, a serious deterioration in our balance of payments and a massive increase in the numbers of unemployed. This was manifested particularly in the period from 1977 to 1981.  It was during that time we had a Government who had come to power with the strongest ever majority and who by 1978 had decided on a change in leadership.  I understand that their reason for changing their leadership was that they understood our financial problems to be so grave as to have to be tackled in a much more serious manner than was the case then.  When Deputy Wilson refers to recent comments made by Dr. Whitaker, he is acknowledging that the Minister for Finance has set the economy on the right <Col N="1385" /> course towards some kind of moderate recovery.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Wilson on having delivered a well-researched speech, but he did try to take advantage of what he referred to as short-term emotive issues and he tried to portray the Minister for Finance as being the big bad dragon, trying to worsen the lot of everyone.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister particularly on the proposal in respect of income tax relief for venture capital.  This complements some of the earlier work done by previous Ministers, including Deputy O'Malley who, as Minister, endeavoured to bring small industries to the country.  Major industry had failed to provide the growth in employment that was needed.  Growth in native industry had stagnated.  I come from an area in which substantial investments were made, especially in Shannon, and where large multi-national companies set up. The authors of industrial investment <Col N="1386" /> here, such people as the late Gerard Sweetman and the late Sean Lemass, were anxious that the Irish people would take advantage of this imported expertise. However, Deputy O'Malley was right in recognising that the Irish did not take advantage of the situation.  In my area there has been extensive liquidity since 1960 and substantial funds have been available from the earnings of the 7,000 to 8,000 people employed in the Shannon Industrial Estate but there is very little evidence of Irish entrepreneurship. There are very few manufacturing industries that have been established by the native people in our area.  That is why I am glad the Minister has introduced this venture capital provision.  It will complement the small industries programme and should attract investment from patriotic Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are too many people trying to take advantage of what is known as the black economy.  Effectively, they will contribute in the long run to the destruction of society in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who avoid paying proper taxation, who encourage malpractice and so on are the ones who are drawing down society. Perhaps at Committee Stage the Minister will introduce amendments designed to cut down on some of the limitations on the venture capital provision. He should have regard to the possibility of relatives of the owners of companies wishing to invest in them.  In addition, those who would monitor and promote those investments, for instance, the merchant banks, are not adequately provided for on the basis of the 1 per cent limit.  The Minister might consider improving on that limit so that these people might be encouraged to provide schemes and provide a platform by which people might be encouraged to invest under this new venture capital programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the other investments in the <Col N="1387" /> budget are concerned one aspect of the financial difficulties is the serious deterioration in the balance of payments.  Ógra Fianna Fáil are to be complimented on the programme they did at the end of last year encouraging a buy Irish campaign. There is also the import substitution in relation to agricultural products such as potatoes which was recognised in the budget.  The aspect of the import substitution I would like the Minister to concerntrate on is the importation of frozen chips, which amounted to £16 million last year.  I would like, because there is a limitation on the amount of money set aside and because the Minister was limited in investing only £100,000 to see the post of Mr. Potato being established, that there would be one executive, like we have in An Post and An Bord Telecom, in charge of the processing of the marketing of potatoes.  The people would be encouraged as a result of that.  The present position is a sad reflection and the sugar company, who had a policy of promoting potato production in the west but when it came to alternative products they did not seem to research the matter very well.  I urge the Minister to ask the Department of Agriculture to make this appointment.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister for Finance to consider improving on the amount of money set aside for the assistance of the unemployed people who want to take advantage of the enterprise allowance scheme.  The limitation of £500 is too small.  The Minister should reconsider the position about this investment.  There are occasions when £500 is very useful, but when a person is setting up a business with current values more money should be set aside.  I would like the Minister to increase that allowance to £1,000 or more.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly commented on the fact that the Finance Bill has 93 pages of complex sections and 22 pages of it are devoted to a new scheme of tax reliefs. Everybody wants to see tax relief but I appeal to the Minister, when he is formulating his policies for the coming year in relation to a fairer system of taxation, to consider simplifying the entire tax <Col N="1388" /> code.  The tax code has got so complicated that an enormous service industry is now established in the country making huge profits at the expense of the general taxpayer in trying to circumvent the provisions of particular tax Bills.  I would like to compliment the Minister for his cautious optimism, and I ask him to consider what I have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few remarks about the economy and about the effect of the taxation system on the economy in particular.  The Minister in his introduction to the budget had a penetrating analysis on the symptoms of the economy.  He said that consumption had declined, investment had fallen, unemployment had risen and growth had been stifled.  In response to that chronic situation the Minister introduced what has been termed a neutral budget.  He did nothing about the very serious situation in relation to the economy.</P>
      <P>One of the major underlying problems of the economy is the adverse fiscal and financial environment.  I do not believe the budget will bring about any alleviation of the problem of the fiscal environment. We have only to look at the anomalies and distortions in the financial institutions to know that there is something very wrong with our financial and fiscal environment.  I consider that the taxation of deposit accounts is very penal and self-defeating.  I feel that an individual who pays one of the highest tax rates in the civilised world has paid enough tax on his income without being further penalised for being prudent and generally responsible within the economic system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tax free limit of £50 on deposit accounts within our main financial institutions is derisory.  When this measure was originally introduced in 1956 there was a limit of £25 which was increased to £50 in the 1967 Act.  At that time interest rates were lower and a capital sum of £2,000 would provide interest of that amount.  At present day rates that £2,000 will be valued £10,000 and at 10 per cent interest it would bring in £1,000 interest on deposit.  Confining interest free deposit income to £50 which is the equivalent <Col N="1389" /> of a capital sum at 10 per cent of only £500 is absolutely ludicrous.  A sum of £500 to an old age pensioner providing for funeral expenses causes problems when the social welfare officer visits that person and says that it has come to his attention that the old age pensioner has a second income.  Surely when young people are trying to be prudent and save a few pounds to build their own houses a capital sum of £500 in a financial institution is not much use to them.  I know a number of them avail of the anomalies within the system to invest their money in building societies.</P>
    <P>This causes problems.  The building societies have been availing of this anomaly to attract large amounts of capital.  I believe the Minister appreciated that this might not be a bad thing because in last year's Finance Bill he did not implement his proposed budget regulation to force building societies to disclose their clients' accounts and open up their books generally. This has caused further problems in the last few weeks with a banking group, feeling the cold draught of the fiscal system and losing heavily in deposits, trying to acquire one of those building societies. It is not the fault of the bank but the fault of the system.  They have not some of the privileges which building societies have, and I urge the Minister, perhaps in the next Finance Bill if he is still in office, to ensure that all financial institutions receive the same treatment regarding taxation of deposit accounts and disclosure requirements.  It is most unfair to have anomalies between different institutions.</P>
    <P>There should also be a revision upwards of the amount of interest which a person can earn.  I suggest a figure of £1,000 would be reasonable, which represents £10,000 capital which, for a young couple trying to buy a house at an average price of about £30,000, is not a great deal of money by today's standards.  The penalisation of depositors here has led to enormous pressure on people to withdraw their funds from the system and invest it elsewhere.  According to the Central Bank quarterly report a sum of £819 million had been taken out of the economic system and diverted to areas where they would get a better return for <Col N="1390" /> their money.  This has tremendous repercussions because it means that the Government have to borrow more abroad.  In answer to a recent Parliamentary Question on devaluation of the punt it was stated that the total exchange losses on the external component of the national debt in 1983 was approximately £810 million.  That sum on the exchange rates alone, never mind the interest and the capital repayments, makes the Flanagan bonanza look pale in contrast.  I urge the Minister to improve the fiscal and financial environment in the country so that it is more attractive for people to keep their money at home and to invest in financial institutions.  We should try to retain the money from private investment and also attract capital here.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister and some of the brighter lights in the Department of Finance should take an extended trip to Switzerland and look at their banking system, which is outstanding.  They also have a spin-off from that system which provides them with the highest standard of living in the world.  They have no natural resources and very mountainy terrain. For many centuries they were foolish enough to provide personnel for many of the mercenary armies in Europe but, in the middle of the last century, they matured and decided to work for themselves. They are outside the EEC and the general European economic system and are a bright economic light in Europe.</P>
    <P>Many people are morose and despondent about our unemployment, much of which is caused by modern technology, new processes for almost all manufacturing disciplines and the introduction of robots as well as the troubles associated with labour in recent times.  Massive redundancy payments have to be made, and the present day industrialist or factory manager is loath to take on additional employees.  With the best will in the world, if he can get the job done by capital investment in plant and equipment he will opt for that.  If the Minister goes to Switzerland he should look at their unemployment figures, which are 0.4 per cent.  However, we should not be too despondent about our own position, we have better natural resources in terms <Col N="1391" /> of land and raw material generally.  Our mineral and oil resources have had a set-back recently but perhaps they can still be utilised.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the economic scene which is putting great pressure on additional employment is the degree of Government services which are swallowing the taxpayers' money.  I heard this morning, on the Order of Business, that the National Development Corporation are going to be set up shortly.  Generally, about 75 per ent of the money allocated to these structures is swallowed by the structure itself and the amount which gets to an area like west Cork is minimal.  In the administration of all schemes the amount that goes on wages and administration is too great.  The taxpayer would not mind paying a fair and reasonable rate of tax if he thought that his money was being put to useful and productive purposes, but he sees that not alone is one national structure gobbling up a large slice of this money but that there is also a great amount of overlapping.  Perhaps we could solve this problem by amalgamation or subsuming one structure into another.  Certainly the problem will have to be confronted.  We have agencies such as the National Manpower Service, the Youth Employment Agency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred every four or five minutes to taxation and the bad use that is made of the taxpayers' money and I am suggesting the Finance Bill will not improve the position.  The Minister might study some countries which have greater productivity, a higher standard of living, a lower rate of unemployment and less interference generally by Government agencies.  If we could have that situation here there would be a better use of taxpayers' money and this would lead to higher productivity.  I realise any Government cannot do much other than providing the right environment and climate.  We need to roll up our sleeves and do some work.  If we wish to <Col N="1392" /> compete with other countries we must have higher productivity and products as good as those of other nations.</P>
      <P>In the Finance Bill there is a gesture towards greater investment in manufacturing industry.  However, the new measures are tied up in so many knots that I do not think many people will avail of them.  The concessions are confined to manufacturing industry and to industry that has been grant-aided by the IDA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad about that.  I should like to see the concession given on a wider scale with as few regulations as possible.</P>
      <P>Considerable effort is being directed against those avoiding tax and against people who may be availing of loopholes in the law.  For instance, a regulation was introduced to block off another loophole in the law regarding bond-washing.  Certainly that matter does not affect anyone in the Beara Peninsula or in south west Cork.  I do not think what has been done will make any useful contribution towards our finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his statement the Minister said it was a matter for the Stock Exchange to adjust to the new situation.  They have done this by continuing bond-washing indirectly.  A number of financial institutions are still availing of some loopholes, and perhaps that is not a bad thing.  Perhaps a sum of £600 million or £700 million was involved, but the people investing in Government gilts and stocks were not making any great killing when they got a return of 11 per cent.  Inflation is of the same order, and if an investor is just <Col N="1393" /> keeping pace with inflation he is not making a great killing.  I do not think that exercise did any good for the economy. I am glad the Stock Exchange and the financial institutions have adjusted to the changes in conditions and that they have at least kept the money in the economy. It is much worse when, despite exchange control regulations, people invest in Switzerland and more shady places such as the Cayman Islands and the Isle of Man.  The Central Bank estimated that a sum of £1,000 million was invested in that way last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>A cosmetic exercise was carried out on the nett outflow of money but the fact is that the money was taken out of the system.  The taxation system and pressures on people have forced many of them out of the economic system and into this grey area.  In the Irish Banking Review of March 1984 it was stated that £1,536 million was taken out of the system, that is 11 per cent of GDP.  Even at a tax rate of 35p in the pound that represents a loss of revenue of roughly £500 million in one year.  The fiscal and the taxation system are putting a lot of pressure on entrepreneurs and on people who create wealth and jobs.  This Bill will not improve the situation.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy G. Birmingham, for widening the scope of the enterprise allowance scheme.  That kind of imaginative initiative is what is required.  The majority of members of local authorities, of all political parties, have been telling the Government and the Ministers concerned that there is no point in paying allowances and benefits to people who do not give any return on it.  The enterprise allowance scheme is to be lauded and the Minister concerned must be congratulated on the initiative he has taken. Instead of giving able-bodied people money for nothing, he is giving an allowance to those who set up their own business and who give some return to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the stock relief provision <Col N="1394" /> given for agriculture.  I was disappointed that the crusade of the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, on land leasing and the better utilisation of land did not get a better reception from the Department of Finance.  The Minister of State put a tremendous amount of effort into that proposal.</P>

I should like to thank the Chair for permitting me to go a little outside the terms of the Bill in the course of my contribution, and I hope the Minister will take the suggestions I have made into account when dealing with the remaining Stages of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy Walsh, and some of his Fianna Fáil colleagues, one cannot help but come to the conclusion that when one strips away all the obvious political bashing and ritualistic stance &mdash; they must do that because they are in Opposition &mdash; and gets down to the more relevant contributions one will find that all Members accept that we have to tackle our major unemployment problem.  The only way we can do that is by prudent management of our economy. Obviously, one of the areas to start with is taxation.  I commend the Minister for the efforts he is making in this regard.  It is conceded by all that reform of our taxation code is required.  It has grown more complex over the years and has been used for the purpose of introducing all types of new taxes and levies.  When it was introduced I am sure it was not envisaged that all the appendages would be attached to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> When people refer to tax reform unfortunately they automatically mean reform that will lead to them paying less tax.  If one asks people to explain what they mean by tax reform the bottom line always is that they are paying too much tax and that reform of the taxation system is necessary so that people pay less.  Of course, the reality is that a certain amount of money is needed annually to run the country.  If we reduce the tax take from taxpayers the money must be found elsewhere.  Unfortunately, tax reform cannot be synomymous with tax reduction, certainly not reduction for everybody. Obviously, for some people in the lower income group tax reform will mean tax reduction.  It should be synonymous with simplicity, equity and a good and effective system of tax collection so that we do not have the situation that tax owing cannot be collected because the system has fouled up.</P>
    <P>The moves towards tax reform in the Bill are small because of the general economic climate in which we are operating. However, I welcome the changes that have been made.  The removal of one of the tax bands is a move to get rid of some of the complexities of our taxation code. In his budget speech the Minister highlighted the fact that it was because of the complicated system of allowances, deductions and exemptions, that the tax base had been eroded.  He announced that his objective was progressively to widen that base and bring in other receipts into the taxation system to try to improve it and permit a reduction in the rates.</P>
    <P>From time to time the Minister has been slated in the media for not adopting the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.  Obviously, that is not possible until one reduces the overall tax burden.  I have no doubt that the Minister will examine the reports and try to implement, where possible, recommendations of the commission.  However, that commission have other areas to cover.  They have issued two reports and it is expected that at least two more will follow.  It is wiser and more prudent to undertake <Col N="1396" /> reform with a full assessment of the picture rather than embarking on anything in a piecemeal fashion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the taxation changes in the Bill which is towards helping the less well off.  The Minister proposes to amend section 16 of the 1983 Act so that those with an income of £96, or less, or self-employed with an income of £5,000, or less, will not have to pay the 1 per cent income levy.  At present the levy is payable on all income, from earnings and investment, but the Minister has not made any reference in the Bill to unearned income.  It is correct that we should try to alleviate the tax burden on those with low incomes.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to section 8 which follows the stated policy of the Government to assist those in society who need most help.  I welcome the decision to increase from £700 to £2,000 the deduction allowable for a person who remains at home to mind an incapacitated person. It is essential that we continue to support, where possible, people who undertake to keep relatives at home.  We should support those who cannot work and are incapacitated.  We should be moving towards reducing the number of people who are confined in homes and hospitals and who thus become a burden on the State.  We are all aware of the cost involved in maintaining sick or incapacitated people in homes or hospitals.  The more help we can give to encourage people to be cared for at home the better.</P>
    <P>I realise that under section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, a wife earning can be equally entitled to the £2,000 deduction but the language in the section in the Bill under discussion implies that only a husband, whether he is incapacitated or has a wife who is incapacitated, can get the deductible allowance.  The Minister should remove as much of this sexist language as possible in coming years and substitute the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; for husband or wife.  Everything possible should be done to ensure that the language used in our legislation is non-sexist.  My first inclination on reading the section was to ask what happens if the husband is incapacitated and the wife is the chief bread-winner. Will she be allowed to claim the <Col N="1397" /> allowance?  In certain situations she is allowed to claim but one could be forgiven for thinking that under the Bill she is not.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Minister to introduce tax exemptions or allowances to those who are prepared to invest in manufacturing companies is a further indication of the Government's encouragement of and positive moves towards employment creation.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the employment enterprise scheme, which is being extended.  This is a positive effort to get to grips with unemployment, and the Minister and the Government should be congratulated.  The important thing is to get constructive ideas on how to make these things work.  One Deputy asked how much benefit would accrue from the scheme.  This is very difficult to assess because we must calculate how many people have £25,000 to invest in a manufacturing industry.  Therefore, it is impossible to calculate to the last decimal point how broad the scheme will be. Under its terms the Minister has broadened the criteria by which people can qualify.  The important thing is that there must be an employment spin-off.</P>
    <P>The success of any of these schemes depends on liaison and co-operation between the Government and the statutory agencies.  The latter must ensure that they will streamline their operations in order to give the best chance of success to such schemes.  It is no use bringing in a scheme riddled with rules and regulations if then, if somebody tries to operate it or avail of it, we find that some other body is involved.  I appeal, therefore, to the IDA and to the planning authorities to carry out a study of these schemes so as to allow for new ideas and flexibility, particularly in regard to temporary planning permissions, so that people with £25,000 to invest can start to improve their businesses without being restricted in regard to temporary planning permissions.</P>
    <P>There can be difficulties if planning managers will not allow flexibility, will dig their heels in and be retrograde.  I hope the statutory bodies will help the Government <Col N="1398" /> in the implementation of such schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 38 is welcome.  It extends the qualifying period from 1984 to 1987.  I hope many people will take up this 50 per cent tax incentive in regard to toll bridges and roads and that they will have the co-operation of local authorities.  The extension of time will probably see many entrepreneurs and developers avail of the incentive.</P>
    <P>Section 64 has come in for much criticism. I agree with the stated policy of the Minister and the Government to try to tighten up the existing law and to close loopholes.  This section will benefit areas particularly in Dublin which have been experiencing huge increase in prices for houses and land.  It applies to areas adjacent to most large towns because of the enormous population growth.  This section will exempt private residences and gardens from capital gains tax in certain circumstances.  When a person sells a private residence it will be exempt provided the value is invested in a new residence. People who have had enough money have been buying properties in potential development areas with huge resultant profits.  That had to be closed, and the terms of this section are well worded so as to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners will not be out on top of every person who sells a house and makes a few pounds on it.</P>
    <P>I live in Malahide.  People just want to come to live there and therefore property values have increased.  Perhaps it is because of the nice quality of life there, or the quality of their public representatives. It has become an attractive area in which people want to live and it is good to know that the Revenue Commissioners will not be running out if I or one of my neighbours wants to sell a house, because it will not have anything to do with development potential.  In the past five or six years in County Dublin huge sums of money were made on residential properties which at the beginning nobody realised would be of great value but with the spread of the city the value of property in towns and villages has doubled, trebled and quadrupled.</P>
    <P>I have not been able to find anything <Col N="1399" /> in the Bill referring to local authority CPOs.  The Minister might be able to clarify this.  If a local authority seek to acquire a property for road widening, etc., there is not much point in putting a tax on the extra price somebody might get for it because the person who owns the property might demand more from the local authority because of that tax.  I do not know what the Minister's views are in regard to this, and I do not know whether I have missed reference to it in the Bill.  As a local authority member I do not want to see CPO settlements going up proportionately to allow for this tax. That would bring us back to square one because ultimately the State, through the local authority, would be paying the owner for the tax.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong of me to conclude without referring to a new section in the Bill.  I have three young children and two of them, of average build, are more than 11 years of age.  Obviously like everybody else I will be caught for the 8 per cent VAT on clothes.  There is a general perception out there as opposed to in here that when these changes come about everybody in here is exempt from them and we have no understanding of what it is like to go out and pay for children's clothes.  It is thought that when we go into our local shops we buy everything without paying VAT.  We have to pay VAT too, as does the Minister, because his children are of average build and over 11 years of age.  We heard the Taoiseach talking about buying presents for his grandchildren.</P>
    <P>We know this tax will have an effect on people's pockets.  People on smaller incomes usually buy their children's clothes in the bigger stores where they are reasonably priced.  Many articles are in the price range of £5.99 and £6.99.  On a garment priced £6.99 the increase will be approximately 56p, bringing the price of the garment to £7.55, not a very large sum in this day and age.  The increases in the children's allowances and personal tax allowances will compensate for this extra charge.  The people who will contribute to the £26 million the Minister expects from this tax in a full year are <Col N="1400" /> those who have more money to spend on clothes for themselves and their children. This 8 per cent tax will not materially damage the quality of life and the spending power of people on smaller incomes because the percentage of their income they spend on clothes is a lot lower than that spent by those with bigger incomes. In my view this is not a penal tax.  When I buy clothes after 1 May I, like everybody else, will find an increase in the prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister is trying to keep with his stated policy to broaden the basis of our taxation code.  Our aim should be to have a more equitable VAT rate, because at present some articles are exempt while others are subject to the 35 per cent rate. Despite the cries of horror from the Opposition when this tax was introduced, if they sat down and did their sums they would realise it will not be as penal as they expect.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what is believed outside, Ministers and TDs listen to representative groups.  I welcome the Minister's ability to take cognisance of what the representatives of the clothing industry said.  He has moved forward until 1 September the payment of VAT at point of entry for materials for clothes.  This was a direct recognition of the case made by the clothing industry.  The Minister was right to grant this concession, and he should be commended for it.</P>

      <P>As a background to the Finance Bill it will be recalled that not so long ago the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance indicated that in pursuance of financial rectitude the Government would have to cut a further £500 million of public expenditure.  This was obviously flying a kite, because during subsequent discussions and interviews this was gradually watered down and the Minister's budget was rightly described as a non-event. It did nothing for employment, the economy or the hard pressed taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public spending cuts have been very niggling, disturbing and discriminatory in many areas.  We had to listen to the tedious commentary and the old chestnut about capital taxation, the old promises <Col N="1401" /> of tax simplicity and equity as well as the old cliches of economic planning and so on.  We have all heard this many times before, and the public cannot be blamed for adopting what would appear to be a very cynical attitude towards this Government and to some extent towards politicians in general.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill and the budget was not a very imaginative exercise.  It will do nothing to help our seriously depressed economic circumstances.  It will do nothing for employment, as has been proved. Unemployment figures are rising all the time, and I am genuinely appalled that the Minister has not seen fit to promote a more favourable climate for the creation of jobs.  What we are witnessing is the opposite: a further stepping stone exercise for the Coalition parties to stay together for their own personal and probably selfish reasons.</P>
    <P>I have said that very little consideration was given to the economy, to investment and to the unemployed.  Worst of all, the standard of living of the weaker sections of our community was eroded even more. During 1983 everybody had to take a major cut in their living standards.  This happened during a time of recession, and I accept that sacrifices will have to be made.  Most people will be prepared and happy to make sacrifices provided they are in a position to do so and if, by doing so, they are helping the economy and contributing towards a general recovery from the recession.  Unfortunately the severe cuts in 1983, and these additional cuts in 1984, did not and will not contribute to growth for improvement and those sacrifices will be seen to have been in vain.</P>
    <P>Living standards have been dropping for some time.  The Taoiseach, who has always put himself forward as being the champion of the poorer sections, has tried to tell us that the budget would maintain the standard of living of the socially deprived and the weaker sections of our community.  Those expressions are rather hollow, particularly when one considers that the introduction of the new 8 per cent tax on clothing will seriously affect the weaker sections.</P>
    <P>The Minister has emphasised that <Col N="1402" /> people buying expensive clothes, such as minks and furs, will be able to afford the additional taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as part of the overall exercise, and I agree with that, because certain sections of the community can pay additional taxation, but unfortunately this new tax will affect everybody, including the weaker sections of the community.  This is something with which I find fault, and I am sure many members of the Fine Gael Party would not agree with the imposition of this tax. The method of imposing the tax is quite ridiculous and has been seen as a joke. There were many cartoons depicting children of different sizes aged ten or 11. This imposition will affect many younger children who have matured and grown more than others.  The Minister has accepted that.  The regulations have been deferred until 1 September.  Surely the Minister must have learned of the terrible problems caused on a previous occasion by the imposition of VAT at point of entry.  The clothing industry has been at its most vulnerable in recent years, as shown by the fact that this country is importing millions of pounds worth of clothing each year.  The Minister has chosen to ignore representations made by the clothing industry.  He states in his speech that these difficulties can be avoided without significant loss of revenue. He indicated in his budget speech that VAT on children's clothing would apply to ten-year-olds.  Obviously the Minister has not learned from this controversy regarding the age and size of children.  There is no fair way in which VAT can be imposed on clothing in the present climate, and the Minister should accept this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ours is a deeply depressed economy, <Col N="1403" /> and further draconian taxation measures will not solve our problems.  They will have the opposite effect and bring down more and more businesses, with the resultant loss of thousands of jobs, which the country cannot afford.  VAT rates generally are far too high for any company to be in a position to meet the commitment in regard to payment at point of entry.  As any business firm will know, from the date of importation it can take six or nine months to sell goods and receive payment.  It is only when a trader is paid for his goods that the sale becomes realistic.  At that stage the business is already out of pocket for VAT during that period, and if the trader has been lucky enough to make arrangements with his bank the additional interest rates will have cost the company heavily.  This must be at the cost of jobs in that company.</P>
    <P>We are probably one of the most heavily taxed communities in Europe in regard to VAT.  One has only to look at the prices of equivalent products in other countries which have higher standards of living and much high incomes.  One would expect that the price of equivalent goods should also be higher, but this is not the case.  The opposite is true.  Some types of business are more heavily taxed than others.  One such is the motor trade, which has been crippled by taxation during the past few years.  Paris is a city which has always had a reputation for high prices.  yet one can purchase a car there for 50 per cent of the price payable here.  The same differential applies to other mechanical goods, electrical goods and foodstuffs.  Clothing is an area where we were a little cheaper, but in this Finance Bill the Minister shows a determination to eliminate that slight advantage.</P>
    <P>The latest unemployment figure is in the region of 220,000 but the true figure is probably nearer to 250,000 because many unemployed young people have not bothered to register.  Everyone will concede that unemployment is our biggest single problem, but this Government would appear not to have the will or to be totally unable to face up to this reality and propose any solution to lessen the impact of unemployment.  Unemployment <Col N="1404" /> must, without further delay, be declared a priority before the situation gets completely out of hand.  The effects of the budget and the Finance Bill would appear to indicate that the Minister is totally unaware of the seriousness of the situation.</P>
    <P>The budget increases in excise duties on items such as tobacco and the increase in the high levels of PRSI are viewed as a tax on labour.  The retention of advance corporation tax and the levies on banks and insurance companies will also disappoint industrialists and will not create the environment necessary for investment, which in turn creates jobs.  The volume of cigarette sales has been falling during the past few years.  We cannot blame the Minister for this, but nevertheless cigarette manufacturers have recently announced redundancies and the start of the falling off of general employment in that sector.  The company in question have been long established in Ireland and employ over 800 people in their tobacco division, but it is understood that there will be at least a 30 per cent lay off before the end of the year.  That is a serious situation which is indicative of the fact that we have reached the maximum in regard to certain types of taxation.  The Minister must consider this position.</P>
    <P>The banks have expressed great disappointment with the retention of the levy on their profits.  Many people would agree that some form of taxation should be imposed on banks, but I would remind the House that this is a levy on the public and not on the banks as such.  This has been shown very forcibly during the past year with the huge increases in bank charges and the introduction of charges for ancillary services which in the past had always been extended as part of the overall service.  There was a time when the public had a choice as to whether they would bank or not, but that choice no longer exists in this modern technological age.  Most payments are made to employees by way of cheques or bankers' orders. Furthermore, in the interests of security it is a matter of necessity for a member of the public to have a current account at the local bank.</P>
    <P>The bank levy is an example of another <Col N="1405" /> broken promise on the part of the Minister for Finance, because he said last year that the levy would be phased out over the next few years.  This gave rise to expectations that the phasing out would commence in 1984.  I would also condemn very strongly the proposed increase in duty in cheques from 5p to 7p and on credit cards from £5 to £10.  These increases hit the ordinary worker very severely, and it is now reckoned that, taking all bank charges and duties into account, the average person is paying almost 25 pence for every cheque written. That is a penal tax which has reached ridiculous proportions.  It is a typical example of the hidden indirect taxation which has been imposed by the Government in the past two budgets, and it bites very deeply into the pocket of the ordinary worker and taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Each year the old reliables are easy meat for every Minister for Finance, and this year was no exception.</P>
    <P>As I recall, in his budget statement the Minister agreed that the point had been reached so far as taxation on the licensed trade was concerned where smuggling was encouraged and also legitimate imports by travellers.  Indeed, for some weeks prior to last Christmas, shoppers from the Republic were spending an average of £1 million a day in the Six Counties.  The main attraction for most shoppers going north was the low price of spirits, beer, tobacco, toys and, of course, certain electrical items.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by thanking Members on all sides of the House who contributed to this debate over the past few days.  I should also like to thank the many Deputies on this and the other side of the House who did not have an opportunity to contribute to the debate because our time was limited.  We conduct our business with as much expedition as we can.  Deputies spoke to me on a number of occasions between budget day and today about a number of the matters I referred to in my budget statement and various aspects of the Finance Bill.  In today's climate, it is only right that I <Col N="1407" /> should call to the attention not only of the House but of the general public also that Deputies do not do all their work speaking in the Chamber.  A great deal more goes on behind the scenes.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go into detail on the various sections of the Bill which have been referred to by speakers during the course of this debate.  That is more appropriate to Committee Stage.  In approaching Committee Stage on this Bill I will have an open mind in relation to amendments which may be put forward from whatever source which are compatible with the general direction of the Bill and the overall budgetary objectives which I set out in my budget statement and which this Bill is intended to bring into effect.</P>
      <P>The inevitable trend or tendency in a debate such as the one we have had is for Deputies in Opposition to make a long series of suggestions for various tax incentives and reliefs and for reductions in the overall tax burden.  When they put forward suggestions of that kind, Deputies on the other side of the House can be assured that they will find a very harmonious chord in myself.  It is probably a little gratuitous for me to say it, but I will venture to say that there is no more enthusiastic tax cutter in the House than myself.</P>
      <P>It is not enough to say we will reduce the burden of taxation and reduce various taxes.  We have to cut the rest of our cloth according to our measure, even for people of my own length.  It is not very constructive or helpful to list a series of tax incentives or reductions which one wants to bring into effect without looking at the other side of the equation and what the consequences of a reduction in revenue would be on the way the State provides the services we require it to provide and the degree to which it can provide, the various services which we have all come to take too much for granted, perhaps, as part of the economic background to our lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made during the course of the debate, particularly by Deputy O'Kennedy and by one or two other Members of the Opposition, to the <Col N="1408" /> Exchequer figures for the first quarter which were issued very recently.  In a press statement accompanying the publication of those figures, I said that, broadly speaking, the situation is in line with our expectations and in line with our objectives as set out in the budget.  I can find no reason whatsoever for changing that position.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy believes he has discovered a shortfall of some £80 million on the revenue side.  He was somewhat carried away by an interpretation put on the figures by one commentator.  Incidentally, I am very glad to hear that economic commentators and economic experts seem to be coming back into fashion on the other side of the House.  I remember that between July 1981 and February 1982 one of the worst epithets which Members on that side of the House could throw at one was &ldquo;economist&rdquo; or &ldquo;academic&rdquo;.  In October 1982 they suddenly found they liked them because a number of authorities were brought forward to support their own &ldquo;The Way Forward&rdquo; or the great leap sideways as I often like to refer to it.  Now the economists are enjoying a resurgence of popularity on that side of the House.  That is good news.  I caution them against being carried away by the particular interpretation put on figures by people who, with the best will in the world, have not got the full information.  That is particularly the case in relation to the first quarter Exchequer returns.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy drew my attention to the fact that in our budget figures there is a target for a 17 per cent increase in income tax receipts this year.  He compared that with the actual increase in income tax receipts of 15½ per cent in the first quarter.  He detected in the difference between those two figures a reason for saying receipts for the whole year would be very substantially behind the target.  That is not the case.</P>
    <P>The increase we had during the first quarter is in line with my expectations as to the trend in receipts from income tax during that period.  The Deputy should bear in mind the fact that there are some increases in income tax revenue which will accrue over this year, but which will <Col N="1409" /> not come in until the last quarter of the year.  One example is the increase in revenue resulting from the change in the payment dates for building societies. There were some once off receipts of income tax in the first quarter of 1983 from back money paid to public servants which did not arise this year.  The increase of 15½ per cent in income tax revenue achieved during the first quarter was a little higher, although not significantly higher, than the increase which I had expected over that period.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy also mentioned VAT receipts.  As I told him during the course of his remarks, his record in predicting VAT revenue is not the best.  I am very much afraid that he is embarking on the same kind of mistaken course this year as he did last year.  He suggested we should have had an increase of 33 per cent in the first quarter of this year.  I had expected an increase of some 16 per cent in VAT receipts during the first quarter of the year and we have, in fact, achieved a 21 per cent increase.  There again, we are broadly on target.  Other factors such as the effect of the introduction in September 1982 of VAT at point of entry by Deputy MacSharry when Minister for Finance affected the pattern of receipts over the first quarter of last year.</P>
    <P>Excise duties are below my expectations, there is no doubt about that.  However, it is not to anything like the extent suggested by Deputy O'Kennedy.  To base his expectations on the simple operation of inflation, use that as the key factor in his predictions on the pattern of receipts is, of course, to ignore the fact that most excise duties are specific duties rather than <i>ad valorem</i> duties and will vary quite independently of the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>The overall situation in relation to the Exchequer position as at the end of the first quarter is that we are broadly on target.  There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever at this point of the year that we shall have the kind of difficulties which Deputy O'Kennedy was predicting. I have said that it is very early in the year to be predicting these things, and that is something which we should bear in mind.  The next point I wish to make <Col N="1410" /> is that the pattern and levels of receipts for the first quarter of this year are broadly in line with what I had expected.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy and other Members of the Opposition spent quite some time talking about the movement in the total borrowing requirement and the current budget deficit.  Deputy O'Kennedy, in particular, attempted to demonstrate that I was presenting an increase as a reduction or <i>vice versa</i>&mdash; I am not convinced that he knew exactly what point he wished to make.  The fact is that our intention this year was to continue with the process of reducing both the overall borrowing requirement and the current deficit as a percentage of GNP.  We have done that.  That is the situation which we have projected.  To be specific, we are projecting a reduction in the current budget deficit from 8¼ per cent of GNP to 7½ per cent during the course of this year and a reduction in the total borrowing requirement from 14 per cent of GNP in 1983 to 12¾ per cent in 1984.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy and a number of his colleagues appeared at times to be objecting to the fact that we were not bringing about an even faster reduction in the level of the current deficit and of the total borrowing requirement.  I think that I made it very clear in my budget statement what our objective was and why this year we adopted the particular budgetary stance which we did.  Just to put it again on the record, we decided that the circumstances of this year were such that if we could avoid it we would be better to avoid a substantial deflationary impact from budgetary policy.  We wanted to be sure that our budgetary stance did not interfere with our ability, as a community and as a economy, to benefit from the emerging recovery at world level.  That was a deliberate policy choice.  I am quite convinced that it is the right policy choice, and that is the choice which has given rise to the budget which I presented and to the measures in this Bill here today.</P>
    <P>If Deputy O'Kennedy or indeed any of his colleagues are worried about the level of the current budget deficit or of the borrowing requirement, I should like to hear from them in some detail what <Col N="1411" /> alternative choice they would propose. Deputy O'Kennedy appears to be coming fairly near to proposing that we should aim for a lower budget deficit or a lower borrowing requirement.  How are we to do that?  Deputy O'Kennedy and his colleagues continue rather vaguely about more selectivity in public expenditure, but they will never say what precisely they have in mind in this respect.  They will never say what the options are and where they could put the priorities.  There has been only one case &mdash; and I listened very closely to this debate &mdash; where Deputy O'Kennedy has made anything like a concrete suggestion as to an area where expenditure should be reduced and he has made quite a meal of this on a few occasions.  He thinks that we are spending too much this year on consultancy services.  Now, the total allocation through all the Votes this year, for consultancy services is £4.2 million.  That is an increase of £1 million on the allocation for 1983.  A quarter of the total increase is for studies relating to computerisation in order to improve the efficiency of the public service.  In other cases, expenditure is for studies and consultancy services in relation to a number of matters which are central to major policy development in a number of key Departments. If that is the type of suggestion which the Opposition can come up with to redress what they regard now as being a difficult situation in the public finances but which they did not regard as anything like so serious when they were in office, I am bound to say that their imagination could be stretched a good deal further than is happening at the moment.</P>
    <P>How are the Deputies in the Opposition able to square their apparent concern over the level of the budget deficit and of the Exchequer borrowing requirement first of all with their own general criticisms of budgetary policy this year? How can they square their suggestion that we should have a lower deficit and a lower borrowing requirement with the fact that the only suggestion coming from them in recent weeks in terms of economic policy is one designed to spend another £200 million of taxpayers' <Col N="1412" /> money?  I cannot see what logic or cohesion there is in that combination of policies, nor can I see how it could in any way be regarded as consistent with the points they have been making over the last few days in relation to the level of taxation or, indeed, the rates of taxation.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the sections of the Bill dealing with the long-term risk capital scheme.  There are many queries about this.  I would make the following points because they were raised by Deputies who, I think, are concerned to make sure that this scheme does achieve its aims.  There is a general feeling in the House that this is a worthwhile scheme.  Again in that respect, I am open to amendments which will make the scheme achieve the objectives we have set out for it.</P>
    <P>Quoted companies are excluded from the scheme simply because they already have a satisfactory track record.  We want as far as we can, to get extra activity generated by this scheme.  I would be against extending the scheme to sectors of the economy where the risk level is not high.  We have deliberately designed this scheme to attract investment funds into the high risk areas, which is where we are going to get a multiplier effect in terms of activity and jobs.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies appear to think that things are excluded from the scheme which are actually specifically included. As I said a few days ago, part of the reason for the length of that part of the Bill and for its apparent complexity is that I want to make sure that the scheme will do what it is intended to do &mdash; that is to get extra activity going, in so far as that is possible.  Product development, research and development and information technology are included there.  The scheme will also apply to a number of services covered by the activities of the IDA at the moment.  These are listed in the Industrial Development (2) Act of 1981.  It is a great pity &mdash; I know other Deputies feel the same way &mdash; that we do not have a little more time for this.</P>
    <P>The debate we have had has shown above all that it is totally wrong and unproductive to discuss taxation in isolation. It is wrong for Members of this <Col N="1413" /> House to speak about tax rates only if, on the other side of the coin, we are not prepared to look at what our proposals on taxation have to do with the level of expenditure.  Of course we would all like to have less taxation and more services. The two cannot go together, and the fact that they do not go together is one of the reasons we are in the kind of difficulty that makes it so important this year to get the balance of budgetary policy right. That is reflected in this Bill, which I commend to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation is already in operation here dealing with <Col N="1418" /> the question of noise, as is the case in a number of EEC countries.  In Ireland the legislation is the Safety in Industry Act which forbids the exposure of a person to a sound pressure level of such intensity and duration as is likely to cause harm. If the sound pressure level exceeds 90 decibels the exposure time must be reduced or hearing protectors must be provided and worn.  The regulations to deal with the matter are the Factories (Noise) Regulations, 1975, S.I. No. 235 of 1975.</P>

      <P>How many times have the Minister of State, his senior Minister or his predecessor in the last year and a half made public statements on the importance of safety in industry? The reason I ask that is that with regard to the noise we are talking about here, the use of ear muffs or ear protectors has increased, I am glad to say.  It is more widespread by far than it was, but I believe it can be promoted still further and an obligation is on the Minister or the Minister of State to promote the extension of the use of ear protectors.  I have not seen any great publicity given to the activity of either Minister in this area. Perhaps the Minister of State can enlighten me.</P>

I have also taken the opportunity of putting my views in a number of articles through the publications of the National Industrial Safety Organisation.  In the near future I will be attending their annual quiz, which is one <Col N="1419" /> of the major events of their calendar, and I will avail of the suggestion put forward by Deputy Fitzgerald to refer specifically to the noise question, which I think is worth while.</P>

      <P>In compiling the list of some 1,000 substances that I have referred to regard will be had to a number of international codes, in particular to the Hazchem code and the ADR Agreement, in other words the European agreement concerning international carriage of dangerous goods by road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy for the Minister <Col N="1422" /> to state the purpose of designating a number of other substances.  The whole controls at present are fragmented, in effective and inefficient.  The present controls on substances which are designated are not being enforced.  That has been acknowledged by the commission who reported recently.  What action does the Minister propose to take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I can repeat much more often that if I succeed in my objective of increasing the number of substances that are controlled from the present level of 25 to 1,000 this side of the summer recess, that seems to me to be very substantial progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that even the 25 substances are dangerous in varying degrees? In other words, some are more dangerous than others and because of that there is no reason why the Minister must just wait until the summer recess to name 1,000. He can name 25 if they are ready to be named, he can name 50,200 or whatever the figure might be.  He should not hesitate or waste any time in supporting what my colleague has asked him.  How many cases have been brought under the Dangerous Substances Act in respect of the substances designated?  Have any cases been brought because of illegal or incorrect handling of those substances?</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the <Col N="1423" /> report of the commission which he forwarded to me yesterday, but is he aware of the very serious charge being made that the dangerous substances regulations are not being enforced?  Has he any plan for ensuring that the present regulations, apart from the many others, will be enforced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated in answer to an earlier question that the priority the Government afford in this area can be seen in the fact that, exceptionally, we have departed from our normal policy of recruitment in the public service in order to increase the number of posts in the industrial inspectorate.  In pressing for action at this stage, Deputy Daly might be reminded that in February 1982, during the last weeks in office of the then Minister for Labour, Deputy Kavanagh, a number of additional posts were sanctioned.  These were, one of deputy chief inspector grade, two of grade I inspector, three of grade 2 inspector and six of grade 3 inspector.  Those posts remained unfilled for some months and it was only with the return to office of Deputy Kavanagh as Minister for Labour that they were sanctioned.  That is an indication of the priority this Government afford to the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 12, inclusive, together.  The AnCO Training Centre in Gweedore is a permanent training centre and it is AnCO policy to retain it as such. With the completion of the new AnCO Training Centre in Letterkenny, the Gweedore centre will now cater exclusively for all Gaeltacht areas on a national basis and for people from non-Gaeltacht areas who express a preference to take courses through the medium of Irish.</P>
      <P>The catchment area of the Gweedore Training Centre is not being extended. However, AnCO are confident that the 64 places to be provided at the centre will be filled given the range of courses they propose to provide there.  AnCO, in co-operation with Údarás na Gaeltachta, have reorganised their provision of courses at Gweedore to meet the needs of Gaeltacht industry.  AnCO will keep these needs under constant review and the range of courses at the centre will be revised according to need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" /> AnCO and Údarás na Gaeltachta have a very close and good working relationship and their officers meet regularly to discuss all matters in relation to training needs including updating of skills in Gaeltacht areas.  For example, the Research and Planning Division of AnCO conducted a survey of Gaeltacht training needs during the summer months in 1983. The results of the survey were subsequently discussed with Údarás personnel.</P>
    <P>With regard to ascertaining the needs of Gaeltacht industry, AnCO keep in regular contact with employers in relation to employment and job prospects for their trainees.  Údarás na Gaeltachta are also very active in this area.</P>
    <P>AnCO do not propose to take any special measures to entice trainees to the Gweedore centre.  The standard AnCO training and accommodation expenses apply to trainees attending the AnCO Gweedore Training Centre.  However, Údarás will pay travel allowances to trainees from distant Gaeltacht areas who have to travel to Gweedore for training.</P>
    <P>Currently there are seven first-year apprentices from Gaeltacht areas in the country attending AnCO training centres other than the Gweedore centre, on courses which are available at the Gweedore centre.  In addition, there are seven trainees on community youth training projects from Gaeltacht areas in the country who are attached to another AnCO training centre.</P>
    <P>I am circulating in the Official Report a table showing the courses that are available at Gweedore centre now that the new Letterkenny centre is operational.</P>
    <P>With regard to community youth training projects, AnCO will continue to give the same priority attention to Gaeltacht areas.  I am circulating also in the Official Report a list of the Community Youth Training Projects which have been completed to date in Gaeltacht areas in County Donegal; projects which are on-going at the moment and projects which have been approved but have not yet commenced in those areas.</P>

      <P>I have indicated clearly the purpose AnCO envisage for the Gweedore centre: that it will return to its traditional role as the training centre for the Gaeltacht in Donegal as well as nationally.

I cannot remember exactly how many people I spoke to but I assure Deputy Gallagher that there were a number of trainees there from the Kerry Gaeltacht and from the Connemara Gaeltacht, to name but two.</P>

      <P>My visit to Gweedore was part of a wider vist to Donegal where I attended a number of functions and visited a number of institutions involved in the general manpower area and the general area of education and training.  With regard to the Gweedore centre, the reason Deputy McGinley was with me was because he has taken a constant interest in the affairs of Gweedore. He has been with my office on an almost daily basis since I took office and I know has been an equally constant visitor to the offices of the Minister for Labour and his predecessor, Deputy Liam Kavanagh. In those circumstances Deputy McGinley was anxious that I visit Gweedore which is situated in his home parish.</P>

If it was in the interests of the training of young people who are there &mdash; and, <Col N="1434" /> hopefully, will continue to be there &mdash; from all the Gaeltacht areas of the country would the Minister of State not agree with me that it is highly dangerous and divisory for him to visit a centre accompanied only by a Fine Gael TD when Deputy Pat Gallagher has in my experience been working in the interests of that centre long before he was an elected as a Member of this House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">

      <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Gallagher has been working in the interests of the centre in Gweedore, just as I have no doubt that the remaining Member for the constituency, Deputy Cathal Coughlan, has been.  I know that Deputy McGinley has been to see me, as I said, on an almost constant basis putting to me certain matters relating to the AnCO training centre.

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will make a statement on any Government proposals for the co-ordination of the agencies involved in youth employment and training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Youth Employment Agency was established in March 1982 and has among its principal objectives the co-ordination and integration of schemes for the training and employment of young persons.  Since this Government took office they have been able to help the agency come to grips with some of the problems which have constrained it in achieving its objectives.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there has been some criticism of the lack of co-ordination of the activities of the various manpower agencies, including a perceived lack of co-ordination between certain bodies in the training and education field.  I accept generally that there are serious problems both in regard to the definition of a coherent policy for manpower development, youth employment and training, as well as in bringing about a co-ordinated approach by the various State agencies involved.</P>
      <P>Against this background, in my role as Minister of State at the Departments of Education and Labour, I have been given special responsibility for co-ordination of education and training and am currently working in the discharge of this brief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State not agree that there is a far greater need now for co-ordination of youth schemes operated and organised by the various agencies than there was when the Youth Employment Agency was first established?  Will he not agree that one of the roles envisaged for that agency at that time was the co-ordination of these youth schemes but that for some reason the overlap now has become far more obvious than it was?  Will the Minister agree that there is grave public disquiet and concern at the failure of the agency to successfully handle that co-ordination?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the establishment of the agency and the introduction of the levy, which took place alongside it, the number of participants in the schemes has multiplied dramatically to such an extent that the average level of participation now is perhaps three times what it was prior to the introduction of the levy.  In those circumstances, simply because there are more people participating, the need for co-ordination is all the greater.  The fact that I was assigned to two Departments and asked to carry out this task of achieving co-ordination indicates that the Government are concerned to do that.  I can tell the Deputy that I have been working very actively indeed in discharge of that.  I have had the opportunity of hearing the views of a very wide number of bodies involved in the manpower, education and training areas, both in writing and in an exhaustive and exhausting series of meetings with the bodies involved.  As a result of those consultations I hope to be in a position shortly to put forward some specific proposals to improve the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Something like 50,000 young people participated last year in programmes funded by the levy for youth employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of those participants would have been on programmes of short term duration, either of the work experience variety of short-term employment or training.  The agency have also been responsible for the direct creation of 750 jobs and that does not take account of the number of jobs indirectly created.  Yesterday I was looking at a paper dealing with Deputy Gene Fitzgerald's city where a large number of short-term survey programmes have <Col N="1437" /> been in operation for some time, mainly sponsored by Ógra Chorcaigh, the youth organisation care.  I was happy to see that there has been a spin-off in terms of full-time employment but that sort of development would not be included in general statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>These schemes are welcome, important and excellent in their own right.  Those who organise them should be commended and they deserve the support of the Youth Employment Agency.  However, I asked the Minister to specify where the 750 jobs are and if that is the total number of jobs which have been created since the agency were set up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure is not the total number because it does not take account of permanent jobs which were a spin-off as a result of temporary employment schemes organised by Ógra Chorcaigh. As to the location of those jobs, my recollection is that on a previous occasion that information was circulated with the Official Report in response to a question from Deputy Fitzgerald.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

      <P>I was not in office at the time and perhaps the Deputy's questions should be more appropriately addressed to those who held office then. I have a recollection, as a new Deputy, that the then Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, brought an empty file into the House which referred to a project that had been selected by Deputy Tunney when he was Minister of State. However, I do not know what criteria he applied at the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to make a statement on allegations of RUC activities in this State.  The British Government were formally told last Friday, following press reports of the trial of Constable Robinson in Belfast for the murder of Séamus Grew on 12 December 1982, in Armagh, that any action in our jurisdiction by security forces from any other State was unacceptable to our Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the announcement of the verdict, the allegation of a &lsquo;cover-up&rsquo; was raised with the British Ambassador at a meeting at which other aspects of the matter were also raised.  The Ambassador was also informed of the seriousness with which the Government viewed the allegations.  The Ambassador said that the allegations of a &lsquo;cover-up&rsquo; were being fully investigated by his authorities and the result of these investigations would be conveyed to us as soon as possible.  He was informed that we required immediate clarification of this matter.  In view of the seriousness of the allegations for our <Col N="1454" /> sovereignty, I have arranged in the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is on an official visit to the Holy See, to see the British Ambassador myself later today.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say anything further on the matter at this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House believe that the sworn evidence given by Constable Robinson, which was not contested by the State, at his trial in Belfast raises very serious questions both about Border security and about the whole administration of justice in Northern Ireland.  These questions must be taken up by the Government.</P>
      <P>This case has caused outrage in the Nationalist community in the North, not only in relation to the verdict, but on account of some of the evidence that was given and not contradicted.  Nationalist politicians whose complete dedication to constitutional politics is unassailable, such as Séamus Mallon, Paschal O'Hare, and Senator Bríd Rogers, have publicly expressed their indignation and their complete loss of faith in the administration of justice in the courts in Northern Ireland.  The SDLP's Deputy Leader has said that the court decision was a deadly blow to the hope that justice would ever be fairly administered in Northern Ireland.  I quote, &ldquo;The process of law and justice has again been devalued in a manner which will have a devastating effect within the community&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The killings of Séamus Grew and Roderick Carroll took place on the night of 12 December 1982 and caused an outcry at the time.  Many people contended that a &ldquo;shoot to kill&rdquo; policy had been adopted by the Northern security forces.  That has effectively been confirmed by defence counsel for Constable Robinson when he stated &ldquo;that Robinson had been trained by his employers to react in only one way to a situation in which he expected to encounter armed or dangerous criminals namely, by opening fire&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Some quotations from what was said at that time will be of some relevance.  <i>The Irish Times</i> reported on 14 December &mdash; and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> The existence of special RUC undercover squads, trained to carry out surveillance and the kind of anti-terrorist operation that led to the shooting dead of two unarmed INLA men in Armagh on Sunday night, has been confirmed to <i>The Irish Times</i> by British Government sources....</P>
    <P>From what we now know from Constable Robinson's evidence, the special undercover squad was operating that night south of the Border without, of course, the knowledge or approval of the Irish Government at that time.  Such an incursion represents a gross violation and infringement of our territorial sovereignty and integrity.  It will be recalled that this event took place shortly after an election campaign in which the present Taoiseach had put forward a proposal to allow the RUC to come south of the Border.  Deputies will, I am sure, ponder on the irony that our High Court and Supreme Court have deliberated at length over the legalities of extradition in a number of cases when it now appears that RUC snatch squads operate their own extradition arrangements.</P>
    <P>There are unconfirmed allegations that this is by no means the first time this has occurred.  I received correspondence recently regarding the alleged capture of a person, currently serving a long sentence in The Maze, by SAS men in County Louth in 1976.  Is there any reason to believe the practice has stopped?</P>
    <P>The Government have a duty to seek an immediate public explanation and clarification from the British authorities. If the sworn statement of Constable Robinson is true, a public repudiation of the misdeeds he described should be sought, together with a categorical assurance that such incidents will not occur again in the future.  If satisfactory explanations are not forthcoming from the British Government, then a radical review of the current arrangements will have to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House are opposed to violence and terrorism from any quarter. However, the Government will have to impress on the British Government more <Col N="1456" /> forcibly than they have done up to now, that many of the actions of the authorities and the whole judicial system in Northern Ireland are totally counterproductive from every point of view.  Indeed, they need only read this morning's <i>Guardian</i> editorial entitled &ldquo;Lies that were made to order&rdquo;, which comments on &ldquo;the depressing and demoralising nature of the British role in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The recent court verdict can only imply that there is official approval of the operations of undercover assassination squads, which are apparently authorised to cross the Border.  Cover-up stories were concocted to justify their actions, yet even when these stories are exposed as fabricated, these actions are still justified regardless.  In an extraordinary break with precedent the North's Police Authority paid for the high-powered defence of the accused.  It was officially stated that &ldquo;the costs of defence are paid for with the approval of the Secretary of State and the Treasury in London where it appears the officer acted in good faith in the execution of his duty&rdquo;.  This is clear evidence of political pressure on the court.  Today an officer of the UDR is charged with murder after months of inexplicable delay, presumably after a political decision to try to appease public opinion.</P>
    <P>The Northern courts are prepared to try to convict dozens of prisoners in a single trial on the dubious evidence of a single paid informer.  Accused persons have often been subjected to torture and ill-treatment.  Plastic bullets are fired and frequently kill children.</P>
    <P>It is clear that large areas of the security system and the administration of justice in Northern Ireland are corrupt.  In that they mirror the state of Northern Ireland itself.  This is further proof if any were needed that Northern Ireland as a political entity has failed, since it is unable to carry out properly the most elementary function of any civilised state, the fair and imparitial administration of justice. The drift to political extremism is the direct consequence of the security methods and the failure to seek political progress by this British Government and predecessors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> Many people are gravely concerned that no action of our Government should be seen to condone the abuses of the Northern judicial or security system.  We cannot tolerate the operation of any undercover British military or police agents in this part of the country.  The whole question must now be raised of the morality of handing persons over to a system of justice administration in which we have no confidence when we have the means to try them here for whatever crimes of which they may have been accused.  I would ask the Taoiseach to see that these points are made forcibly to the British Government and to report back to this House as soon as he receives their response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall confine myself to the contents of the Taoiseach's statement in regard to the alleged RUC incursions across the Border.  It is the most serious incident of this nature that has occurred.  Previous incidents involving army personnel were said to be either unauthorised, follow-up operations, mistakes or a question of the personnel losing their way but in this case the RUC were responsible.  It appears to have been a planned and pre-authorised operation and that makes it unique.  That is the police force that is in close co-operation with the Garda Síochána in Border security and, presumably, they were not made aware of the RUC plans or activities.</P>
      <P>That surely puts the whole question of co-operation in jeopardy and the damage done can only help the Provos or the groups who want to ferment bitterness and hatred in Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach must get the firmest possible guarantee &mdash; he has told the House that he will be seeking such a guarantee &mdash; that no such violation of sovereignty will take place again.  To ensure such a guarantee I should like to ask the Taoiseach to inform the Ambassador that future co-operation on Border security will be conditional on such a guarantee being received by the Ambassador from the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the honour, as Chairman, to introduce the Committee's First Report entitled Neighbourhood Watch as a Scheme for Community Involvement in Policing.  I hope this debate will demonstrate a willingness on the part of this House to come to terms with the problem of crime and that there will be a positive response from the Minister to the committee's recommendations.</P>
      <P>While the committee was set up in July 1983 it was not until December that its own full-time clerk and typist were appointed.  The committee consider it essential, if they are to make any real inroad on the areas covered by their orders of reference, that they be in a position to employ consultants and we have decided to have our Orders of Reference amended to enable us to do so. We hope we will get co-operation in that respect.</P>
      <P>At our initial meeting the members considered how best to tackle the very wide range of items which could be considered under our Orders of Reference and which deal with such aspects of:</P>
      <P>(a)  the administration of justice,</P>
      <P>(b)  the implementation of the criminal law, and</P>
      <P>(c)  existing legislation</P>
      <P>as affect the personal safety and security of persons in their homes, on the streets and in public places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members considered the alarming increase in crime over the past number of years which, coupled with a falling detection rate, has created a general concern on the part of all citizens of a drift towards a general state of lawlessness.  It was agreed that the Garda alone could not tackle this problem with any real prospect of success; there are 11,338 gardaí in the country and they cannot realistically be expected to be everywhere.  It therefore fell to the Members to consider how the community could improve, on a practical level, the assistance which it provided to the gardaí to enable them to carry out <Col N="1459" /> their functions.  The committee decided that it would concentrate on the topic of community policing with particular reference initially to the system of neighbourhood watch.</P>
    <P>We had a meeting with the Garda Commissioner and other senior Garda officers to discuss various aspects of the crime problem and of community policing. I would like to thank Commissioner Wren, and his officers, for discussing these matters with the committee.  It is, to the best of my knowledge, the first time that Members of this House have had the opportunity to officially discuss the crime problem with the Garda authorities.  A forum which allows elected representatives to discuss matters affecting the personal safety of the community with the Garda authorities is a very welcome development.</P>
    <P>The committee discussed the topic of a community approach at a number of meetings and also considered the recent tendency towards groups of concerned citizens wishing to take a more active role in the fight against crime.  There must be a new emphasis in the approach to solving the problem and in this approach the obvious good-will and concern of the community should be recognised and utilised to assist the Garda.</P>
    <P>The report deals with three ways in which the community can more actively assist the Garda.  These include:</P>
    <P>(1)  Crime Prevention Committees,</P>
    <P>(2)  Neighbourhood Watch,</P>
    <P>(3)  Civilian Observation Patrols.</P>
    <P>With regard to crime prevention committees the committee consider it essential and are recommending that a crime prevention committee be established in any area where community policing schemes are being introduced.  These committees would be representative of local interests, for example, residents' associations, elected representatives, official organisations involved in social activities, voluntary groups and local gardaí especially community relations staff and juvenile liaison officers.  Representatives of ACRA &mdash; the Association <Col N="1460" /> of Combined Residents' Associations &mdash; NATO &mdash; National Association of Tenants Organisations &mdash; and other community organisations should consider how they can best assist the community by becoming involved in crime prevention committees.</P>
    <P>The functions of these committees would include:</P>
    <P>co-ordinating the response of the local community to crime prevention activities in their area;</P>
    <P>providing a formal means of communication between the community and the Garda;</P>
    <P>the set-up and control of neighbourhood watch and civilian observation patrol schemes;</P>
    <P>co-ordinating the response of State and local authorities and voluntary groups to the needs of a particular community; and</P>
    <P>arranging for research and study into the causes of crime in an area.</P>
    <P>The question of research into the causes of crime was considered important by the committee.</P>
    <P>The crime prevention committees being representative of various interest groups and disciplines, would be ideal bodies to study the crime problems of their particular community area.  General statements are often made attributing criminal activity to unemployment, poor housing conditions or social inequalities. However, such generalisations are not particularly effective in offering short-term solutions to the problems facing the community.  What is required is for these committees to study the crime situation in their own area.  There is no doubt but that different areas have different problems. Some areas have a large drug-related crime problem whereas in others the problem may be vandalism.  Some areas have large teenage populations. Others have high densities of elderly people.  Each area will require different forms of policing and different crime prevention measures.</P>
    <P>The members of crime prevention committees could study the particular <Col N="1461" /> types of crime which they are experiencing and try to analyse the reason for the various crimes.  Having identified the various categories of crime a study could be made of the offenders engaged in criminal activity.  This could consider their ages, their background and family circumstances and the possible explanations for their criminal activity.</P>
    <P>A study by the Medico-Social Research Board into drug abuse in the north-central Dublin area in 1982-83 revealed that the prevalence to heroin abuse in the 15 to 24 age group was 10 per cent.  This study showed that in half of the cases one or both parents were dead, or separated; only four out of 88 were employed at the time of the survey while 64 were compulsorily unemployed; only four out of the 88 left school with any kind of a certificate.  Only when the community and the authorities are aware of the causes of crime can effective steps be taken to tackle the root of the problem. The crime prevention committees should have access to funds provided in the community policing budgetary allocation for the purpose of arranging studies into the local crime problems.</P>
    <P>Immediate steps to tackle crime problems should include the provision of accommodation for young persons who get into trouble with the law because of the lack of parental control and who are in need of care in such a setting.  The committee were advised that there are about 50 identifiable young offenders in the Dublin inner city area who are responsible for about half of the crime in the area.  If these youngsters could be put into care it would have a very significant impact on the level of crime.</P>
    <P>The second suggestion is to strengthen the juvenile liaison officer service and to provide the necessary resources to enable them to perform their duties.  This scheme provides an alternative to prosecution for offenders under 17 years of age and involves the rehabilitation of young people in conflict with the law, guiding potential delinquents and all aspects of youth work.  This scheme has been in operation since 1963 and during 1982 just over 2,300 juveniles were admitted to the scheme.  During 1982 juvenile liaison <Col N="1462" /> officers paid a total of almost 23,000 visits to the homes of juveniles, 4,500 visits to boys' clubs and attended at almost 4,000 lectures and meetings.</P>
    <P>Juveniles account for about one-fifth of all crime and the juvenile liaison scheme is ideally placed to deal with these offenders.  However there are only 70 juvenile liaison officers to cover the entire country, 26 being assigned to the Dublin area.  It costs about £440 per week to maintain one person in prison.  This is equivalent to the cost of employing two juvenile liaison officers.  Each juvenile liaison officer could supervise about 50 juveniles at a time.  The Juvenile Liaison Officer Scheme could deal with 100 juveniles for the amount that it costs to maintain one person in prison.  There should be a significant investment in the Juvenile Liaison Officer Scheme as a cost-effective method of tackling the crime problem.</P>
    <P>An expanded juvenile liaison scheme should provide a significant input into the work of the crime prevention committees. Emphasis needs to be placed on active involvement with various youth activities and with visiting schools.  It is essential that the Garda become more identifiable with the youth of the country and, by doing so, seek to improve community relations.  The juvenile liaison scheme is often regarded as the poor relation within the Garda Síochána.  This approach must be changed and the emphasis on the scheme significantly increased to enable it to deal effectively with this most important area.  Crime prevention is an essential feature of the role of the Garda in the future.</P>
    <P>There are a number of alternatives for offenders who are prosecuted in the courts including the welfare service, community service orders, hostels and prisons. The probation and welfare service provides a probation work and related service to the courts.  The work involves carrying out pre-sentence assessments for the courts, supervising offenders in the community who are referred by the courts and providing a counselling service to offenders and their families.  There are about 155 officers attached to this service.</P>
    <P>The procedures for community services orders are in the process of being <Col N="1463" /> introduced and will provide an alternative to custodial accommodation. Offenders will be required to undertake work which will be of benefit to the community and which will be a more sensible way for an offender to repay his debt to society.  This scheme must be introduced as quickly as possible and its progress monitored to ensure its effectiveness. While other offenders may be sentenced to custodial accommodation and have no immediate relevance to the functions of the crime prevention committees, they will eventually return to the community and the community must be prepared and ready to accept them.</P>
    <P>The Garda must be actively involved in the community to be in a position to assist those who have passed through the judicial system and return to the community. It will be essential to provide some worthwhile employment or perhaps apprenticeship schemes for such persons. A greater emphasis needs to be placed on ensuring that they are provided with the opportunity to avoid criminal activity.</P>
    <P>The neighbourhood watch scheme involves a minimum of active participation on behalf of the community.  Members of a neighbourhood watch scheme become more aware of activity in their own area and observe and report suspicious and/or criminal activity to the Garda.  It is aimed particularly at petty and opportunist crime and vandalism.</P>
    <P>The report outlines practical examples of the steps members can take to make it more difficult for criminals to engage in criminal activity.  Consideration could be given in the framing of the new draft building regulations to ensure an adequate level of physical security, window and door locks etc., in all private houses and other buildings.  The basic designing of houses and the lay-out of housing estates needs to be examined to see how these matters could be improved upon so as to reduce the opportunity for criminal activity.</P>
    <P>While the Garda authorities should create an awareness of the potential of the scheme, the initiative for a scheme must come from the residents with the <Col N="1464" /> Garda providing the necessary support. The committee are concerned that there may not be sufficient manpower on the beat, telephone lines into Dublin city Garda stations or adequate transport to respond to calls for assistance and they have sought details from the Department of Justice as to manpower and resources in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  We are also anxious that schemes should be introduced only where there is a reasonable prospect of success and we wrote to the Garda Commissioner expressing our concern about this and the need to ensure that the pilot schemes are provided with the resources to ensure their success.</P>
    <P>Neighbourhood watch will not be successful in all areas.  It is certainly likely to prove successful in suburban areas but may not have any impact in, say, the Dublin inner city area.  Even for it to succeed in any area it will be essential that there be adequate gardaí on the beat.</P>
    <P>The committee considered the recent trend whereby civilians were taking a more active role in the fight against crime by, for example, patrolling their neighbourhood. While they consider that this good-will should be harnessed, the committee are anxious to emphasise the need for such activity to take place within an approved framework and under the control and supervision of the Garda.  One of the ways by which such community activity could be expressed is in a civilian observation patrol where members patrol the streets and community property, observe and report any suspicious or criminal activity, but do not get involved in any incidents.</P>
    <P>The committee have made a number of recommendations in favour of various forms of community involvement in policing. Among the more important recommendations are: (i) the need for resources to be provided for community policing schemes through a community policing budgetary allocation, (ii) crime prevention committees must be set up in any area where the community is going to become more actively involved in policing activities, (iii) the Garda authorities should take the initiative in ensuring that the public are aware of the potential of <Col N="1465" /> community policing schemes; should be actively involved in their introduction and should train members of such schemes.  In this connection Garda members may also need basic and in-service training in community relations.</P>
    <P>This is the committee's first report and is intended to provide a guideline for the public as to the views of this House on the practical ways in which the public can assist the garda to combat crime.  This document is intended to stimulate public discussion on the whole question of community policing.  The committee will proceed to consider other areas within their orders of reference but will keep an eye on developments in this area and may report further to the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that there must be a realisation on the part of the public that the Garda alone cannot tackle the crime problem.  Every individual member of the community has a role to play in the fight to reduce crime and improve the quality of the life of society. For too long now people have been saying that the Garda will deal with this and that with the result that the ordinary citizen has opted out of his role.  It is time for a new realisation that people must again play their part in maintaining social order and that such a role necessitates a close liaison and co-operation with the Garda.  The committee are aware that there must be a corresponding change in emphasis and they will consider what steps, in addition to those already covered in this first report, can be taken to change this emphasis.</P>
    <P>The House will realise that this report was unanimously agreed by the committee whose members have asked me to state that the time allocated for its discussion is very short.  We will be looking for some extension on another day.</P>

      <P>I am particularly pleased that we have brought the first report before the House.  I welcome the reasoned speeches at the AGSI conference as reported in today's press.  I am very reluctant to pay any compliment to that association because on the last occasion I did so in the House they interpreted it as an attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> The purpose of the report, which was considered before the action Deputy Woods referred to by people in the streets, is to regularise and to harmonise relationships between community groups and the Garda who have to be the primary and the first group in the maintenance and administration of law and order.  Condemnation of vigilantes by Members of this House has been interpreted by some groups as condemnation of all groups involved in efforts to maintain law and order in their communities. That is not the case.  There are many groups voluntarily involved in trying to do something about crime in their area and are associated and work in harmony with the Garda and are not what could be described as vigilantes.  The committee are not against such groups although they are against vigilantes.  They are anxious that such groups work in harmony with the Garda under the control and supervision of the Garda and not on their own.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the neighbourhood watch scheme together with the civilian observation patrol, appropriately called COP, is something the community will welcome.  One of the biggest problems in the Dublin region is crime and many of the more active members of the community are very anxious to get involved with the Garda to try to do something about this problem.  This will give them a formal outlet for this energy and interest.</P>
    <P>I hope the Garda Commissioner will appoint an inspector in each division and a sergeant in each Garda station to take in hand the administration of the scheme proposed by the all party committee today and that the Dáil committee will look at the deployment and training of the Garda and will write a report on drug abuse and drug related crime aa a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I also hope that at an early date we will be able to give some consideration to the question of family courts, or parental responsibility, and that this will be considered as part and parcel of a review of the age of criminal responsibility.  In my view this is extremely urgent because of <Col N="1467" /> certain provisions in the criminal justice legislation.  I hope too that the various problems facing the community can be examined by the all party committee and that in the coming months we can issue reports on the various areas of difficulty facing the community.  Not all the problems we face are aggravated by lack of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>For some time Dublin has been suffering from an appalling level of crime and vandalism.  It has become a city of fear: we have a number of no-go areas.  Various types of solutions have been advocated over the years by different people, such as psychiatrists, community groups and so on, but these proposals failed to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>It was against this background that the committee were set up.  We have before us today the first report on the neighbourhood watch.  I see this as only the first round in the fight against crime.  This is only the tip of the iceberg.  There are many question marks behind the proposals. Deputy Mitchell mentioned vigilante groups.  This is one area where we might run into difficulty because there is a possibility that such a voluntary group can be taken over by extreme groups and there is also the danger of protection rackets.  These areas will have to be monitored very carefully with the result that tremendous responsibility will fall on the Garda to ensure that this type of situation does not arise.</P>
      <P>The neighbourhood watch has been tried very successfully in New York over the past few years and this has led to a reduction in the crime rate.  However, the Irish person has a great fear of being labelled an informer.  This may deter many people from becoming involved in a positive way with the neighbourhood watch.  The Garda must monitor and supervise the neighbourhood watch scheme and give professional instruction to the people who take part.  These people must be identified only to a very small number of gardaí, perhaps at local Garda station level.  If this scheme is monitored properly it can contribute in a very positive way towards the solution of the overall problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> Since our last committee meeting a great deal of publicity was given to politicians criticising the Garda.  Some of the statements attributed to members of the committee were taken out of context.  It is unfortunate that we do not have a full detailed account of that meeting so that what I say could be proved.  I want to put on the record that the Garda have been doing a very good job under difficult circumstances. The Garda must obtain full support and more financial resources from the Department.  In present circumstances there is no way the neighbourhood watch will be successful.  More finance must be poured in to facilitate involving more areas.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I see this as the first round in the fight against crime.  We cannot expect solutions overnight to problems which have been building up over a number of years.  I hope the full co-operation of the public will be forthcoming and that the Garda will be seen to support the public.  If we can start along these lines that will be a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I commend this report to the House and thank the chairman for his leadership.  We have done a fair amount of work since the committee were set up. We met very regularly and took our responsibilities very seriously.  I do not intend to make a long submission but I want to make a few points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last week end the Commissioner gave a figure of £221 million per annum as the budget for the Garda, a force of 11,200 people.  It was inevitable that the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism would look at the force and how they worked.  In my view the Garda over-reacted to the criticism they alleged was made by the committee and by Members of this House. There are a number of semi-State bodies <Col N="1469" /> such as CIE, Aer Lingus, NET, the ESB, Bord Telecom and so on, which can be criticised.  They all have large budgets, and large organisations should come under the scrutiny of Members of this House.  We should know if they are efficient, if they are doing the job for which they were set up and if taxpayers' money is being spent properly.</P>
    <P>Like other members of the committee, I have the greatest respect for the Commissioner, the Deputy Commissioners, the senior members of the Garda and the force in general but, contrary to what the Garda have been saying about political interference in their area, they have interfered to a great extent in the political arena.  I also mentioned that point in my Second Stage speech on the Criminal Justice Bill.  For example, it was reported in the <i>Evening Press</i> on 3 March that the Government's plan to combat serious crime was turned down by the Garda at a meeting in Wexford.  They said that the Minister's proposed amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill would tilt the balance in favour of the criminal and that the pressure groups had won while the Garda had failed.  I would say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that.  So far the Garda have won because they have been the greatest pressure group in getting the Bill in its present form before the House.  They say that the new Act would be of very little use to the Force.  This is another attempt by them to lead the Dáil and one of the complaints of the committee was that they were also attempting to lead us by the nose and were annoyed because we did not want that and wanted to make our own submissions. If this new legislation would be of very little use to the Force, then that is proof that they are the most inefficient organisation in the country.  I said at a committee meeting that they may be one of the most inefficient organisations, but this is proof.  Every responsible body is saying that this Bill is draconian in some of its measures.</P>
    <P>I refer to a statement made during that weekend by Sergeant Michael Murray, a member of the AGSI executive, who operates in Finglas.  He stated: &ldquo;If we so honestly and sincerely want to have contact <Col N="1470" /> with and support from the community we must stop thinking of ourselves as a brotherly band, beleagured by hostile forces, and start thinking of ourselves more as public servants within a specialised law enforcement organisation&rdquo;. That is a positive statement and I think the man is right.</P>
    <P>The committee interviewed a committee from Finglas where the first community policing operation is to be set up.  As a result of replies to the questions I and other members asked I felt they were unprepared for that operation and merely because this committee was the first to suggest that they operate community policing or neighbourhood watch they tried to steal a march.  I emphasised that there was a danger because they were stealing possibly the only trump card we had left in combating and controlling crime.  Some of the statements were taken out of context by the media. This committee suggested that they be supported and provided with money where necessary and that we should try to help them.</P>
    <P>The general secretary, P. J. Rogan, suggested that sweeping comments were made by members of the committee, including myself.  That is not true because we have been constructive in our suggestions. They also said that a comprehensive document was submitted to us by AGSI for consideration but that has not happened and the document will not be submitted for another three weeks.</P>
    <P>We must remember what the role of a Member of this Parliament is.  If a Member is not entitled to examine and look at the Garda, then I should like to know who can.  I thank the Minister for making that point in his submission to the association. He said on television recently that Members of Parliament and members of the committee should have a right to look at how the Force operates.</P>
    <P>Regarding what is happening in relation to crime and the Criminal Justice Bill, the day when you cannot answer back a garda who stops you on the street is a sad day for this country.  If it ever gets to the stage where some brat &mdash; and I mean a brat &mdash; takes in respectable members of the community and incarcerates them in <Col N="1471" /> a dirty cell for three or four hours, it is also a sad day for this country and people must speak out against it.  The Bill is not yet through the House and this does happen. In memory of the older, dead generation of Garda, whom we loved, and the present revered members, I stand against certain sections of the Criminal Justice Bill and in favour of an up-graded, humane, efficient Force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report of the committee.  It is important that the Dáil should have a committee looking at the question of crime, policing and the relationship with the community.  The terms of reference of the committee are, however, restricted in that they do not allow the committee to look at the question of the causes of crime.  I note the committee's suggestion that local community groups or crime prevention committees should be financed to look at the causes of crime locally.  While certainly there is a need for people to look at the causes of crime in their own area, primarily the question of examining the overall causes of crime is a matter for elected representatives in this House and by the committee.</P>
      <P>The matter of neighbourhood watch takes up most of the report and it pinpoints a number of basic requirements. They include resources, manpower, communications between local people and the Garda and so forth.  Another very important element in the operation of the scheme is the matter of confidence between local people and the Garda.  It is not always the case that the Garda have that confidence, certainly in parts of this city.  This may be due to the Garda being pushed into positions because of lack of resources or manpower and having to do things they would not necessarily want to do in enforcing the law.  Confidence does not exist in all areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must also be said that not all gardaí are keen on the idea of the neighbourhood watch.  In many parts of this city the Garda simply want a number of people in an area to report to them what is going on and they do not want to have any hand, act or part in the broader question <Col N="1472" /> of liaising with local people in regard to crime prevention.  This is not the case in Finglas where an attempt is being made to set up a pilot scheme.  My experience is that there has been a very open response to the whole idea of the pilot scheme in the Finglas area, but unless the Garda make a conscious effort to build up confidence between themselves and the local people this scheme will not get beyond the point of being a pilot scheme in one area.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the causes of crime and Deputy Woods said that various people put forward poverty and deprivation as causes of crime.  I argue very strongly that the social factors which lead to crime have to be dealt with as a matter of policy by whatever Government are in power. I also feel very strongly that the committee should immediately establish a study into the effect housing, education, unemployment and deprivation of various kinds have on young people who get involved in crime.  We must take note of the statistic which indicates that 50 per cent of those involved in crime are under 21 years of age.  We should discuss how that problem can be dealt with through policy decisions by the Government.  It will not be solved by committees looking at their own local situation.  A whole range of social policies must be introduced by the Government.</P>
    <P>The question of drugs is also very important in relation to crime.  We all know drug addiction leads to drug pushing and crimes of various kinds, and not just petty crimes.  In the past it has led to fairly serious crimes because the addict has to pay for his or her habit.  I urge the committee to take up as their next priority a study of the causes of crime and to look into the cause of drug abuse and make recommendations.  I ask them to press very strongly for the strengthening and committing of resources to the junior liaison officers scheme.</P>

      <P>As a member of <Col N="1473" /> the committee I welcome this report.  My contribution will be brief because of the time limitation.  I hope that at some future date this matter can be discussed in greater detail by all Members of the House.  I hope that when the reports of committees come before the House they will not be a filler-in on a Thursday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of months the committee have examined this problem thoroughly.  We have quite a number of meetings.  We met various groups of people such as the Garda.  We also had an interesting meeting with members of the Finglas group who were most helpful to us and told us about various problems in their areas and various matters which should be dealt with prior to putting this scheme into operation in other areas.  We learned over the past few months that before the scheme is operated in other areas certain problems have to be ironed out if it is to operate successfully.</P>
      <P>I think we are going about it in the right way.  I hope the proposed neighbourhood watches, civilian observation and general vigilance will be a success. We are all victims of crime in one way or another.  Some people are the real victims and suffer loss or physical assault.  Houses have been robbed.  Others have friends who were attacked and robbed.  Others are affected by malicious damage claims and insurance claims.  We are all suffering in one way or another because of the fact that crimes are being committed against the people.</P>
      <P>It will take time and planning to operate the scheme successfully.  It will take a commitment from all of us and especially from those who are concerned about community problems.  We will need certain resources, finances and equipment.  It may be that in one area there is only one squad car or the telephones are not working.  All these practical difficulties can be dealt with. The proposal by the committee is only one way to fight crime.  We will be discussing many more matters in trying to bring about a decrease in the crime rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously we need a good Garda Force working for us.  We have a good Garda Force.  Hard hitting headline-seeking criticisms <Col N="1474" /> of the Garda are not helpful.  Official channels are available whether it be the Minister, the local superintendent or the Commissioner of the Garda.  I reject any general headline seeking criticisms which do not contribute anything.  Some groups and individuals who make these criticisms do not make any constructive contribution themselves.  I hope that a combination of effort, with the public helping the Garda, will bring about a reduction in crime.  Very often the victims of crime do not get too much notice. People shout about rights being affected. The rights of the victim do not claim the same prominence.  I welcome the report and I hope its progress will be watched by Members of the House and by the Minister for Justice over the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the committee I welcome this report and commend it to the House.  There is no doubt that there is a very serious and growing crime problem and that we should be doing something about it.  The crime problem gives rise to a diverse ideological response, as was illustrated by some speakers here today.  There is the attitude which portrays crime as an attack on the rule of law and a threat to the established order which must be controlled at all costs.  There is the other approach which suggests that crime is the product of a sick society and arises from various social malfunctions within our basic institutions. There is an even more radical approach which focuses on the irrelevance or inadequacy of those institutions. There is a certain element of truth in these approaches and they must be kept in mind in any discussion on how the crime problem can be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the remarks made by Deputy Cosgrave about the Garda.  One aspect of the proceedings of the committee which I deplored was outspoken attacks on the Garda.  Basic decisions on the role, functions and structure of the Garda were taken at a time when society was very different from what it is today. The difficulties faced by the Garda acting in that role and acting within the ambit of those decisions taken very long ago in <Col N="1475" /> trying to control crime in modern society cannot be underestimated and must be clearly understood, if any clear policy is to evolve to combat crime.  Some of the difficulties facing the Garda Force arise from a changed perception among some groups of their role in society.  These see the Garda in the role of protecting the standards and position of a certain section of society at the expense of others.</P>
    <P>Most of the difficulties in attempting to combat crime arise from the fairly static and limited range of responses of the Garda to a wide and changing diversity in crime.  One conclusion which is evident from the interim report and preliminary discussions by the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism is that the effectiveness of the police as a force isolated from and not integrated to any extent with the local community is severely limited and becoming more so as time goes on.  The Garda have come around to agreeing with that point of view, but I notice that they still see themselves as the prime movers in the evolution of community policing.  For various reasons into which time does not permit me to go, I disagree with that view.  Perhaps in the early stages the police could act as the catalyst in encouraging the development of community policing in society, but local communities themselves must be the prime movers in this regard.</P>
    <P>The key to the evolution of community policing must be flexibility.  There must not be a rigid scheme which applies in the same way in all areas.  As time goes on, experience will lead to a system of community policing which it is hoped will be rational and effective, and will have wide acceptance from the public.  I hope that such evolution will be accompanied by the development of a more fair, humane and just society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the committee, I have been involved in the discussions leading to the production of the report.  I fully support the emphasis placed on involving the public more fully in attempting to reduce the level of crime in the community.  Despite a small <Col N="1476" /> reduction in crime in 1979, a 50 per cent increase has been recorded in indictable offences over the last five years.  Such increase is a real cause for alarm and shows that the Garda on their own cannot deal with the general level of crime in our society at present.  This is where the concept of community involvement and policing must come to the fore.  It was in recognition of this need that the members of the committee decided to concentrate initially on the production of a report on the ways in which citizens could assist the Garda.</P>
      <P>While the level of crime poses a serious problem, many are concerned about themselves or their families and friends becoming victims.  Serious crimes are a cause for legitimate concern, but such form a minority of the total.  The public must have a balanced picture of crime.  If the fear of crime is to be reduced, the adoption of certain crime prevention practices will help &mdash; increased foot patrols by uniformed gardaí, improved street lighting, the fitting of window and door locks, all have been found to lessen that fear.  It is accepted that increasing police manpower is not the sole solution to combating crime.  The public have a part to play and can effectively help by becoming more involved in the prevention of crime.  It is for this reason that the committee are recommending the introduction of community policing schemes.</P>
      <P>It appears that a considerable proportion of indictable offences are of a petty nature and the result of opportunities placed in the way of potential criminals. As an example, in 1982, there were about 20,000 cases of larceny from unattended vehicles, which represents one-fifth of the total record of indictable offences.  While I accept that circumstances arise where persons may have no option but to leave possessions in unattended vehicles, the extent of the crime shows a lack of foresight on the part of vehicle owners.  They must be educated as to the important part which they can play in reducing crime. People spend a large amount of money in buying expensive cars and go to no trouble whatsoever to safeguard these from robbery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to our recommendations for <Col N="1477" /> the establishment of a crime prevention committee, this is the kernel of our report, as pointed out by the chairman. In this area we would have a welding together of the community, the Garda Síochána and members of local authorities. This is the first step in the involvement of the Garda in the community.  As stated in the report, we will be looking at other ways in which this could be achieved.  I would like the Garda to become more involved in youth activities, in the establishment of relationships with schools and youth clubs and with younger people.</P>
    <P>The function of the Garda, as I understand it, is to prevent crime, protect life and property and maintain public peace and order in our society.  In the discharge of that duty, it is imperative that they operate within the law as laid down.  Any garda who fails in that should be severely punished.  There has been criticism of the Garda Síochána.  I am not opposed to such criticism, if it is informed.  However, that criticism has shown lack of balance in recent times.  Since the establishment of this State, the Garda Síochána have served us very well.  They set up road blocks and check houses at risk to their lives.  They are very brave men in doing this.</P>
    <P>To get a picture of the value of the Garda Síochána to the community, it is worth examining the record in that regard and the casualties which they have suffered in bravely carrying our their duties. In 1970 Garda Richard Fallon was shot in following armed robbers at the AIB bank in Arran Quay.  Inspector Samuel Donegan was killed in 1972 when examining an explosive device on the Border. In 1975 Garda Michael Reynolds was shot in the head in St. Anne's Park, Raheny, while pursuing persons suspected of an armed robbery.  In 1976 Garda Michael Clarkin was killed in an explosion when called to examine a booby trap in a house.  In 1980 Garda Bourne and Detective Garda Moroney were both killed when pursuing armed robbers. Also in 1980 Garda Séamus McQuaid was shot by persons suspected of armed robbery.</P>

We should recognise that and take it into account.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to thank the clerk of the committee and his staff for their very courteous attention.</P>

      <P>As a rural Deputy I am not aware of the problems with regard to crime in the city of Dublin and other big cities.  However, I suggest that the neighbourhood watch be extended to rural parts of our constituencies, particularly my constituency where elderly people are at present living in constant fear.  I should like to know if the Minister is aware that throughout the length and breadth of this country there are large numbers of elderly people living in constant fear of attack in their homes by greedy, violent and ruthless thugs who have no hesitation about forcing their way into the homes and apartments of these defenceless people, demanding money through maniac, forceful attacks on their homes.  They are robbing these unfortunate victims, in many cases causing them grievious bodily harm.  This unfortunate situation has arisen because people are not aware of how much money they are entitled to have in their bank. Perhaps this matter would be proper to the Minister for Social Welfare.  Elderly people living in rural areas who apply for the old age pension &mdash; particularly in the case of bachelors or others living alone &mdash; often withdraw money, sometimes their life savings, from a bank or post office when somehow or other somebody gets to know about it and a short time afterwards their homes are broken into and they are robbed.  This is happening all over rural Ireland and is particularly <Col N="1479" /> prevalent in my constituency at present. These men come in the dead hour of night, just kicking a door in to gain entry. There was even an instance of an invalid having been thrown out of bed &mdash; because it is known that sometimes people have a habit of keeping money under the mattress &mdash; so that they could look for money under the mattress.  I know of people who have been afraid to go back and live in their homes because they have been broken into and robbed.  This fear is of crisis proportions in our society at present in particular among the elderly.</P>

      <P>I should like to commend this report to the House.  I firmly believe that community policing will be a major contributor to our success in the fight against crime in the future.  I would compliment Deputy M. Brennan on his simple but very realistic presentation of the reality of crime to so many of our people today, rural and urban.  It is in that atmosphere that we and indeed the Minister have undertaken much of the action of the past year.  The reality is extremely sad, the quality of life of people has deteriorated rapidly.  People cannot go freely from their homes, they cannot do what they could have done five, six, seven or eight years ago.  It is that dreadful limitation on people's lives that has presented us with the task that we, as legislators, cannot continue to ignore.  We are facing that task in a number of ways this year with the Criminal Justice Bill, our proposals on community policing, the development of a pilot scheme and, hopefully in the course of this year, a very important part, the Children's Bill, which will deal with the caring side of proposals in relation to children who are at risk or who may become criminals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of the scheme succeeding cannot be understated.  The alternative for our society is to accept a situation in which there will be an ever-increasing number of Garda Síochána, in which the answer to crime will be a much greater presence of police on our streets, outside our places of business, perhaps generally becoming a feature of every <Col N="1480" /> street corner.  None of us would like to see that happen.  None of us would see that as a tolerable solution, apart from the fact that society could not afford it. Quite apart from that it would be totally undesirable in terms of the quality of life and the kind of society we would wish to create.</P>
    <P>Community policing first raised its head in other countries.  It was initially proposed here by the Garda Síochána themselves.  That is a welcome development. It was their association who produced a major discussion document on this over a year ago in which they indicated their willingness to have this developed. Spontaneously our people took this concept aboard.  For example, in the fight against drugs they have discovered that it is community awareness, action and prevention that constitutes the best answer to those types of crime.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few points about the Finglas area in particular, where a year ago people facing some serious incidents in their area came into the Minister indicating that they were interested in a pilot scheme of community policing, seeing that as the solution to their problem.  They were very happy when the Garda Commissioner decided that Finglas was to be designated one of the pilot areas.  In Finglas there is a Garda force which, as Deputy De Rossa has indicated, has extremely good links with the community arising out of the early stages of the community policing concept which began in recent years.  In one and a half years there has been a significant impact made on the level of crime in that area.  For example, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of cars stolen in the area.  The people of the area have been surveyed.  They have shown themselves very willing to co-operate fully in this scheme but they have identified a series of problems.  I would say to the Minister that there is an awful lot at stake here, that this is the first pilot scheme from which we hope will develop a national scheme which will affect all cities and rural areas.  It is extremely important that this pilot scheme be given the resources it needs.  The people have already identified the necessity for extra <Col N="1481" /> manpower, perhaps extra facilities for the Garda Síochána, in particular the desirability of having sufficient manpower so that there can be a regular beat in order that individual members of the Garda can become known to individual members of the community.  The next stage in that pilot scheme is that every household in the Finglas area will be circulated with details of the scheme and how it will operate.  Each household will be asked to put up a sign reading &ldquo;Community watch&rdquo; and will be invited to be in regular communication with the Garda Síochána.  That will lead to a significant increase in calls being made on the Garda Síochána.  If they cannot respond adequately the scheme will lose its credibility. I would ask the Minister to look very carefully at the necessity of giving this pilot scheme the necessary resources.  We on that committee, and I personally, believe it is a most important scheme and must not be put at risk by inadequate resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> First of all, I should like to thank everybody who contributed to this debate this afternoon.  There have been a number of major opportunities afforded Deputies to register their views about crime, lawlessness, law and order in general over the past 12 months.  We had a very effective Second Stage debate on the Community Services Order Bill, and we had the Second Stage debate on the Criminal Justice Bill, which was quite long.  We had, I think, also two special debates on the general area as well.  I am glad to have had the opportunity of listening to this debate also.  As I said in the House previously, this is not just a ritual we follow: I do take the views of Deputies into account.  I consider that the views expressed by Deputies in this House are of more significance in influencing me in decision-making than those of anybody else outside the House.  I might suggest that Deputies would look again at the amendments I shall be proposing next week on the Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice Bill when they will see that many of the views expressed here <Col N="1482" /> have been taken on board by me.  I intend to continue to operate in that way.</P>
      <P>As this is the first occasion on which the House has met to debate the work of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to wish the committee every success in discharging the functions which the House has given to it.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the crime committee's first report that the members have been working hard at their task.  The matter of a neighbourhood watch scheme, which forms the subject matter of the committee's first report, was a very apt choice. The report has, of course, only just been published and the various recommendations will require to be carefully considered and evaluated.  The process of consulting the various interests involved is being put in hands.  Accordingly, I am not in a position today to give a final response to all of the committee's recommendations.</P>
      <P>However, I am pleased to be in a position to endorse wholeheartedly the central recommendation of the report on the establishment of neighbourhood watch. I announced in the House in May last that I was considering the introduction of such a system and in the ensuing months the Garda authorities researched the topic and, as noted by the committee, the Garda are, with the co-operation of the local communities, in the process of setting up the system on a pilot basis.  It is heartening that there is agreement on all sides on the potential for good which neighbourhood watch seems to offer. When we think of schemes like neighbourhood watch, we usually think in terms of community policing.  To think about that, we must think of the nature of the community.  We have many communities in the State.  In order to have a community service integrated into the community those who carry out the service must be part of the community. This is one of the difficulties we face as regards community policing.  Country gardaí live in the towns and villages and are integrated into the community.  However, they do not live in the same communities in the cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> I am not casting any reflection on gardaí but it is worth noting that our housing policy has brought about a position where the major support agencies involved in a community move in during the day and move out at night.  This refers to teachers, probation and welfare officers as well as to gardaí.  They all give a good service while they are in the community but obviously if they do not live in the community there is not absolute integration.  Real involvement in a community means living among the people, getting to know them, your kids going to school with their kids, and your wife having a cup of coffee and doing the shopping with their wives.  That does not happen in many of the support agencies.  Consequently we must think of other ways of having a strong contact between the community and the Garda.</P>
    <P>When I first came to office I discussed this with the Commissioner.  As an initial attempt to get the community more closely involved with the police, it was decided that as many gardaí as possible would be put back on the beat and that gardaí in uniform would patrol the same areas working on consecutive rosters.  In that way they could build up a relationship with the community.  They would know people by their first names.  They would know who lived in what house and whose car was parked outside a certain house.  This was accepted as normal up to a few years ago.  There are areas in the city where people do not know the gardaí by their names.  More gardaí have been put back on the beat.</P>
    <P>Another idea is that of having a community policeman designated to a particular area.  His job would be to forge links between the community and the force at a personal level.  He could coach the local kids' soccer team, as many gardaí coach a hurling or football team down the country, or he could go into a house and have a cup of tea and talk to the people.  It is vitally important that the strong contact which existed between the gardaí and the people be re-established.  In that context, I welcome community watch.  It will provide another mechanism whereby people <Col N="1484" /> can make contact in a personal way with the gardaí.  That is vital for the prevention of crime.</P>
    <P>It has been traditional for Ministers to appeal for public co-operation with the Garda.  That has always been interpreted as a one to one response &mdash; the individual good citizen doing his civic duty should respond to an individual garda on behalf of the force.  We also need a community response and community watch provides for that.  My views are already a matter of record on this matter.  There is a cautionary note to be sounded.  There are groups who would like to infiltrate communities for their own purposes.  This is particularly true of the Provisional IRA and their ongoing policy of winning influence, control and subsequently power with the Armalite in one hand and the ballot paper in the other.  Their attempts to influence communities to support them electorally has tempted them to infiltrate community groups.</P>
    <P>It is important that people setting up community watch should do so in co-operation with the Garda.  It would be a tragedy if concerned parents set up a structure which proved to be the wooden horse which brought terrorists into their communities and allowed them, under the subterfuge of help, to play a significant role in their communities.  That would take the community from the frying pan into the fire.  Communities should be aware of this.  That can be avoided by setting up community watch in co-operation with the Garda.  Get the Garda in at the beginning and have the ground rules established early on.</P>
    <P>We should not be too pessimistic about the situation.  Crime is increasing but the increase last year was 4.9 per cent.  It was a small increase.  The year before it was 9 per cent and the year before that it was 22 per cent.  I hope we have the right trend on the graph.  Too much emphasis has been placed on crime detection over the years.  There is a budget of £246 million spent on the Garda and prisons.  The harm has already been done before the switch is turned on for it to operate effectively. A crime has been committed and it is only after that has happened that the forces which fight against crime are activated. <Col N="1485" /> There is a victim.  Somebody has been hit over the head or his or her television or car has been stolen.  Everything is then activated to catch up with the person and punish him.  It would be of enormous benefit to society if more emphasis was put on crime prevention rather than crime detection.  Community watch presents an ideal opportunity for this.</P>
    <P>In the US where this scheme has been in operation for a number of years the business community are involved.  Insurance companies and banks have sponsored communities in community watch. An essential part of it is to protect homes and property.  Insurance companies are in the business of accepting liability to protect homes and property.  If communities are reducing the risk, why should insurance companies not help them in their fight against crime?  I would like if this committee took up this idea with the insurance companies and the banks.  It would benefit the community and the companies.  The insurance companies provide information and publish literature.  They also provide infra-red pens for marking property.</P>
    <P>I do not see the Criminal Justice Bill as a panacea for all our ills.  There are many things we must do in our fight against crime.  The legislative approach is only one of them.  We must build up public confidence in the Garda and we must build up the morale of the Garda.  We must make them more effective in urban areas especially.  I am sure the Whitaker committee on prisons will enable us to find solutions to many of the problems associated with prisons.  We must have a more effective court system and alternatives to imprisonment.  If the appropriate alternatives were there many people who are now imprisoned would not be in prison.</P>
    <P>I do not want anybody, especially the members of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, who are here and who have such an interest in this, to misunderstand my position.  A great deal of attention will be given to the Criminal Justice Bill next week.  It is only part &mdash; a necessary part &mdash; of the <Col N="1486" /> approach to the crime problem legislation, but there are other things also.  I accept the role of the committee and of all Deputies in the House to make a valid contribution to that and I will be open-minded about it.  I can do with all the good advice I can get.  I thank everybody who contributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartin has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the distribution of milk quotas in Ireland with a view to accommodating people in western areas.  He has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have agreed with my constituency colleague, Deputy Brennan, that he should have five minutes and I will take 15.</P>
      <P>In whatever arrangement is made for the allocation of the milk quota it is well known that the extent of the super levy as a penalty on milk production is so wide that nobody will send milk to the creamery in excess of his quota and incur payment of that levy, so we will have in fact a quota system.  I do not expect, neither do I hope, that this will be a permanent system to which we will be tied for as far as we can see into the future.  I hope that the pricing policy of the Community and the fact that MCAs are being progressively reduced and abolished in the Netherlands, Britain and Germany, together with restrictions on the imports of feed from third countries, will create a situation in which milk production will slow down in some member states of the Community and that in the foreseeable future, in the next three, four or five years, Ireland will be able to resume increased production of dairy products and compete in the markets for a higher share than we have at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture on the success he achieved in his negotiations on behalf of Irish farmers. I never underestimated the difficulties facing the Minister in the case he was <Col N="1487" /> making.  As an MEP and having discussed with interest with the Council, Commission and Members of the Parliament the problems of milk production in Europe, and the economic and social implications of all the arguments made, I realised that this was politically a very serious subject not only in Ireland but in many countries throughout the Community.  We realised that, while we had a very strong case to make, in favour of Irish agriculture, other regions of the Community and other farmers in other parts of the Community had a strong case too.  We were asking for Ireland a concession that was being denied to many hundreds of thousands of small farmers throughout the Community who were being forced to cut back on their production.  Therefore, we did not underestimate the difficulty the Minister would have in convincing the Governments of Europe that they should apply a levy to small farmers in their own member states and at the same time allow Irish producers the opportunity to increase their production.</P>
    <P>The arguments made on behalf of Ireland within the EEC can be made on behalf of the western seaboard farmers in the underdeveloped areas with equal conviction.  When we presented to Europe a case for an exemption for Ireland we presented a national case, and that is reasonable enough.  I discussed this earlier with the Minister and with the Taoiseach and they felt that they should argue Ireland's case and that they should not complicate that argument by proposing different treatment for different parts of the country.  I pointed out to them that if we went to Europe with a case for the underdeveloped areas on its own we would not have had a difficulty.  We could easily have got the sort of derogation that we wanted.  We could have got an open road in front of milk producers in the west to continue production for the foreseeable future.  That could not be got for all of Ireland.  There was a political will in Europe.  It was quite obvious in debates in the Parliament and from talking to Commissioners and representatives of the Council that the west had the sympathy we needed to give us a total <Col N="1488" /> exemption from the levy.  We chose not to do that and on balance probably we took the right decision.  The case for Ireland would not have been as good if we were not able to include in it the figures of the disadvantaged areas, the low milk yields there and the total dependency of so many farmers in those areas on milk production.  The farmers of the west joined with their colleagues to make a strong case, which was made successfully. Now we should take a look at the possibility of redistributing the quota within this country so that the 25 to 30 per cent of farmers in the west who produce milk can be allowed a more generous allocation from that quota than the bigger, better off farmers in the south and east.</P>
    <P>Regarding the yield per cow, in north Connacht the average yield is 530 gallons, in the Cork area 760 gallons, in Waterford 877 gallons and our national average is 734 gallons.  The average for the EEC is 965 gallons.  This clearly shows that the gap between the better-off and the poorer Irish farmers is bigger than that between the average Irish and average EEC and far wider than the gap between the better areas of Ireland and the EEC average.</P>
    <P>We can underline the differences between the eastern part of the country and the western area.  In the south-west 41 per cent of farmers are in the under 10,000 gallons category while in the north-west 88.3 per cent of farmers are in that category.  Something like two-thirds of the farmers supplying milk in the north Connacht area are in the under 5,000 gallons category.  I am referring to that area because it is an average, well-organised co-operative area in the west and is typical of the west.</P>
    <P>Another point made on behalf of Irish farmers was the limit to the number of choices they had in agricultural production. Nowhere is this more true than in the underdeveloped areas where the possibility of farmers converting their land to other types of production does not exist.  If small farmers in the west cannot produce milk then one can say that it is not possible for them to achieve a viable income from agriculture.  The strongest <Col N="1489" /> of all arguments put forward by Ireland and the most convincing in regard to the super-levy was that in the interest of regional policy and economic convergence Ireland should be given the opportunity to go ahead.  We could not argue it entirely on a farm against a farm basis. We know there are many small farmers in Europe whose production was going to be reduced and who were to be denied the possibility of improving their standards of living which are considerably lower than average for their regions at present.  We could not argue against the case being put forward by them, but we could argue on a regional basis that the EEC is committed to economic convergence, the redistribution of wealth, the bringing of opportunities and incomes of people in the poorer areas up closer to those in the better-off areas.  On those grounds Ireland has an unanswerable case, which was well made.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we can make this case again. We have discussed many times the disadvantages of centralisation, the flight from the land in the west, the social and economic consequences that flow from all that and indeed the consequences that we have just been hearing about in terms of lawlessness and the breaking down of security in urban areas.  For all these reasons we can argue for the economic development of the west.  The farmers there have made sacrifices in their efforts to co-operate with farmers from the rest of the country in bringing about a deal that was better than we could have got without the co-operation of those farmers in the west.  I am saying now to the farmers of the remainder of the country that they ought to concede a little in the interest of allowing the further development of the dairy industry in western areas. We are not arguing here for the maintenance of an inefficient industry. We know now what our quota is and that that represents the amount of milk we will be able to sell.  It is a question of which part of Ireland that quota of milk is produced in and it is in this context that I say we should give preference to those areas in which farmers do not have the opportunity of producing sugar beet, cereals <Col N="1490" /> or beef on the sort of extensive scale that is necessary in order to make a living.</P>
    <P>We ought now to see the reason in the arguments Ireland was making in the face of opposition from our richer European neighbours and apply the very same reason in favour of the farmers of the disadvantaged areas.  Some policies of the Community militate against the development of agriculture in the west.  I have pointed out many times that while almost half the farmers of Ireland are living in the region of Connacht-Ulster, only something like 20 per cent of the benefits from the CAP are directed to that area. If one considers in economic terms the regional impact of the CAP one finds a little black patch for the Golden Vale area.  That is the area to which the benefits of the CAP have gone.  I am sure that your constituency, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, has enjoyed a fair measure of that advantage.  I am glad they have been able to benefit in that way but we are asking now for a small concession for the west.</P>
    <P>Because of the policy of the Community in giving preference to cereal growers <i>vis-à-vis</i> the imports of cheaper cereals from all over the world, we have maintained higher cereal prices in the Community than has been the case outside. The same applies to beef prices. Consequently, the west of Ireland which does not produce cereals has been forced to pay the higher prices in respect of stock raising, supplementary dairy rations and so on, for feed brought either from the eastern part of the country or imported. Because of this policy we have been put at a disadvantage but we have had to make that sacrifice on behalf of the country as a whole.  However, this makes our case stronger for a little extra now.  Of course we respect the wisdom of successive Governments in supporting the policy on cereals but it has put us at a disadvantage. While I do not expect the Minister to tell the dairy industry precisely what they should do, what I am advocating must be a subject for negotiation. I urge him to bear in mind the facts I have put forward and to request the dairy industry and people with whom he has consultations as to how the super-levy <Col N="1491" /> should be put into effect, to consider the case I am making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may, I shall give a couple of minutes of my short time to Deputy McCartin's fellow candidate for the European Parliament, Deputy MacSharry.</P>
      <P>I shall be very brief in making my case in support of the west.  Again, that part of the country is the poor relation.  Yesterday the management of the North Connacht Farmers met here with Fianna Fáil and I understand they will be meeting with Fine Gael next week.  This group are making a very good case for the west in so far as the super-levy is concerned. The figures in respect of the yield of gallons of milk per agricultural acre will put the situation in perspective.  In the west, the ratio is 27.6 gallons per acre while in Cork it is 179.4 gallons and in Waterford 124 gallons.  The figure for the EEC as a whole is 110 gallons.  It will be seen, then, that the figures for Cork and Waterford are much higher than those for the European average.  It was because of the low figure for the west that the Minister was successful in achieving an increase in the quota.  I am not criticising him.  He fought a hard battle but when he visited Sligo he promised that the super-levy would not be applied to the west.  He said that the disadvantaged areas of the west should be free of the super-levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the figures for the yield per cow, in the North Connacht Farmers' area it is 530 gallons.  The figure for Cork is 764 gallons while for Waterford it is 877 gallons with an average yield for the country of 734 gallons.  The Minister did a great job in so far as his constituency was concerned.  The average yield for the EEC as a whole is 965 gallons.  We in the west are entitled to some derogation.  The people there are only developing their farms.  Much of this work has been in progress since the completion of the Moy drainage scheme but we are awaiting more arterial drainage works so that agricultural land can be developed further. As Deputy McCartin has pointed out, we in the west are not growers of <Col N="1492" /> cereals.  Taking all these circumstances into consideration, the Minister should grant us some concession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty arises from what is a disastrous decision for Irish farmers and for our dairy industry but this difficulty is more pronounced in the west and in the north-west as illustrated by the figures given by Deputies McCartin and Brennan.  These figures which have been known to the Minister for a long time establish beyond doubt the serious damage that is caused to the development of the dairy industry in the west generally.  The North Connacht Farmers have done a lot to highlight the problems.</P>
      <P>In the short time available to me there are two questions I wish the Minister to answer.  First, why did he promise to representatives he met in November that at the end of the day the least he would look for, if everything else failed, was an exemption for the disadvantaged areas from the super-levy?  Did he seek that exemption and, if not, why not?  I trust the Minister will be able to answer the question today because we may not have the opportunity of raising it again here.</P>
      <P>My second question is to ask the Minister whether on this day, before any final decision is made, he will give a commitment to the west of a major proportion of the 4.65 per cent increase.  We all know that this level of increase spells disaster for the dairy industry but the Government to which Deputy McCartin belongs have accepted it and we must live with it. The least the Minister can do is to show some fairness to the developing farmers in the west where the differential between their levels of production and the national average is equally as great as is the differential between our national average and the EEC average.  I look forward to a favourable response from the Minister to these questions.</P>

      <P>I want to reject the suggestion that I ever promised that any specific part of the country would get preferential treatment in regard to the super-levy because that is 100 per cent incorrect. Our complete negotiating strategy in Europe for the last nine months has been that Ireland as a whole would be treated as one single entity and there was not to be any differentiation between regions or between suppliers big, medium or small. I visited Sligo last September and I pointed out that I would endeavour to see that the north-west area would get the same concession as the Cantal area in France, which is exempt from paying the co-responsibility levy, not the super-levy. Certain mountainous regions of the mainland of Europe have that exemption.</P>
      <P>I have endeavoured and will continue to endeavour to ensure that seriously disadvantaged areas in the west of Ireland will get a similar concession in regard to the co-responsibility levy because I do not accept that the only criterion for exemption from that co-responsibility levy is height above sea level.  The quality of soil, climatic conditions and annual rainfull are just as significant when it comes to granting exemptions as height above sea level.  I have said that at meetings at Councils of Agricultural Ministers and I will persist in my attitude to see that equal treatment is given to people in similar type but different circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened with interest to what Deputy McCartin and other Deputies have stated.  There are, however, some <Col N="1494" /> points about the special arrangements agreed for Ireland which must be taken into account.  Firstly, our chief point in the discussions with the Commission and with the other member states was the great importance to Ireland of the milk industry, an importance which far exceeded the position of milk in the economy of any other member state. Our second point was the comparatively low state of development of milk production in Ireland.  I have heard some interesting statistics quoted, particularly in regard to my own county being the highest county in the country regarding milk production.  I want to point out something very clearly.  Waterford, next to Wicklow, is probably the most mountainous county in the country.  If they have got a high milk yield it is to their credit that they have achieved it in such difficult terrain.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations in Brussels we had to base our case on the country as a whole.  To have to look for a special deal for part of the country would have endangered the success of the whole effort. Had I tried to get a special concession for part of Ireland I would have provoked other Ministers to make similar pleas for disadvantaged parts of their own countries and I am afraid this would have led to confusion and lack of agreement.  The British could have demanded it in respect of Wales, Scotland and the Sperrin mountains in Northern Ireland.  The French could have looked for it in respect of the Cantal region, which is now subjected to the full rigours of the super-levy despite the fact that it is exempt from the imposition of the co-responsibility levy. Similar other areas throughout the Community could have made a case.  What about the mountainous areas of Italy? They could all have demanded a special exemption but they did not.  We were the only ones who got it overall.  They did not even look for a regional exemption in relation to regions which are so very drastically under-privileged and undeveloped.</P>
    <P>As to the way in which the quotas will be allocated within the country here we will, of course, be working on the basis of a quota under what is known as Formula <Col N="1495" /> B, that is the quota will be based on co-operatives and dairies.  Next week my Department will be having discussions with the various interests in the milk industry.  There are still meetings being held by the Commission in Brussels to complete the detailed regulations for operating the super-levy.  I might point out that there will be meetings in Brussels tomorrow and next Tuesday on the details of these regulations.</P>
    <P>There is a provision by which a special quota allocation may be made by member states to producers having special difficulties.  I must, of course, stress that any such allocation would mean a reduction in the quotas for other producers. The type of special quota allocations which I refer to are for farmers who have had difficulties for one reason or another, perhaps due to disease in their cow herds or due to the fact that they are in a very precarious state of development and if their development was halted it would jeopardise their financial position.  Those are the particular type of cases we will be looking at in the coming weeks but any such allocation will have to be made at the expense of other producers.  That is a very difficult area in which to work.  For my part it is simply as if having tread my way rather carefully, if I may say so, through one mine field, then being asked to enter another one.  It is a very difficult area overall.</P>
    <P>I have also to keep in mind that in some parts of our disadvantaged areas there are creamery enterprises as advanced as anywhere in the country.  I <Col N="1496" /> can think of one notable creamery which has been very much in the news in the past year or so.  It is rather too early yet until the discussions I refer to are completed for me to consider the whole method of allocation of quotas.  I will take note of what Deputy McCartin said but I feel in all fairness I must advise him that the allocation of special quotas is going to be a far from easy task.</P>
    <P>With regard to what Deputy McCartin said, I would also like to point out that it is essential that milk production in this country this year exceeds the 6.45 per cent we have been allocated in the Brussels talks.  We must prove that we have the capability and the potential to expand annually far in excess to that, to give ourselves the right to take up the concession which we were given, which was that Ireland would get priority when any further milk supplies become available in Europe during the five year duration of the super-levy proposal.  In the discussions which my Department will be having with representatives of the dairy industry next week, and probably for a number of weeks subsequent to that, it is probable that some interests will be opposed to special arrangements for particular categories of producers or particular areas.  I would rather let the farming organisations and co-operatives have a discussion on that and let them see if they can come to some arrangement before I enter into discussions with them at ministerial level.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will naturally not expect me to comment on particular happenings in this area, and indeed, the Revenue Commissioners are precluded by the confidentiality obligations imposed on them from giving information concerning the tax liabilities of readily identifiable persons. In general, however, the seller of property, whether by way of a raffle or otherwise, is liable to tax on any chargeable gain, that is, the gain after allowance has been made for expenses, arising from the disposal of the property.  The Capital Gains Tax Acts provide rules for determining the amount of a chargeable gain after appropriate relief for indexation of the base cost and the Deputy may rest assured that these Acts, and any other relevant legislation, are strictly enforced by the Revenue Commissioners in all cases.</P>
      <P>The question of the nationality of the owners does not affect the issue in so far as capital gains tax is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of the critical situation of the Irish flour millers due to United Kingdom imports at very low prices; and that many independent flour millers will be out of business by the end of the year if some action is not taken; and in view of the fact that his Department and the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism are concerned, the proposals the Government have to rectify this situation; if the Government will make a case to the EC Commission or with the British authorities to resolve the problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, of course, aware that flour imports from the UK have been causing difficulties for the flour milling industry here. However, EC rules prohibit the imposition of restrictions on imports from other member states and it is in our interest, as a major exporter of agricultural products, that import restrictions generally should not be applied.</P>
      <P>My Department have brought the difficulties caused by the flour imports to the notice of the EC Commission and the UK authorities but again because of EC rules the action open to those authorities is limited.  Essentially what is required is that Irish bakers and other flour users should have regard to the consequences for the economy and for employment generally arising from the use of imported flour.  I have stressed this on a number of occasions in my dealings with these and other interested parties.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the reason he will not transfer a prisoner (details supplied) from Portlaoise Prison who went on hunger strike in support of his demand, particularly since the prisoner insists he has no connection with paramilitaries.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): It is not the practice to give specific reasons for a decision not to transfer a prisoner from one prison to another.  Such decisions are, however, reviewed from time to time in the light of all the circumstances including, where appropriate, the fact that the prisoner has applied for a transfer.</P>
