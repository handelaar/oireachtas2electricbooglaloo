    <Title>Funds of Suitors Bill, 1984: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to enable part of the funds of suitors vested in the Accountant of the Courts of Justice to be withdrawn and applied for the various purposes indicated in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funds of suitors are the cash and securities belonging to suitors and other persons which have been transferred to or paid into or deposited with the High Court.  They consist of moneys or investments transferred or paid into or deposited in court either under the provisions of one or other of a number of statutes &mdash;for example the Auctioneers and House Agents Act, 1947&mdash;or under Rules of Court &mdash; for example Order 22 which provides for the lodgment of a sum of money in satisfaction of a claim before <Col N="1256" /> or at the time of delivery of the defence in certain types of action &mdash; or under some judgment or order of the court made in an administration suit or in some other form of proceedings, or in the form of dividends or interest on court investments or bank deposits.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary way these funds may be used only for the benefit of those entitled to them.  However, a small proportion of the funds is represented by unclaimed balances and dividends which have been accumulating over a long period&mdash;some as long as two centuries. These are know as dormant funds and may be defined more precisely as balances in accounts in the funds of suitors which have not been active for 15 years or more.  I should explain that these funds are essentially a phenomenon of the past and that funds do not become dormant in recent times to any significant extent. The funds of suitors are under the control of the High Court and subject to that control are managed by, and stand in the name of, the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.</P>
    <P>The total liability of the accountant in respect of all funds of suitors on 30 September 1983&mdash;the latest date for which there are published figures&mdash;was just over £98,621,000.  Assets held by the accountant, consisting of cash and securities, amounted to £97,343,000 on that date.  The difference between the amount of liabilities and assets on hands on 30 September 1983 was £1,278,000.  This represents the aggregate of the moneys which have been withdrawn from the funds of suitors over the past 200 years under the authority of various Acts of the Parliament of Ireland, the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Oireachtas. All these Acts indemnified suitors for any loss which they may sustain by reason of the withdrawals, and these indemnities are backed by the Central Fund.  Another way of saying this is that a portion of the funds of suitors, at present amounting to £1,278,000, is not represented by cash or securities held by the accountant, but simply by the liability of the State to indemnify suitors against any loss up to that amount.</P>
    <P>Moneys withdrawn from the funds of <Col N="1257" /> suitors under Acts passed before the establishment of the Oireachtas were applied for such purposes as building and improving the Courts of Justice and enlarging the Law Library.  Coming up to modern times, withdrawals from the funds were authorised by the Oireachtas in 1959, 1963 and in 1966 as follows:</P>
    <P>The Funds of Suitors Act, 1959, enabled a total of £323,000 to be withdrawn for three purposes, namely, to provide assistance towards the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre, to finance repair and renovation of the buildings of the Society of King's Inns and to provide for the creation of a fund for the maintenance of the society's library.</P>
    <P>The Funds of Suitors Act, 1963, authorised the release of a sum of £50,000 to help finance the rebuilding of the Cork Opera House.</P>
    <P>The funds of Suitors Act, 1966, authorised the release of £450,000 to help finance the cost of rebuilding the Abbey Theatre and the completion of the Cork Opera House.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the total of the sums withdrawn to date from the funds of suitors is £1,278,000.  There remained on 31 May 1984 in the dormant accounts assets consisting of cash on deposit and securities to the total nominal value of £2,817,000.  The market value of these assets is marginally higher.</P>
    <P>The money to be withdrawn under the Bill will actually be channelled through the current cash account which is maintained by the accountant of the High Court in the Bank of Ireland to meet all his cash liabilities to suitors on foot of both dormant and live accounts.  As in the case of the previous withdrawals I mentioned, the Bill affords a complete indemnity to suitors by which they will be absolutely protected from any possible loss resulting from the withdrawal of funds under the provisions of this Bill.  I should add that nothing that is proposed in the Bill will affect the rights or the ability of suitors to make claim to any of the dormant funds that it is proposed to withdraw.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1258" /> Before I turn to the objects for which the money would be used, I feel I should make it clear that certain provisions in the Bill are intended to honour commitments given by previous administrations. These are the provisions in relation to the funding of work needed for the repair and renovation of the King's Inns building, and the provision of funds for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  In particular the commitment regarding the King's Inns work was given expression to in the Funds of Suitors Bill, 1981, which made considerable progress under the previous two administrations before it lapsed on the dissolution of the last Dáil.</P>
    <P>As a further preliminary point, I should mention that since I introduced the Bill in the House, the Government decided that certain amendments should be introduced to the provisions of the Bill.  These will provide for some reallocation of funds within the overall amount that may be withdrawn under the terms of the Bill, but they will not involve any change in the overall position.  I will refer to the particular amendments at appropriate points in my speech.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach already announced on 27 February the decision to allocate £600,000 for capital projects in the arts field from the funds that are to be withdrawn under the provisions of this Bill. I am aware that the Minister of State for Arts and Culture, Deputy Ted Nealon, in whose area of responsibility this matter comes, intends to speak about this particular provision in the Bill, so I think it would be appropriate for me to leave any further comment to him.  However, I am aware that the Government have already decided that some of the available funds will go the the Royal Irish Academy of Music.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the proposal to provide funds needed for repair and renovation work on the King's Inns building is not new.  The work involved is considered to be essential for the preservation of the building.  The King's Inns building was the last work in Dublin of James Gandon, the architect who designed the Custom House, the Four Courts, the Military Infirmary and the Westmoreland Street facade of the Bank of Ireland.  The <Col N="1259" /> south wing of the building together with the join section under the cupola is owned by the State and is occupied by the Registry of Deeds.  Altogether the State owns and occupies about two-thirds of the composite King's Inns building.  It is worth noting that two-thirds of the actual building is owned by the State, not by the barristers of King's Inns.</P>
    <P>There is unanimity, amongst those best qualified to judge, that the building which houses the King's Inns and Registry of Deeds is a minor classic and one of the finest buildings of its kind in Dublin.  The part of it which is not owned by the State is listed as a building to be preserved, under the Dublin City Development Plan, 1980.  It is a building of national significance and importance and must feature prominently in the architectural heritage of the nation.  The part of the building which constitutes the King's Inns is used by the Society of King's Inns for the purpose of educating and training barristers.  Perhaps I should clarify that the society's library in Henrietta Street is not part of the building and is not involved in the present proposals.</P>
    <P>Architectural examination of the King's Inns building in 1980, and of the adjoining Registry of Deeds building, revealed that the external stonework of both buildings is in a state of serious decay.  The deterioration in the stonework arises from the age of the material, from atmospheric pollution and from the poor quality of the granite which was used in the building.  The state of the stonework gives rise to a danger of falling masonry, and hoardings have been erected in places to protect the public from injury.  Full repairs to the external stonework of the buildings were estimated in 1981 to cost £1,310,000.</P>
    <P>The Government have accepted that the Society of King's Inns is not in a position to provide the funds needed to carry out the essential and substantial repair work needed to preserve the building which it occupies.  Ordinary maintenance is, of course, another matter and I am informed that the society spent about £150,000 on maintenance and repair work on the building between <Col N="1260" /> 1970 and 1980.  Accordingly, the Government decided that it was necessary to provide, from public sources, the funds needed to preserve an artefact of exceptional historic and aesthetic interest which, on any standards, must rank in the forefront of the architectural heritage of the nation.  Moreover, it is clear that further delays in carrying out the work that is needed would have the effect, at least, of making more expensive and extensive the work that would ultimately have to be done.  It would place the future preservation of this particularly fine building at serious risk.</P>
    <P>The work which will be financed under the Bill will be executed entirely under the control of the Office of Public Works. Accordingly, no money will be paid to the Society of King's Inns under the Bill. The work involved consists mainly of replacing, refacing or repointing the granite stonework of the buildings and repairing the boundary walls, gates and railings surrounding them.  The remainder of the work costing about £100,000 consists of internal works in the building including rewiring and certain works in the basement necessary to prevent the development of fungal infestation.  The internal work is regarded by the Office of Public Works as essential for the preservation of both the King's Inns and Registry of Deeds buildings.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the King's Inns benefited from the funds of suitors before in 1959.  Under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1959, a total of £70,000 &mdash; the present day value of which is £657,774 &mdash; was paid to the trustees of the society.  £25,000 of this was for the creation of an investment fund, and the application of the income thereof for the maintenance of the King's Inns Library, which is not, as I already mentioned, involved in the current renovation project.  The balance of £45,000 went to defray the cost of expenditure incurred in undertaking work of renovation and repair to the King's Inns building which is the subject of the present Bill.  It has of course, proved inadequate to finance renovation work carried out since 1959 but was, in any event, never intended to cater for <Col N="1261" /> works of the kind now found to be necessary.</P>
    <P>The provisions for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann is intended to help to defray part of the cost involved in the extension of their Cultúrlann at Monkstown, Co. Dublin, which was completed in 1983. The Minister for the Gaeltacht will be responsible for putting this provision of the Bill into effect.  His Department already administer an annual grant payable to Comhaltas.  I will be introducing an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage proposing that the amount for Comhaltas should be increased from £250,000 to £300,000.</P>
    <P>I will be proposing a further amendment to the Bill to enable a provision to be included for the payment of an amount of £100,000 from the available funds to the Minister for Labour to provide additional funding for the community, youth, recreational and employment programme, which is administered by the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>I estimate that the balance of the funds available after the above payments have been made will be about £1.19 million. Under the terms of the Bill as introduced this residue would be spent in building a new Children's Court for the District Court in Dublin and, to the extent that funds remained after that, on other projects in the courts area for which the State has responsibility, which it would fall to me to decide.  However, under a further amendment of the Bill, I will be proposing that some of the balance of the funds that will remain after the specific commitments that are included in the Bill have been met, should be available for the provision of legal aid facilities which it will fall to me to decide, in addition to miscellaneous courts projects.</P>
    <P>In the District Court the hearing of charges against children or young people must be held separately from the ordinary sittings of the court.  The 1924 Courts of Justice Act, section 80, provided that a Justice of the District Court should sit once a week, if requisite, in a Special Court in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford to be called &ldquo;The Children's Court&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Up to the late forties the Dublin Metropolitan <Col N="1262" /> Children's Court sat in Court No. 2, Morgan Place, Four Courts, and was then physically separated from the other courts by being housed in Dublin Castle where it remained until November 1981 when it was forced to evacuate the premises at very short notice because they were considered to be in a dangerous condition.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Castle accommodation was long regarded as deficient and unsatisfactory and more than ten years ago plans were prepared for improving the accommodation by internal rearrangement and the construction of an annex to the back of the building.  These plans had to be abandoned, however, following a detailed survey which disclosed that the structure, which is 200 years old, would not stand the proposed alterations.</P>
    <P>Following the evacuation from its former premises in Dublin Castle in 1981, the Dublin Children's Court has been located, temporarily, in the District Court, Morgan Place, which is quite unsuitable for the purpose.  It does not provide adequate waiting facilities and is causing serious disruption for other courts in the location.  It has meant the loss of one courtroom and a judge's room to the District Court, which has adversely affected the disposal of other court business. In fact, the President of the District Court has repeatedly requested the return of the courtroom involved to its normal use to enable him to deal with the ever-lengthening lists that have resulted from the protracted loss of the courtroom.</P>
    <P>Although the provision of new permanent accommodation for the Children's Court has been an urgent priority for some time efforts by the OPW to find suitable accommodation on the market have failed and subsequent plans for the construction of a purpose-built Children's Court at a site owned by the State at Smithfield, Dublin, have had to be shelved due to lack of funds.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I am particularly pleased to be able to have the funds needed to carry out this important development made available under the provisions of this Bill.  The plans for the new Children's Court are being drawn up at <Col N="1263" /> present in the light of the provision in this Bill.  Generally they will include the provision of generous waiting and consultation facilities with conference and duty rooms for probation and welfare officers, so that all who are concerned with the welfare of children who appear before the courts will be adequately facilitated. The plans will include separate waiting areas for gardaí, witnesses and for members of the public.  There will be two courtrooms and judges rooms.  In addition to two consultation and two welfare officers rooms, a retiring room for solicitors will be provided.</P>
    <P>As to the question of what other courts projects might be financed from the remaining funds, I think that until such time as the priority item, that is the building of a new Children's Court, has been completed, and the final cost of that project is known, it would be unrealistic to speculate on what other projects might be included.  Perhaps I should mention that under the law at present local authorities, and not the State, have responsibility for providing and maintaining court accommodation outside Dublin.  It follows that courts projects outside Dublin could not be financed under the provisions in this Bill, under present arrangements.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should emphasise one feature of this Bill which differs from previous Funds of Suitors legislation.  The present Bill will authorise the disposal of all but a nominal amount of 1 per cent of the capital assets in the dormant accounts of the funds of suitors &mdash; and not merely the cash in these funds, to which previous withdrawals were confined.  In practical terms this may involve retaining only about £28,000 of the value of the investments contained in these accounts.  This residue is necessary to enable any successful future claim on the dormant funds to be valued accurately.  However, the amount does not affect the ability of the accountant of the High Court to meet any such future claim because of the inclusion in the Bill of the usual indemnity provision in favour of suitors.  Incidentally the incidence of such claims is rare.  I understand that claims totalling <Col N="1264" /> about £1,400 were paid out of dormant funds in the last decade.</P>
    <P>The consent of the Chief Justice has been obtained to the withdrawal of the moneys which the Government propose to use for the purposes indicated in this Bill, as this involves the withdrawal of moneys which come, at present, within the sole jurisdiction of the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is the provision which enables the accountant of the High Court to realise the existing investments in the dormant accounts subject to the retention of stock to the value of 1 per cent of these investments for the purpose that I have mentioned already.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is the provision which enables cash in the funds of suitors to be devoted to the various purposes that I have mentioned. As in the case of previous withdrawals from the funds of suitors, section 5 of the Bill affords a complete indemnity to suitors against any loss they might otherwise sustain as a result of the enactment of the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill is a provision to extend, temporarily, the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works to carry out work on the King's Inns, which is not a public building.  Under existing legislation the Commissioners of Public Works are empowered to undertake work only in relation to public buildings and the extended powers which the Bill confers relate exclusively to work on the King's Inns and will expire, at the latest, after five years.  The provision also restricts the amount which the commissioners may expend on this work to the amount of £600,000 provided under section 3 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The release of funds from the courts accounts is not equivalent to authorising the spending of the taxpayers' money, but it seems to me to call for the same level of responsibility and I am satisfied that each one of the proposals to which this money will be devoted is most deserving of immediate assistance and that it is necessary that the dormant funds of suitors should be used in the ways proposed in this Bill.  Were it not for the availability of these funds at the present time I have little doubt that demands on the Exchequer for finance to meet the <Col N="1265" /> cost of the various proposals that will be financed through the withdrawal of these funds would be even greater.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset to thank the Minister for giving us such a detailed explanation of the Funds of Suitors Bill.  Most people find it difficult to understand funds of suitors.  The Minister has outlined very clearly where they come from and how they come to be available at this time.  The principal element we have to recognise is that these are windfall moneys which are available to the State and to the Oireachtas to be allocated in the Bill before us for purposes which would not otherwise be covered.  That is what one would expect to be done with funds which are a windfall. Consequently we support and welcome many of the things the Minister has said and the way in which he has outlined them.  We are very concerned that these moneys should be used specifically for purposes which should not normally be covered by the State or by somebody else.</P>
      <P>I should like to raise a number of questions about the funds which, as far as I can see, the Minister has not covered. The Bill provides only for the disposal of funds of suitors lying dormant in the office of the accountant of the courts of justice.  That means funds lying dormant in the High Court.  It does not refer to funds lying dormant in the office of the county registrar, the Circuit Court, the District Court, or in the office of the clerk of the District Court.  I should like the Minister to clear up the point whether those funds are actually included in the funds mentioned as lying dormant in the office of the accountant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister proposes to use the windfall funds as he has taken great pains to show us, for such purposes as they were used in the past, for instance, the completion of the Cork Opera House and the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre.  These would appear to be suitable uses for windfall funds which are available in this way.  We would expect to look at problems which we have along those lines and <Col N="1266" /> which we would not be able to deal with otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to allocate £600,000 to culture and the arts within the meaning of the 1951 Act as the Taoiseach may determine.  This is very welcome. Presumably these allocations will be in line with the intentions of the House in the making available of extra funds which would not otherwise be available. We do not want to see these funds used to replace money which should be made available in the normal way to particular groups involved in culture and the arts.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he wishes to allocate £250,000 to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and in an amendment which he is putting before the House later he plans to increase this figure to £300,000.  We welcome the application of funds to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann as a suitable application for these projects for a group who are in difficulties at the moment and who need the funds.  Comhaltas Ceoltóirí have considerable financial problems at present, due mainly to the fact that they were promised a grant in 1982 but that was not forthcoming.  They went ahead with the work and now they have a very substantial deficit which is worsening their position daily.  The non-payment of a funds of suitors grant which was promised in 1982 and, secondly, a reduction in the annual organisation grant from Roinn na Gaeltachta which was reduced in 1982 from £125,000 to £110,000 and which has been kept at that level, have added to their difficulties.</P>
    <P>Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann have undertaken very extensive work programmes. Members of the House will recognise that they are making a considerable contribution to cultural development, particularly in the area of folk music and Irish music and culture generally. They have 400 branches throughout the country, they organise many tours and Fleánna Ceoil and their functions are attended by approximately 750,000 people annually.  This gives an indication of their influence and effect on the country as a whole and their importance.</P>
    <P>Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann have also played a part in promoting reconciliation <Col N="1267" /> in the North of Ireland which they outlined clearly in their submission to the New Ireland Forum.  They have 60 branches in the North of Ireland comprising members from both communities. They are a group who have an influence and an effect in almost every parish throughout the country and whose work is worthy of support.  Currently they have considerable difficulties.  Their debts are in the region of £750,000 and because of high interest charges these debts are growing rapidly.</P>
    <P>We support the Minister's approach in making further funds available in this instance and in increasing the amount from £250,000 to £300,000.  However, our position is that a further £250,000 should be applied to Comhaltas, bringing the amount to £500,000 and I have to put down an amendment to that effect.  This was our view, irrespective of the amendment which the Minister circulated late last evening.  I am not criticising the Minister for circulating it late in the evening: we know the circumstances of the Dáil at present and the amount of business that is underway.</P>
    <P>Our view is that a figure of £500,000 is necessary to overcome the difficulties Comhaltas Ceoltóirí face at present.  We consider these are suitable windfall funds and this is a most suitable purpose to which to apply the funds.  I am putting down such an amendment on behalf of Fianna Fáil and we will ask the Minister to consider increasing the figure. We consider he is going in the right direction in increasing the amount from £250,000 to £300,000 but that will not meet the problem and they will be left with a debt of £450,000.  Therefore, the problem will remain with them in view of the high interest charges.  Comhaltas are making strenuous efforts to raise funds to put themselves back on a strong financial basis.  They are taking measures to tighten up their management and their administration.  They undertook a major investment in the Comhaltas headquarters at Monkstown and in the development of the cultural institute at Monkstown. Indeed, the closure of that institute is imminent unless the problem is solved <Col N="1268" /> quickly.  This group are contributing in a major way to the cultural life of the country and they fully deserve our support.  In our view they need at least £500,000 from these funds and since they are available as windfall funds we believe they should be given this help.</P>
    <P>The other works the Minister mentions include the King's Inns where not more than £600,000 may be applied in or towards defrayal of the cost of carrying out the works specified in section 4.  The work is being carried out by the Office of Public Works and money is being applied to them for that purpose.  Therefore, this is work that the State should normally undertake in its programme through the Office of Public Works and, consequently, the amount of money applied for that purpose in this Bill would seem to be excessive.</P>
    <P>In finding additional moneys for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann we would have no objection to the Minister deducting these from the £600,000 that may be applied towards the cost of carrying out the works at King's Inns.  There are many questions about this that must be put.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the State has control over 60 per cent or two-thirds of the buildings in the King's Inns and I should like him to clarify that.  I take it he means that the King's Inns hold the fee simple and make it available to the State at a certain rent?  Alternatively, have they been transferred entirely to the State?</P>

      <P>We are aware that the Registry of Deeds is there.  It is very difficult to get information about the activities of the King's Inns, as the Minister may appreciate.  If one goes to the Incorporated Law Society one can get their published annual accounts and see <Col N="1269" /> what is going on there in relation to their activities and accounts.  However, there are not similar accounts in relation to the King's Inns and it is a matter of some public concern that the funds are being allocated to a body who have no direct public accountability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not spend too much time looking backwards.  There are plenty of people doing that.  In any event, there is concern about the way that moneys of this order will be applied.  The Minister has covered part of that in pointing out that the King's Inns are under the control of the State and he also said that absolute ownership is under the State. That will certainly clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance of the King's Inns is owned by King's Inns themselves and these are a private group who are in possession of an historic building which is of immense value to the city of Dublin and which should be maintained and repaired.  The Minister has outlined the reasons for that so I need not go into them again and I agree with him in that respect.  Nevertheless, we must face the fact that the King's Inns will benefit as a result and in doing so, under the measures which have been outlined by the Minister, will provide no element of public accountability or indeed no account of any sort in relation to the running and management of that building.  The Minister said the King's Inns cannot afford to pay for this repair work themselves.  We are all involved in running community centres now and the community are expected to make a contribution towards <Col N="1270" /> such centres.  Could the King's Inns not make a contribution?  When religious orders are setting up schools they are expected to make a contribution because it will be their property eventually.  I know they only make a contribution of about 10 per cent but nevertheless it is a help.  It is hard to believe that the King's Inns cannot make any contribution and I should like the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <P>The King's Inns have made their facilities available to the public.  Their park is available and the rooms within the King's Inns are made available to groups and charitable organisations for various uses. The park and grounds are opened to the public during daylight hours and residents in the area have no other green space available to them and make good use of the facility.  A room has been made available in the building to the State for use as a court.  The High Court have sat there for about 100 days over the past 12 months.  The King's Inns also provides for about 500 students on a four year course.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that the Kings's Inns have, in recent years, contributed £150,000 to the renovation of the buildings but that at present because of atmospheric pollution, increased porosity of the granite, moisture being absorbed into the joints and so on, major works need to be done.  The money for these works will be paid to the Office of Public Works who would do the necessary repairs.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister in his plan to maintain this historic building but, as I said, some contribution should be made by the King's Inns in relation to the portion which is their private property.  I am not going to go into the antiquity of the Inns or the elite nature of this profession. People are surprised at the fact that you can still have requirements in a course to take so many dinners in a year and so on. From what the Minister said, it is quite clear that none of this money is going to wine cellars or luxuries in the King's Inns and, therefore, the works which are specified appeared to be very necessary and worthwhile.  At this stage, the Minister has an opportunity to try to bring some element of accountability and perhaps <Col N="1271" /> some contribution into the King's Inns and perhaps to require that accounts should be produced at intervals because it is adding to the capital value of the society.</P>
    <P>For what other purposes can the moneys be allocated?  The Minister has also proposed that funds would be allocated to the Children's Court to improve the services there and he has gone into that in some detail.  That would be very welcome and we would naturally support it. We look forward to these facilities being provided.  He has also said that in one of his amendments he intends to provide funds for legal aid facilities.  He will deal with this later and will have the authority under the Bill to make such provisions.</P>
    <P>Another area which the Minister might consider is the very urgent need for a centre for the rehabilitation of young drug addicts.  This impinges on the court area and on the work of the Department of Justice because so many of these drug addicts end up in jail because of drug-related crime.  They are not being adequately catered for under the system at present because we do not have the facilities to deal with them.  It is a very urgent need at present, especially for young people who are very badly catered for.  It is now an emergency and should not be left until funds are available from the Minister for Finance.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the needs in this area and that the impact of work done in the rehabilitation of young offenders who have been involved in drug-related crime would pay very substantial dividends.  It is clear from work done elsewhere that it is not possible to put all these drug-related offenders back on the road to recovery or to rehabilitate them, but the proportion who can be rehabilitated is substantial.  Consequently they are taken out of the area of crime and given an opportunity to lead useful lives.  I would ask the Minister to consider a centre for the rehabilitation of young drug addicts from the funds available here.  If the other funds to which I have referred are not included in the total which has been given, perhaps this could be looked at. These are the funds lying dormant in the <Col N="1272" /> High Court.  It does not refer to the funds lying dormant in the Office of the County Registrar in the Circuit Court or in the District Court.  If there are further funds lying dormant there, they should be used for some of these excellent purposes.</P>
    <P>Since introducing the Bill the Minister has obviously considered some relevant improvements and has tabled some amendments.  Through his suggestions he has already improved the allocation of these funds in a way which should have the support of this House.  We are asking him to go further in relation to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and to bear in mind the need for a rehabilitation centre for young offenders.</P>
    <P>We welcome these windfall moneys and the opportunity to allocate the funds to purposes which would not otherwise be covered.  We hope the Minister will keep this in the forefront of his mind and ensure that the Minister for Finance does not take the opportunity to switch from other allocations which he would normally make.  This can happen all too often.  This is an unusual opportunity and the funds should be used for special high priority projects, particularly in the area of the culture and the arts and the work done by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the broad principle under which the dormant funds of suitors lying in the courts should be brought back to life and put to good public use.  This is a principle which all of us would support.  I would mention as a brief aside that one would wonder how much there is by way of dormant funds lying in the banks.  It must amount to many millions.  Perhaps on some occasion this Minister or the Minister for Finance would have a look at that aspect and see whether there is any method by which dormant funds in the banks might be put to public use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the items thrown up in this Bill give rise to very serious concern.  The Minister indicated that the proposed grant of £600,000 to the King's Inns is being included in the Bill to honour commitments given by previous administrations. We need to know a lot more about that.  What administrations?  What is <Col N="1273" /> meant by &ldquo;administration&rdquo;?  Does it mean a vote in this House?  Does it mean a committee?  Does it mean the Cabinet? Does it mean the Government?  What Government?  Who was the Taoiseach? Who were the Ministers?  I had thought that we in this House, the Members of Dáil Éireann, were the ones who, under the Constitution, gave commitments to dispense with public moneys, not administrations. Are we years later bound by a commitment given by an administration, whatever that is?  Is it suggested that we in Dáil Éireann are obligated to honour a commitment other than a commitment in a Bill enacted by the Oireachtas?</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about a grant of £600,000 from these moneys to the King's Inns.  The King's Inns are the professional controlling body of the barristers' profession.  They have as their headquarters the King's Inns building in Henrietta Street which adjoins the Registry of Deeds building, a Government property.  The latter building is in need of repair and nobody could call into question the need to spend money on it since it is a public building.  The King's Inns building is very fine, a minor classic.  I was in it on one occasion and it is magnificent. The crucial point is that it is a private building belonging to a private professional body.  There are many such bodies.  Solicitors, architects, doctors and engineers have them and all of them have their buildings, some of which may be minor classics too.  Does it mean that one of these bodies can come to the Government in times of economic stringency seeking to obtain a massive amount of money?  It raises very serious questions and I am very unhappy about it.</P>
    <P>This building is not open to the public, minor classic though it be.  The public cannot view the magnificant vaulted ceilings, cornice work, chandeliers and so on.  Deputy Woods made what I can only regard as a pretty poor apologia along these lines.  He referred to the fact that the public have the benefit of the park but the park is referable as much to the Registry of Deeds as to the King's Inns. He made the point that it was useful as a right of way to go through from Broad-stone to Henrietta Street but £600,000 is <Col N="1274" /> a high price to pay for a pedestrian access which is there as much by courtesy of the Registry of Deeds as the King's Inns.</P>
    <P>The King's Inns have already obtained substantial amounts of public moneys from these funds.  The sum of £323,000 was given in the Funds of Suitors Act, 1959, towards the rebuilding of the Abbey, a magnificent project which I would wholeheartedly support, and also to finance the repair and renovation of the King's Inns.  Again the same body are coming along for a substantial allocation of public funds.  I do not accept the description &ldquo;windfall moneys&rdquo;.  These are public moneys which the Government are taking under their control to distribute.  They are being distributed. They are taking these moneys &mdash; admittedly not raised by taxation&mdash;under their control to distribute.  In my view that makes them public moneys and we should call a spade a spade on this issue.</P>
    <P>In 1959 they received a substantial sum.  What is so special about the King's Inns?  What is so special about their premises that they, and they alone, must be so honoured with the dispensation of £600,000 of public money?  There is a community centre in my constituency in Greenhills which is not used for the lack of perhaps £20,000 or £30,000 which is urgently needed by a substantial densely populated area there.  Would they be considered for something out of a Funds of Suitors Bill?  In common with other organisations up and down the country, of which there must be many hundreds, I should imagine they would get fairly short shrift if they attempted to do so. Therefore, what is special about the King's Inns is something that escapes me. There are very many public projects which are open to members of the public crying out for funds.  For example, I have seen reports that the National Museum is in a critical condition for want of funds, that many of their artifacts and exhibits are being destroyed because they cannot be provided with storage and cover, let alone put on public view.  The National Museum at least is a public institution.  It is open to members of the public and adults and children can go there and learn something whereas the King's Inns is not <Col N="1275" /> open to the public view.  I would contend that it behoves wealthy professional bodies, such as the Society of King's Inns, solicitors and anybody else, to so arrange their financial affairs that their headquarters and institutions are provided for.  The subscriptions which are levied on members of professional bodies over the years &mdash; and goodness knows the Society of King's Inns has been there a very long time; they are one of the oldest professional bodies in the country&mdash;should be organised at a rate which will maintain their premises at the level they require. That is a matter for them.  The State cannot undertake responsibility for, and does not undertake responsibility for, the maintenance and construction works of every minor classic up and down the country, or every major classic building either.  I would like to see the King's Inns building preserved&mdash;it is a James Gandon Building&mdash;that is fine but that must be done by the private institution that owns it and not from public funds.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I see that in 1959 they also received a substantial sum of money for the maintenance of the society's library.  I am sure it is a very fine library. But I remember seeing a report some while back saying that they had sold off a substantial proportion of the books out of their library, that they had raised quite a substantial sum of money as a result of having sold some of the valuable assets in the form of old and antiquarian books they had there.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicates that the Society of King's Inns is not in a position to provide the funds.  That is unfortunate but it is nobody's fault but their own and the fact that they do not have the funds to maintain their headquarters is regrettable. I am sure they are not alone in that. There are many worthy community organisations that likewise find themselves short of funds in these difficult times.  In the public eye, at a time of high unemployment, at a time of real hardship being exercised by so many of our people, for it to be seen that £600,000 of public money is distributed in this way must be a source of grave and serious concern to say the least.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> I regard as firstclass the money being provided for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann&mdash;a very worthwhile organisation. The necessity for funds for the new Children's Court could not be faulted either.  The provision for legal aid is to be very much welcomed and I do so very strongly indeed.</P>
    <P>The provision of £600,000 for the arts is something I welcome also but I do have some concern about the manner in which it is to be dispensed.  I see from the Bill that a sum of £600,000 for the arts is to be given into the sole discretion of the Taoiseach.  I must admit that that raises some questions in my mind.  I wonder is that the appropriate way to deal with the dispensation of £600,000 for the arts?  I have no doubt whatever that the Taoiseach has a very fine appreciation of the broad spectrum of the arts but to give the dispensation of a very substantial sum of money like that into the hands of any one person, be it the Taoiseach or someone else, is something that should not be done.  There is an Arts Council who are well disposed and well qualified to do that.  While I support the provision of the money for the arts&mdash;at least it does have a public thrust&mdash;some further consideration ought be given to the manner of dispensation of that money.  It would not be helpful at all if the impression were to be given that this was some kind of slush fund, or something of that nature, given into the personal disposition of the Taoiseach. Rather it should be dispensed, perhaps on consideration by the Arts Council, or perhaps some other like committee along with them who could examine necessary objects, where improvements in the arts were necessary, and have it dispensed in that way.  Subject to those qualifications I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for his clarification of the purpose of this Bill and its provisions, and of the work that is to be done on the renovation of King's Inns.  I particularly welcome the extra moneys being provided for the community, youth, recreational and employment programme administered by the Department of Labour.  I fully support the provision of £100,000 there.  I support <Col N="1277" /> also the establishment of permanent accommodation for the Children's Court. With regard to other court projects I would hope we would hear from the Minister what is the present position outside the Dublin area.  As he correctly pointed out in his introductory remarks, outside the Dublin area local authorities have responsibility for providing and maintaining courts.  Bearing in mind the financial problems at present being encountered by local authorities it appears that they will be restricted in endeavouring to provide such court facilities.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers I, too, would question why such a large amount of money is being made available to the Society of King's Inns.  It has been pointed out already that a total of £323,000 was given to them in 1959 with a further provision of £600,000 under section 3 of this Bill. The Minister has detailed some of the work to be done there.  I should like to ask the Minister some questions about the replacement of the electric wiring and the renovation of the basement.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us if there will be any practical use made of the basement of that building.  It is not very practical for the Minister to say that money is being spent to prevent fungal infestation if there is not going to be any practical use made of the basement.  Surely that part of the building could be used for meetings.  If it is not to be used, would it not be better to seal it off altogether rather than expending that amount of money thereon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the Minister's introductory remarks were devoted to the King's Inns. I would have preferred that he would have talked more about culture and the arts.  I had been hoping that most of the moneys to be made available under the provisions of this Bill would have been allocated towards cultural and arts projects. In the past money has been provided for the Cork Opera House and the Abbey Theatre.  It is intended under this Bill to allocate funds to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and in my contribution I shall deal with the grant to that body. A sum of £250,000 is not sufficient for that body and the Minister's proposal to increase the amount by £50,000 will not <Col N="1278" /> help a great deal.  In fact, even with that grant CCE will be in serious financial difficulties.  The Minister has stated that the money is to defray the expenses involved in building An Cultúrlann.  CCE make the point that had they got the grants promised to them in the past, particularly the capital grant promised in 1981, they would not have problems in An Cultúrlann.  The organisation is concerned that the level of grant has not been maintained in recent years.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time that the King's Inns has got money from the Government. We have suggested that the Government pay £500,000 to CCE.  That amount would put the organisation back on a more sound financial footing.  I note that the grant from the Arts Council to Comhaltas has remained static for the last three years at £59,000.  One must bear in mind that the total budget of the Arts Council is £5½ million but the contribution to Comhaltas is very small, although there is majority support for our native culture and music.  In fact, less than 2 per cent of the budget of the Arts Council is allocated to native culture and music.  Comparisons have been made by CCE to the amount allocated to other art forms such as ballet and opera.  I understand that ballet received £400,000 while opera received £350,000 per annum. Comhaltas are only seeking parity with other art forms which obtain between 8 per cent and 10 per cent of the budget of the Arts Council.  Those promoting Irish music and culture should receive an allocation similar to other art forms.</P>
    <P>Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann has been in existence for 33 years and has branches in the 32 counties.  Groups have been organised in Great Britian, the USA, Canada, France, Sweden, Luxembourg and Australia.  One of the features of the organisation is that Irish people living in those countries have managed to keep Irish music popular among emigrants.  In all there are 400 branches promoting Irish music, song and dance.  Functions organised by Comhaltas such as Céilíthe and seisiúin are attended by 750,000 people annually.  We must also take into account the part the organisation plays in the tourist industry.  Comhaltas is particularly <Col N="1279" /> active during the tourist season.  At a time when we are endeavouring to attract more visitors to Ireland we should be helping groups such as Comhaltas.  I accept that one of the difficulties in regard to that industry concerns our high VAT rates but we are not doing much to help an organisation such as Comhaltas that has made great strides in entertaining tourists.</P>
    <P>The Minister has helped in some way by increasing the allocation to Comhaltas by £50,000 but bearing in mind that the grant from the Arts Council has remained static for many years and that the grant from Roinn na Gaeltachta to Comhaltas has been reduced since 1982 the Government should do everything possible to increase the allocation.  In fact, Comhaltas deserves the highest allocation under the Bill.  I suggest that the Minister reduce the allocation to the King's Inns by £250,000 and pass that on to Comhaltas.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that Comhaltas made a submission to the New Ireland Forum pointing out how they had managed to bring people of different creeds and political views together.  They have promoted co-operation and harmony throughout the island.  Having proceeded with the building of An Cultúrlann they were disappointed that State funding to them decreased.  It is estimated that State funding to the organisation decreased by 50 per cent in real terms in recent years.  As a member of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann I support the call for extra money for that organisation especially when there is majority support for Irish culture, music, song and dance.  That organisation should be given priority.</P>
    <P>I note that money will be provided under the Bill for the Children's Court in Dublin and the King's Inns which is also located in Dublin but our organisation covers the entire island.  Irish emigrants are concerned about the drop in State funding to the organisation.  Many Irish people in America have expressed the view to me in the course of letters that the entire organisation is in danger because of lack of funds, particularly An Cultúrlann which is the focal point for <Col N="1280" /> Comhaltas.  It would be disastrous if An Cultúrlann was forced to close down due to a lack of funds.  I hope to talk on this again on Committee Stage, and I hope the Minister will accept, as we propose, that £500,000 be given to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  I thank him again for his clarification of matters when introducing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that these funds that have been held effectively in the courts for so long are now being made available for public purposes. I welcome also the Minister's initiative in not merely, in a sense, using some of the interest but using some of the capital at a time when funds are scarce.  I would like to concentrate my remarks on two or three aspects of the Minister's speech, but initially I will deal with what I would describe as the Dutch auction being run by the party opposite.  Every Member of this House recognises the worthiness of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and their great contribution to national life and the way the organisation has knitted together Irish communities outside this country. In recognition of the worthiness of this organisation their needs have been met fully by this Government in a way that the Opposition party never intended to meet them.  The original proposal in this Bill as published was to provide £250,000 for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  The Minister has indicated in this House this morning that he is increasing it to £300,000.  That is to be welcomed, but what is the attitude of the Opposition?  It is not to say, &ldquo;It is a good idea to give the extra £50,000&rdquo;.  They do not want to give them £300,000; they want to give them £500,000.  Why not say £600,000, £700,000 or £800,000?  It is curious that Deputy Woods and his colleagues adopt this approach particularly in the light of the fact that their own Government in 1982, when seeking to decide what funds should be made available to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann out of the funds of suitors, proposed to give them £200,000. When did Deputy Woods suddenly have this great thought?  Was he lying in the bath one night contemplating his big toe when suddenly the thought came to him, <Col N="1281" />&ldquo;We should not give Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann £200,000, we should give them £500,000&rdquo;?  How did he light on the figure of £500,000?  Was there some magical reason for holding on to that figure?  Why was it not £600,000 or £400,000?</P>

      <P>Why were his Government in 1982 proposing to give Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann £200,000, £100,000 less than this Government are making available to them?  Let us not beat about the bush on this question.  This is the sort of spurious political debate that goes on regularly in this House and demeans the standing of politicians.  Members of this House who when in Government knew that their own party were going to do something, come into this House 12 or 16 months later and propose something at total variance with the proposals of their own party when in Government.  That is why comments made by Members of this House on important areas of our national life lack credibility with members of the public.  Why could Deputy Woods not have the generosity to come into this House on this Bill and congratulate the Minister on making available to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann £100,000 more by way of funds than his own party were prepared to make available to them?</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy is unaware of what his party would have done if they were in Government, but he is certainly aware that approximately 18 months ago his own party were proposing to make available £100,000 less to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann than are the present Government.  Why must the Deputy engage in political posturing in this House by implying that larger funds would be made available to them by the Fianna Fáil Party today if they were in Government?  If he thinks he can deceive or fool the general public or the many members of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in this way he is mistaken.  I congratulate the Minister on making this allocation of £300,000 available to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  It is very worthy.  I congratulate him on not simply producing a Bill duplicating what his predecessor was going to do and for approaching this legislation with a degree of innovation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with two aspects of the Bill in a little more detail than Members on any side of the House have yet dealt with them.  First, I want to deal with that aspect of the Minister's proposal in which he states that he is going to use some of the funds made available for the purpose of legal aid.  This was not proposed to be done in the original Bill published or this Bill, and I welcome the fact that the Minister intends to provide additional funds pursuant to this Bill for the legal aid system.  It should be recognised that the Minister in doing so has taken into account submissions and representations made to him by members of both the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party that he should make such funds available. That is an indication of the openness of this Minister and his willingness to listen to submissions and representations from Deputies in this House, and when legislation <Col N="1283" /> is produced for Second Stage he is open to introducing aspects or making amendments in it to meet needs or legal requirements after he has examined them.  He is willing to meet reasonable proposals put to him.  It is fair to say that a number of Deputies on the Government side, including myself, requested that the Minister look at the possibility of providing funds for legal aid out of the Funds of Suitors Bill and I welcome the fact that he has been able to do so.</P>
    <P>In this context I hope the Minister will be able to clarify a number of matters, although he may not be able to do so at this stage.  It is not clear from the Bill what the exact allocation of funds will be for legal aid and the Minister may wish to give that some consideration.  I do not wish to tie him down on that but I would like a general indication of the amount of money being made available for the purpose of legal aid.  I welcome the provision of these moneys because the existing civil legal aid system &mdash; I presume that the moneys will be granted to the civil legal aid system at least, not the criminal legal aid system &mdash; as it is operating by the provision of State law centres is under severe pressure, unable to cope with the amount of work that the lawyers in those centres are asked to cope with, and has always been inadequate to meet the needs that exist for legal aid.  It should be recognised now that first, too few solicitors are employed in the individual law centres as they exist under the State system of legal aid; secondly, there are not sufficient numbers of such law centres. The law centres as they operate at present are vastly over-worked.</P>
    <P>Frequently there is the situation, particularly in Dublin where there are three law centres, that the personnel are overworked to such an extent that they refuse to take any new legal work for a period.  There have been occasions when the law centres at Gardiner Street, at Aston Quay and at Ormond Quay were closed in relation to taking on new clients.  The situation now is that anyone seeking legal assistance through the civil legal aid system will have to wait at least <Col N="1284" /> a month before gaining access to a lawyer. My information is that at the moment one of the law centres is not taking on new clients.  This problem has existed during the period of office of the last three successive Governments.  The time has come for us to review the workings of the law centres and to re-examine the manner in which we are dealing with this area.  One hopes that some of the moneys being made available by the Minister for legal aid will be made available to the State civil legal aid centres to ensure that at least they can provide a proper, adequate and speedy service.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that there have been in existence law centres established by way of, in a sense, ministerial <i>diktat</i> or under the aegis of the Department of Justice without any legislation having been introduced here such as that suggested by the Pringle Committee in terms of the provision of a comprehensive legal aid system. We recognise that at a time of economic difficulty when we are trying to cut back on financial expenditure and when the taxpayers are overtaxed we may not be in a position to provide the type of comprehensive civil legal aid system envisaged by the Pringle Committee but in the context of dealing with the whole area of legal aid, I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of introducing statutory provision to deal with this whole question, to provide for a situation in which the present type of legal aid system could operate and in which there would be room for expansion by way of ministerial regulation as finances became available.  What we have now is a hotchpotch system of legal aid that is unco-ordinated as between civil legal aid and the criminal legal aid areas and which is not properly accountable to this House.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Minister's suggestion of allocating funds to the legal aid system, this is an area in which I have a great interest.  I am speaking here as one who was involved in the free legal advice centres from 1970, from shortly after they started, and as one who was both a former director of a free legal advice centre and a chairman of the free legal advice centres.  It was as a result of my work with the centres in the early seventies that I <Col N="1285" /> became involved to such an extent in the area of family law and in trying to solve many of the social problems being experienced then and which are still being experienced.</P>
    <P>When I was director of the free legal advice centres in 1974, we opened the Coolock Community Law Centre which is the only community law centre in the State.  It is a different type of centre from the Government-sponsored law centres which effectively seek to provide legal advice.  The law centre at Coolock is one which in the context of community centres seeks to involve itself with the local community and to meet not merely individual legal needs but group needs and also to assist in advising people of their legal rights and in acting on behalf of representative groups within the community. This has been done in the context not merely of employing solicitors to give legal advice but also in the context of employing community officers.  That type of centre represents a philosophy that is different from that of the Government-sponsored law centres.  The Coolock Law Centre is about to celebrate a decade of existence so it is opportune that we pay tribute not only to those involved in the centre at the time it was opened but to all those who have been involved in it since.  The centre operates on a shoestring budget and has provided a service of a kind that has made a tremendous contribution to the people of Coolock.  It has provided us with a prototype of what the ideal law centre should be.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to consider seriously the proposal from the free legal advice centres to establish a community law centre at Tallaght.  I am surprised that Deputy Taylor has not referred to this proposal.  Tallaght has a growing community.  It has a population equivalent to that of Cork or Limerick.  The community at Tallaght are not served by a Government-sponsored law centre or by any type of comprehensive legal aid service.  The population of Tallaght is in the region of 60,000 but is expected to be about 90,000 by the year 1990.</P>
    <P>The free legal advice centres have submitted to the Minister comprehensive proposals for the establishment of a community <Col N="1286" /> law centre to service the new satellite town of Tallaght.  I should like to endorse the sentiments expressed by the centres and to publicly support them. There is a need in Tallaght for a community law centre on the lines of the one that has worked so well at Coolock.  I appreciate that the Minister may not be in a position to provide the total amount by way of funds that the free legal advice centres are seeking for this project but I recall that when the centre at Coolock was opened, the expenditure was far less, even on a comparative basis, than is being sought for a community law centre at Tallaght.  Until such time as the State is in a position to provide a comprehensive legal advice service and civil legal aid by way of proper statutory provision, the Minister should encourage the establishment of other law centres and the type of diversity of approach that exists between the Government law centres and the community law centres.  By observing the different types of operation involved, the effectiveness of the different types of centres could be monitored.  The Government law centres do not fulfil the concept of community law centres as envisaged either in the Pringle Report or as operated in most countries in the world.  The Coolock community law centre in particular fulfils that concept.</P>
    <P>In the interest not only of the people of Tallaght but of the community generally, the free legal aid centres have proved by way of a clear record over a number of years that they are able to run community law centres.  They operate efficiently on a shoestring budget and with less expenditure than it takes to run any Government law centre.  They should be given an opportunity to open a further community law centre.  The Minister should consider this project.</P>
    <P>The contributors from Fianna Fáil had no comments to make on this area.  No doubt someone will be thrown into the debate to reiterate what I have just said. It is an indication of their failure to acknowledge social needs.  It shows their lack of social awareness and commitment. No member of the party has dealt with the legal aid problem or with the problem which many thousands of people <Col N="1287" /> face who require legal services for essential reasons.  Very often they are battered or deserted wives seeking legal assistance to obtain the basic supports and protection of life.  It is noteworthy that the Opposition have little or nothing to say in that area.  The Minister's interest in this area and his willingness to make additional funds available, which he indicated this morning by saying he would introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to enable funds to be allocated for legal aid, is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite welcomed the idea of providing funds for the children's court in Dublin.  Apart from that there was no detailed examination of the proposal.  I welcome the Minister's intention in principle. There has been a crying need for a new children's court in the Dublin area for decades.  The Kennedy Report produced in 1970 spoke about the inadequacies of the children's court as it operated in Dublin Castle.  In 1966 the Tuairim Report dealt with the inadequacies of the court structure in dealing with children.  In 1980 the task force on child care made recommendations for the introduction of a children's court.  Despite that there were no proposals to deal with this area until the Minister published the Bill before us. I welcome the Minister's recognition of the needs in this area and his commitment to provide facilities which have been required for many years in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to create any difficulties for the Minister when I say that I must make some comments in the welcome I give to this.  I mean them as constructive comments and not destructive.  While undoubtedly there is need for a new children's court in Dublin there is equally a need for a radical change in the administration of children's law and juvenile justice.  That is not an issue on which we can go into detail on this Bill but the point is worth making that the long-awaited Children Bill which the Minister for Health keeps promising but has not produced is supposed to radically reform areas of law dealing with problems relating to the taking of children into care and the problems relating to children who commit criminal offences.  The task force <Col N="1288" /> on child care contained a number of recommendations in this area, the vast majority of which I agree with.  In the context of changes in the children's law to move away from the statutory provisions we have had since 1908, it is clear we will have to provide new structures, procedures and new types of courts to deal with children and the law.</P>

      <P>If the Chair will bear with me I will deal with the question of children's courts which was dealt with in this Bill.  In the context of determining what type of children's court we want in Dublin or elsewhere one must have some philosophy about how to deal with this area.  The type of legislation which will be introduced by the Minister for Health must indicate the kind of court structure we will have for children.  The Minister's proposals seem to envisage establishing a children's court simply to operate on the basis of the legal system we have at present.  I do not intend this as a criticism of the Minister but I am not sure if the manner of arranging the facilities in the children's court will be adequate.  From my experience of these courts, particularly in the area of the family law court, the boffins in the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice who designed them might think that their designs are practical but they are not. Very often they do not provide the type of facilities which the political heads in the Department of Justice would want to see provided.  The report of the task force on child care stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recommend that, apart from the courtroom, rooms should be made available for courtroom conferences involving parents and representatives of other interested agencies.  There should be separate accommodation for consultations with the children, their parents, legal advisers, social workers and others.  A witness room should also be provided, where witnesses may be accommodated, where it is deemed <Col N="1289" /> advisable to exclude them from the court otherwise than when they are giving evidence....  In many court houses at present, lack of accommodation renders it difficult to hear any case <i>in camera.</i>  ...witnesses cannot be segregated or controlled and there are no facilities for consultations or waiting other than the halls and passages which are often crowded with gardaí, witnesses and parties to other cases.  This lack of accommodation renders it quite impossibe to deal with cases in the manner proposed above. Ideally children's courts should be separated and distinct from the ordinary adult courts....</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to provide for that. In the context of the accommodation in the courts, if one examines the statistics of the vast number of children who go through the Dublin Metropolitan Children's Court each year charged with criminal offences or in the context of care proceedings, they will show that there are in excess of 20,000 children's cases determined in that court each year.  Any number from 20 to 40 children will be dealt with by the court in any one day. Sometimes that number of children can be dealt with on any one morning.  By no stretch of the imagination can two consulting rooms meet the needs in this area as described by the task force.  These will not provide facilities where parents and children can meet in private before being faced with a possible court hearing.  The Office of Public Works do not have a good record in this area in that a special purpose-built court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I am permitted by the Chair and the Members of the House to conclude my contribution I shall do so in five minutes.  OPW were involved in the provision of a new purpose-built family court in Dolphin House to deal with family cases as they arose before the Circuit Court.  That building proved to be inadequate.  As a result, after considerable expenditure on that building, family cases are now being dealt with within the Four Courts or in Chancery Place.  The purpose-built court in Dolphin House is being used for cases other than family cases.  I ask the Minister to have broader consultations about the facilities which should be made available in the children's court and not simply rely on the advice he receives from his officials or from the Office of Public Works.  In particular, he should have regard to the experience of lawyers who are familiar with the children's courts and the family court, the manner in which they operate, and the problems created by the new facilities provided by the Office of Public Works in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I welcome the Minister's commitment in this area, I have to make the point that the provision of a children's court in this way is an example of a piecemeal reform to tackle a problem which requires a far more comprehensive approach.  In the minority report of the task force on child care, on the question of children's courts it was stated expressly that in principle the authorities would be in favour of having special family courts because of the specialised nature of the decisions which have to be taken in that area.  They took the view that as many of the cases coming before family courts would involve children, in a system of family courts the children's court should form one division.  As the deliberations of the marital committee are coming to an end a consensus is emerging on all sides that there is going to be a need to provide a family court structure to deal <Col N="1291" /> not merely with problems relating to children but with the whole area of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>If a new purpose-built court is to be built in the Dublin area, it appears that we are talking about spending something in the region of £800,000.  If we are going to spend that type of money I would ask the Minister to spend it not simply to provide a new children's court, but to provide a family court in which family and marital difficulties that are litigated can be dealt with by way of the provision of a number of courtrooms in that building, and to have a courtroom to deal with children's cases.  I ask the Minister not to spend this money on a children's court alone, but to extend his commitment to the provision of an all-purpose family court to deal with all aspects of children's law and family law in the Dublin area. Such a court provided in Dublin could be the prototype of the courts we should be able to provide at a later stage in a better economic climate, in other parts of the country to deal with family problems so that these cases will be no longer litigated in the back rooms of old broken down courthouses, buildings and dance halls all over the country.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept my comments about the way in which he may spend the funds, particularly in the legal aid and courts areas, as constructive and that he does not take them as a personal criticism.  I welcome the fact that this is the first Minister for Justice in a Fund of Suitors Bill who ever provided funds for legal aid or for children's courts.  It is to the shame of all his predecessors, going back to 1966, that not one was willing to take up the issue of providing a proper court facility in the Dublin area for the thousands of children who find themselves heading into court, not simply on criminal charges but because proceedings are brought when they have to be taken into care either due to the failure of their parents or other difficulties.  It is a disgrace that we have permitted the present facilities to continue to operate for the past decades.  I welcome the Minister's commitment in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the easy ride Deputy Woods has given to this Bill.  I agree with his amendment as regards Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, but I thought he would have been stronger in his condemnation of the way in which this £2,790,000 is being used. One would expect that this money would not be used for ordinary Exchequer purposes to provide for items which would be included in the departmental Estimates, but would be used for specific projects of a cultural, artistic or community nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse what Deputy Shatter had to say about free legal aid &mdash; I will speak about this later.  Let us look at how this money is being spent.  First, the Minister takes £1,190,000 for the Department of Justice to build a children's court.  This should have been done years ago.  The Department of Justice should have battled at the Cabinet Table to ensure that money was provided for this purpose. The Minister should not have to wait for the Funds of Suitors Bill to grab more than £1 million to build a children's court. This court should have been provided out of public funds because the taxpayers are providing plenty of money, wherever it is going.  The Minister is also handing over £100,000 to the Department of Labour for a community youth recreation and employment programme.  This sounds an excellent idea, but surely that is what the youth employment levy and the 1 per cent income levy are for.  The Department of Labour should have provided this sum in their Estimate.  There is no reason why £1,190,000 should be given to the Department of Justice, £100,000 to the Department of Labour and £600,000 to the Office of Public Works to do a job on a private building. This building is not under State ownership and specific legislation is required in this case because the Office of Public Works are only allowed to use their funds for public buildings.  Now we are giving them specific permission to use these funds on a private building.  This is an extraordinary use.  This is a gross misuse of these funds.  There are two sums which are not being used for the ordinary departmental Estimates system of funding: <Col N="1293" /> £600,000 to allow the Taoiseach to become a patron of the arts &mdash; an image which, unfortunately for him, Deputy Haughey has succeeded in getting over the last number of years, but now the Taoiseach with this £600,000 in his pocket will start to make a name for himself in that field &mdash; and £300,000 to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.</P>
    <P>The majority of Deputies would agree that most of these funds should go into the legal area where hundreds of thousands of people are unable to avail of legal aid because they cannot afford it and this means they lose their legal rights. Without the availability of aid to defend themselves, their rights and their families, they are deprived of justice.  Some years ago the Government accepted this and decided to give State assistance to free legal aid centres.  These centres are totally inadequate in the type of case they can take, and there is at least a three to six months waiting list because of the enormity of the task facing them.  There is no funding for the free legal advice centres, which have been in existence for the last 15 years who thought they would be able to wind up when this Government took office, but have not been enabled to be wound up.  They still have three community information centres in the city and five rights centres providing representations in regard to social welfare and appeals cases.  They help people who lose social welfare benefits who are unable to get assistance.  Therefore their service is invaluable.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Shatter said, such organisations offer an excellent service to the people in their areas.  FLAC have allowed the people representing the communities to take over services, and one area in particular which needs such a service is Tallaght, not forgetting Ballymun, of course.  Tallaght is a fast growing town with a present population of 70,000 people.  Enormous social problems exist there.  Even if those people could afford to pay for legal services they would have to come to town to have them provided. A community centre there would do an enormous amount of good, with members of the community assisting each other.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> That is the type of service these funds should be used for &mdash; community based legal aid projects.  They are only asking for a guarantee to help them to start a community service in Tallaght and to be able to exist for three years.  They are looking for £200,000.  I ask the Minister to consider this as a deserving application, a deserving project to be aided by this Bill.  He has ample room.  There has been concentration on £600,000 for the Board of Works, £100,000 for the Department of Labour, as well as other sums, all going back into the big maw of the Exchequer.  We will never know how much of the money will be swallowed up in administration.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as I have said, there is ample scope to juggle around and the most deserving organisations are those trying to provide community legal help. The Minister has decided to give £1.19 million to the courts and then he will divide up the balance.  I support the case of Deputy Woods for a grant of £500,000 for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann who are in dire financial straits and who need new headquarters.  It would not be out of line with the programme of the Government already to give annual sums for cultural projects, like the theatre.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that section 2 does not seem to regard Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann as being related to culture and the arts.  It appears that the Taoiseach does not intend to regard the Comhaltas in such a light because it is suggested that £600,000 be given to culture and the arts and only £250,000 to the Comhaltas.  Would the Minister now in the House consider giving them £600,000?  They have a continuous annual need for funding to promote Irish culture and music.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the organisations to which these funds should be given &mdash; voluntary community organisations concentrating on family law, like Cherish, Hope, The Rape Crisis Centre, etc.  They all operate in family law and should be considered for help from this £2.79 million. They should be the first to be considered and Tallaght should be given priority.  As well, organisations in other <Col N="1295" /> new towns such as Clondalkin and Ballymun should be given help.</P>

      <P>I would have been finished by now.  I wish to support the welcome for the Bill and to express the hope that the funds will be used for productive purposes. The discussion so far has indicated the enormous problems existing in Dublin as related by Deputies Mac Giolla, Taylor and Shatter.  However, I would remind the House that no less problems exist in other towns throughout the country.</P>
      <P>There are many problems in towns like Drogheda and Dundalk.  The Drogheda Grammar School is a very historic building. It is a very controversial matter.  It should be preserved but because it was in private ownership it is now actually falling apart and I was wondering whether, if Drogheda Corporation made an application to the Minister for even one-sixth of the £500,000, the sum estimated to be sufficient to preserve the particular building, what would his answer be.  I am not prejudging the issue but I would hope the Minister would say he would give us the money but the answer could also be that, since the building is privately owned, one would not be justified in using public money to restore it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other buildings, such as Garda stations, which are now falling apart and they would be the direct responsibility of the Minister.  Surely some of these moneys we are discussing now could be used to restore them.  There are also many historic buildings along the Border.  These are also falling apart and <Col N="1297" /> I am wondering could this money be used for their restoration.  I am wondering also about the restoration of the courthouse in Drogheda and in other areas too. These are historical and they are falling apart.  At the moment they have to be propped up in one way or another to prevent them falling down on top of the people who have to attend these buildings.</P>
    <P>The Minister said courthouses are the responsibility of the county councils. Steps should be taken to cope with the situation.  Conditions are deplorable and why could this money not be used to provide proper facilities rather than spending what is effectively a sizeable sum of money on a private business?  I was wondering would the Minister be prepared, for example, to make money available to trade unions which occupy buildings of an historical nature in various towns and cities.  If a trade union wants to provide facilities for its members the only recourse is to increase the contributions of the members.  The only business that is actually growing at the moment is the business of crime and the people who are not likely to go out of business are the people engaged in the legal profession.  That applies particularly to the senior members of the legal profession.  They have to be subsidised to the tune of £600,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor voiced his objections earlier and I am sure the Minister is aware that solicitors, who might be described as the second or third division of the legal profession, when they wanted a building provided that building in the Bluecoat School.  They had to reconstruct and renovate it at a cost of £1.5 million.  There was no subsidy that I am aware of.  They provided their own money.  Each member of the organisation had to make an equal contribution.  No levy was placed on those in the first division, on the people who earn the big lolly.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals in general terms.  It would not, I admit, be possible to satisfy everybody in the distribution of any moneys and we have to hear what the Minister of State will have to say in regard to the arts.  We are very much in the dark as to what package he has.  The <Col N="1298" /> Labour Party would welcome any contribution to the arts.  They have been sadly neglected hitherto by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>We welcome the proposal with regard to free legal aid.  There are some who think free legal aid is confined to Dublin city.  The fact is it is required countrywide. If there is to be a broadening of the free legal aid system I would ask the Minister to take into account the fact that we might want free legal aid in Limerick, for example.</P>
    <P>It should not be confined to one particular area.  That has been the tendency up to this.  We do not regard this money as windfall money.  It rightfully belongs to the State and it should be spent in the best interests of all the community.  I strongly object to using this money to subsidise a privately owned building.  We would have no objection to State expenditure on that part of the building owned by the State but if we accept the proposition adumbrated here we will be creating a very dangerous precedent.  It is rather strange that on the two occasions when money of this kind was being distributed by the State a particular sector got a very sizeable slice of that money. The money comes under the responsibility of the High Court and I would be glad to be told that no pressure was brought to bear by the courts on the Minister's Department for any specific allocation of this money to the only sector of our community at the moment which is really in business.  I welcome the Bill but strongly object to that section of it.  I ask the Minister to very seriously reconsider amending it at the appropriate stage.</P>

      <P>Tá mise ag súil le fada leis an deis seo mo chuid tuairimí a nochtadh maidir le rudaí áirithe.  Níl mé ag rá go mbaineann siad go díreach leis an mBille atá os ár gcomhair ach baineann siad le dearcadh atá sa tír seo.  Tá mise chun iarracht a dhéanamh é a chur os comhair an Aire uasail atá anseo ionas go dtaispeánfaidh sé go n-aontaíonn sé liom agus gur ró-fhada ar fad atáimid ag glacadh má tá daoine áirithe in Éirinn atá sásta obair a dhéanamh in aisce go bhfuil saghas tuairim ann nach fiú an obair sin <Col N="1299" /> ar chor ar bith nó go bhfuil tuairim ann nach bhfuil rud ar bith eile le déanamh ag na daoine sin agus mar sin gur ceart airgead a thabhairt do lucht an rachmais i gcónaí &mdash; iad sin atá ag iarraidh táille ard ar pé obair a dhéanann siad.  Sin go bunúsach an fhadhb.  Nuair a bhí mé i m'Aire Stáit agus mé i mbun cúrsaí a bhain le spórt agus leis an aos óg bhí mé ag iarraidh i gcónaí a chur os comhair an Rialtais an mí-thuiscint a bhí ann maidir leis an rud bunúsach sin.</P>
      <P>I shall be hoping, in the course of my comments, to soften the Minister's heart and if necessary to convert him.  He is now given an opportunity to demonstrate the recognition he and his Government have for something which is so vital to the well-being and wholesome side of living in this island.  If we think about it, we have no hesitation in recognising that there is abroad an idea in respect of any exercise, pursuit or interest which is harboured by any Irish man or woman, if people are doing it for nothing and are volunteers, first that it is unnecessary, unimportant or irrelevant or, secondly, that those involved have nothing else to do and that the enjoyment which they get out of it should in itself be recompense for what the are doing.  I want the Minister and the House to ponder deeply on that.  If they agree with me in the immediacy of their consideration, or on second consideration, that that is a fact, I hope they would agree that to continue in that attitude towards all our voluntary organisations would be a serious mistake and one which would make society and this country of ours all the poorer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My thoughts will perhaps not be in the sequence in which I would like to present them, but I return to the reception and welcome which we gave to the last great visiting personality to this country, the President of the United States of America. It is fairly noticeable that in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's own county of Tipperary or in the metropolis here, when we thought that we should perform for him, that we should demonstrate what was Irish, we did not bring in our legal profession, our teachers or any profession. When we wanted to demonstrate to <Col N="1300" /> him what we were proud of, in Dublin we brought in Clannad and in Tipperary representatives of the cultural movement there.  I do not think that we did that just for the sake of appealing to the superficialities of what is Irish; we did it because we were anxious to demonstrate to him that we had something which was characteristically Irish.  We recognised in our hearts, even though not in the matter of the disbursement of moneys, how vital that is to the nation.</P>
    <P>As far as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are concerned, they have an organisation who have continued on for years now, with very little financial assistance from our Government and from the present Government, except &mdash; it should be said in the matter of criticising the present Government &mdash; that they did not give Comhaltas Ceoltóirí even the small percentage increases that came to other organisations.  We have people who, day in, day out, have worried and applied themselves as best they could, first to saving our music and song, and having done that, apply themselves now to developing them.  They are prepared to do this without any remuneration whatsoever, except the satisfaction they get from knowing that they are contributing to what is so vital to the enrichment of Irish life.</P>
    <P>When I was making our case to our own Government on voluntary organisations, I said that the great merit of these was that people were doing it on a voluntary level.  If they, as they should, aspired to doing a thing perfectly and professionally, inevitably there would be a gap between the maximised effort of the volunteer and what was necessary and the obligation was on the Government to fill that gap.  That is all we are being asked to do here by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí.  We are not being asked to nationalise the whole movement.  Again, perhaps, it is a thought that we should bear in mind.  If we accept &mdash; and nobody rejects &mdash; that the work which they are doing is vital and important, and if they were tomorrow to pull out and leave it to the Government of the day to carry out all those duties, what would that cost?</P>
    <P>Suppose we wanted to nationalise <Col N="1301" /> Comhaltas Ceoltóirí tomorrow and suppose we had, as we have in the case of the legal profession, nobody wanting to do a hand's turn unless he got paid for it, what would it cost?  Suppose a great traditional violinist or accordionist refused to go to Sligo to perform there or to give lessons unless he received £1,000 on the nail before he went, would we regard that as desirable?  I am not going to make little of the need which exists for justice in the country, for courts, but the position at the moment is that if a learned professional in the courts areas is obliged to travel or even if not obliged to travel, his fee per day can be £1,000.  I am not saying that all lawyers get that, but often in our courts there are on call perhaps two or three different solicitors for people who engage them, and the combined fee can be something amounting to that.  We are talking about free legal aid, but nothing is free.  When we examine it, what we are talking about is guaranteeing that the fee which the legal profession will require for their services is available to them.  They do not, as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí will do, do anything for nothing.</P>
    <P>Some may argue that what they are doing is far more important, but I would argue as well that what Comhaltas Ceoltóirí are doing is equally important, more positive, more wholesome and more patriotic.  It will provide much more lasting benefits to this country and our people than the opinion or decision of a legal man.  What I am endeavouring to say is that we disregard somebody who has a excellent contribution to make but is in an area where, traditionally, one does not ask for a fee.  <i>Ipso facto</i> we leave him aside, and cater for those who, traditionally, guard their position that if they speak to anybody they must be paid. The person who makes music, the person who sings can do it for nothing.  His or her talents are not to be recognised.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that Deputy Shatter is not here.  I am often disturbed when I hear Deputy Shatter &mdash; I have heard Senator Robinson as well &mdash; discuss divorce. The case they would make in relation to the person who, unfortunately, has to <Col N="1302" /> pursue his or her right to entitlement at the moment, is that it cannot be done because of the cost and, therefore, something else must be done.  Would they not consider helping by reducing the cost? Would they not do it for less money? That would be moving towards it.  Instead of those in their profession making the case that they have feelings for the person who is pleading because of the cost perhaps we should be thinking of a situation where the State should employ people who will give this service at reasonable fees bearing in mind that it is the State and the community who have educated those people.  The Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham, Deputy Shatter and I would not be in the professional position we are in if it were not for the fact that the rest of the community have contributed five-sixths of what it has cost to make lawyers and teachers of us. Surely those of us who claim to have feelings for our neighbours, who are continually advancing our concern for those people, should be as idealistic as the people in Comhaltas, in sport and in the community who are prepared to do this for nothing, bearing in mind that it is work which is beneficial to the community, which should give us satisfaction and which we should make less demanding on the purse of the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give to the Minister of State the assistance he gave to me when I pleaded that I should be allowed in.  Naturally I will bear in mind that he <Col N="1303" /> wants to speak.  I notice that he is a beneficiary under the scheme.  More power to him.  His Department are getting £100,000.  I recollect reading that last year his Department had £11 million unspent money.  Why does he think he should take this £100,000?  If he had £11 million which he did not spend last year and if Comhaltas are being evicted and have the ESB standing at their door telling them they will switch off their lights unless they pay the money they owe why would he not be magnanimous enough to recognise the plight of Comhaltas and say he is agreeable to giving that £100,000 to them?  I do not know if he will have £11 million over this year.</P>
      <P>I hope, in the course of his contribution, he will explain the situation where Comhaltas Ceoltóirí, who are in debt to the extent of £750,000, are only getting £400,000 and his Department, who had £11 million unspent last year, are getting £100,000.  That is perhaps an oversimplistic presentation of what I see but I know the Minister of State will be happy to reply in the time which I am happy to give to him.  I acknowledge &mdash; I said earlier on that I hoped to soften the Minister's heart but that would not prevent me from saying things which I considered to be true even if he did not like them &mdash; that he has moved from the initial position in respect of Comhaltas.  I am accepting that, because of that, he accepts the important part being played by Comhaltas.  I know that my colleague, Deputy Woods, has an amendment which asks for £500,000 for Comhaltas. I am still not happy with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will return to what I was endeavouring to put before the House.  Is the work Comhaltas are doing important?  Is it vital to the nation?  Do we accept that today, while we have very little memory of the ephemeral happenings of the past century we pay homage to Raftery, Carolan, or Eóin Ruadh Ó Súilleabháin, people who did what they did for nothing, people who were penniless but nevertheless have left us those priceless possessions? Did we at the time have any regard for the monks and the clerics who left us the <Col N="1304" /> Book of Kells, the Ardagh Chalice or any of those priceless treasures which we are happy to hawk around the world as indications of what the Irish are and the real contribution we make to the spiritual life at home and abroad?</P>
    <P>I know one can be dismissive of a Comhaltas session and I know some parents have expressed slight reservations about Irish music being played in pubs and its association with drink.  It is quite a social thing to have a drink while people are playing music.  That is the way it is in every country in the world.  I am afraid that, because of lack of funds, it could be necessary for Comhaltas to submit themselves to some sponsor or some agency which would not have any interest in Irish music or culture but would only have the interest of maximising profits for themselves.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that we should have to stand up here making a case for the outstanding organisation in Ireland who are doing our work in relation to what we call Irish culture, the restoration and the development of Irish music, song, dance, things which make us characteristically Irish.  Why is it necessary that this should be done?</P>
    <P>I hope to help the Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham.  I congratulate him on the fact that he has held tight to his position in respect of all the volunteers who are engaged in looking after our youth.  We will spend £2 million tomorrow trying to cure the problem of drugs and we will not give the Minister of State an extra £500,000 to prevent the problem arising.  This is the illogicality of our approach to what is very important.  It comes from what I said earlier on: perhaps a peasant attitude of looking up to the person who charges most for his services and disregarding the person who is idealistic or patriotic and is pursuing the essential.</P>
    <P>We should not make the mistake of taking Comhaltas and Conradh na Gaeilge for granted.  If they are not given recognition, inevitably they will become annoyed and then it will be too late to recover the position.  Because of the activities of Comhaltas over the past decade tremendous strides have been made. <Col N="1305" /> Comhaltas sent to all Deputies a statement of their membership and their branches.  I do not need that.  From the time Comhaltas were established I have been a frequent attender at the local branch.  When I was Minister of State, even though the Government were not giving us as much money as I would have wished, as Minister of State I was present to acknowledge what they were doing.  I regard their activities as being far more important than the activities of many other organisations who apparently can call upon all Governments for money overnight.  They plead certain cases.  I am not just talking about the legal profession. I am not excluding the veterinary profession, or the teaching profession, and all the professions who get so much from the community.</P>
    <P>We talk about free education.  There is no free education.  Education is paid for by the PAYE income taxpayer.  We talk about equality of education.  There is no equality of education and there will never be equality of education until we recognise that certain people are born with certain inequalities and move designedly to help them.  It is not equality of education to expose everybody to the same curriculum.  It is a myth, a fallacy, a lie and a deception to say that.</P>

      <P>I was endeavouring to demonstrate our attitude to the volunteer as against the professional.  Through no fault of his own somebody may be forced to opt out after he takes the intermediate certificate examination.  Because he is intelligent and has a feeling for self-education and for improving himself he becomes involved in a voluntary organisation. Another person does his leaving certificate examination and moves on to university.  I am not talking about people who get scholarships.  I am talking about all the other students.  Out of the pockets of the masses of the people there is a subsidy of approximately five-sixths of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education is no longer the idealistic thing of the past, education for education's sake.  Now it is education for what you can get out of it.  The professions are involved in lobbies and exercises.  They think up an attractive name and pretend they are concerned for the people.  You do not have to do a very close examination to realise that they are copperfastening their own position.  I do not criticise them unduly for that, but I do criticise them if they pretend they are concerned about their neighbour <Col N="1307" /> because, quite obviously, they are not. They suggest they have a better case for getting the money available than my friend who left school after the intermediate certificate examination and then became involved in Comhaltas.  He gives day in and day out.  He has a talent for music.  He goes around in his own car, at his own expense.  Now he finds that the headquarters of his university, his King's Inns, cannot get money.</P>

I went to my Government and said that I had an involvement in the matter and that I was not going to go to Tullamore where volunteers such as Paddy Larkin had built a community centre and track merely to pay verbal homage to them.  I said that unless the Government gave me some money to give as a token of our recognition I would not go.  I did not go and I got the money.  I suggest that made it easier for my successors to follow on with the work of giving recognition to all volunteers in this area.  I will not be dissuaded from the theme of my contribution here.  It is scandalous that here in Dáil Éireann, in an assembly that claims to have an interest in and a recognition of what can be described as things Irish, we have to spend time convincing each other of the need to help an organisation like this.  This organisation is on the verge of liquidation and it is a tragedy that we have to haggle over a few hundred thousand pounds.  We are making cases for other institutions.  There is a provision in the legislation that the Taoiseach will have at his disposal £600,000 to disperse as he wishes.  I am not saying he will not do a good job but we are giving him that amount for whomever he thinks fit but, at the same time, his Minister is saying that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann will get only £300,000.</P>

      <P>There is a sum of £300,000 for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and it is worth repeating that it is £100,000 more than was provided by the previous Government.  In addition, a sum of £600,000 is being made available for purposes in relation to culture and the arts, making a total of £900,000.  A sum of £100,000 has been designated towards the cost of repair and renovation of the premises of the Royal Irish Academy of Music at Westland Row.  They are an excellent body and they deserve that help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining £500,000 will be used to help fund capital projects for a capital programme for the arts proposed by the Arts Council.  The actual management of the additional funds will be delegated to the Arts Council as the Government have no wish to encroach on the statutory competence or autonomy of that body.  The additional capital assistance which will be made available to such interests will, of necessity, complement rather than supplant their own fund-raising activities.  I understand that before a public commitment <Col N="1312" /> is given to assist a specific project, potential recipients of such assistance will need to be firmly committed to providing the remainder of the funds necessary to complete the projects.  An amount of work has still to be done in this area before a detailed announcement can be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address myself specifically to the provision of £100,000 for community facilities. In this year's Estimates there is a sum of £1.2 million to allow for ongoing work on substantial community facilities throughout the country.  A number of community centres have found themselves in difficulties and this sum will be applied to such groups to get them over the hump.  It is an additional injection to assist local volunteers with their fund raising.  It is proposed to allocate the sums as follows but before I list them I wish to point out that this announcement is being made now in the aftermath of an election, some two-and-a-half years before the next polls and not in advance an election as might be the practice of other administrations.</P>
      <P>A sum of £9,000 will be allocated to the community centre in Ennistymon. They received a grant of £85,000 in March 1982.  The work is practically completed and the additional £9,000 will make that possible.  The community centre at Banteer, County Cork, which is in a somewhat similar situation, will benefit to the tune of £5,000.  The community centre at Dromtariffe, County Cork, will receive a sum of £10,000.  This is a small rural area and the local volunteers have done magnificent work in raising a huge sum of money.  The proposed grant will allow for the completion of the centre.  The Irish Wheelchair Association day care and sports centre at Clontarf will benefit to the tune of £5,000.  This is an enormous project and the money being granted is little more than a gesture of goodwill and support for a magnificent voluntary group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community centre at Durrow, County Laois, will receive a sum of £3,000 which will allow the centre to be <Col N="1313" /> completed.  The community centre at Caherdavin, Limerick, will receive a sum of £11,000 and the community centre at Southhill, Limerick, will receive £5,000. This is an area where fund raising is particularly difficult because of the level of unemployment and the local people there have done a magnificent job.  The community centre at Newcastle West, County Limerick, will receive £9,000. The community centre at Emyvale, County Monaghan, who found themselves in difficulties in completing the centre will receive £5,000.  The sports complex, Larkspur Park, Cashel, County Tipperary, will receive £14,000 and the indoor athletic complex at Nenagh, County Tipperary, will receive £14,000. The Catholic Youth Council outdoor centres in County Wicklow will receive £5,000.  There is a project there providing three facilities at Oakwood, Ballycrean and Arklow which is completed but the interest repayments are proving a burden on the day-to-day activities of the centres.  The sum allocated will assist them in meeting those repayments.  The sports complex at Mullingar is a massive project but it is now running into difficulties. This will receive £5,000.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Most of the points raised can be dealt with on Committee Stage but Deputy Woods raised one point I should like to deal with now.  He asked if there were dormant balances in any other court apart from the High Court.  The answer is no.  The moneys relate to moneys in the High Court and I am not aware of any dormant balances in the Circuit Court or in any other court.  The moneys date back in some cases for a number of centuries.  It may be of interest to know that there are not dormant funds accruing now.  The reason we have these dormant funds over a long period is due mainly to the fire in the Four Courts in 1922 which destroyed records and made it impossible for people to claim particular funds which became dormant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The Galway main drainage system is designed to take sewage from Galway city via a new pumping station at South Park to a deep sea outfall off Mutton Island.  At present the sewage is discharged without treatment at Claddagh Quay and South Park.  The first stage of the scheme has been completed at a cost of approximately £1 million and the Galway Corporation's plans for the next section of the scheme consisting of a pumping station and preliminary treatment works at South Park were approved by my Department in June 1983.  The corporation's proposals for the acceptance of tenders were approved in July 1983 (tenders for plant) and in November 1983 (tenders for buildings).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the South Park pumping station is specially provided for <Col N="1316" /> in the Galway city development plan and that in the planning of the pumping station full consideration was given to any possible effects on the existing environment from the physical planning point of view including visual impact and possible noise and odours.  Galway Corporation secured the assistance of the IIRS in this connection.</P>
    <P>The treatment works proposed to be provided at South Park would be enclosed in a pump-house and would not create any aerosols.  I am advised that it would not be a danger to health.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposed outfall to deep water from Mutton Island, Galway Corporation commissioned a special report from An Foras Forbartha and in the light of this report the view taken by the technical advisers of the local authority and of my Department was that further treatment was not necessary at present given existing population levels.  It was envisaged, however, that the need for further treatment might arise as the scheme would reach its full design capacity. I understand that in accordance with normal practice where sea outfalls are involved, the then Department of Transport did consult the Department of Fisheries before granting the foreshore licence.</P>
    <P>I made it known to the corporation some time ago that, in order to give them the time needed to look further into aspects of the scheme locally, I would ensure that the capital allocation arising from the £1.4 million loan, which had been sanctioned for the scheme, would not be withdrawn.  I understand that the Galway Corporation considers the matter at their meetings on 30 April and 11 June and that further consideration will be given to it by the corporation at a further meeting.  While I did take the opportunity some months ago to visit the site of the proposed pumping station to get a better appreciation of what is involved, it would be inappropriate for me to offer any comment on the scheme which is still under consideration by the local authority.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the proposed sewerage scheme is <Col N="1317" /> designed to discharge untreated effluent into an area where a shellfish control order has already been made by the Western Health Board?  Is the Minister also aware that scientific discoveries in recent years show that viruses cannot be eliminated from oysters if they become affected, and it is very likely that oysters would be affected, due to the sewage discharge into an area in close proximity to oyster beds?  The Minister said the Department of Fisheries were consulted but he did not say what advice he received&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I said, as a result of representations made to me from local representations and others, I allowed Galway Corporation to reconsider the matter and not to hold them to any time scale.  Meetings are taking place between Galway Corporation and experts and, until Galway Corporation report back to me, I am not in a position to comment on what discussions are going on since I am not aware of them.  I could only make a decision on the basis of the opportunity I have given to Galway Corporation to come back and make representations to me on the overall effectiveness of the scheme for the Galway Bay area.</P>

As a result of representations made by concerned local representatives in the area that this scheme should be looked at again, I decided to allow the corporation to continue to examine the problem.  I understand they are discussing it with experts in the area.  At the same time, I gave them an assurance that the money provided by the Department would be available when they came to a decision on the matter.  When these further discussions are completed and we know what Galway Corporation request of us only then can we take any decision on the matter.  I have gone as far as I can in the matter with Galway Corporation. I am not bludgeoning them into doing anything in particular; I want to ascertain from them what further considerations there are, and then a decision can certainly be taken on the matter.</P>

Because that was done by local representatives I thought it better <Col N="1322" /> to take the points made by Deputy Molloy and others in the House, and Senators also, allowing a second look to be taken at the situation overall.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he agrees with the statement of the Galway County Manager that the 1984 road grant represents a reduction of £600,000 approximately on the 1983 road grant to Galway County Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In comparing figures for 1984 and 1983, it is necessary to have regard to the changes introduced this year in the system of notifying road grant allocations.</P>
      <P>The system of road grants administered by the Department operates on the basis that the amounts of grants committed in respect of road works generally exceed the level of funds available for recoupment in any particular year.  This is intended to take account of the fact that a substantial proportion of the notified commitments does not mature for payment within the year due to the practical difficulties in implementing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of road grants which operated before 1984 left open the possibility that demand for recoupment could outstrip the grant provision for the country <Col N="1324" /> as a whole in any particular year with the result that payments would have to be withheld at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The system of road grant allocations introduced this year is similar to the system which operated in 1983, with the exception that the grant allocated in 1984 and notified by letter to local authorities on 24 February 1984 will actually be paid this year if the conditions set out in that letter are fulfilled.  Under the old system, this could not have been guaranteed.</P>
    <P>In the case of Galway County Council, my Department notified the council in March 1983 of road grant commitments totalling £3.87 million.  The carry-forward commitment at the start of 1983 was £1.196 million, resulting in total commitments in 1983 amounting to £5.066 million. The amount actually paid by the Department was £4.011 million.</P>
    <P>On 24 February 1984, Galway County Council were notified that a grant of £4.191 million had been allocated to the local authority for roads in 1984.  New commitments made amounted to £4.040 million while the carry-forward commitment at the start of 1984 was £1.055 million, which results in total commitments in 1984 amounting to £5.095 million.</P>
    <P>It is open to the council to incur liabilities up to £5.095 million.  Any claim in 1984 in excess of the 1984 allocation of £4.191 million will be met either by way of payment by the Department early in 1985 or possible savings in allocations to other local authorities which may arise later this year.  It is not possible to indicate at this stage the total State grants likely to be available in 1985 in respect of roads.</P>
    <P>In the case of Galway Corporation, the increase in the grants in 1984 relates to the new Corrib Bridge and approach roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we should be grateful to the Minister for putting so much information on the record but I am sure he will accept that the question relates to a specific matter of the statement of the Galway County Manager that the 1984 road grants represent a reduction of £600,000 on the 1983 grant.  I wanted to establish and put on record <Col N="1325" /> whether the Minister accepts the statement made by the county manager as true, or if not if he can explain why he thinks it is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have an accounting procedure and I suppose we can make figures look one thing or another, but I will explain how we look at it and perhaps the Deputy will see our point of view. Galway County Council's new commitments for 1984 at £4.04 million are £170,000 or 4 per cent higher than in 1983.  Their pre-1984 commitments of £1.055 million result in total commitments of £5.095 million in 1984.  It is open to the council to incur liabilities, as I have said, up to £5.095 million in the current year.  Their allocation of £4.191 million, which is the amount to be paid to the council in the current year, is £180,000 or 4 per cent higher than the grant payments of £4.011 million made to the council in 1983.  The council's total commitments in 1983 amounted to £5.066 million.  The 1983 grant commitment was £3.87 million. Their pre-1983 commitments were £1.196 million.</P>
      <P>The county manager's statement to which the Deputy refers is a submission made by the council to the Minister of State during a meeting on 15 March 1984. In the submission it was stated that the amount available to the council for roads expenditure in 1984 is £663,000 less than the grant notified in 1983.  This statement is based on the following: (1) 1983 road grant notified £3.87 million; (2) 1984 road grant allocation £4.191 million, less recouped expenditure at 31 December 1983 of £719,000 and expenditure in excess of grants notified for the individual schemes in 1983 of £265,000 totalling £0.984 million, which leaves £3.207 million. The difference between (1) and (2) is, as the county manager suggested, £0.663 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the information submitted by Galway County Council in their monthly expenditure returns the following estimate breakdown of the above £0.984 million emerges.  December 1983 expenditure was £353,000.  Accounts related to 1983 which were brought to book in January and February 1984 were <Col N="1326" /> £250,000.  Expenditure in excess of 1983 commitments on individual schemes was £265,000.  The balances of grants withheld pending receipt of final documents relating to the schemes were £116,000.</P>
    <P>While it is correct to say that the above expenditure represents a first charge on the 1984 road allocations, the council's submission does not mention that some of the elements comprising the £984,000 in 1983 will most likely be repeated in 1984.  For example, expenditure in December does not fall due for recoupment until the following January.  Likewise accounts being paid at the end of the year fall due for recoupment only as they are paid.  It is likely that the balance will be withheld again pending submission of the final documents.  There is always a carry-over from one year to the other.  In actual terms there is an increased grant this year to Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not contradict himself.  As I understand it now, in the middle of that long answer he has confirmed the statement made by the Galway County Manager that he was in effect being left £100,000 short in 1984 compared to 1983.  Is the Minister aware that when the deputation from Galway County Council attended on the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, he told the Galway County Manager that the manager's figures were wrong and that if he came over to his Department in the afternoon he would explain where he was wrong and that in fact Galway were getting a very generous increase in their road grant?  When the manager went to the Custom House in the afternoon he was able to prove his case and showed that he was being left short and that the Minister and his officials gave us wrong information when they met the deputation from Galway County Council.</P>

If there were not, I put it to the Minister, Galway County Council would not have to get an overdraft, as they had, of £0.5 million in order to survive.  Would he not accept that he is contradicting himself when he talks about carry-over of funds when it is his Department who are not allowing Galway County Council to carry over expenditure from 1983 to 1984?</P>

      <P>It is carry-over commitments that have been completed from one year into the next, which happens because certain roads are completed and certain bills are paid out of the following year's allocation against work done in the previous year.  This happens every year in every local authority.  It just so happens that perhaps a heavier amount is being carried over into 1984 than was carried over into 1983.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the critical financial situation that has arisen at Galway County Council following notification that the domestic rates and agricultural grants for local authorities will only be increased by 0.8 per cent in 1984 over the 1983 figure; and the action he will take to avoid redundancies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Galway County Council, in common with other local authorities and public agencies, are having to operate in difficult financial circumstances.</P>
      <P>In comparing the 1984 provision for rates support grants with that for 1983 it must be remembered that the latter was increased by the present Government by £31.5 million over the provision made by the previous Government.  This increase has been sustained into 1984 and an additional £2.27 million provided.  The aggregate of current State grants and subsidies to local authorities in 1984 is expected to be 10.3 per cent approximately higher than the outturn for 1983. Current and capital allocations together will be up by £65 million approximately. Almost two-thirds of all local authority spending on current account is now provided by the Exchequer and, given the many other competing demands for Exchequer resources, this is as much as can be done in the prevailing conditions. I hope local authorities will do everything possible to minimise the adverse impact on employment by means which should include reasonable use of local sources of income and measures to promote greater cost-effectiveness in operations and in the elimination of any wasteful procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have undertaken a wide-ranging review to see what measures can be taken <Col N="1331" /> to put local authority finances on a firmer basis for the future.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the An Bord Pleanála &mdash;<i>Review 1983</i>, published on 30 January 1983, which stated that while sanction for the filling of four senior posts of planning inspector was received in 1983 it was not possible to fill these posts due to protracted negotiations with the representatives of the inspectorate on the matter of general terms and conditions for their transfer to the service of the board and that due to its complex and protracted nature the issue had been referred to him to determine; if so, if he will give details of the issue referred to; and when it is likely to be resolved.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the form of the &ldquo;work to rule&rdquo; being applied by the planning inspectorate assigned by his Department to An Bord Pleanála; if so, whether this practice is limiting the number of appeal files being prepared for decision by An Bord Pleanála; and the action he will take on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 16, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I should explain that the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, provides that the board shall employ such and so many persons as the board from time to time thinks proper.  The Minister's function in this regard is limited to approving the number and kind of such employees.  An inspectorate of 19 was approved for the board in July 1981.  Under the Act the terms and conditions of service of board employees is a matter for the board, subject to the approval of the Minister. Terms and conditions of service have been approved for the inspectorate.  The Act also provides that, pending the appointment by the board of its own staff, interim arrangements could be made by the board for the supply by the Minister of services of staff of the Department. Pending the recruitment of its own staff by the board to fill the approved posts, staff from my Department, including 15 inspectors, are assigned to it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that the filling of inspectorate posts within the approved structure, including the four posts mentioned in the document to which the Deputy refers and of which I am aware, is a matter for the board.  I am not in a position to say when the arrangements for the filling of the vacant planning inspector posts, or for any transfers, will be completed.  However, discussions are continuing between the board and the inspectorate in regard to the filling of posts by transfer of staff from my Department and by open recruitment.  The board have now sought applications for posts of senior planning inspector by public advertisement on the 6 June 1984.</P>
      <P>My Department was not made aware that a dispute existed between the board and the inspectorate or that the inspectorate had instituted a &ldquo;work to rule&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions are a little out of date as they have been on the Order Paper for over four months.  Did the Minister say that the Department were not aware of any dispute?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must accept that it is surprising his Department were not informed of what was happening at that time in An Bord Pleanála.  It would shake public confidence in the Minister and his Department.  The Opposition were well aware of the dispute and the effect it had.  It caused delays in deciding planning appeals.  The Minister's predecessor sought to use that as an excuse for abolishing the planning board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not due to the fault of the members of the board but to the <Col N="1338" /> lack of an inspectorate and the work to rule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the reason he will not enter into discussions with the Local Government Union regarding arrangements for the collection of local authority service charges in 1984; and if he will make a statement regarding the embargo on collection of these charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Local Government and Public Services Union has issued an instruction to its branches to the effect that members are not to co-operate in the collection of new charges for local authority services. While I am not as yet aware of the full effects of this instruction, it could, if implemented, have serious consequences for the provision of local authority services and employment.</P>
      <P>This action appears to be linked by the union to a request for discussions on the problem of rationalising rate and revenue collection arrangements.  As the Deputy is aware, most rate collectors in rural areas, while receiving full pay, have insufficient work to do, consequent on the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings and agricultural land.  Efforts by management to resolve this issue on a voluntary basis have so far failed.  The collection of 1983 charges was the subject of discussions between management and the union under the aegis of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board.  It was agreed at these discussions that the union would co-operate in the collection of these charges and that further discussions would be held between both sides on the rationalisation question.  It is a matter for the board and the union to arrange these further discussions.  Certain aspects of the management side's position are, however, now being considered further with a view to the holding of these discussions at the earliest possible date.  Any meeting between the union and me on the subject would, therefore, be premature at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever we may think about the merits of the charges, surely the Minister must agree that it is most <Col N="1342" /> unsatisfactory that a dispute of this nature was allowed to continue for so long.  Will he intervene in this dispute to arrange for an early settlement?  Will he meet with the representatives of the union to discuss the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy I followed to good effect when I was in the Department of Labour was that I was reluctant to intervene when discussions were still going on.  In this case it would not be prudent to intervene until the subject has been discussed between the union and management.  If there is still a difficulty then I will consider the Deputy's suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the letter which was sent out to each branch secretary of the union informing them that the management side decided it would not meet with the union.  In view of that surely it would be appropriate for the Minister to intervene.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that the initiative in this matter lies with him in view of the fact that he is paying rate collectors whose job in 90 per cent of cases ceased four years ago?  As a result of this there is a desperate drain on public finances.  The Minister has been very lax in his efforts to have the dispute solved.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will confirm whether he has introduced new regulations requiring that 90 per cent of group water supply scheme local contributions be collected and the contractor appointed before his Department will allocate grants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Group scheme grants are payable on <Col N="1345" /> the basis of a proportion of the cost of providing individual water supplies and it is therefore essential for groups to collect local contributions to meet the balance of the cost.  I have not introduced regulations requiring groups to collect 90 per cent of the local contributions for their schemes and to appoint contractors before grants are allocated to enable them to proceed.  In cases where there is reason to believe that groups may not be in a position to collect the local contributions necessary to pay for their schemes, my Department pay particular regard to the total amount of contributions raised locally when deciding whether grants should be allocated for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the Department are requiring, if not 90 per cent, that a very large proportion of the local contribution be collected before any grants are allocated and that this rule is proving unworkable?  Because of this, activity in the group water supply scheme area has been almost brought to a halt, as I am sure the statistics the Minister is circulating in tabular form will show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the case. The Deputy is suggesting that the group scheme has been brought to a halt but grants were allocated for 34 new schemes in the first quarter of this year and a total of 1,723 grants were allocated for new schemes and existing schemes over the same period.  What the Deputy says is not fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, not alone are the Department requesting these contributions, but that they are insisting on them?  The result is that many group water schemes are paying substantial bank overdrafts on money they should have received from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I said no regulations have been introduced or proposed whereby groups would be required to <Col N="1346" /> collect 90 per cent of local contributions. That is a statement of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>

Would he also accept that since a recent television programme on group water schemes there has been a great change in the operation of the group water schemes by his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Local inspectors are probably being much more cautious in their approach to group water schemes as a result of that programme and a certain amount of laxity in certain areas. They require that the money be put up front before work proceeds but this is only a cautionary measure which any prudent inspector would require to ensure that at the end of the day the group water scheme will be carried out and funds will be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the reason his Department approved of a special contribution for increased pipe sizes on the Charleville-Braganstown group water supply scheme, County Louth; and the reason they have since refused approval for a loan and subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department approved the payment by Louth County Council of a special contribution to the Charleville-Braganstown group water scheme in respect of increased pipe sizes which the council require the group to provide in order to cater for future development in the area.  Louth County Council applied to my Department to sanction this special contribution from the local loans fund.  As group water scheme special contributions are normally financed by way of treasurer loans, my Department advised the council on 1 February 1984 to seek a treasurer loan to finance the special contribution.  The repayment of loan charges on this loan would qualify for State subsidy of 50 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have not refused to approve the laying of increased pipe sizes by the Cluid group water scheme.

These proposals are under examination and I expect to make a decision on the matter at an early date.</P>

It is then a matter for the manager, in the first instance, to consider what action, if any, should be taken.  A recent anonymous complaint against an officer of the local authority mentioned by the Deputy was dealt with in this way.  The manager subsequently informed my Department that he was satisfied that the allegation implied in the complaint was without foundation.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes that in the case of the inadvertent non-insurance of a vehicle a person shall be liable on summary conviction to a minimum penalty of £100, and in the case of deliberate non-insurance to a minimum penalty of £350.  Amendment No. 3 proposes that in the case of the deliberate non-insurance of a vehicle a person, on summary conviction, shall be automatically disqualified from holding a driving licence.  The House will generally agree that the failure of so many motorists to comply with the law in regard to vehicle insurance has reached such proportions that it has become a great national scandal, particularly when one is aware that the number of uninsured drivers could be as high as 150,000.  This has been estimated by the Automobile Association for the entire country.  The scandal is compounded when one appreciates the number of accidents involving uninsured drivers. According to available figures, 62,000 cases of uninsured driving were brought before the courts and the further tragedy is that those who have suffered <Col N="1387" /> loss of limb and property must get compensation from the Motor Insurers' Bureau, and such compensation can be recovered only by increased premiums which have to be paid by those who abide by the law.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the Prices Commission have made a recommendation along the lines of my amendments.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendments, which will impose severe penalties on people who will not insure their vehicles.  Before I speak further I should like to know if the Minister intends to accept the amendments, or what is his attitude to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to be able to persuade the Deputy that in refusing to accept the amendments I have a good reason and that he will agree the course adopted in the Bill is the right one.  The report of the Prices Advisory Committee into the cost and methods of providing motor insurance recommended that the maximum penalty for uninsured driving should be increased from £100 to £1,000 and that in the case of deliberate non-insurance there should be a minimum penalty of £350 together with suspension of the driving licence, and that the minimum penalty for inadvertent non-insurance should be £100.  These proposals have been given careful consideration.  I have accepted the proposal to increase the maximum penalties, and this is provided for in the section.  Therefore, I will explain further why I cannot accept the Deputy's amendments.</P>

    <P>The amendment before us proposes not only to set a minimum penalty but to distinguish between inadvertent and deliberate non-insurance.  Considering the principle of minimum penalties first, their introduction would be an unnecessary interference with the discretion of the Judiciary who under the Constitution are charged with the administration of justice.  It could lead to injustice.  A minimum penalty of £100 for a person of limited means, say an old age pensioner, a widow or somebody on social welfare, could be a very substantial and punitive penalty even where the offence had been <Col N="1388" /> committed through an oversight.  I would be concerned also lest the proposed minimum penalty might in effect become the maximum penalty.</P>
    <P>Though I understand the Deputy's concern to ensure that tough action will be taken against uninsured drivers, I am concerned that justice will be done.  I am not convinced that the amendments would be for the best, for the reasons outlined.  It is best that justices in the District Court would be allowed discretion to judge each case on its merits.  In doing so, I am sure they will take account of the emphasis placed by the House on dealing severely with uninsured drivers when the circumstances merit it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the motives behind the Deputy's desire to distinguish between deliberate and inadvertent failure to insure but I would prefer to retain the existing provisions which allow the courts to judge the seriousness of offences on the facts of the case and to impose appropriate penalties.  A maximum £1,000 fine and, or, six months imprisonment provide plenty of scope, and the introduction of the distinctions proposed might divert court proceedings into long arguments on whether an offence was deliberate.  It could lead to challenges in higher courts on the niceties of definition. I would prefer that the District Court would decide on the facts and hand out penalties accordingly.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a distinction between deliberate and inadvertent non-insurance, the only alternative in the second amendment would be to impose a mandatory disqualification for any offence relating to non-insurance.  This could be unduly harsh.  There might, for example, be extenuating circumstances especially where a person had allowed cover to lapse for a short period through an oversight. If either of these options is unsatisfactory than I suggest we retain the present provisions which give a discretionary power to the courts to impose disqualification.  Section 27 of the 1961 Act empowers the courts to impose disqualification in addition to other penalties in connection with offences in relation to mechanically propelled vehicles or the driving of them.  In addition conviction <Col N="1389" /> for a second or subsequent offence in a period of three years carries a mandatory disqualification of not less than six months increased to one year under section 3 (4).  It should be pointed out that automatic disqualification for a first offence is limited in the existing legislation to drunk driving offences and to dangerous driving leading to death or serious injury or serious bodily harm.  I am not convinced a sustainable argument has been made for extending the mandatory disqualification beyond the existing range of offences.  I am satisfied that the increased penalty coupled with power to disqualify which, I am sure, the courts will use with due discretion in appropriate circumstances are a sufficient deterrent and deserve to be given a chance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister has put on record his own views in this matter as to whether the types of checks proposed should be accepted and implemented and, in the light of the grounds he has mentioned, we will not push it to a vote.  However this gives me the opportunity of highlighting the very serious problem of uninsured driving.  There is an escalation in the number of persons driving uninsured cars and they constitute a very serious hazard on our roads. People who are unfortunate enough to be involved in accidents caused by non-insured drivers are at a very serious disadvantage and these drivers constitute a very serious burden on road users who are complying with the law and who are paying insurance.  Insurance is extremely high.  A sum of £1,000 for motor insurance has been mentioned.  When one considers the fact that in 1983 there were 450,000 prosecutions under the Road Traffic Acts we have some idea of the magnitude of the problem.  As I said earlier, 62,000 of those related to uninsured drivers.  Practically 75 per cent of the workload of the District Court is taken up with cases under the Road Traffic Acts.  I do not know whether this is the correct way to introduce penalties or whether some other way, such as the Minister is suggesting, would be more appropriate.  The position is most unsatisfactory and if there are 150,000 uninsured <Col N="1390" /> motor vehicles being driven on the roads surely that is a situation that cries out for redress.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot just sit back and claim that these changes will in themselves bring about a major improvement in the presEnt unhappy situation.  The penalties should be such as to make it prohibitive for anybody to bring an uninsured motor vehicle on to our roads.  I doubt if these variations in penalties will bring about any major improvement.  I am told that there are claims of up to £30 million compensation already as a result of accidents caused by uninsured drivers. I am informed the insurance bureau is adding £70 to each premium to meet the cost of these claims for compensation. The law-abiding motorist is paying for the damage caused by the uninsured driver.  I do not believe any increases in penalty will act as a sufficient deterrent or make those people think twice before they take an uninsured vehicle on to the road.</P>
      <P>I tabled a specific amendment, amendment No 7, but it has been declared out of order.  Had that amendment been accepted I believe it would have acted as a deterrent because current insurance would have to be exhibited on the vehicle. Several Deputies have suggested that that would be the most positive step designed to bring about a substantial improvement.  War must be declared on uninsured drivers.  District justices on average fine the uninsured driver £50. The maximum fine was supposed to be £100 but in practice the level is invariably £50 so even if we increase the fines we have no reason to believe the courts will impose those fines and the result will be the penalties will not act as a deterrent. If one is only fined £50 and one's insurance costs £500 one will take a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Insurance can be as high now as £1,000. Some young people would be quoted figures of that kind.  They are not going to bother paying that sum of money to an insurance company.  All they need do is hope that the Garda will not be as vigilant in this matter as some of us might wish and that they can get away with six or 12 months' driving without ever being found out.  Even if they are found out, they are <Col N="1391" /> prepared to take that chance and pay the fine.  If the courts were imposing fines of £50 up to now, are they going to impose £500 on average in the future?  I do not know that &mdash; we shall have to wait and see.  If those who are charged with decisions in our District Courts were to read the Dáil debates they would see that it is the will and wish of this House that they deal much more severely with people who are responsible for this offence of driving without insurance.  I would urge greater severity in the imposition of financial penalties on these people.</P>
    <P>I must express serious regret at the decision to rule my amendment out of order.  All of us in the House would agree that if it was compulsory to display insurance certificates on one's windscreen that in itself would act as a very great deterrent because it would be easy to determine whether a person had or had not paid insurance.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the courts do not normally impose a fine which they are of the opinion that the defendant is unable to pay.  That puts us in the same position as the Minister has mentioned with regard to my proposal &mdash; it will be those of least means who will be the ones to suffer custodial penalties by getting jail sentences.  The public want to see a greater crackdown on uninsured drivers and there is now an acceptance that our courts should administer short jail sentences more frequently in cases involving drunken, reckless and uninsured driving. It should not be the principle administered in our courts that those of poor means are the ones to go to jail.  Short jail sentences have been shown to be very effective in other countries in regard to drunken driving.  I have no doubt that they would have the same effect on people taking the chance of driving without insurance.  There is an outcry from those complying with the law to the authorities to be more active in ensuring that all citizens comply with the law.</P>
    <P>In 1982 there were only 38,209 uninsured drivers convicted out of the 62,000 prosecutions which were brought before the courts.  Whether that was due to slipshod documentation on the part of the <Col N="1392" /> prosecution, or cases struck out on technicalities or whatever, it appears that only a little over half the cases brought before the courts resulted in a conviction of any kind.  The average fine imposed, as I say, was only £50.  There is clear evidence that the courts have been dealing extremely  with our uninsured drivers up to the present.  I am sure that all of us in the House would hope that in future, with the increased fine, the courts will take cognisance of the wishes of Parliament and the anger of the people against those who are flouting the law and in this way putting up the costs on the law-abiding citizens.</P>
    <P>The Irish Insurance Association have recently given figures which show the alarming increase in the amount of outstanding claims against uninsured motorists. The graph rises very dramatically.  I should like to put these figures on the record: in 1978 the figure was £4 million, in 1979 £7 million, 1980 £11 million, 1981 £18 million and 1982 £27 million.  I am not exaggerating the seriousness of this problem when I state that it is a national scandal.  Those figures well justify that statement.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister has not found some other way, if not by way of my amendment, to introduce greater legal deterrents.  I accept his point that the minimum penalty of £100 would be unfair to a person of very poor means who, through some mistake or other, had failed to insure his vehicle.  However, if a person brings a vehicle out on to the road it is recognised as a lethal weapon and if he is in charge of it, the very least he should do before he goes on the roads with it is to make sure that he is insured. It is a very great crime for anybody to drive an uninsured vehicle and up to now the courts have not treated it as such.</P>
    <P>I would not like to be accused of proposing something which would be a burden on people of small means, but if a person owns a motor vehicle, he must be of some means and insurance is part of the cost of motoring.  The full cost should be taken into consideration before people decide to own cars and bring them out on the roads.  Penalties must be taken into account when they decide to run a <Col N="1393" /> car and invest their own personal income in the purchase of the car and the purchase of fuel in making use of it.  In making that decision they should be fully aware that any contravention of the laws of the land which apply to owning and using a vehicle extend to fines of a minimum of £100, as suggested in this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not see his way to accepting this amendment today and I shall not push it to a vote.  However, having the amendment down has given me the opportunity of highlighting the views of my party and of myself in this matter and of expressing my regret that the Minister has not taken some initiatives in introducing greater deterrents. The disc would have satisfied many in this House and it is very strange that in discussing a Road Traffic Bill an amendment requiring the placing of a disc on a windscreen should be ruled out of order and that we cannot discuss it as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very considerable sympathy for the amendment tabled by Deputy Molloy.  I accept the Minister's response to it.  It would be unfair to impose on the courts a very rigid position in which they would be obliged to impose a fine on somebody who simply did not have the money.  However, I want to take issue with the Deputy on one other matter. He seems to blame the courts for the penalties which they have been imposing. The truth is that judges throughout the length and breadth of the country have been expressing frustration at the very restricted way they have to operate in the matter of non-insurance.  The first body of people to highlight the outrageous fact that in this country at the moment about one in five drivers is uninsured were the Judiciary.  If the blame lies anywhere, it lies with this House and with successive Governments who allowed this to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>A £50 fine was not much of a deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Fines of £50 will never solve this problem.  I support the general thrust of this Bill in the sense that it will allow judges to impose substantial fines.  However, if a person cannot pay an insurance premium of £600 or £700, there is very little point in fining him those amounts. As I know from my own experience in defending people in the District Court for non-insurance, generally they are young people who have no money or, indeed, may not have a job.  Imposing a sentence of £600 or £700 carries with it the sting that in the event of the fine not being paid, they go to prison for a month or so.  They will go to prison for a month because the truth is that these people do not have the price to pay insurance cover. Unfortunately this Bill does not recognise that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Bill was indicated on Second Stage as just one in a series of measures which the Government propose, but frankly they and previous Governments have been lax in this.  The <Col N="1395" /> matter is not being accorded the urgency which it warrants.  A few weeks ago I asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism some questions. His junior Minister came in to reply to them.  When I suggested that the level of uninsured driving was somewhere between 20 and 25 per cent the response I got from that junior Minister was that I was exaggerating and had exaggerated on this issue for the last few months.  I raised this matter consistently since last March and it gives me no pleasure to find that the Motor Insurers' Buraeu of Ireland now come out and say that in their estimation the level of uninsured driving is one in five.  I estimated it was somewhere between 20 and 25 per cent, so we are not that far apart.</P>
    <P>It is a national scandal that that is the case.  What is even worse is that the establishment, the Government and the Civil Service, do not appear to accept that that is the position.  Anybody who observes the level of accident claims being dealt with by the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland, particularly the rate of increase each year over the last three years, has to recognise that the level of uninsured driving is at a far higher level than the Department accept.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy gave some figures in relation to the amount paid out in claims. The estimated amount of claims which are not paid is even more significant.  At the end of 1982 the estimated amount of outstanding claims to the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland for uninsured driving was £27.6 million.  Within 12 months that figure had grown to £42 million.  Three years ago the Commission on Motor Insurance reckoned that over 10 per cent of the Irish driving population were uninsured. That rate of increase alone should have alerted Department officials to the fact that the level of uninsured driving was increasing dramatically.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurers' Bureau now accept that that figure is 20 per cent but it may be a bit more.  It is certain that it is over twice what it is in the UK.  The UK figure is quoted at 8 per cent.  It is very interesting to note that there has <Col N="1396" /> been an increase there in the past few years of very significant proportions as well.  In Germany the figure is 1 per cent so we actually have over 20 times the level of uninsured driving they have in Germany.  There is clearly something wrong.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will do absolutely nothing to deal with the problem.  There is no doubt that the fines should be greater than they are because unquestionably there are some people who drive without insurance who could afford to pay a more substantial fine than the fines the judges can impose at present.  It is naive to believe that this Bill will make any significant impact on the problem. The vast majority of people who are driving without insurance are people who do not have the money to pay for insurance.</P>
    <P>I have quoted figures in the House on Second Stage of this Bill and I have had questions down about the matter but I cannot say I have got very far.  I went through details of a survey I carried out for young people.  There are approximately 18 insurance companies operating in the motor insurance field.  I inquired through an agent what the cost would be for a 20-year old person to obtain motor insurance for what we described as a Ford Fiesta car three years old, valued at £2,000.  Only one insurance company out of the 18 companies contacted would even consider covering them for insurance. The rest of them said they did not cover young drivers notwithstanding all the promises we have from the Department that there is no difficulty for young people getting insurance and they have all sorts of safety nets to ensure this does not happen.  The one company who offered insurance was the subsidised one, the PMPA, who quoted £1,032 for third party insurance for a car valued £2,000. To suggest that a young person who puts together all he has to provide himself with a £2,000 car, frequently to get to work, could afford to pay £1,032 per annum in insurance premium is a joke. To push the thing further, to believe that you will stop that person driving by increasing the penalties for non-insurance from £100 to £1,000 makes a right farce out of it altogether.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> I am not disagreeing with the Bill in principle.  I believe it needs to be done but let us not cod ourselves that this Bill will solve the problem of uninsured driving. It will not.  If we are serious about solving this problem we will take steps. I want to make a couple of suggestions to the Minister because there is something he can do.  I want to make it quite clear I am not blaming the Minister for this for one second.  There has been among the various Ministers and civil servants who have been in this Department a complete lack of recognition of the very real problem which exists and is now growing to crisis proportions in relation to uninsured driving.</P>
    <P>I believe something could be done within this Bill.  I cannot remember what the reason is but I know there is some reason why the disc proposed by Deputy Molloy and which was originally proposed by the Commission on Motor Insurance in 1981 is impractical.  I gather there is some substantial reason why that is not on but there is no reason in the world why every driver should not be obliged to have with him or her, when driving a car, evidence that he or she is insured.  The figures quoted by Deputy Molloy which indicate that about half of the people stopped for insurance and charged afterwards are acquitted in court on production of an insurance certificate is a fair indication of the lack of concern among the public in relation to the whole question of insurance.  When people are stopped by a member of the Garda Síochána and are asked to produce evidence of insurance they have 14 days within which to produce their insurance certificates at a station named by them. I am always amazed that in 30, 40 and 50 per cent of cases people either forget or do not bother to produce their insurance certificates, the result being that all of the time of the court is taken up when those cases are ultimately thrown out.  There is also the cost involved for the driver.</P>
    <P>There should be a law whereby any person who drives without evidence of insurance on him or her could have the car he or she is driving confiscated.  If this were done as a temporary expedient for a couple of years in order to bring home <Col N="1398" /> to our motorists the seriousness of this problem I believe we would get somewhere with it.  It is a question of enforcing the law.  That is something the Minister could consider doing in this Bill.  He could bring in an amendment on Report Stage which would deal with that problem.  I urge him to take a serious look at this.  I have no objection at all if it is put down with a limitation of two or three years on it to see if it might deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The greatest proportion of uninsured people driving cars are young people. The reason there is such a significant proportion of uninsured young drivers is that they cannot get insurance.  Young people are being discriminated against to an outrageous degree.  I know it has always been accepted as reasonable by the Department and by previous Ministers that because young people have a record of more accidents they should pay a higher premium.  That is all right within reason but the whole principle of insurance is that you spread the load over as many people as possible.  They may regard that as an acceptable exception to that rule but at the moment, either because young people cannot get insurance at all, or because the premiums charged by the few companies who will provide insurance to young people, are so high, practically speaking, they are not being offered insurance.</P>
    <P>That problem has to be tackled and this Bill will not do it.  The only way to do it is to reduce the cost of insurance for young people.  If that causes some interference by the Government and by this legislature into the free marketing operation of the insurance industry so be it. You cannot say to young people: &ldquo;We are charging you £1,500 or £1,000 for your insurance premium because young people have a bad driving record&rdquo; and expect those young people who have just acquired a licence to get experience anywhere.  They will not get experience if they cannot drive the car.  The problem has to be faced up to.  We have 20 per cent of our drivers uninsured and, amongst them, a great number of young people who are being forced into the commission of criminal offences because we will not recognise that they have a <Col N="1399" /> very real problem in that they are not being accommodated within the insurance market.</P>
    <P>I am completely fed up with the response I have been getting from different Departments.  I am told on the one hand that we have a declined cases agreement and that young people will not be refused insurance on the grounds of age alone.  I am told by companies that they would never refuse to insure people because they are young or because of their age alone.  When you got a young person to approach an insurance company up to a couple of months ago you were told: &ldquo;sorry, we do not deal with young people&rdquo;.  I have a letter here from an insurance company.  I will not put their name on record.  I indicated in a question I put down in the Dáil some months ago that only one company in the motor insurance business would cover young people.  This company would deny that. They claim they never refuse insurance. I have a letter from an inspector in one of their provincial offices headed: Re Motor insurance for Mary Blank who is the daughter of Mr. Blank who got the letter. Mr. Blank was written to as follows:</P>
    <P>We refer to the above.  We have referred the proposal form to our Head Office and we regret we are unable to quote due to the age of your daughter.</P>
    <P>When I claimed in this House that that was the position with every insurance company bar one, it was not accepted. When I pursued it with supplementary questions a few weeks ago, I know I was irritating the Minister.  I regretted that.  I know his civil servants did not agree with a word I was saying.  The reality is not being accepted within the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. I do not know about the Department of the Environment.  The Minister is here now, and I am hoping to get some action. Motor insurers are refusing young people the opportunity to drive with insurance because of high premiums.  They are being refused insurance because the motor insurance industry does not want their business.  That is the real problem. We are skirting around the issue.  I am <Col N="1400" /> not against this Bill.  It is important but it does not deal with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that this amendment is seen within the context of the Bill as a means of highlighting the fact that non-insured cars are a serious problem.  I dispute with the last speaker the suggestion that raising the fine would not act as a deterrent.  I feel it would.  I should like to see the fine much greater than the level at which it is pitched.</P>
      <P>We cannot be so naive as to believe that people who can purchase a motor car and petrol cannot pay insurance.  The one in five or the 20 per cent figure has to be critically analysed.  Out of that 20 per cent a proportion of young drivers emerges and a proportion of elderly drivers emerges.  That is not the entire problem. I am sure Deputy Molony realises that there is a practice whereby insurance is deliberately avoided by buying and selling secondhand cars very rapidly to stay ahead of the machinery which technically can catch people for registration and insurance.</P>
      <P>I refer to the practice of buying a secondhand motor car and selling it within the year, and continuing on like that. This is rampant in Dublin.  Anyone who feels that it is a question of not being able to carry the insurance burden is not putting the matter in perspective.  There are some remedies which can be taken from a practical point of view.  I would like to see whether insurance could be tied in with taxation on an annual basis to make it easier for people to cope with the problem of planned payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If insurance companies are discriminating against a particular sector of motor users, it should be possible within the EEC context to consider international coverage.  Perhaps a person could buy a policy cheaper in Italy, or England, or <Col N="1401" /> Germany which would give international coverage.  When one is going abroad it is not very expensive to extend the insurance cover.  When there is a head office or a branch in another country this can be done by a stroke of the pen without incurring any other cost.  The Minister should consider rationalising insurance on an international basis.</P>
    <P>It should be mandatory to have a visual display of insurance cover on all vehicles. If Deputy Molloy's request to increase the fine were accepted in the spirit in which it is presented, this would underline the Minister's intention.  I have no doubt that he is serious in his intention. It is a very difficult problem, but there would be no loss of face involved in recommending an increase in the fine.  I remember when another Bill was going through, an amendment by the Opposition to increase the fine was accepted in that spirit.  The House is united in addressing itself to the question of non-insurance.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak briefly about insurance for the elderly.  It is suggested that young people cannot get insurance because they are discriminated against and companies are not willing to insure them as first purchasers of insurance. How would the House feel about drivers with an excellent record of driving for 30, 40 or 50 years, and yet when they arrive at a certain stage, their policies are loaded purely on account of their age rather than because of a medical fitness test?  That practice should not be accepted.  I hope when the Minister is replying he will refer to elderly drivers and particularly those who have had a safe driving record over the years.  They should not be loaded unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>The nub of this matter is a commercial one.  It is a question of insurance companies being in the market place for business. If there is open competition on an international scale, and if there is business to be sought, given the tight recession in which we find ourselves the insurance companies should be only too willing to get in there and quote at every possible opportunity.  It will be necessary to have an obligatory fitness test for insurance, where the people most fit to drive <Col N="1402" /> will get insurance at the cheapest rate. The cost can also be borne almost as a purchase tax through the sale of petrol. There are many ramifications to the Bill. I appeal to the Minister, as a gesture of goodwill, to accept Deputy Molloy's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Two points have been made, one by Deputy Molony and the other by Deputy Brady, to which I should like to refer.  I should like to be associated with the remarks regarding young people who have problems obtaining motor insurance.  The premiums are so high that it is impossible for many young people to obtain motor insurance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brady spoke about insurance for elderly people.  I know of a person over 80 years who has been driving for the past 40 years and who has an accident-free record.  That person was requested by his insurance company to go for a medical examination by the local doctor who certified him fit to drive. Nevertheless, the insurance company refused to give him insurance cover.  The man concerned is not well off and I made representations on his behalf to the company concerned.  He has now to go to see a consultant surgeon in Ailesbury Road to find out if he will certify him fit to drive.  That is ludicrous.  The man has an impeccable driving record and he requires a car for travelling in and out of town.  He is in good health, he has never had an accident and having regard to the care he takes in driving he is unlikely to have a road accident in the future.  In my view he is being discriminated against in this instance.</P>
      <P>An important matter and one where I consider there is a grave miscarriage of justice has not been mentioned in the debate so far.  In my constituency in the past few years I have come across probably ten people who have received serious permanent injuries and who will never obtain any compensation.  The interesting point is that they were travelling on vehicles that were insured.  I am referring to pillion passengers on motor cycles.</P>

      <P>The mileage <Col N="1403" /> on this section is getting excessive.  I have allowed a lot of discussion on it. The emphasis is on non-insurance but the Deputy is talking about vehicles that are insured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  In 80 per cent of cases a person travelling as a pillion passenger on a motor cycle is not insured.  If he suffers permanent injuries following an acident he will not obtain any compensation unless he can bring a claim against the driver of the other vehicle.  If the driver of the motor cycle hits a wall with no other vehicle involved and if the pillion passenger receives serious brain injuries he cannot claim compensation in at least 80 per cent of cases. The exception is the Norwich Union Insurance Company who provide cover for approximately 20 per cent of motor cyclists but this means that 80 per cent of pillion passengers cannot make any claims and get compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I think some penalties should be imposed in the cases I mentioned. I put the question whether it is not necessary to impose a penalty on the driver of a motor cycle who carries a pillion passenger and who has not cover for that passenger?  The existing situation cannot continue.  In my view a minimum of 1,000 people have suffered permanent injuries but they have not obtained any compensation.  It is essential that some kind of cover be provided for pillion passengers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy made the point that district justices have been very lenient with some people who had not insured their vehicles.  He said that, where a person with no means is brought before the courts, justices are faced with the choice of sending them to jail or not imposing a fine.  In general the courts have made every effort to comply with the Road Traffic Acts.  There are many instances where judges impose the maximum fines and, in many instances, even for a first offence, they have suspended people from driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>And they have sent them to jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>They have suspended them for specific periods on their own <Col N="1405" /> volition because they fully realise the dangers of allowing people to drive motor vehicles without insurance.  It is necessary to allow judges some discretion because there are many instances of people who drive cars in exceptional circumstances without insurance.  Perhaps the owner of a car becomes seriously ill and someone else in the house may bring him to hospital although they are not covered to drive.  In a case like that there must be discretion to impose a reduced fine.  To impose a mandatory, minimum penalty would not be the correct procedure to adopt.  I hope that judges will go along with the Minister's general intentions to try to make it more difficult to drive without insurance and to increase the fines on people who do so.  I am also pleased that the Minister is increasing the mandatory disqualification from six months to 12 months for second offences. That is necessary and desirable and will be of benefit in reducing the number of people driving without insurance.</P>
      <P>Many speakers have mentioned the necessity for having motor insurance discs displayed on vehicles.  However, the problem with regard to that is that the law at present requires the person using the vehicle to be insured, not the vehicle. Under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, the person using the vehicle must be insured or guaranteed.  The vehicle cannot be used by people other than the owner unless they are insured or guaranteed and have the owner's permission.  The fact that an up-to-date motor insurance disc is displayed on a vehicle is not proof of the identity of the person in charge of the vehicle, so that a person who takes a vehicle without the owner's permission displaying a disc would be regarded as driving lawfully by the Garda and there would be no questions asked.  Of course if the vehicle had been stolen it would not be covered because the driver did not have the owner's consent to drive.  We must amend our legislation to cover that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The passing of legislation in regard to drunken driving has resulted in a reduction in the number of road accidents and An Foras Forbartha statistics prove this. I hope the amendments before the House <Col N="1406" /> at present will mean a further reduction in road accidents.</P>

      <P>Before we pursue the matter of insuring a vehicle, we should study the situation regarding taxation of a vehicle.  I have come across a case to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention. A summons was sent to my home address from the Parking Fines Office in Coleraine Street, Dublin, in the name of a person c/o my home address.  I know the person involved although he is not from my constituency and he did not have my permission to register his vehicle at my address.  I intend to hand a copy of the summons to the Minister so that he can investigate the matter.  I sorted out this matter with the fines section but I was amazed to discover that the vehicle was taxed by the taxation officer in Roscommon on the basis of the information given by the person involved.  I was not informed by the Motor Taxation Office or the person that they were using my address for taxing the vehicle.  The person is not from County Roscommon.  I recall a person of that name but I have had no personal contact with the person concerned. The Fines Office are now unable to trace the person concerned because the address given was totally inadequate. The Minister might examine the matter of information given by individuals to the motor taxation offices.</P>

      <P>Generally in relation to motor taxation the amendments put forward by our spokesperson should be accepted by the Government.  There is a major crisis obtaining in relation to the non-insurance of vehicles.  The points made by Deputies Molony and Enright in relation to the cost of motor insurance are very relevant.  The Government should take more positive action to bring down the cost of insurance to young drivers.</P>

      <P>I am entitled to a passing reference as well.  In relation to the amendments I can only support those put down by our spokesperson.  Indeed, one amendment referred also to the displaying of a disc, but was ruled out of order. I would again ask the Minister to reconsider his decision to rule that out of order. I do not see any reason why the amendment put down by our spokesperson should have been ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might revert to the situation regarding the overall question of penalties and fines because the question of the non-insurance of vehicles has reached crisis proportions at present.  I believe that the cost of insurance to everybody has been <Col N="1408" /> increased because of the number of uninsured vehicles being used, the number of accidents in which they have been involved and the cost of which has been loaded on to people who have not been responsible for such accidents.  That is why our spokesperson has advocated this strong line in relation to the non-insurance of vehicles.  The point made by the Minister, and which was mentioned by other former Minister in this House, that the amendment put forward provided a disc for the display of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the actual fines being imposed under amendments Nos. 2 and 3 put forward by Deputy Molloy.  The reason people are not insuring their vehicles is the cost and, unless the Government move on that, this problem will recur constantly.</P>
      <P>The one hope of devising a national insurance scheme for young drivers is through the PMPA, which is now a State-run and controlled insurance company and which, with the support of the levy at present, is being supported by every other insurance company and insured driver.  I believe the PMPA could be given a certain allowance to devise a cheaper insurance scheme for younger drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate has been interesting and wide-ranging over the whole of the insurance area.  As you said, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, most of the comments made are more proper to another Minister.  We are dealing here with increased penalties for certain offences under the Road Traffic Acts and therefore I must confine myself to that brief and also to the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> At the outset I gave a full explanation of why I felt Deputy Molloy's suggestions would not constitute the best way to deal with the problem, that perhaps it would take away discreation from the Judiciary. That would not be good justice; it may be better law but I do not think it would be so good on the justice side.  Therefore, I consider the proposals contained in the Bill constitute the better method.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill increase the maximum penalty for uninsured drivers to £1,000, a very large increase.  Evidence we have suggests that when penalties are increased usually the Judiciary take due notice and have increased fines accordingly. This happened when stiffer penalties were introduced for drunken driving under the 1978 Act, when the then maximum went from £100 to £500, which was reflected in higher fines imposed by justices throughout the country.  Bearing in mind the intense feelings of all Members of the House about uninsured drivers, the difficulties they are causing, their numbers and the fact that they are making everybody else's insurance more expensive, I am satisfied that justices will take note of what has been said in this House and will avail of the greater latitude the provisions of this Bill will afford them in the area of fines.</P>
    <P>I might also point out that under the provisions of this Bill it is proposed to increase the period of mandatory disqualification for a second or subsequent offence within three years from six months to one year.  Therefore we are not just providing that the fines be heavier but we are also increasing the mandatory disqualification period by six months which can be a very heavy penalty on somebody who is dependent on a car but who through negligence had not insured it.</P>
    <P>I would prefer that the amendments would be withdrawn and that Deputy Molloy would accept the case I have made.  We consider this to be the best way forward in this area.  In any event, I would have to oppose the amendments, but I should prefer that they be withdrawn. Nevertheless I want to give the Deputy a small bit of information which may be of some help to him.  While his <Col N="1410" /> amendment No. 7 has been ruled out of order &mdash; and other speakers mentioned that fact in the course of the debate &mdash; I might inform the House that I have been advised that section 11 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, contains adequate powers to make regulations requiring the display of an insurance disc on vehicles. Following consideration of the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Cost and Methods of Providing Motor Insurance a statement was issued in October 1983 indicating the Government's intention to introduce a requirement on those lines.  The preliminary views of the insurance company interests and of the Garda have been obtained and are being considered by my Department.  As I indicated in reply to a parliamentary question on 15 May, further discussions have been arranged to finalise details of the requirements, including the commencement date.  I shall be announcing the details of the scheme for having discs displayed on motor cars and vehicles generally in the near future.  I hope that will ameliorate Deputy Molloy's attitude to these amendments and that he will see his way to withdraw them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give the House his estimate of the numbers of uninsured drivers in the country?  The figure I stated &mdash; an estimated 150,000 &mdash; needs some official confirmation as to whether it is a correct estimate and whether it would represent a loss to motor insurance of approximately £50 million.  Can the Minister also tell the House what is the loss to insurance arising from the numbers of people uninsured?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very cautious about Deputy Molloy's demand for statistics. I do not want to come up with statistics here for which I have no basis and we have no basis in our Department for any statistics under the heading for which he has asked me.  Therefore, I would not use this House to inform him and the rest of the country that there is a certain level of uninsured drivers that is known.  I am afraid that that statistic is not known to us.  Estimates could be <Col N="1411" /> made but I would not suggest that they would be even remotely correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is surprising that the Minister cannot indicate what he thinks is the extent of this problem of uninsured drivers.  That is very disappointing.  I ask the Minister if he will reconsider his answer.  Surely with the compilation of comprehensive information in regard to motor vehicles, the number of vehicles on the road and the number of people with driving licences and the Department's responsibilities under the Road Traffic Act in regard to uninsured drivers, that is not asking too much.  Are we exaggerating the problem?  Are the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland and the Automobile Association exaggerating the problem?  What is the opinion of the Minister for the Environment and his Department?  Surely they have something to say about this.  The number of outstanding claims has been increasing at such a rate and now stands, if Deputy Molony's figure is correct &mdash; I have not the figure for 1983 &mdash; at £40 million. Surely that is a serious scandal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the best estimate we have.  In 1982 it was 62,264 for compulsory insurance offences and in 1983 the figure was 91,147.  This is the closest indication of the level of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the figure I quoted.  He said that claims <Col N="1412" /> last year cost the Motor Insurance Bureau £13 million.  That is correct.  That was the value of the claims settled or dealt with in 1983.  The figures that I referred to were calculated by the Motor Insurance Bureau as the cost of all outstanding claims notified to them.  My purpose in quoting those figures was to show the rate of success.  At the end of 1982 the value they put on all outstanding claims notified to them was £27.6 million. The value of all outstanding claims notified to them a year later was £42 million. As Deputy Enright pointed out, the accident rate has been dropping and that would indicate that the level of insurance is increasing rapidly.</P>
      <P>I express sympathy with the Minister here.  Obviously Deputy Molloy would like the Minister to give him the information he seeks, but it is impossible to assess precisely the number of uninsured drivers on the roads.  The only way to check that is for every driver in the country to be stopped and his insurance certificate checked out.  There is no other way to do it; you can &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo; after that.  A survey carried out by the Garda somewhere in the west showed the level of uninsured drivers as 22 per cent, an indication that the matter is serious.  The level of prosecutions in the District Court is an indication that the matter is serious. The figure was accepted at 10 per cent in 1981.  On that basis consider that the level of outstanding claims on the Motor Insurance Bureau is increasing.  Recognising that the accident rate is dropping and considering that increase, it does not surprise me that the Motor Insurance Bureau, very much an establishment body not given to exaggerated claims in regard to any statistics, are now satisfied that the level of uninsured driving is of the order of 20 per cent.  The situation has reached catastrophic proportions and must be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise one further point on the section or it may be appropriate on the amendment.  Perhaps the Minister will consider on Report Stage providing for a penalty of compulsory community service for a person convicted of uninsured driving.  Jail might serve as a deterrent but expense is involved in maintaining <Col N="1413" /> people in prison.  The effect of the section and particularly of Deputy Molloy's amendment if accepted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That involves another Department, the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of Deputy Molloy's amendment if accepted would be that district justices would have to impose penalties of a certain amount and under the existing provision a person who fails to pay a penalty is imprisoned for a period of time.  Judges will impose substantial fines even if Deputy Molloy's amendment is not accepted.  Judges will have the power to impose fines of up to £1,000.  If a judge imposes a fine on a man of straw, a person who has no money, of £500, £600 or £700, that fine will not be paid and the person will have to go to prison.  That will be unpleasant for the person, equally unpleasant for the Minister for Finance who will have to pick up the tab for it, and for the taxpayer who is already overburdened.  Perhaps the Minister will consider imposing a mandatory sentence of community service on somebody who has committed what is, after all, the violently anti-social offence of driving uninsured.  That might be a solution to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why Deputy Molony rose to correct some figures which I gave when he merely confirmed the figure that I had already given.  I mentioned that claims of £13 million were made each year against the Motor Insurance Bureau and I said also that the figures given by the Motor Insurance Bureau in regard to the number of outstanding claims against uninsured motorists was £27 million odd in 1982.  I had not the figure for 1983, which he tells us has gone to £42 million.  That amount in outstanding claims is clear evidence of the rapid increase in the number of uninsured drivers on our roads, claims jumping up from £11 million in 1980 to £18 million in 1981, £27 million in 1982 and now, if the figure is correct, £42 million in 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's response has not indicated <Col N="1414" /> to us that he is alarmed as we and some Deputies on his own side of the House are in regard to this matter.  The amendment which he has asked me to withdraw was recommended by a Government-appointed body, the Prices Advisory Committee on motor insurance. In their report they recommended the need for legislation of this kind.  I am sure that the people appointed to that committee by the Government at that time would all have been very responsible, with wide experience of motor insurance and the operation of the Road Traffic Acts.  Their opinion was that a mandatory fine of the kind mentioned in the amendment would be necesary to act as any kind of serious deterrent and that automatic disqualification would be warranted in the case of deliberate non-insurance. If the Government are not prepared to go so far at this stage, we will not push it to a vote; but if the amendment is not acceptable to the Government we would like to hear of some positive moves which would act as a serious deterrent.  Therefore, I am pleased to hear the Minister confirm that, though my amendment in regard to the placing of an insurance disc on motor vehicles has been ruled out of order here, he is now of opinion that under the Road Traffic Acts he is empowered to make regulations enabling the compulsory carrying of insurance discs to be introduced. If that is so, all we can do is welcome that move and urge him to come forward with the changes and implement the new regulations as quickly as possible.  We feel that that certainly will act as a major deterrent.  I hope the Minister can do that at an early date.  In view of the Minister's decision to introduce insurance discs I am withdrawing the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, after line 8, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(7)  The following subsection is <Col N="1415" /> hereby substituted for subsection (2) of section 112 of the Principal Act:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(2)  A person who contravenes subsection (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment;</P>
    <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £2,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both such fine and such imprisonment.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to increase the penalty for an offence under section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, where a person uses or takes possession of a vehicle without the consent of the owner or without other lawful authority. The maximum penalty for such an offence is a £50 fine or six months imprisonment or both.  The amendment proposes to provide for a maximum penalty on summary conviction before the District Court of a £1,000 fine or 12 months imprisonment or both.  This penalty is consistent with those for the most serious offences outlined elsewhere in the Bill. However, because the unlawful taking of cars is now a more serious and pervasive problem than was the case when the 1961 Act was introduced, it is proposed to provide also for the option of trial by jury for such offences.  Conviction on indictment will attract the maximum penalty of a £2,000 fine or five years imprisonment or both.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We support the amendment. Undoubtedly the taking of vehicles without authority has become a very serious problem.  In the earlier years it was more of a Dublin problem but unfortunately the epidemic has spread to the provinces also.  The law needs strengthening in regard to this offence.  Consequently, <Col N="1416" /> we welcome the Minister's proposal.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the position in regard to the EEC Council of Ministers directive of 30 December 1983. I understand the directive was designed to secure more equal treatment throughout the Community for victims of traffic accidents, requiring member states to have compulsory motor insurance cover up to certain specified limits in order to make compensation available to innocent victims of traffic accidents which are caused by uninsured, stolen or unidentified vehicles.  There is some confusion as to when the directive is to be implemented. I understand the directive requires that national laws be amended by 31 December 1987 and that the provision is to be in operation by December 1988.  In reply to a parliamentary question recently the Minister indicated that there is an extension of four years in respect of this country.  This would mean that we would not be required to have the legislation in operation before 1992. The Minister stated that he would be introducing amendments to this Bill to cover points in regard to compensation for damage to motor vehicles that have been stolen but he has not put forward any amendment on those lines.  Perhaps he was mistaken on the occasion in question.</P>

      <P>I, too, support the amendment but it is necessary also that the Minister play a part in trying in some way to coèrce the manufacturers of cars to make it very much more difficult for cars to be stolen.  The Minister will appreciate that we support the amendment fully in respect of the imposition of fines. In many cases cars are being stolen by young vandals, vandals perhaps of a very strange kind because the practice in Dublin is merely to steal a car for the purpose of joyriding.  This can result in tragic accidents, as was the case recently. In some areas of Dublin cars are being stolen and then burned.  Apart from the imposition of fines the Minister should make it mandatory that certain types of locking devices are fitted to cars at the point of manufacture.  This would be the <Col N="1417" /> best deterrent.  Substantial amounts by way of claims in respect of malicious damages related to stolen cars are coming before the local authority in Dublin.  In Cork also the figures are outrageous in this respect.</P>
      <P>There are some cars that are very easily stolen and, strangely, these are usually the most expensive cars.  The BMW, for instance, is regarded as a very easy car to steal because it is very easy to start whereas other cars which are difficult to start will not attract vandals.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on the possibility of manufacturers being obliged to fit certain types of locking devices on cars.  We are not talking about something that will be of any cost to this State but more about the manufacturers playing their part, fulfilling a social obligation in helping to come to grips with the whole problem of the stealing of cars instead of engaging in advertising which glamorises the fast driving of cars.  This matter has been raised before in the House but the Minister has an opportunity now of doing something about it.</P>

Regarding the point made by Deputy Molloy, in the course of discussion of another road traffic Bill to be brought before the House, the directive to which he refers will be considered but it cannot be considered in the context of this Bill.</P>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Brady, it was stated in a press release of October 1983 that the Minister for Industry and Energy would be consulting with the motor industry on the possibility of securing facilities such as car locks.  I am dealing here only with the question of penalties so I cannot take up the Deputy's excellent suggestion.</P>

I should like to draw the Minister's notice to a device invented by two Galway men.  It is a tube lock for a motor car which is linked to the brake and the gear stick.  When it is locked with a heavy lock it is impossible to put the car into gear or release the brake.  It is impossible to steal such cars. The tube lock can be purchased for £30. I defy anyone to steal a vehicle which has a Galway tube lock fitted to the brake handle and the gear stick.</P>

In far too many cases the loss to the nation has been one of loss of life.

The simple lock device designed in Galway is only one of a number of similar such devices which, if made compulsory, could eliminate the problem of stolen motor cars.  I recommend that all owners of motor cars in the Dublin area who have to park in areas which are not secure should purchase a Galway tube lock.  I guarantee their car will not be stolen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>5.  In page 4, after line 8, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" />&ldquo;(8)  Section 113 of the Principal Act is hereby amended&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  by the deletion in subsection (1) of &lsquo;in a public place&rsquo;, and</P>
    <P>(b)  by the subsection of the following subsection for subsection (2):</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(2)  A person who contravenes subsection (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £350 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to increase the penalty for an offence under section 113 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 for interfering or attempting to interfere with the mechanism of a vehicle while it is stationary or to get into or attempt to get into a vehicle while it is stationary.  At present the maximum penalty is the general one in section 102 of that Act, namely a maximum of a £20 fine for a first offence; a maximum of a £50 fine for a second or subsequent offence or a maximum of £50 and/or three months imprisonment for a third or subsequent offence in any period of 12 months.  The amendment proposes to increase the maximum penalty to a fine of £350 or three months imprisonment or both.  This is in line with the penalty proposed in the Bill for moderately serious offences.  The upgrading of the proposed penalty is a reflection of the fact that unlawful interference is now a more serious problem than when the original legislation was enacted.  The opportunity is also being taken to extend the scope of this offence by removing the words &ldquo;in a public place&rdquo; from section 113 (1).  This will mean that interference with the mechanism of a vehicle will be an offence whether committed in a public place or on private property.  It gets over the anomaly that someone could be prosecuted under this provision where he interfered with a car on the street but not in the owner's driveway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment also <Col N="1420" /> deals with the problem of stolen cars.  We support it.  We recognise the necessity for it and hope it will in some way act as a deterrent to this epidemic which has struck Dublin and other urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a case in Dublin where somebody used a shotgun on a person who was stealing a motor car in the grounds of his home.  I do not advocate that kind of deterrent.  Can the Minister give a statistical breakdown on the number of cars reported interfered with in a public place and those within the confines of a private residence?</P>
      <P>I welcome the amendment.  This is an area where there was a void as regards implementation of the law.  It would be helpful to know that statistic.</P>
      <P>There are a sizeable number of traffic wardens on patrol in Dublin.  Their job is to prosecute or put on-the-spot parking fines on illegally parked cars.  Would the Minister think it a good idea if their duties were extended so that they could keep a more vigilant eye on cars?  This would help to make it more difficult for people to steal cars.  Traffic wardens are usually in the same area for a considerable length of time.  They get a feeling for the area. They are watching motor cars and vehicles which are parked in public places.  In many cases they see the owners leaving their cars.  They would be the best watch dogs, so to speak, to counteract this type of crime.  It is very difficult for a garda to spot a person getting into a car.  It is very easy to do so as often keys are interchangeable. It is difficult to pinpoint that kind of crime.  Traffic wardens who are on patrol all the time could be used to great advantage to make the law more effective.  Perhaps the Minister will consider this.</P>

      <P>In this amendment, the Minister stated that persons can be charged with breaking into a car on private property.  Do I take it that under the present law nobody can be arrested for committing a crime of breaking into a car if it is parked on private property?  I ask this question because only a week and a half ago a car was in the process of being broken into when the son of the owner <Col N="1421" /> of the car came home.  He was a big burly chap and tackled the two people breaking into the car.  He managed to detain them until the Garda were called.  The Garda refused to arrest these people but warned the owner of the car that his son might well be taken to court for assault by the two people breaking into the car.  Were the Garda correct in not arresting and detaining the two people caught in the act of breaking into the car because it was on private property?  Is that the law at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the last question first, it is my understanding of the Road Traffic Act that this is not an offence.  If the person stole the car in a private area it would be, but the act of getting into the car is not at present an offence.</P>
      <P>I can give the number of offences in which proceedings were taken for stealing mechanically propelled vehicles and for unauthorised interference with them. In 1982 there were 4,395 offences proceeded with and 3,738 in 1983.  Although the figure is down, I hope that means there has been a lessening in the number of offences.</P>
      <P>Traffic wardens could keep a vigilant eye on activities in a particular area but unfortunately they are not in a position to take enforcement action.  Nevertheless, they could, and usually do, act as a deterrent; but one of the problems is that they do not work at night.</P>

      <P>In this section the Minister is introducing imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months in the event of the driver or owner of a vehicle contravening the maximum weight requirement and the maximum general fine has been increased to £350.  I would like the Minister to give some indication why he <Col N="1422" /> considers it necessary to introduce imprisonment as part of the penalty for contravention in this case.  If the Minister has knowledge of extensive contravention of the maximum weight requirement, would he tell us the extent of the problem as it affects our roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This section increases penalties under the Road Traffic Act, 1968, other than those covered by the general penalty.  It also removes certain offences connected with weights of vehicles and the examination of vehicles from the scope of the general penalty and provides specific penalties for these.  The creation of specific penalties for those offences, involving imprisonment for a first offence as an option available to the courts instead of or in addition to a monetary penalty, is necessary in view of the greatly increased number of heavy vehicles on our roads and the need to protect roads and bridges from damage caused by excessive loading, leading in turn to increased infrastructural costs.</P>
      <P>A further objective is to ensure that the more liberal weight limits recently authorised are offset.  These limits are economically justifiable on the grounds of more efficient transport of goods, but it is essential to ensure that breaches of the law which could offer considerable commercial or financial advantage should be discouraged.  In addition, the section expresses certain vehicle weights in metric terms in line with the general Government policy on metrication.</P>

      <P>Money is being provided for additional weighbridges where the Garda feel there is a need, because the incidence of this offence is increasing. It is hoped to have sufficient weighbridges in each country to make detection of this offence easier and to ensure that it is cheaper for vehicle owners to test their vehicle weights.  These matters are being discussed at present.  This section is very important and should be <i>in situ</i> while these discussions are taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked this question because if a garda seeks to establish if the vehicle is within the required maximum weight it will be necessary for him to direct the driver to a location where there are facilities for weighing the lorry.  This is why I wanted to know what facilities are in existence for complying with this requirement.  The Minister is acknowledging that there are very few locations where the police may have vehicles weighed.  If that is so, would the Minister give more information about what he intends to do about this?  If a lorry driver driving west is stopped in Kinnegad by a garda who is of the opinion that the driver is not complying with the weight requirements, where would he direct the driver? If there is not a weighbridge within a reasonable distance this could involve an expensive delay for the driver and the lorry owner.  Now that the penalties for this offence are being increased to include a term of imprisonment, I presume it will be obligatory on the State to provide adequate facilities throughout the country to enable the Garda to enforce these regulations without causing unnecessary and excessive expense to drivers who comply with the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support my colleague, Deputy Molloy.  It is common knowledge that the law is being flouted in this respect on a daily basis. Many carriers openly admit that if they were to comply with the regulations they would be out of business.  I remember attending a deputation from the carriers at the Department of the Environment and coming away quite depressed on two <Col N="1424" /> counts.  First, it was openly acknowledged across the table that there was no way of complying with the axle tonnage laws being proposed; and second, and most seriously, the Department were concerned about the amount of irreversible damage being done to small roads, particularly small bridges and in urban areas the structural destruction of small homes by very large and heavy juggernauts which careered down side streets which were never intended to carry such traffic.  The amount of damage being done to small houses by these juggernauts is appalling.  All Deputies will have received complaints from constituents about damage of that kind.</P>
      <P>I will take the Mountpleasant area in Dublin as an instance.  It provides a short cut into which these giant lorries can go to avoid the main thoroughfares, and I doubt the practicality of identifying their weights from small signs on the trucks. Such lorries should be forced to carry recognisable weight signs so that people will be able to contact gardaí in towns and cities.  I am not talking about small notices but about the need to have the weights displayed visibly so that some effort can be made to make the owners comply with the law.</P>
      <P>There are two types of vehicles to which I would refer.  One is used in the building construction industry and carries large loads of materials.  The owners of such vehicles tend to comply with the law very strictly and I am not addressing my remarks to them.  I am referring mainly to juggernauts which come from overseas with heavy loads or who take on loads here and move about openly, flouting the law.  I particularly do not wish my remarks to be taken as directed at firms who comply with the law.  Indeed some of them are very hard pressed to comply with the weight regulations.  It is hard enough to get some of these vehicles through a road without talking of weighing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister would have to carry this a stage further.  We must have visible weight displayed on such trucks so that people can protest to local gardaí.  Some of these trucks are so <Col N="1425" /> unwieldy that when they hit icy patches of road they are lethal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support those who have spoken before me and join them in expressing great concern at the flouting of the law by the owners of overladen trucks which can do tremendous damage. I live in Celbridge and I have noticed many trucks definitely overloaded, but such observation would not stand up in a court of law.  The Minister must make provision for the stopping of this by increased fines, or imprisonment if necessary. I would ask the Minister to consider the taking away of licences or, say, reducing the number of licences issued to offending hauliers: if one of the haulier's trucks has offended he should be made to lose one licence if his drivers are repeatedly breaking the law.  The fine of £350 is too small to be a deterrent because if a driver is caught only once in 21 or 22 journeys the profits he would make out of overloading the truck would far outweigh the fine.</P>
      <P>If such vehicles are owned by one company is it the company who will bear the penalty and will it be in respect of each offending vehicle?  We need to be specific. Will we be imposing penalties in respect of each vehicle?  An owner could switch one vehicle for another.  Supposing he had three vehicles, AZW 123, AZW 124 and AZW 125, would there be only one offence or would there be three offences committed by the same owner? Would the Minister also tell us whether he is prepared to spend a certain amount of money to provide weighbridges at strategic points?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention to provide sufficient weighbridges prior to the introduction of this section? Speaking about weights, the tendency is to treat lorries and trailers as one.  I may have missed it, but is there provision to deal with this point &mdash; will it be the combined weight of trailer and lorry or will there be separate weights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 deals with maximum actual weights.  It deals with trailers as well as lorries.  The provision <Col N="1426" /> of additional weighbridges would be necessary because under existing law a vehicle cannot be apprehended, shall we say, and taken to a weighbridge unless it was apprehended within five miles of such a weighbridge.  Therefore, we will have to provide more weighbridges or deal with the distance a weighbridge can be from the scene of the alleged offence.  In reply to Deputy Briscoe's point, penalties can be imposed for each vehicle and if there was suspected excessive weight all vehicles would have to be tested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear more about the weighbridges.  Who will be charged with their provision?  I would expect that it would be very costly to construct weighbridges of sufficient size to cater for these massive vehicles.  I would be wary of the Minister's intention. He may decide to put further heavy cost on local authorities in view of the fact that the Government already are leaving local authorities short of funds to run existing services.  Would the Department of Transport be responsible?</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied that the section will have any practical effect. Even if we are willing to increase the distance which a vehicle will have to travel to a weighbridge, even if it is increased by ten or 15 miles, I cannot see how this provision will work and I should like a re-assurance from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that vehicles will be able to move commercially around towns without using weighbridges. I would draw Deputies' attention <Col N="1427" /> to the big vehicles that go through the countryside to Rosslare.  It would be impossible for them to get around this provision.  Undoubtedly, it would be necessary to provide more weighbridges because the type of vehicles that will be using them will more or less be forced to travel on major roadways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see this working at all.  I suggest that weighbridges would have to be constructed on a national grid system so that they would be located at least 20 miles from each other.  I accept one could see that system working out, but the first point would be to have an estimate of how many weighbridges would be needed.  Secondly, on current costs if we take one weighbridge we can do a calculation then as to how many would actually be envisaged and what would be the cost.</P>
      <P>Finally, I was rather taken aback that no reference was made to the destruction of property, both large and small.  Constituents in the inner city here have asked me if a case could be brought against the Department of the Environment for destruction done to their homes, destruction substantiated by architectural reports and so on, where foundations have subsided and frontages have been damaged.  At times the passage of a juggernaut can shake the whole house.  I do not suggest the Minister can cope with all this but I would like him to take up the point with regard to the destruction of small homes and small bridges.  I believe this whole matter was actually quantified by the Minister's Department and there are facts and figures available on the rate of destruction.  Speaking from memory, I think in so many years time unless steps are taken a percentage of our bridges will become dangerous.  I am not talking now of the principal bridges such as those across the Liffey or the Lee.  I am talking about the smaller bridges all over the country which are not suited to the heavy traffic using them.</P>

      <P>We are in agreement obviously on this and that is why we have increased the penalty for overloading. <Col N="1428" /> For a first offence it is imprisonment.  The cost of a weighbridge would be about £50,000 and from memory I believe five could be supplied.  The Garda have the right to make a spot-check and if they consider the weight is excessive they can require the driver to go to the weighbridge and have the lorry weighed. During the night huge trucks travel all over our main roads and travel within close proximity to weighbridges in the main towns of every country.  I suggest the Garda should wait for the trucks to come to them rather than have the Garda go up the roads looking for the trucks. With the increased numbers of weighbridges provided over the years this increasingly serious problem will be resolved.  We are introducing this section and we want it to be acted upon as quickly as possible.  Possibly we are not geared to meet the problem now and so it is wise to take this matter into account.</P>

I am sure the Minister will agree in relation to traffic accidents that there is a great danger to passengers in motor vehicles which do not have non-splintering type windscreens.  There are plenty of statistics to show the seriousness of resulting eye injuries.  Could the Minister give some indication whether he supports the proposal to make it compulsory, from a date to be fixed by the Minister, that all motor cars sold in this country be fitted with laminated non-splintering windscreens?

      <P>Absolutely.  It is not quite understood that toughened glass, of its very nature, actually explodes on impact.  Even if one is sitting in a car wearing a seat belt and travelling at 20 or 30 miles per hour a stone can hit the windscreen and cause it to explode, resulting in that person being permanently blinded.  This can be easily avoided as Deputy Molloy has suggested, by the compulsory fitting of laminated windscreens. This is obligatory in the United States and many European countries. The cost is between £5 and £20.</P>

The Minister is concerned about the compulsory wearing of seat belts and about drunken driving, but this is one case where by a simple regulation, similar to that applying to a compulsory insurance disc, he would be preventing 100 cases of eye damage each year.  The EEC supported the regulation seven years ago.  Everybody with a knowledge of the subject agrees that it should be mandatory.  It is a national scandal that this is not taking place here.

      <P>While accepting the Chair's ruling, I wish to tell the House that I am advised that section 11 of the Road Traffic Act of 1961 empowers me to make a regulation requiring the fitting of laminated windscreens to vehicles. The present regulation allows the use of toughened glass or laminated glass in windscreens and a review of the existing regulation had been previously prepared in view of the discussions at EEC level on the proposed directive on the subject. However, I have been recently informed that the prospects of an early adoption of that directive are now very slight.  In addition, strong representations have been made to me by the medical profession in favour of making laminated windscreens mandatory.  In the circumstances, I have had the position reviewed <Col N="1431" /> over the past few weeks and am glad to announce that, subject to certain consultations, it is proposed to make regulations requiring the fitting of laminated glass windscreens in vehicles first registered on or after 1 July 1985.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Minister for having made this decision which is, as he knows, in response to pressure from the medical profession and from the Fianna Fáil Party in previous debates in this House.  I was then very critical that the Minister was not prepared to proceed to make his own decision.  At that time, some months ago, he told me that he would not make a decision until the EEC directive on the matter was finalised.  I thought that was a wrong decision and am glad that he has now changed it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am complimenting the Minister on making this change, which we consider to be very significant.  It places an obligation on all motor car manufacturers to install laminated glass in cars which will come on the market for sale from whatever date the Minister has fixed.  I would urge the Minister to introduce that new regulation as quickly as possible.  The move from our side to have laminated windscreens fitted in cars has largely been motivated by Deputy Joe Walsh who had the unfortunate experience of being involved in a traffic accident in a car fitted with the old type toughened glass which shattered on impact.  He suffered a very serious eye injury as a result and were it not for the expertise of the eye surgeon involved he would have lost the sight of one eye.  He has been campaigning with the surgeon, John Blake, since then to have the fitting of laminated windscreen glass made compulsory for all cars.  I am delighted that the Minister has now announced that he is prepared to do this and is empowered <Col N="1432" /> to do it under section 11 of the 1961 Road Traffic Act.</P>
      <P>The House should know that the most serious eye injuries resulting from collision with the windscreens of toughened glass which shatter are usually caused when a car is travelling at moderate speed.  Many people are not aware of that.  Many of the accidents do not involve excessive speed.  Those going at excessive speeds go through the windscreen so fast that the eyes do not have time to be injured.  This is a very progressive step and I compliment the Minister on it.  I look forward to the debate on the regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>May I also thank the Minister for giving the House this assurance? Where cars on the road at the moment have not laminated glass, the problem can be prevented by the wearing of some type of protective glass by the motorist.  Corneal damage can be avoided in that manner.  The Minister's regulation will apply only to new cars and at present 8 per cent have laminated and 92 per cent have toughened glass windscreens. The Minister could suggest the added precaution of wearing some type of safety glass.</P>

      <P>I want to add a cautionary note for the Minister, that as from 1 July 1985 anyone having a shattered windscreen repaired should be allowed to replace it only by laminated glass non-splintering windscreen.  In other words, the repairers should not be in a position to buy up stocks of the former type windscreen from the car manufacturers because that would not be contained in the regulation.</P>

      <P>I want to give what I have as the present position in Ireland because I would not like to see every car owner descend on his local garage wishing to know if his car had a laminated windscreen. A recent review of the position in Ireland in relation to the use of laminated windscreens in motor vehicles has indicated that Ford, Toyota, Datsun, Fiat, Volkswagen, Leyland, Talbot, Vauxhall, <Col N="1433" /> Opel, Citroen, Peugeot and Renault fit laminated glass in the windscreens of virtually all new vehicles being marketed by them.  Only in a few cases, such as Datsun and Renault for their cheaper models, and Leyland for the Mini, the Metro and the Acclaim, do manufacturers fit toughened glass in windscreens.  The cost of fitting laminated windscreens is an optional extra and on new cars is about £40 to £50.  About 90 per cent of new cars have laminated glass windscreens.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I was contributing to section 2 and saying this feature of the Bill differs from previous Funds of Suitors Bills in that the intention here is to authorise the disposal of all but a nominal <Col N="1435" /> amount of one per cent of the investments in the dormant accounts of the funds of suitors, and not merely to dispose of the cash in the accounts as was done previously.  Previously the interest accrued to the investments was distributed. Now we are liquefying the investment and holding just one per cent in the funds.  The reason for holding the one per cent is so that the High Court will be able to evalue any subsequent claim which might arise.  There is no question of the one per cent being adequate or not adequate, because subsection (5) of the Bill provides an indemnity anyway for any claims which might accrue subsequently.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what the position is in relation to interest on the funds.  Obviously some of these funds are in assets and some are <Col N="1436" /> in cash.  Is any interest accruing or continuing to accrue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Yes, some of the investments are in assets and some are in cash, and interest continues to accrue.  That is why it is difficult to be specific about the residual amount which is being allocated to the Children's Court, and other projects in the court areas, and to civil legal aid.  The essential feature which distinguishes subsection (2) from similar provisions in previous Funds of Suitors Acts is that both the investments and the cash accrued are being disposed of here, whereas previously only the cash accruing to the investments was being disposed of.</P>
      <P>Also a one per cent residue is being retained.  It is not being retained to cover any claim that might be made subsequently on the funds of suitors by legitimate claimants.  Subsection (5) indemnifies any claimant from a deficiency in the funds.  The one per cent is being left there as a nominal amount so that it can be invested by the courts in the type of investment in which the funds are now invested, and used as a base figure, and subsequently a multiplier can be applied if a deficiency occurs and somebody was making a legitimate claim on the funds. It is merely a technical mechanism for measuring the exact value of any claim that might arise subsequently.  It will amount to about £28,000.  Over the past ten years the claims which have been made on the dormant acounts amounted to approximately £1,400.  The likelihood of any claim arising in excess of the 1 per cent is removed.  The reason for allowing the 1 per cent is not to cover subsequent claims because there is an indemnity in subsection (5), but to provide the base investment for a subsequent valuation.  If a claim transpired it could be dealt with by allocating a precise figure of investment and interest accrued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general principle of the Bill, section 2 is probably the best place to make this point.  These funds of suitors have been with us for a considerable time.  I should like to draw the attention of the House and the Minister to <Col N="1437" /> what I see as a fairly fundamental change in our approach to these funds.  They were always regarded &mdash; in so far as you can ever so regard anything in public administration &mdash; as something of a nest egg.  They were there to be availed of for separate, distinct, unique purposes.</P>
      <P>I am not sure whether the Abbey Theatre rebuilding project was the first time we had recourse to them.  That was of long-term historic importance.  It was deemed entirely suitable that these funds of suitors, because of their very special nature, should be used for a purpose of that sort, something which was infinitely desirable in a cultural, artistic or even social sense, and which would never normally succeed in getting the sort of finance it would need.  That principle was adhered to by all administrations. Because of their nature and the particular type of funds they were, they should be kept for very particular purposes, unique projects which could not and would not in the normal course of events be undertaken in the process of Government.</P>
      <P>I fear we are eroding that principle on this occasion.  I do not for one moment quarrel with any one of the purposes for which these funds are being allocated here.  They are all desirable.  I wonder whether the Minister, perhaps at the behest of the Minister for Finance, is now having recourse to these funds for purposes which would normally and legitimately fall to be financed by the Exchequer. For instance, let us look at the Arts Council.  Various Members of this House have their own views about what level of funding we should provide for the arts in any year.</P>
      <P>Any time I had responsibility in that area perhaps I stretched the Exchequer resources a bit more than would have been acceptable to many people.  I would never quarrel with giving more to the arts rather than less.  On the other hand, the Arts Council is a statutory body.  The provision is there for the council to be funded every year in the House through the normal Estimates, and so on.  I do not know if we should depart from that.  It does not come within the unique one-off situation which the rebuilding of the Cork Opera House represents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> I am a bit worried about the principle of the Bill, that the Government would seek to shuffle off onto the funds of suitors liabilities or needs which should normally be met as a matter of annual contribution from the Exchequer as an ongoing current expenditure.  I know that by saying this I am risking the accusation that I am not willing to provide funds for these purposes.  Of course I am and here I would differentiate between Comhaltas Ceoltóirí and the others.  Comhaltas Ceoltóirí comes within the very limited criteria I would set down as deciding how the funds of suitors should be used.  I know that probably I leave myself open to the accusation that I am unwilling to provide support for these other purposes. I am not.  I yield to nobody in my wish to promote our artistic and cultural endeavours and to allow them to receive the greatest possible support from the Exchequer.  I make the point to the Minister in good faith that these funds of suitors are of such a special nature that they should be treated as a windfall when some unique set of circumstances make it desirable that we should have recourse to them for some uniquely desirable artistic or cultural purpose.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the work on the King's Inns building is not something that should be undertaken in the normal way by the Office of Public Works as part of the voted moneys for the Office of Public Works in any particular year.  I accept it is an historic building and an important one and that we must secure and preserve it but then that could be said about many other buildings.  I should like the principle to be adhered to, that whatever we do in this area should be done in a straight forward manner through the annual voted expenditure.</P>

      <P>One of these days the Chair and I will form a mutual appreciation society.  As always, I will bow not just to the wording of the Chair's ruling but also to the spirit of that ruling.  Whatever about this Bill, for the future we should keep these funds of suitors for very special, unique and historic occasions.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Certainly one could argue along the lines Deputy Haughey has argued.  The funds of suitors have accrued for a number of centuries but they are no longer accruing. Most of the funds now accruing to the dormant funds arise from the burning of the Four Courts in 1922 when records were destroyed and this made it impossible for people to make claims subsequently.</P>
      <P>Before the foundation of the State Funds of Suitors Bills were passed.  The money was applied for such purposes as the building and improving of the Courts of Justice and enlarging the Law Library. In 1959 a sum of £323,000 was used towards rebuilding the Abbey Theatre and also for the reconstruction and the renovation of the King's Inns building and for the creation of a fund for the maintenance of the society's library.  In 1963 a sum of £50,000 was used for the rebuilding of the Cork Opera House and in 1966 a sum of £450,000 was used to help finance the cost of rebuilding the Abbey Theatre and also to complete the Cork Opera House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am doing here is realising the assets.  I have looked carefully at how money was used in the past.  Generally it was used in the courts area or in the general area of art and culture.  I have followed the precedents here.  First, I have fulfilled commitments made by previous administrations.  I think Deputy Haughey made the original commitment to King's Inns and it was an admirable decision.  It is a Gandon building, one of the finest in Dublin, but it is falling down. That is not a figure of speech.  There are <Col N="1440" /> timber hoardings to protect the public from falling masonry.  From information given to me, I am satisfied that the Society of King's Inns have not got the funds to refurbish and renovate the one-third of the building they own, the State owning two-thirds.  It is appropriate that one of the finest buildings in Dublin should be renovated by the State, not particularly out of the vote of the Office of Public Works but, in keeping with the decision made by Deputy Haughey, to refurbish and renovate it out of funds of suitors.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the allocation to the area of arts and culture.  A sum of £600,000 will be used to fund items already set out in the capital projects listed by the Arts Council.  The Royal Irish Academy of Music, another fine building, will be one of the projects.  I take the point made by many Deputies regarding Comhaltas Ceoltóirí.  Adding the £600,000 allocated to the general arts area and the £300,000 to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí gives a total of £900,000 to be spent in the general arts and culture area, in line with what was done previously.</P>
    <P>Since I came to the Department of Justice I have had many approaches about the desirability of having a children's court in Dublin.  Many Ministers were faced with this problem previously. As far back as 1966 there were recommendations that Dublin required a separate modern building for dealing with children in court and for facilities for parents and for consultations.  I decided funds of suitors would be appropriate for building a children's court in Dublin. Before the foundation of the State money was used for the courts.  Money was used for the Law Library, again a combination of King's Inns and the courts.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I cannot estimate exactly what the children's court will cost but it will be somewhere in the region of £750,000.  I was faced with the realisation at that point that if I wanted to fulfill the commitments made by two previous Governments to the King's Inns and Comhaltas and to provide funds for the Arts Council to proceed with their capital programme and to build a children's court, the residue was very small and that it would be generations before adequate funds would arise from that source.  I then decided to put the proposal to the Government that we would retain only a nominal residue and use the remainder for general projects in the court area for civil legal aid and for the general area of community development and the £100,000 being allocated to the Department of Labour.  While it is a radical change it is justified in the circumstances.</P>

I hope that the commitment to give £600,000 to the Law Library is not related to the need for the Chief Justice to make an order under this section because the money the Minister has available &mdash; I have no objection to the money being allocated to Comhaltas and the Arts Council &mdash; could be put to better use than making it available to gowned, bewigged, well-heeled trendies, which is nothing short of scandalous.</P>

Do accountants or solicitors get anything for their offices?  Why, in God's name, do we have to give £600,000 to the Law Library?  I will tell you why &mdash; because Deputy Haughey, when he was Taoiseach, promised it to them.  He said here it was a pity that the money was coming out of this source and that it should come under the Office of Public Works.  There are a number of areas in the inner city of Dublin and other parts of the country which would make very good use of £5,000 or £10,000 but they cannot get their hands on even that small amount.  I have a great personal regard for the Chief Justice but I hope there is not a subtle bias with regard to these funds because he has to make the order.  I hope we are not being pushed down a road which we do not want to go because, as an elected representative, I wish to protest at this money being allocated to people who are well capable of looking after themselves.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2) (c) line 13, to delete &ldquo;£250,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£300,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under this amendment I am proposing that the amount which may be paid to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann on the application of the Minister for the Gaeltacht should be increased from £250,000 to £300,000.  The amount is intended to defray some of the cost incurred by Comhaltas in connection with the completion of an extension to their Cultúrlann at Monkstown, County Dublin, which was completed in 1983.  A commitment had been given by a previous administration to amend the lapsed Fund of Suitors Bill, 1981, to make an amount of £200,000 payable to Comhaltas for this purpose.  The provision in the Bill was intended to honour that commitment and to provide an increase limited to £100,000 beyond the original amount because of the increased indebtedness of Comhaltas that has arisen due to the delay in enacting the Funds of Suitors legislation.  The object of this amendment is to increase the amount provided in the Bill as initiated by £50,000.  As I said, the commitment given by the Fianna Fáil Government was £200,000.  When the Bill was published the commitment was £250,000 and the amendment proposes to increase this by £50,000 to £300,000.  Of course, this is not the only source of funds available to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. They also get a grant from Roinn na Gaeltachta which was £105,000 in 1981. In 1981 they also got £20,000 which was the last instalment of a £90,000 capital grant paid in 1981.  In 1982 the grant was raised to £110,000 and has been maintained at £110,000 in subsequent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are also allocated money from the Arts Council and the projected figure for 1984 is around £59,000.  They also get small sums of money from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In all, if this amendment is accepted and the Bill becomes law, in 1984 Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann will get £300,000 here and £110,000 from <Col N="1444" /> Roinn na Gaeltachta.  They will also get £60,000 from the Arts Council, which is a total of £470,000.  They will also get some thousands for projects abroad from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Their total contribution from the State in 1984 will be approximately £475,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is to increase the sum to £500,000 instead of £250,000 which is in the Bill at present. We appreciate that the Minister recognises that there is a need for additional funds and that he goes further in providing £50,000 to bring the amount up to £300,000.  However, there is no great value in giving them half a lifeline.  They want us to help them to get out of their present difficulties whereby their debts have increased to £750,000.  I am not going to repeat all that was said this morning about the importance of this organisation and how extensive their activities are.  That has been recognised on both sides of the House.  It is not a question of petty political point scoring which some of the Members on the other side of the House indulged in earlier indicating that the figure was £200,000 some time ago.  Two Governments came and went in the meantime &mdash; there is another one now &mdash; when there was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing in that period.  We know that many Bills were delayed in coming before the House in any event. We need only look at the Criminal Justice Bill which experienced similar difficulties with changes of Government at that time. The net effect is that their position in 1984 is that they are indebted to the extent of £750,000.</P>
      <P>I suggested this morning that the Minister could get the extra money he requires here from section 2 (b) which reads:</P>
      <P>not more than £600,000 may be applied in or towards the defrayal of the cost of the carrying out of the works specified in section 4 of the Act,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to the King's Inns.  Those funds really should be provided by the Office of Public Works &mdash; this is work which is being undertaken by the Office <Col N="1445" /> of Public Works &mdash; leaving aside altogether the fact that one-third of the property there is privately held.  There are certain questions about the provision of those funds for privately-held property without any contribution from the other side or any particular conditions applying. Indeed, the Minister may consider conditions subsequently.  But the Office of Public Works from their normal allocation should be able to provide the moneys required in that area.  By switching some of the money &mdash; as it now transpires an extra £200,000 &mdash; to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann we could throw them that lifeline, get them out of their present difficulties and allow them get on with the excellent work they are doing.  For that reason we propose that the sum involved should be of the order of £500,000, as has been inserted in our amendment and I would ask the Minister to consider that.  I appreciate that the Minister is giving an extra £50,000 and that he considered that very recently.  I would ask him to consider going somewhat further so that they may be placed on a sound financial footing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Minister's initiative in introducing this Bill, and that part of it which relates to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, I recognise fully the Government's intention to honour the contribution which the Comhaltas has made to Irish culture.  I fully accept that the Government are now providing out of this fund a 50 per cent increase over and above that promised by the Fianna Fáil Government of 1982. Nevertheless, in spite of the additional funds available to them from other sources, and which the Minister correctly outlined, their grant from Roinn na Gaeltachta was reduced in 1982 from £125,000 to £110,000 and has been kept at that level ever since.  When one takes devaluation into account &mdash; although it must be admitted that because of the efforts of the present Government they have succeeded in reducing the level of inflation which would slow down that impact &mdash; there is a case to be made for asking the Minister to reconsider what is a generous <Col N="1446" /> commitment of £300,000 from this fund to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.</P>
      <P>It needs to be said that the only two aspects of the whole of the Irish cultural heritage programme which have been recognised as being successful were those in the development of Irish music and the fashion which came into being about ten or 15 years ago of going back to the old Irish names for children.  A great deal of tribute must be paid to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann for their work in that field.</P>
      <P>I know we are dealing with the technical aspects of the Bill and that I cannot stray too far from them.  Nevertheless this is particularly relevant in view of the new evidence coming to light under the series of films made by Bob Quinn which brings our whole heritage, our perceived origins and that kind of thing, into new focus for research and investigation.  I have had the advantage of looking at the work of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in other countries, particularly bearing in mind that my city is twinned with Quimper in France and we see there, as part of a cultural exchange, films outlining the work done by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in preserving our ancient heritage going back to the type of music prevalent in Europe and North Africa 1,500 to 2,000 years ago.  They have preserved that and are now making that music fashionable again, whereas it had been derided, sneered at and decried up to 20 years ago before modern research afforded it the focus it deserves.  They have played a tremendous role in this process.  I do not need to throw apples into an orchard to tell anybody here the work they have done.  But I recognise the constraints there are on State funds.  I am sincere in applauding the Minister for his stated intention of increasing the original amount to £300,000.  But, given the fact that they are circumscribed by the reductions from Roinn na Gaeltachta and by inflation, I would ask the Minister if he would please take another look at that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe nobody in the country would lend themselves to the kind of action intended in giving £600,000 to the Society <Col N="1447" /> of King's Inns.  The legal profession, from time immemorial&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As I see the position, the money to which we are referring here relates directly to the premises of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and not to the general body for all its activities.  If my recollection is right, Fianna Fáil allocated £200,000 only whereas we allocated £250,000 to the premises and have now increased it by another £50,000.  While I applaud the activities of the Comhaltas, as would anybody in the House, perhaps the Minister would clarify whether this refers to the actual premises or to the total activities for the debts incurred by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> Sir, when you asked me to move the adjournment of the debate last night I was stressing the need to have a large amount of capital injected into the building industry. There is an urgent need now to get this industry out of its present wretched state.  The Government in Britain recognise the importance of the building industry and have introduced home improvement grants which in that country have <Col N="1450" /> created an increase in employment in the building industry.  A number of men who were employed in the building industry in this country have emigrated to Britain recently, and this might account for the Government's latest announcement that there has been a reduction in the number of persons on the unemployment list here.  The Government here should consider reintroducing home improvement grants.  At present 45,000 people in the building industry are unemployed and that is one-third of the workforce. Another important factor is that a survey carried out recently has revealed that 20 per cent of building contractors here have no work on their books, and this is very serious for the future of the building industry.</P>
      <P>The Government now should as a matter of urgency take some action in this respect.  The slump in the building industry has created great problems for the many industries serving that building industry.  The question might be asked: have this Government a deliberate policy of holding back finance that would allow the State section of this industry to progress? There is widespread concern whether the Housing Finance Agency will have sufficient funds to service the number of applications for loans.  People who have applied for loans are very worried about whether these loans will be approved because of the lack of finance.</P>

        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> The Minister and the Government should take this into consideration and do something about it.  The State section of this industry is overmanned completely and its day-to-day running surely must give rise to the biggest bill that the Government have to meet.  This section operates mainly in maintenance rather than in building.  I call on the Minister and the Government to have a hard look at the building industry which needs to have large amounts of finance put into it.  The reintroduction of improvement grants would encourage people to carry out improvements to their homes and at the <Col N="1451" /> same time create employment in the industry.</P>

Surely at this stage we are entitled to be told where they are going to get £200 million.  Deputy Molloy comes in here and spends money when he is in Opposition.

      <P>The figures are there and anybody who wishes to read them may do so.  The Taoiseach gave them the week before last.  The expedient of using public moneys to try to spend their way out of recession has been tried and found wanting and it is absolutely futile at this stage for Deputy Molloy to counsel a return to that approach.  He may not like me or Ministers on this side harping on this theme, but whether he likes it or not it happens to be true.  As long as he keeps calling for additional expenditure of the order he now suggests we will have no option but to point out the fundamental folly of the course he is recommending.</P>
      <P>Before going further I would like to refer to my own major programmes of housing, roads and sanitary services which comprise about 60 per cent of total output of the industry.  Also I would like to answer some of the points made by Fianna Fáil last night and then I will talk about the Government's plans for the future of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke comprehensively on housing matters last night and I would like to add just a few words to what he said.  This year we expect that <Col N="1453" /> total housing completion will equal or perhaps exceed last year's total of 26,138 houses.  Given the present unemployment situation and difficult economic conditions and their effect on housing demand, this represents no mean achievement.  With regard to private housing, an adequate supply of mortgage finance is available and the number of new loans approved by different agencies is holding up well.  Housing completions on the local authority housing side are likely to show an increase this year, and average employment on this programme has improved by 5 per cent in the first four months of this year and by 13 per cent since this Government took office.</P>
    <P>As part of their overall development policy the Government are pursuing a programme of road improvements aimed at eliminating major deficiencies in our own road network within a reasonable period.  Despite the present difficult economic situation, the Exchequer will be paying out about £127 million in road grants in 1984.  These funds will enable significant progress to be made on the programme of road works outlined in the road development plan.  Of that provision about £102 million will be spent on road improvements and roughly £25 million on road maintenance.  Priority is being given to the improvement of the national routes and selected major road works on other important routes.  Major projects under way this year include the Athlone by-pass, the Redmond Bridge in Waterford, the Bandon line and Custom House Bridges in Cork, the improvement of the Cork to Mallow road, and in the Dublin region the construction of by-passes at Santry, Swords and Palmerstown-Ballydowd. Apart from the construction work involved, the benefits accruing from this programme will include easier access to our principal cities, improved travelling time on the major inner-urban routes and less traffic congestion in our larger towns and cities.  The investment of previous decades must also be preserved and this year's road maintenance grant will permit a reasonable standard of maintenance on national and other major routes.</P>
    <P>The present level of State investment <Col N="1454" /> in roads represents a significant increase in real terms relative to 1979.</P>
    <P>A review of the road development plan has recently been completed by the Department drawing on four years' experience of the operation of the plan. The review examined the progress made since 1979 and identified the principal road schemes to be carried out in the medium term on a priority basis.  The review will be considered by the Government in the next few months in the context of the preparation of the medium-term plan.  In preparing the plan, the Government will take into account the view expressed in the recent report of the National Planning Board that greater priority should be given to investment in major road improvement projects.</P>
    <P>On the sanitary services side the Government are very conscious of the vital importance that the provision of an infrastructural network of sanitary services facilities plays in the promotion of economic development.  Despite the recession and its attendant financial difficulties, the Government made substantial capital available in 1983 for this programme and a similar high level of investment, of the order of £99 million, has been provided for the programme in 1984.  The high level of investment includes about £7 million to be provided for the small schemes programme which is used to finance schemes costing £50,000 or less.  These schemes play an important role in maintaining employment for local authority direct labour forces.  In addition to the small schemes programme local authorities carry out some major schemes by direct labour and this also provides additional work for the workforce of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The provision for 1984 also contains an amount of £6 million voted capital to ensure continued assistance to private group water and sewerage schemes which have a significant contribution to make in bringing piped water to rural houses and isolated farms.  Increased levels of grants are available to groups who are in the &ldquo;less favoured&rdquo; areas, mainly western counties, through the European Guidance and Guarantee Fund.  In 1984, subsidy on the sanitary services programme <Col N="1455" /> will amount to £36 million.  This subsidy consists of contributions to local authorities towards loan charges incurred on the financing of sanitary services schemes.</P>
    <P>Average direct employment created on the construction of sanitary services schemes in 1983 amounted to almost 2,000 and I hope that this level of employment will be maintained in 1984 and 1985. To this end I recently approved 47 public water and sewerage schemes with an estimated value of £37 million.  These are all either new major schemes or new sections of existing major schemes and brings the total of schemes approved by me this year to 57 with an estimated value of more than £43 million.  I have also allocated almost £7 million to local authorities for local water and sewerage schemes costing up to £50,000 each.  This will bring the total value of the public water and sewerage schemes at construction and tender stages to an unprecedented £450 million and will maintain in respect of 1984 and 1985 the increase of about 7 per cent in average employment on the schemes achieved in 1983.  This again shows the Government's commitment to providing a high level of investment in a programme which is vital to the building and construction industry.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that in addition to the beneficial effects on activity and employment arising directly from the construction of the schemes, the sanitary services programme facilitates other forms of physical development so important to the wellbeing of the construction industry at present.  For that reason I have been encouraging local authorities to ensure that the newly-approved schemes are brought to construction stage as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The idea of joint venture housing and shared ownership were mentioned in this debate last night and I would like to clarify the issue involved.  The idea of joint venture housing where private developers build houses on local authority land for sale to persons approved by the local authority is in principle a good one and one that I am very keen to support. It has been actively encouraged by my Department since February, 1982 and <Col N="1456" /> a number of local authorities have initiated joint venture schemes.  I would certainly like to see more local authorities getting involved in this kind of housing activity and I am considering how this might be achieved at the moment.  However, among the factors I have to bear in mind are the already high level of assistance available to private house purchasers &mdash; the £1,000 grant, the £3,000 mortgage subsidy, stamp duty exemption and income tax relief &mdash; the need to ensure equity as between those buying joint venture houses and those buying houses on the ordinary speculative market, and the inevitable limitations on public expenditure.  The matter would be very simple if we could be sure that every pound spent on private housing aids would be matched by a corresponding saving in subsidies for local authority housing, but unfortunately things do not work out that way in practice.</P>
    <P>The idea behind shared ownership is a simple one: if people cannot afford to buy a basic house suitable to their needs perhaps they could afford to buy a share of the house to start with and pay rent for the remaining portion until such time as their income rose sufficiently to enable them to buy out in stages the rented share.  It is basically a scheme to meet the needs of people whose incomes would not be sufficient to repay the usual kind of building society or local authority mortgage on the annuity basis.  However, it must be emphasised that the Housing Finance Agency already meet the needs of this particular segment of the housing market by providing loans repayable on an income-related basis and that the shared-ownership concept has only been successful in the UK and Northern Ireland in the absence of an income-related mortgage repayment scheme and where the level of owner occupation and of financial support by the Government for house purchasers is considerably less than in this country.  I am not convinced that there would be many people who would wish to buy only a share in their house and pay rent on the remaining portion, for which they would receive no income tax relief, when in fact they can already purchase the entire equity of <Col N="1457" /> their house with low repayments under the HFA scheme.</P>
    <P>It is also important to stress that the shared ownership concept would not build any additional houses unless the Government provided the funds since the operation of the scheme requires the Government to fund in the first instance the purchase price of the house involved. However, I retain an open mind on the question and I am having the idea examined in my Department to see what advantages it may offer.  It may, for example, be useful in relation to the sale of local authority houses to existing tenants where a newly appointed tenant with no tenancy discount might otherwise find it impossible to purchase his house under the existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>All in all, while both joint venture and shared equity may have a contribution to make, it would be over-optimistic to think that they have the capacity to transform the housing scene here.  However, as I have indicated, Deputies can be assured that I will give my support to any ideas that offer the prospect of improving our housing situation on a basis that can be shown to be cost-effective.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nolan referred last night to the latest CIF/EEC survey of the construction industry for March 1984.  While his information on the increase in the number of firms in the residential building sector that had ceased building was correct he neglected to refer to some very important quantitative information contained in the survey, namely, the average number of months required to finish work in progress and contracts in hand on the survey date.  In the case of non-residential and civil engineering sectors of the industry the level of work which firms had in progress and for which contracts were in hand at the end of March this year was above that at the end of March 1983 while in all sectors the level in March 1984 was above the level in December 1983.</P>
    <P>The National Planning Board's report was mentioned during this debate by Fianna Fáil speakers.  Deputy Molloy in particular used it to point selectively to its recommendation on roads to the proposal for expenditure of £20 million on certain infrastructural projects.  However, <Col N="1458" /> he did not mention the fact that the board said that the £20 million should be found by reducing other PCP allocations. Neither did he mention some of the other points the board made about investment in the building industry &mdash; for example, that no new subsidies or tax reliefs can be introduced to boost building activity, that the requirement for renewed growth in certain sectors of the industry is strong growth in the economy; and that special measures to boost building activity would make no contribution to recreating conditions for sustainable growth.  I may not agree with their views &mdash; and indeed Deputy Molloy may not agree with them either &mdash; but if he is trying to use the board's report as a model of the way in which the Government should deal with the building industry, there is at minimum an obligation on him to give us a balanced picture of what the board had to say about policy in relation to the industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to look briefly at the prospects for growth in building and construction output and the role of the State in encouraging and sustaining orderly growth and development.  As of now, it appears that 1984 will see the worst of the recession weathered and a course set for a recovery in output in 1985 which will be strengthened in 1986 and, I hope, sustained in future years.</P>
    <P>Generally, I would expect to see growth in the industry for the second half of the decade keeping more or less in line with the growth in the economy as a whole.  We have had in the past periods of very rapid growth intermingled with periods of negative growth.  It would, I feel, be in the industry's interests that in the future the aim should be to secure steady and sustained growth of a kind that will not put undue pressure on resources while at the same time allowing us to meet our essential requirements for infrastructure of all kinds.  The industry will undoubtedly continue to depend heavily on public sector support and investment but it must also look to the private sector to generate demands for its services.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, the pattern of demand from the private sector will depend on what is <Col N="1459" /> happening in the wider economy.  In so far as the public sector demand is concerned, there is a recognised need to plan ahead and, in particular, to give the industry advance notice of the likely trend of public investment not just on a single-year basis but covering perhaps a period of three to five years.  There is a Government commitment to produce a medium-term public capital programme and I have no doubt that this programme will provide the industry with a basis on which it can plan with some degree of assurance.  But, having said that, I would emphasise that by its nature the industry will always be subject to some degree of volatility and it would be foolish to think that the Government can ever be in the position of being able to guarantee the industry an overall level of work or demand for its services.</P>
    <P>A integrated public policy for the building and construction industry, if it were possible, would go beyond the preparation of multi-annual investment programmes for the main area of infrastructural investment and an assessment of the impact of existing specific policies which impinge on the industry or its output.  It could, for example, give a better assurance of value for money, encourage innovation and ensure compatibility and consistency in the operation of public policies that have a direct or indirect effect on the industry.  I should mention in this regard that the Sectoral Development Committee is at present finalising a detailed study and evaluation of the industry, which, I am confident, will provide valuable bench-mark material in relation to the industry and provide a context within which decisions as to future planning for the industry and the Government's role in relation to it can be taken.  We need, too, to develop measures for assessing the returns we can obtain from public investment in different kinds of construction, the direct and indirect employment and output effect the fiscal impact and the financial return.  Information on these matters would provide an improved basis for policy decisions and make the returns from construction investment more <Col N="1460" /> transparent.  Better methods of forecasting construction output are also needed.</P>
    <P>What I am trying to show is that the problems of the construction industry are to a significant degree rooted in the very nature and characteristics of the industry and that they are not therefore amenable to easy remedies.  The industry has learnt the hard way through its experiences since the bonanza in the late seventies but at least it can be said with some degree of confidence that the major part of the decline is now over and that modest growth may begin in 1985.  This is, therefore, a good time to plan ahead on a realistic basis taking account both of the problems and the opportunities that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope, that in what I have said tonight and what the Minister of State said last night we have indicated the Government's real concern for the building industry and for its workforce.  We have maintained the sectors of the industry for which we have a direct responsibility at the highest practicable level of output and will continue to do so.  Our actions in the housing, roads and sanitary services areas and in relation to the other items in the public capital programme for which there has been a genuine demand have prevented the decline in the industry from being much more acute.  Deputies may be assured that this will continue to be our approach.  But in the last analysis we can never have a soundly-based building industry without a soundly-based economy.  It is in the interests of the building industry that we should persist with our plans to put the public finances on a proper footing and restore competitiveness to our economy. The steps required to achieve this necessarily impose constraints and restrictions on all sectors during the period of adjustment.  There is, however, no other way and it is time that the Opposition realised it.  Instead, they have come into this House again making the same rash statements and suggesting so-called &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; for an industry which deserves better.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that by now they would have at least modified their approach in <Col N="1461" /> some respect.  Obviously and unfortunately, I am wrong.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not been in the Department of the Environment for very long.  The previous holder of the office was no less than the Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party.  This matter was discussed widely 12 months ago.  Various proposals were put forward but the position has remained the same.</P>
      <P>There is a major crisis in the building industry.  We heard nothing from the Government about what efforts are being made to improve the position and alleviate the very serious unemployment situation in the building industry.  There are approximately 45,000 to 50,000 people unemployed in this industry and we have heard very little about them.  What is being done about this problem.</P>
      <P>Over the years the building industry was one of our major employers.  The building industry, particularly in Dublin, is almost at a standstill.  I would like now to refer to the unemployment problem and the people on short time in the building supplier side of the industry.  The building and construction industry employed many apprentices &mdash; carpenters, bricklayers, plumbers and painters. This is a well known fact, not Fianna Fáil gossip as it is often described: at present apprentices to the building industry who had served one, two or three years have been laid off and have been unable to find employment to complete their apprenticeship.  I ask the Minister to look into this serious problem.  It is a very sad situation when an apprentice is unable to complete his apprenticeship or to find any other kind of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known that house builders have been unable to sell many houses. Probably one of the main reasons for that is the uncertainty of employment.  People are unwilling to accept the responsibility of buying a house when they are unsure of their jobs.  Until a few years ago people in certain types of industry were regarded as having safe jobs but unless one is employed in a very specialised industry <Col N="1462" /> one would be very hard pressed to find a secure job at present.  Every day we hear of firms closing down and this is all adding to the problems of the construction industry because people are not buying houses. Down the years the small builder contributed to the success of the building industry.  The small builder who built ten or 20 houses a year and employed five, six or 12 men has disappeared from the scene.  What efforts are being made to help these people?  It was accepted by all political parties that small industries played a very important part in the development of the country.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the housing side of this industry, but let us look at other areas.  I want to refer to the cutbacks in education because they are affecting the building industry.  There has been a major cutback in school building. I appreciate that the Minister for the Environment is here tonight and not the Minister for Education but the cutbacks in school building have affected this industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Housing Finance Agency loans.  They have made a very good contribution to the building industry in the past few years.  However, I have received representations from all over the country because people have experienced considerable difficulty getting these loans.  There is a slowing down in this area and I ask the Minister to ensure that this situation does not continue. Many rural Deputies have had complaints from people who have been unable to get these loans.</P>
    <P>Prior to the 1982 election the Coalition parties produced a policy programme which clearly stated that if they were elected to Government they would immediately provide an extra £100 million for the construction industry.  When it came to the 1983 Budget not only was that £100 million forgotten, but many more millions of pounds were taken from the capital programme.  So far we have heard nothing about this.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister of State said we were listening to the old style Fianna Fáil propaganda criticising the industry, and that it was Fianna Fáil who left the industry in this state.  The time has come for <Col N="1463" /> the Government to accept their responsibilities. They have been in office since November 1982 and there is no point blaming Fianna Fáil at this stage.  What have the Government done to help the building industry since they took office? This industry is facing a major crisis and recent surveys show that since this Government took office the unemployment situation is worsening.  A solution must be found for this.</P>
    <P>Over the years the building industry has played a very important role in the development of the country.  It is not just the people employed in the industry or the builder making a profit who are involved, but many other industries benefit from this industry.  I have been engaged in building supplies for many years and I know the situation.</P>
    <P>February 1957 was one of the worst months for the building industry but the present situation is as bad.  In 1957 we had a Coalition Government in power, and we have a Coalition Government in power today.  The time has come for the Government to state their policies and to tell the people what they intend to do to improve this situation.</P>
    <P>The Government must realise that developers and builders and all others associated with the construction industry have no confidence in the Coalition.  That is what is causing the problems in the industry.  It is about time, therefore, that the appropriate Ministers would arrange a get-together with the industry to discuss its problems and to give renewed confidence because without confidence there will be no investment.  Many small builders have houses lying half completed but they simply cannot finish them because people, uncertain about their employment prospects, will not purchase.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable slowing down in regard to group water schemes throughout the country.  I understand grant payments have slowed down to practically nothing in the last 12 months &mdash; I learned this from a recent reply by the Minister to a parliamentary question. All these things are causing chaos throughout the construction industry.  As well, there has been an enormous <Col N="1464" /> decrease in roadworks which is causing more unemployment daily.</P>
    <P>The building industry has played a very important role in the development of the country and the creation and provision of employment, and it is the duty of the Government to do everything possible to restore confidence.  I appreciate that the Minister took up office in this Department only recently but I earnestly ask him to try to remedy the delays in planning permissions and to do something about increased charges.  There are considerable delays in Dublin and I have spoken about them on numerous occasions in the past few years.  The provision of sanitary services has been slowed down and consequently many small builders with parcels of land throughout County Dublin are held up because services are not available.  I suggest that the local authority should adopt a more lenient approach so that small builders might be able to begin to work again.  I hope the Government will reconsider the funding of sanitary services.</P>
    <P>All in all, there is a sad situation in the building industry because of Government policy.  This has led to disemployment.  I apportion most of the blame to the Minister for Finance, but the entire Government are responsible.  They have been in office since November 1982 but the position is getting worse month after month and they cannot blame Fianna Fáil for it any longer.  The Government's lack of incentive is tearing the industry apart.</P>
    <P>According to information from the CSO, there has been only a 20 per cent completion of work on local authority housing.  Graduates from Bolton Street last year had to go to AnCO to try to prepare themselves for future employment. The number of local authority houses being constructed in Dublin fell by 20 per cent in the first quarter of 1984 and it is questionable whether the target of 6,000 houses will be achieved.</P>

      <P>A few years ago architects <Col N="1465" /> and draftsmen had so much work that one had difficulty in getting plans drawn up.  Today they are going around knocking on doors to see if there is any work for them.  Many young people were employed in that side of the business but they now find it impossible to get work. When they took office, the Taoiseach and Deputy Spring promised that they would provide an additional £100 million for the construction industry but in the budget of 1983 not only was that money missing but many hundreds of millions of pounds disappeared as well.  This has affected seriously an industry that has played an important role in the development of the country over the years.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have a few minutes to express my views on the building industry.  An idle nation is a nation in decay.  It is well known that if given the opportunity the building industry could create jobs overnight.  Recently we have been meeting many people with special skills, plasterers, plumbers, woodworkers, who cannot find work because of the disastrous effects of Government policy. Of course this Coalition Government are consistent in their treatment of this industry. Their predecessors did the same. When Fianna Fáil were in power building went ahead.  I would remind the House that yesterday evening the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, said the Housing Finance Agency had sufficient funds to meet grant payments.  The recent tender for funds to finance the Agency, as we all know, failed; yet the Minister of State has given an assurance that money will be provided by the State.  I am anxious to know if this is true.  I ask this question because in counties such as Limerick, Westmeath and particularly my own county there is a waiting period of anything up to eight months under the Housing Finance Agency.  When that agency was set up it was introduced as the greatest thing that ever hit the land, something that would solve all the housing problems, something that would encourage people to build houses for themselves.  That would have been an excellent policy but unfortunately that has not been the evolution.  It was only <Col N="1466" /> yesterday a constituent asked me was it true that his application for a housing loan would be passed next week but he would have to wait until next January for payment.  I would like the Minister now to assure me that this will not be so.  It should not be so.  If it is so it will be a complete contradiction.

      <P>A sum of £56 million was made available for the HFA loans and this year £83 million is available and will be spent on HFA loans.  If, as the Deputy says, there is a waiting period all I can say is that the demand has grown out of all proportion as compared with last year.  That can be the only reason for delay.  The money has been increased by £17 million this year.  This money will be provided and will be given to the local authorities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The most alarming feature is that all indicators now point to a further decline in the construction industry unless, as my colleagues have said, there is a change of policy.  Architects, engineers, quantity surveyors are all giving the same message. It is accepted that the industry must inevitably be affected by the worldwide depression but positive measures could be taken which are not being taken.  The industry is of tremendous importance to the community.  In various areas there is a need for physical improvements.  Housing needs, school needs and so on must be met.  This negative policy towards the industry must be changed.  The potential <Col N="1467" /> in the construction industry is tremendous. The industry responds to community needs and Ireland is still a semi-developed country with a great deal of potential in that particular sphere.  The philosophy of fax incentives or subsidies is quite fallacious and particularly damaging from the point of view of private funds being made available which, in addition to reviving construction work, would also generate subsidary employment.</P>
    <P>Confidence is one of the most important assets in stimulating the economy and that applies particularly to the construction industry.  We are all aware of the numbers who are losing their employment and the reason for that loss of employment is the construction industry.  I heard an argument last night over cement sales in the beginning of this year.  This side of the House was claiming that cement sales in the first four months this year had dropped.  It is perfectly true that they have picked up now.  We were told that last month cement sales had improved.  For that one month that is so and the reason is that it was so low earlier on, that an upturn had to come at some stage.  Also weather conditions had an important bearing on the situation.  The weather recently was much better than it was this time last year and if one puts difficulty in finding the reason for cement sales being slightly up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose you will blame Fianna Fáil for the weather last year as well.  I would like to make a brief reference now to the serious issue confronting the industry, namely, the clawback which the Coalition Government have put in abeyance.  But it is there hanging over the industry and I have been told by those involved in the industry that if this is not killed off immediately it will close down a great many firms which are on the brink at present.  The Minister is well aware of this.  I would ask the Minister <Col N="1468" /> to dissipate immediately the cloud that is hannging over the industry.</P>
      <P>I understand about 35,000 families are waiting for houses to be provided by local authorities.  We all know from our travels around the country in the last fortnight that there are people living in appalling conditions.  In my own area in the last 20 years there has never been a time when a housing scheme was not in progress. Unfortunately for the past eight months there has been no scheme.  That is a sign of what is happening.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the people across the floor to accept my word that what I say is true in relation to my area.  I live in it and I am meeting people every other day who are looking for houses.  I am asking the Minister now to put some money into the industry, an industry which will help him to solve some of the problems confronting the Government.  The Minister has been landed with this difficult portfolio. The Labour Party have allowed themselves to take on the difficult portfolios and it is no wonder they find themselves in the sorry position they are in now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time at my disposal I shall restrict myself to that aspect which relates to imports.  Before I do so, however, it must be borne in mind I speak as one who dealt at first hand with the industry.  I refer to the experience I had during the Alcan project which was the biggest project of its kind in Europe at the time.  Sadly it is still the case in Ireland and many countries that this is an itinerant industry.  Most people can look forward to security in their jobs, working from 8 a.m. to 4 or 4.30 p.m. in their factory or office and finishing at the end of the week, but the construction industry is still in the era of stop-go development. It has been crying out for a number of years for an overall policy to eliminate that aspect of its operation.  I am sure people of all political persuasions would agree with that demand.  I have spoken here on many occasions on different aspects of the industry and its employment content, which Milton <Col N="1469" /> Friedman has identified as the greatest reflator of down-pressed economies.</P>
      <P>I want to speak about a very dangerous situation which is beginning to develop in the down-stream industry &mdash; the area of builders' supplies.  There was a discussion here last night on the cement industry. We are all aware of what happened some years ago when one small group or individual started to import cement, causing havoc in the indigenous industry. Through whatever mechanism was employed that problem was resolved.  We are now in a very difficult situation in that under the philosophy of the Common Market there must be free transport of goods, capital and labour.  Badly depressed though our building industry is at the moment, it is in further danger if people decide to operate for themselves and introduce cheap construction industry imports.</P>
      <P>Taking the gypsum industry as an example, I have been approached by workers in my city who are very concerned with what is happening at the moment.  Gypsum Industries Limited have been working here as part of another foreign based company for the last 48 years and have given very worth-while employment to all types of workers down through the years.  They employ at present 500 personnel.  In recent times another company, a subsidiary of a Spanish multi-national company, have started to import gypsum into this country.  That will have a very serious impact on the employment content of the gypsum industry which we have known up to now. It will create havoc if that situation is allowed to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the fact that other countries in the Common Market are good and slick at evading the Common Market regulations.  For as long as I have been in the Dáil I have referred to the fact that the Government here &mdash; and it is an honourable enough thing &mdash; tend to operate on a boy scout mentality.  We forget all the hidden subsidies which other Governments supply to their native industries.  It is outrageous that they are thereby circumventing the normal legislation and rules of trading within the Common Market.  It might sound well to <Col N="1470" /> create a small industry employing eight, ten or 20 people by starting off this new import industry, mar ea, but in actual it could disemploy 100 people already working here in steady employment.  A briefing given to me by workers in my own city employed in the gypsum industry stated that the company which always operated here was founded in 1936, employing 500 people.  Foreign imports of plasterboard are a definite threat to this employment.  If, for example, these imports gain 20 per cent of the Irish market, between 100 and 200 Irish jobs will be put at risk in the long term.  The present threat comes mainly from Spain, with French and East German board currently in the background.</P>
    <P>Ireland has the highest <i>per capita</i> consumption of plasterboard in Europe. Spain has among the lowest.  This is a Spanish company which is operating an artifical agency here.  The Spanish domestic market's annual demand is 2½ million square metres.  The factory in Spain has a capacity of around 12 million square metres.  It is owned by LeFarge of France, National Gypsum of the USA and Ultralitre, a Spanish company.  The Spanish Government operate a subsidy system to encourage exports.  This amounts to just under 10 per cent of full value, including agents' fees.  Spain also maintains import duties of 24 per cent approximately to protect its home market from any counter-trading.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking to one aspect of that.  The Congress of Trade Unions have spelt out that 5,000 down-stream jobs can be maintained, in addition to the 15,000 in the building industry itself and I have spoken about this before, my views being very well known.  We are talking about the building industry and similar industries.  There is a danger at the moment that further jobs can be put under threat.  We are talking about an import substitute programme here.  I have heard figures quoted in this House in a general context, not just in connection with the building industry, indicating that if there were a swing away from imports to buying Irish products of 3 per cent over the present rate an extra 10,000 jobs would be created.  Everyone here is lamenting the decline in employment, not alone in the building industry but in industry in general.  I am seriously concerned that in a short-sighted attempt to get a foothold in a market, somebody starting up a small industry will do so at the expense of workers in the Irish construction industry.  I am appealing to the industry to adhere to An Foras Forbartha's building project register here which is specifically available to help Irish companies to buy Irish made products within that industry.  That should pre-empt the need for going outside the country and would protect Irish jobs.</P>
      <P>Again, it cannot be said too often that every single one of us pays tribute to the concept of the Buy Irish programme.  But some of us are like peacocks: we cannot look down at our feet because we do not know where our shoes have been made, whether they were made in this country. In every facet of every industry here we should look at what we are buying and keep Irish jobs safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1983 the building industry imported £300 million of construction products. There was a drop in that figure of £50 million between 1982 and 1983.  If we could eliminate our present imports into the building industry, it is estimated that in a very short while another 8,000 to <Col N="1472" /> 10,000 jobs could be created here.  That would give worthwhile employment within the industry on a regular ongoing basis.  In spite of all the olagoning &mdash; a lot of it legitimate &mdash; which we get from the private sector of the industry, the construction companies themselves are contributing to that malaise by importing products.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very legitimate temptation to buy cheapest, especially in an economy like our own which, as is common in western Europe, is going through a particularly bad time at present. However, could I appeal to the industry to look at its own conscience?  It should see where it can buy Irish products and keep Irish people at work.  That cannot be overstated.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was present some time ago at a meeting with the construction industry in our own region and listened very sympathetically to their present difficulties. In spite of what has been said, the Government have invested very significant money over last year's expenditure, but there never would be satisfaction and I certainly am not satisfied with the level of investment in the construction industry. As much money as possible should be found to keep those people at work because it answers a dual need.  I believe the Government are working towards that, however difficult the position is and given the kind of constraints we have at the moment.  I would like to emphasise in this discussion on employment in the construction industry that the remedy lies in our own hands: we have the resources to control the level of employment, to stop any decline and to improve the employment content by cutting out altogether imported products in the down-stream supply industries of the construction industry.</P>

      <P>I agree with most of Deputy Prendergast's remarks.  It is very important for us to be very careful about what he described as the downstream side of the industry.  Architects and engineers have a duty, particularly at a time like this, to specify products which are of Irish origin and are up to Irish Standard specifications. That might might be a way of getting over the difficulty Deputy Prendergast spoke about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>For the record, I would like to state that the products produced in Ireland come from the highest developed technology in Europe and are among the finest of their kind in the whole world, but this is being undermined by cheap substitute grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest that the new regulations Bill might be of considerable help by ensuring that the products will have to be of specific standard and in that way overcome the difficulties about which Deputy Prendergast spoke.  I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution, in the very short time available to me, in support of the Fianna Fáil motion, which was so ably proposed by Deputy Molloy.  I would like to comment very briefly on the Minister's speech which has already been referred to by Deputy Hugh Byrne.  It is something that I as a public representative and an engineer come across quite often.  I refer to the difficulty in relation to mortgage finance.  The Minister said there is adequate supply of mortgage finance available.  It may be available in theory but on the ground and in practice a lot of people have considerable difficulty in obtaining adequate mortgage finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to emphasise what has been referred to by a number of people on the Government side of the House as well as on this side in relation to the Housing Finance Agency.  The hard practicality is that quite a number of people are being told they will have to wait seven months before they get payment and they will have to suffer on bridging finance for <Col N="1474" /> seven months.  We will have to see if we can get over that.  There is very little point in saying that money is available if people have to go and borrow the money and then have to spend seven months on bridging finance at 18 per cent to 20 per cent.  We only mislead people if we tell them that adequate finance is available. Many purchasers have learned a hard bitter lesson over the long drawn out period they are on bridging finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast said that the building industry has often been descibed as the barometer of a nation's economy. If one takes this criterion and uses it in relation to Ireland the truth of this maxim is very evident.  There has been a considerable fall in employment in the industry to what can only be described &mdash; I do not lightly use this term &mdash; as a catastrophic situation.  Despite the Minister's best efforts tonight to state otherwise, never in my 25 years' experience in the industry have I seen it in such a deplorable state.  The construction industry depends more than any other industry on confidence and trust.  It is quite obvious that this industry has neither confidence in nor the trust of the Government, which unfortunately are so divided on ideological grounds that they have transferred to the industry their own uncertainty in regard to policy.</P>
    <P>Government policies have stifled the industry and have effectively stopped what has been a developing facet of the industry.  I refer to group water schemes, which could be reactivated.  This came up at Question Time today and I know one of the problems the Minister has in relation to it.  The system could be upgraded in order to safeguard the groups and the State without any very great cost to the Government.  It is very significant that in the first three months of this year the total number of group water schemes paid was only 930 as against 1,745 last year.  We got that today in reply to a question put down by Deputy Molloy.  In the first three months of this year in comparison with the first three months of last year we are down by over 800 group water schemes.  That alone would make a tremendous difference to the industry.</P>
    <P>Many small contractors have a problem <Col N="1475" /> in relation to this.  While the Minister has been very sympathetic to those which have been brought to his attention &mdash; I speak from experience and I would like to thank the Minister for his help in relation to a number of the group schemes I brought to his attention &mdash; there are many others where the contractors are in great financial difficulty.  If something drastic is not done in the very near future many small contractors will go out of business.  The Government could without any great cost very quickly end the black economy in the building industry.  They could make it impossible for those doing &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; to conduct business.  They could stop people from undermining the industry, from undercutting prices and from draining the confidence of medium and small contractors who are burdened by a tremendous variety of forms and taxes which a number of them are finding it impossible to keep up with.</P>
    <P>There are many other things the Government could do to streamline the industry, to help the industry, and to restore confidence in it, which would cost very little but which would cut the red tape which is strangling many small builders. Unfortunately, over the last 18 months I have seen many small builders going out of business.  They have thrown in the towel because they are unable to combat the bureaucracy which is overwhelming them.  In 1984 some builders in Mayo are charging the same prices for local authority houses as they charged in 1982 and they are still being beaten on the price.  I know one man who is a very strong supporter of the Government who priced a house recently at 10 per cent less than the price last year, and he was still beaten.</P>
    <P>This is an impossible situation for the smaller contractors.  The Government should help them.  They could help them by making it impossible for people who have none of the bother and who have all the advantages, who have not got to complete tax forms or PAYE forms, and make the various deductions which small builders have to make, to compete for local authority houses.  The Government should help the small builders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> The Minister should abolish the necessity for applicants for home improvement grants to wait for an inspector.  I can understand why this was provided for in the changeover in the various grants.  The time has now come for the Minister to abolish that necessity and give people the chance to start their work as and when a contractor is available to do the job. Many of these grants are for the installation of bathrooms and septic tanks. People have to wait three months for planning permission for septic tanks and, in many cases, another two to three months before an inspector calls.  Then a contractor might not be available.  These people have a certain amount of money to spend and they must spend it when the contractor is available.  Many of them are not availing of the grants.  The Minister would be doing a tremendous job if he abolished that necessity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities are in the best position to survey these grants if we get the co-operation of the unions and so on.  That would probably be the best way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very good suggestion. They already do it quite successfully in the case of disabled persons' grants. The Minister told us tonight that, in the public area, employment has increased by 5 per cent.  He also told us that in 1983 there was a 19 per cent fall in employment in the industry generally from the 1982 figure, and that for the first three months of 1984 there was a 15 per cent average drop in employment as compared with the first four months of last year.  I ask the Minister to give the industry guidance, take it into his confidence, tell it his plans and show that he cares.  I would ask others around the Minister to stop blaming Fianna Fáil.  They have been in office for 18 months.  A coalition of Fine Gael and Labour are in Government.  Positive action would be much better than criticism of Fianna Fáil such as we heard in the speech made by the Minister of State last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the need for the industry to rely more on the private sector and not to place such a heavy <Col N="1477" /> reliance on local government and the public sector.  The private sector will respond.  It proved that it would respond some years ago when a Fianna Fáil Government advertised a programme with which I had the privilege to be associated for the construction of Government offices.  We got many tenders and many offers from the private sector.  If the Government have positive plans the private sector will respond.</P>
    <P>Quite often the Opposition are accused of not making suggestions.  In all his contributions Deputy Molloy put forward many positive suggestions.  Have they just been pushed aside?  The Minister should look seriously at the suggestions made by Deputy Molloy for positive improvements in the building industry.  If his suggestions were put into operation the industry would receive a badly needed boost.  When the Opposition make suggestions there is a feeling they are not acted upon or considered.  Last night we got the old clap-trap about Fianna Fáil making a mess of the country from 1977 on.</P>
    <P>The industry urgently needs guidelines. It needs them most of all to restore confidence.  It needs positive, precisive, planning to enable it to plot its course. The Minister should give it that policy, that planning, that guidance and I am convinced it will respond.  The Irish construction industry has the capacity, the skills, the skilled labour, the expertise and the management to produce badly needed employment.  It probably has the most skilled workforce in Europe.  That is generally agreed.  It has the will and the capacity and all it needs from the Minister and the Government is a clear, concise, positive plan of action.  If the Minister gives the industry that guidance and a clear, concisive policy, the industry will respond and we will have a much better construction industry which will be able to plot its course of action over the next couple of years and provide employment and spin-offs.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously the motion put down by Deputy Molloy and Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 is an alternative to amendment No. 3 and amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are being discussed together.  Deputy Tunney is in possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that I did not have to make any case for addressing the <Col N="1485" /> Chair or the House, that I had no irksome contribution which might appear to upset my tranquillity as I plead the case for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  Again I would put to the Minister the fact that he accepted that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are at the moment on the verge of bankruptcy.  The sheriff is waiting. While we can argue that in the past successive Governments have been neglectful of the special position of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, that is irrelevant to the moment.  Even though it was acknowledged earlier that the Minister had moved from his original position of £250,000 to £300,000, he has now before him an amendment in the name of our spokesman, Deputy Woods, asking that he increase that to £500,000.  In so doing he will give recognition to the work that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are doing and acknowledge that in their own right they are entitled to this money.  Apart from that, in the unfortunate position in which they find themselves, without the additional money they will be unable to continue developing their great organisation as it is.  They will not be able to survive.</P>
      <P>I take the correction that the Minister made to my reference to Clannad as against Na Casadaigh. There is no difference between the two.  If the Minister wants that again perhaps I should say that for reasons best known to the Taoiseach I was not privileged to be there to note that it was Na Casadaigh rather than Clannad who were there to entertain and demonstrate to this great visiting dignatory all that is best in Irish music and culture.  I am at a loss to know why the Minister might take that point as militating against his giving Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in the legislation is giving a blank cheque to the Taoiseach in respect of £600,000 for undisclosed purposes. I know that it is wise and prudent for any Minister to place such confidence in his Taoiseach, but he will accept that where there is unanimity in the House as to the special merits of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann it seems strange that he would give a blank cheque for <Col N="1486" /> £600,000 to the Taoiseach to cover areas of art and culture while his allocation in respect of what is identified by all Members of this House as the most important organisation working in the field of Irish culture is so limited.  There is nothing insular about giving preference to our own.  I appreciate that in the field of art the Taoiseach may be disposed later on to give grants to the theatre where there will be placed before us in this and other cities dramas set in French attics and boudoirs and English and American basements, all of which is important in the whole spectrum of the theatre, but the Minister must accept that what is being pursued by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann should take preference and priority over that.  Would he presume that the Taoiseach might not mind too much if the £600,000 which he is giving the Minister to use at his discretion for the arts and culture could be reduced by £100,000 or £200,000 so that he could meet the amendment proposed by Deputy Woods?  Surely the Taoiseach has some faith in the opinions of this House.</P>
    <P>The fact that the amendment was proposed by Deputy Woods is completely unimportant to me.  What is important is that it is the minimum required to keep Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann viable.  The Minister may say that the membership of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann if they are sincere can continue to run raffles and tax their own members to an extent greater than at the moment.  If he says that I will ask him why not tax the members of the legal or some other profession who have available to them greater amounts than are available to the Comhaltas.  Professional bodies exist and money is available to them.</P>
    <P>I know that other Deputies are anxious to speak to this.  I appeal in all sincerity to the Minister to increase this allocation. He has already had a change of heart and has accepted that the original amount of £250,000 should be raised.  There is no reason why he should not accept that he should do the big thing by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and raise it to £0.5 million.</P>
    <P>Because I have been arguing purely on the nature of the work for its own sake I <Col N="1487" /> have left aside all the considerations about the ancillary benefits to us in the matter of tourism, the benefits to the Comhaltas and the groups sent out by them to travel to England and all over the world demonstrating what we have here.  For its own sake the least this House would require of the Minister, bearing in mind the situation that we all know exists in the Cultúrlann and with the Comhaltas, is that we should make it a viable operation and allow all those good volunteers, people so concerned with the preservation and development of this great aspect of our culture, to continue. More important, we should acknowledge their importance.  We are thankful that they exist and are prepared to do the work which we ourselves should be doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Tunney's earlier statement I am very much aware of the value of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann as is everybody else on this side of the House.  The recognition of their value is in the essential fact that the Minister has allocated £300,000 towards their premises.  I want to be quite clear that we are talking about the premises in Monkstown, not the whole country or the whole of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  I would like to have on the record that, if my memory serves me correctly, Fianna Fáil allocated only £200,000, and a statement from across the House earlier today said that we were only keeping pace with inflation.  The difference between £200,000 and £300,000 is 50 per cent. Now I understand how Fianna Fáil can get their figures wrong, if they try to state to the House that inflation was running at 50 per cent in the last year and a half. A measure of how Fianna Fáil value Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann is in the amount of £200,000 which they allocated. It would appear to me that we value them very much more than that in so far as we have given them an extra 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the amendment that £500,000 be given to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  Most of the arguments for the amendment have <Col N="1488" /> been put already.  There is an unanswerable argument for providing this money to CCE because of the financial difficulties in which they find themselves and also because to give too little might be to throw away money rather than to save an organisation.  Therefore, it is very important to give the appropriate amount.  The case for the necessity for the £500,000 has been well made by the organisation in terms of saving their headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann were established in the fifties at a time when Irish music was not as popular as it is today.  Certainly, it was not known internationally in the way it is known now. The members of CCE built the organisation. They control and run it, not to make profit but because of the love they share for Irish music and the culture they are promoting.  They have succeeded down through the years in having Irish folk music internationally loved and sought after.  The audiences in this respect are even wider in Europe than they are in Ireland.  In addition to the 400 or so branches of the organisation in Ireland, they have branches also in Germany, France, Sweden, Luxembourg and Australia while there are 25 branches in North America and 40 in Britain.  That is an extraordinary achievement for a voluntary organisation in a relatively short number of years.  They have done an immense amount of good for our country.  In terms of money alone they have promoted Ireland throughout Europe, America and Australia.  For this reason alone they are deserving of the greatest possible assistance from the Government.  Instead, the grant was cut in actual terms in 1982 from £125,000 to £110,000 and it has remained at that level since, despite the fact that, taking inflation into account, the £125,000 should have been increased to £160,000 or £170,000.  The grant is very small in terms of Arts Council grants.  In terms of the size of the organisation and its importance, the grant is very tiny.  This is one case where the Government cannot plead they have no money, that the country is broke, that they would like to help CCE but do not have the money.  In this case there is £2,790,000 of a largesse to hand <Col N="1489" /> out without the taxpayer having to be concerned since the money will not be coming from his pocket.  This, then, is a wonderful opportunity for the Government to do something for the organisation.</P>
    <P>However, the £2,790,000 will not be used for the benefit of voluntary organisations. Only £300,000 of that amount is to be paid to CCE, while practically half of it will go back into the Exchequer and to Government Departments.  This is an outrage and should not be acceptable to this House.</P>
    <P>To say that the Minister is increasing the amount by £50,000 is to indicate how low it was at the beginning.  It is an effort to put a reasonable face on the amount but £300,000 is not sufficient.  What is at stake here is the saving of the headquarters of an organisation who have brought tremendous honour as well as a great deal of tourism and money to this country, an organisation who have succeeded in bringing about cultural relations with other countries on a scale that no other State can match.  This is one of the diplomatic ways of becoming familiar with other cultures.  In this cultural endeavour people from the Continent, from America, Australia, Britain and so on have learned more about Ireland and have come to love our music which has such variety compared with the folk music of other countries.</P>
    <P>By agreeing to increase the subvention from the Funds of Suitors Bill to CCE to £500,000 the Minister would be doing a tremendous service to the country, its music and its culture.  There are a number of ways in which he could see his way to making this extra money available: one is to reduce the amount for the King's Inns but another is to have regard to the very big amount of £1.19 million which remains in his Department.  If he still finds, having looked at all these things that it is impossible to take the money off the King's Inns or that he must use the money to build a new Children's Court he could always put a word in the ear of the Taoiseach who has been given £600,000 to give out in whatever way he sees fit.  We have no idea what the Taoiseach will do with that money in relation <Col N="1490" /> to cultural development or what particular artistic endeavour he favours.  It may not be one that the House would favour. The Minister could ask the Taoiseach for £200,000 out of his £600,000 if he cannot find £200,000 anywhere in the £1.19 million.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of places where the Minister can get the money from.  The money is available and there is no argument about that.  It is a question of the will to do it.  It shows an apparent lack of knowledge of the importance of the organisation to the country and the need to keep them going.  It shows a lack of understanding about what the effect would be if the organisation collapsed. The use and development of the headquarters is of vital importance in keeping the organisation together.  All the organisation's money goes into the running of the organisation.  They receive a miserable grant of only £110,000.  How are they to finance trips abroad or trips made by branches abroad to this country?  How are they to finance the fleanna and still keep their headquarters going?  It is easy to say that an organisation of this size should do such and such and should not have got into trouble of this kind.</P>
    <P>The organisation have done a good job and building their headquarters was worthwhile.  They have financial difficulties, as have the most efficient industries and businesses.  These industries get assistance from the State through Fóir Teoranta or the IDA.  I do not think the Minister took into consideration the financial importance of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann to the economy and the work they do in attracting tourists to the country.  There is no question of this being a case of just giving money away each year to fund a particular artistic endeavour whether it be theatre, ballet or whatever.  This would make a vitally important organisation, which has grown over the past 30 years, financially viable and put them back on a sound footing.  It would enable them to proceed with organising fleanna and so on without having to collect money continuously to pay bills and stave off creditors, which is their position at present.  Comhaltas are not as <Col N="1491" /> efficient as they would be if they did not have financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to find another £200,000 for them to ensure that their headquarters is maintained.  The money is available and it would be no skin off the noses of taxpayers to do this.  No pressure has to be put on the Minister for Finance.  The money is there.  It is just a question of distributing it in the way it can do most good.  Giving an extra £200,000 to Comhaltas is a way in which this money could be used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice for a change to hear everyone talking about money we have to give out rather than the other way around.  The Fund of Suitors Bill has come up three or four times in the last 20 years.  The money should be given back to the people in a form in which the people would get the maximum benefit from it.  That poses a problem for whoever has the job of deciding to whom the money should be given.  In the case of Comhaltas they would get maximum return for the money expended for the reasons outlined by Deputy Mac Giolla and others.  I agree with him in his analysis of the contribution that Comhaltas are making to the country.  On the other hand, it would be a limited use if it was given to the building.</P>
      <P>It may be wasteful although useful if the Department of Labour distribute the money to very small projects where it is not possible to get a big return for it.  I realise that the intention to give some to the King's Inns has caused the most contention. The Minister devoted a considerable part of his speech to explaining why money is needed in this area.  Some people concentrated on this and the Minister gave a full explanation, thinking that was what Members wanted.  In 1959, 1963 and 1966 many distinguished Members of the House established a precedent for giving money to this institution.  Looking back at the debates they amounted almost to representations on behalf of the building.  This probably derived from the fact that they were more familiar with the building than the ordinary Dubliner.</P>

A sum of £600,000 is needed for the work to be carried out in the King's Inns building but the question was asked if this money should be spent in this way.  In the 1966 debate on this subject a former Taoiseach said, at column 1886, Volume 223 of the official report, that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>normally, the type of expenditure involved might not be regarded as being directly the responsibility of the State and, in circumstances of a shortage of money for a variety of necessary projects, particularly building projects, might not be regarded as one which could legitimately be considered and certainly would be regarded as a project that would compete for the funds available only on a very unreal basis, as being one that would be unlikely to justify public expenditure, <Col N="1493" /> certainly in the sphere in which some of the activities are carried on.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister's explanation for providing public money for this building. Other speakers said that, if this building is to get public money, other buildings too might be considered.  The Minister said this building was falling down and desperately needed money spent on it.  I wanted to ask a simple question: who decided in the last year to sandblast the stonework of this building and nearly succeeded in knocking it down?  A lot of damage was done to the building during that operation.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Architectural examination of the King's Inns building in 1980, and of the adjoining Registry of Deeds building, revealed that the external stonework of both buildings is in a state of serious decay.  The deterioration in the stonework arises from the age of the material, from atmospheric pollution and from the poor quality of the granite which was used in the building.  The state of the stonework gives rise to a danger of falling masonry, and hoardings have been erected in places to protect the public for injury.</P>
    <P>To clean up the building contractors were hired and I saw the building being sandblasted over a period of months.  High pressure air and sand were used to blast away at this very delicate stonework which is almost falling apart.  I wonder how much of this £600,000 will have to be expended repairing the damage done trying to clean the building.  This was the wrong way to go about cleaning this building.  Perhaps the Minister could ask his experts in the Office of Public Works about this.  In my view this cleaning should have been done by way of a chemical and gentle washdown.  This building, which was built in 1795, should be glistening in the sun in all its glory instead of looking like a dull grey giant since this work was carried out.  Perhaps the Office of Public Works should take this building in hand and look after it properly.</P>
    <P>In my view the real reason why questions have been asked about this building <Col N="1494" /> and the amount of money being granted is that this is independently-owned and we would not get a return for the people's money.  This very important building erected in 1795 was the last work in Dublin of James Gandon, but there are many other buildings around the country for which a good case could be made to have public money spent on them.  Not too long ago Christ Church Cathedral had to raise money to have a restoration job carried out.  Castletown House has managed to survive for the last 20 years by voluntary donations and by opening its doors to the public.  If we spend this money on this building and if this fund is going to be used in future to help restore or maintain historic buildings, perhaps a trust should be set up with a certain amount of money to be used to help maintain selective buildings.</P>
    <P>In 1959 £323,000 was given towards the Abbey Theatre, renovation of the King's Inns and the maintenance of the library of the King's Inns.  The Minister did not tell us but how much of that money went towards the King's Inns.  In 1963 only the Cork Opera House got public funds.  In 1966 the Abbey and the Cork Opera House were again given public money.  It is interesting to note that in 1966 the present Chief Justice, then Deputy O'Higgins, and Deputy Cosgrave requested a small amount of money for the upkeep of these buildings.</P>

      <P>I hate to interrupt the Deputy, but amendments Nos. 3 and 4 ask whether £300,000 or £500,000 should be included for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  I appreciate the Deputy's concern for the other buildings, but the Minister's amendment says the amount should be £300,000 and the amendment in the name of Deputy Woods and others says the figure should be £500,000.  They are the two amendments being discussed.  The Deputy may make a passing reference, but he has gone into an historical discussion on some buildings and I would be greatful if he would come back to the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your correction but before you came into the House <Col N="1495" /> we had been talking about the total amount involved and the Ceann Comhairle invited me to relate it to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and the amount given to this building, to examine how the total amount should be expended and to say whether more money should be given to Comhaltas.</P>
      <P>It appears that a precedent is being claimed in this instance, and we should examine whether that is the case.  It may be unfair to take the amount allocated for this building as if this were happening for the first time.  It is understandable that people will object to an independent body, with independent means, getting an allocation from public money for the upkeep of a building which is largely for their benefit, apart from the fact that two-thirds of this building is occupied by the Registry of Deeds.  Over the years this building has been of very little benefit to the general populace because it was not easily accessible to the ordinary person. Because of the restricted entry into that institution, only a small number of people can gain entrance.  If we are to give money to that institution should we not extract a price for it?  The price in this case should be that the society would be accessible to the Department of Education, for instance, so that they would have some say in the examinations and in control of those who go to the Bar.</P>
      <P>Another matter worthy of consideration is the justified objections from the public to a large amount of money being given to an institution from which the general public derives such little benefit. We saw not long ago the sale of rare books in Christies of London in order to raise money for the library.  In such circumstances I do not think it is fair to the people of Ireland to ask them to support the institution when this money is required for many other worthy causes without, at the same time, being able to look at or investigate the system of examination and entrance to King's Inns&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The £300,000 which the Minister has suggested for the Comhaltas or the £500,000 which Deputy Woods has suggested cannot be provided unless we examine closely the total amount of money available.

      <P>I apologise &mdash; I did not mean to disobey your ruling, with which I agree.  The Minister has a certain amount of money to allocate and he has given a generous increase on the original amount proposed for the Comhaltas, a generous increase on the amount suggested by the Opposition when in <Col N="1497" /> Government.  If he had offered £400,000 they would probably have looked for £600,000.  They should be thankful for the increased amount proposed by the Minister, a substantial percentage increase on what was offered earlier.  I think we will benefit enormously from this allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment proposed by Deputy Woods to increase the sum to £500,000.  I acknowledge that the Minister has come part of the way with us by proposing to increase the original figure and there is an unquestioned need to do this.  I come from Clare, from an area which has been in the forefront of the revival of Irish music, dance and culture in the past number of years. Deputies will understand the importance in my constituency of the preservation of our national culture.  Miltown Malbay, Tulla and Doolin have been identified closely with Irish song and dancing.  We all know what has been done in Clare by Comhaltas in this respect in the last number of years, particularly in my constituency, for the preservation and development of our traditions.  Not only that, but they have provided facilities to enable much more work to be carried out.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important that the whole financial structure of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann be such as will ensure that all the impact which they have had in the regional areas, and above all in the small local communities, is preserved.  We should make every effort &mdash; and this is a very small effort, indeed &mdash; to put their financial structure in a more healthy position than it is at present.  No-one here can be satisfied with the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí can do a lot themselves, and they have done a tremendous lot in local fund raising in every community.  Other Deputies are well aware of the developments that have taken place at the fine centre at Ennis, Cois na hAbhna.  There have been the teachta ceoil and various other centres provided in isolated communities at enormous expense and inconvenience to Comhaltas, working in a voluntary capacity over a great number of <Col N="1498" /> years.  It is important that we recognise this work and ensure the provision of the necessary finances.</P>
    <P>1985 will be European Music Year and will be celebrated with various events.  Is it not an indictment of the community that we should allow an organisation dealing with our own cultural traditions to be in this very unhealthy financial position at this time and not remedy that by giving the extra finance needed at a time when we are about to launch into a national campaign to celebrate European Music Year?</P>
    <P>I would point out also the educational impact of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí on the isolated rural communities.  Organisations like the Willie Clancy Summer School at Miltown Malbay where young Irish musicians are trained and many students, including foreigners, are introduced to Irish music.  This has had a tremendous impact on very young people.  It has been argued that the Comhaltas could finance themselves, but I do not think that they can come up with the money and every day that this situation is allowed to continue will make it more difficult for them to get out of the financial crisis.</P>
    <P>I noticed in the Minister's brief the reference to the provision of money for the Department of Labour's youth and recreational scheme.  This is a very welcome development.  However, my understanding of the scheme, which was organised and run by the Department of Labour, was that the funds available in a number of years &mdash; I am not sure of the present situation &mdash; were not fully utilised. Perhaps it was because schemes were not organised or capable of being run efficiently during the course of the year, or for some other reason.  At one time there was upwards of £1 million in that fund unspent at the end of a financial year.  I am not sure what particular scheme this money is directed at, but the Minister is looking at areas to find an extra £100,000 should check with the Department of Labour to see if the money provided for the youth and recreational schemes within that Department's Vote was expended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; is very realistic, especially when one considers the reason for the allocation in the regional Funds of Suitors Bill which was formulated in April 1982.  At that time the Department of the Gaeltacht issued a letter by which Comhaltas Ceoltóirí raised some £200,000 in order to fund their new building. When this new Bill came forward and the Minister proposed a sum of £250,000, it seemed that in the 18 months he was covering the cost to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí and doing the correct think in so covering it.  At that time it was pointed out that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí were having financial difficulties and the Minister has been very generous in now increasing that money by another £50,000.  We started at a level of the State guaranteeing £200,000 and it is now going to guarantee £300,000, which is a 50 per cent increase.  The management of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí are aiming, towards that kind of increase.  The leader of Comhaltas, <Col N="1502" /> Lebhras Ó Murchú, in a recent speech sought £400,000, and generally people looking for money put a ceiling on it.  The Minister has gone a long way towards relieving the immediate financial problems facing this body.</P>
      <P>I understand why other Deputies speak so highly of Comhaltas and the work they have done, particularly in County Clare. It is from my constituency that a lot of the initiative has sprung.  Deputy Daly spoke about the centre erected in Ennis &mdash; Cois na hAbhna.  That centre was built with the aid of development funds through Clare County Council.  Indeed, the site was given free by that council and much assistance was given voluntarily. The members in Clare worked voluntarily. As well as the classes for song and dance, they also have a premises utilised for Scoil Lán-Ghaeilge in Ennis.  Comhaltas as a responsible body are providing both cultural and educational activities and, indeed, the centre in Monkstown, County Dublin, should be able to provide similar amenities.  I would like to be on record as saying that I do not understand why people on the other side cannot acknowledge the generosity of the Minister in improving the guarantee from £200,000 to £300,000.  I cannot see why they will not acknowledge that and go on with discussion of the Bill.</P>

Sílim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go dtuig feadh chuile dhuine an sár-obair atá á déanamh ag Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann agus nach bhfuilimid ag iarraidh tada as bealach nuair a iarraimid go dtabharfaí an t-airgead seo ar fad dóibh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to recognise that the £200,000 mentioned by the Minister as being the sum which Fianna Fáil had decided on indicates that we had a Bill prepared and that the money should have been allocated long before now.  I have asked the Taoiseach on numerous occasions when this Bill would be presented in the House. It was as a result of the guarantee which was given to Comhaltas that those funds would be made available that they contracted for certain works which have left <Col N="1503" /> them with high expenditure.  They have a bank overdraft to face.  While we accept that the Minister's gesture is worthwhile, in this instance he should go the whole distance and give the £500,000 we are suggesting in our amendment.</P>
    <P>Since Comhaltas were founded in 1951 they have done a tremendous job not alone in the provision of music, the revival of music and our culture generally but they are recognised internationally. They have branches in every one of the Thirty-two Counties.  The Cultúrlann is a show piece which people from all parts of the country can visit and be proud of the work done by Comhaltas but it is also recognised internationally as the centre piece of our cultural revival.  Any moneys which we are about to expend should be given willingly to Comhaltas.  We see the figures for other areas, such as £400,000 for ballet and £350,000 for opera while Comhaltas get only £125,000.  I do not consider we are asking for too much when we suggest that this figure be increased to £500,000.</P>

      <P>I am making a suggestion to the Minister and to the Deputies on the far side of the House, after discussing the matter with Deputy Woods, that before we take a vote on this tonight after finishing the debate Deputies who have not visited the centre in Monkstown should go out there and see for themselves what Comhaltas have been doing and what has been provided there as a show piece by Comhaltas.  I am quite sure the Deputies from the other side of the House and from this side of the House, who have not visited the Cultúrlann and who have not seen what they have been doing there, would feel justified in accepting our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of tremendous benefit to tourism. It is very hard to place a value on tourism when we are talking about what it does for our economy.  Some of us met the people from the Federation of Irish Hotels this evening and they told us the income which comes from tourism in various <Col N="1504" /> ways.  Comhaltas are contributing. They have their seisiúin at various centres throughout the country.  We have somewhere to take our German, French and American visitors and they appreciate what we can give them.  It is different from anything they can get anywhere else in the world.  I suggest to the Minister and to the Government, when we finish debating this matter tonight, that we postpone voting on our amendment and give every Deputy an opportunity to go out to see the Cultúrlann in Monkstown and see what has been done there.</P>
    <P>Comhaltas have been doing great work for the language.  They have a programme for improving the Irish language, for using Irish terms for helping to ensure that people involved in musical production will try to do that through the medium of Irish.  We could continue talking here for a long period tonight, going over the various things Comhaltas have been doing to improve our culture since it was established in 1951.  I hate to see us dividing on this particular matter.  It is not something the House should divide on.  I am convinced, if the Deputies who have not visited the Cultúrlann visited it, they would overwhelmingly support our amendment in relation to the £500,000. If the Government had taken action sooner and brought this Bill before the House Comhaltas would not find themselves in the financial trouble they are in today.  They undertook work on the understanding that this money would be made available to them fairly quickly. The Minister, in quoting our figure, is admitting that the Bill was prepared and ready so I cannot understand why we had to wait so long before it came to the House.</P>

      <P>I was not going to speak on the amendment but listening to the trend of the debate there is a suggestion from across the House that this party are less committed to Comhaltas Ceóltóiri Éireann than their party.  That is not true. Whatever about the remarks of Deputy Mac Giolla, who, as far as I am aware, has not said anything about this amendment, the party on the other side of the House had proposed £200,000 and the <Col N="1505" /> Minister proposed £250,000.  In recognition of the concern on both sides of the House he has increased that to £300,000. Many people have a cynical view of the House and if we are going to get into this ridiculous Dutch auction that no matter what the Minister proposes the Opposition will raise the anti, it is an absurd way to carry on our business.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment to increase the allocation to £500,000.  It is wrong of Deputies on the other side of the House to come in here just to defend their Minister.  They should put their country and their culture first. Numerous members of the Government <Col N="1506" /> parties will be greatly embarrassed this evening.  I support the suggestion by Deputy Gallagher that we should adjourn until such time as members on the far side of the House fully realise the implications of what they may be doing tonight if the House divides on this amendment.</P>
      <P>The impression has been given this evening that this would be a bonus to these people, but Comhaltas require £500,000 to stay afloat.  If we have any pride in our culture £200,000 is a small sum.  The money is available.  We are appealing to the Minister to leave politics aside.  We will commend him if he agrees to leave politics aside.  We know he was sent in here to do a job.  He is acting on behalf of the Government.  The people of the 26-counties and the 32-counties will applaud him if he agrees to do this.  As was pointed out Comhaltas have 400 branches throughout the 32-countries.  We have an opportunity tonight to help our fellow countrymen in the six counties where there are 60 branches.  It is difficult for Comhaltas in the present circumstances, but they are doing an excellent job there.  We should give full support to the 400 branches which include 60 branches in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have had the opportunity to see the centre at Monkstown and, if everybody else saw it, they would feel obliged to allocate this money particularly when £200,000 is available.  The decision we take here tonight will have repercussions on our culture for many years to come. The Minister will be remembered for many things, but he will certainly be remembered for the decision he takes if he puts it to a vote.  We appeal to him to make this money available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment to increase the funds to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann to £500,000.  On the point made by Deputy Coveney, I want to make it clear that this decision was reached in our party some weeks ago.  In fact, the Government have reacted to our proposal to increase the amount.  The allegation being made that we proposed to allocate a certain amount in 1982 is not relevant to the present day problems of <Col N="1507" /> Comhaltas.  We faced up to the reality that Comhaltas are in a very serious situation. The £500,000 available to the Government under the Funds of Suitors Bill would solve their problems for the future, and ensure that the great work they are doing will continue.</P>
      <P>We must all be very proud of the fact that Comhaltas provided the culture and tradition which entertained the President of the United States and his wife at Ballyporeen. Television pictures were shown in many countries throughout the world and particularly in America.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle should be aware that Comhaltas were responsible for the fine performance there.  In all the President's tour, nothing was of a higher standing or standard than the performance of Comhaltas. The Government have decided to increase the grant to £300,000 but the Minister could increase the amount to £500,000.  I would appreciate it if he would indicate to the House that he is prepared to reconsider his decision in the light of the views expressed by all sides of the House.  If a free vote were taken on our amendment tonight I have no doubt that there would be a clear majority in favour of increasing the grant to Comhaltas.</P>
      <P>The King's Inns is a fine building and a fine organisation, but it is a private organisation.  It does not respond to the needs of the people of the whole country. Comhaltas have 400 branches spread throughout the country.  They are represented in practically every village.  They are a 32-county organisation.  They are a national organisation with 60 branches in the northern part of our country.  They represent our true culture and should be fully supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coveney felt that we in Fianna Fáil were trying to project the image that we supported Comhaltas more than the Government side.  It is quite obvious that we in Fianna Fáil fully support Comhaltas. We took a decision which was discussed in full at parliamentary party level to increase the allocation to £500,000. This decision was not taken because the Government had decided to give £250,000.  If the Government had decided <Col N="1508" /> to allocate £500,000 we would have supported that proposal and an amendment would not have been necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes from a constituency in which Comhaltas are fully represented. He should support their aims and objectives.  In my constituency next Sunday the Connacht Fleá Ceoil will be held in Strokestown by Comhaltas.  I have been at many of their fleánna throughout the west of Ireland.  They are contributing to the culture of our nation.  They are preserving the very basis of our culture. They should not be forced to go from door to door to collect in support of their organisation.  Tonight we have a great opportunity to support this amendment put down by our spokesman, Deputy Woods.  We have an opportunity to increase the allocation to £500,000.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the fact that the Minister is increasing the allocation to £300,000 but this is not a Dutch auction.  We want to see it increased to £500,000.  We are prepared to vote on that because we believe in the aims and objectives of Comhaltas.  We believe the Irish people support that organisation.  As Deputies, we should reflect the needs and requirements of the Irish people by supporting a national organisation.  The ballet receive more money per annum from the State than Comhaltas.</P>

I have been in their national headquarters.  It is a fine building and a well-built centre.  It is right that we have a fine institute to reflect our culture.  I urge the Minister to indicate that he is at least prepared to consider the proposals put forward and to accept the amendment put down by our party.</P>

      <P>I was delighted to hear the contributions of all Deputies.  I was particularly interested to hear the contributions of the Deputies opposite because it seems to me when they were in a position to do something they did very little but now when they are in a position to do very little they talk a lot.  The facts are that in April 1982 when Fianna Fáil were in Government they decided that £200,000 was the appropriate figure to allocate to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí.  When I published this Bill the amount was increased to £250,000 and on the basis of representations made to me by many people I increased the amount to £300,000.  That is a generous contribution, and it is particularly generous in contrast with the penny-pinching approach of the Deputies opposite.  When they had power they did very little but now when they are out of power they talk a lot.</P>

My experience in politics and in life generally is that people always ask for more than the actually need and more than they expect to get.  I provided £300,000 but the Fianna Fáil Party want to provide £100,000 more than the people requested.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I was very happy to move amendment No. 3. It is a vote of confidence by the two parties in Government in the work of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí.  We appreciate what they do throughout the country. They are well organised and they make a major contribution to Irish life and Irish culture.  We appreciate their music, what <Col N="1512" /> they do for young people, the way they are organised and their interest not only in Irish music but in Irish dance and the whole Irish way of life.  We salute them for what they do but we must settle on a figure and on consideration of all the facts available to me I think £300,000 is the appropriate figure.  People who are advocating a higher figure, without making a specific case on why it is necessary, are simply looking for the plaudits of an organisation which, however worthy, has organised a very strong lobby for this event tonight.  Nobody in Fianna Fáil has justified £400,000, £500,000 or £600,000. The figure has been produced out of the air.  It is a figure in excess of the request. I have assessed the situation and my belief is that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí this year will get from all sources a sum of £473,900.  We are half-way through the year.  Next year there will be an allocation from the Arts Council and from Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Why do Deputies opposite not direct their lobbying to the newly constructed Arts Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is a windfall fund, a once-off operation, and the Minister should stop lecturing us about how he, his Department and the Government allocate all the resources of State and how excellent they are.  Indeed we could have a separate debate on the way the job is being done by the Government at present.  This money has come into the possession of the State and it is available for distribution.  The Minister and some of his backbenchers have alleged that the Minister allocated a sum of £250,000, that he then changed it to a sum of £300,000 and then went up as far as £500,000.  That is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as the Bill was circulated it was debated at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and it was recognised by all present that a sum of £500,000 was required.  Our amendment originated at that meeting.  The Minister decided quite <Col N="1514" /> suddenly to introduce the Bill this week in the middle of the Criminal Justice Bill and all the other business going on until the small hours of the morning and we agreed.  Our amendment was part of a discussion which took place in a genuine way.  There has been an attempt here tonight to try to smear some Members on this side of the House which is despicable. Although it also happens in normal proceedings from time to time, we had thought that this Bill was exceptional and different and one which Members on all sides of the House would readily and willingly support.</P>
    <P>We said at the outset that the extra £50,000 which the Minister was giving was very welcome and we are delighted that he has done so but it is still not enough.  I will quote from a letter from Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann of 14 June 1984 which was sent to Deputies and Senators:</P>
    <P>The proposed payment of £250,000 to Comhaltas from the Funds of Suitors will leave a further shortfall of almost the same amount in relation to the grant which was promised in 1981.  In that year, we were promised £200,000 but as this was not paid, and as we could not meet our financial commitments on our new Folk Theatre, contracts were re-negotiated driving the price of the project up considerably.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have read this and realised that things had changed dramatically from 1981 when the original proposal was made.  That came in April as the Minister said, in a proposed Bill which, because of subsequent events, did not get to the House until now.  The letter goes on:</P>
    <P>We subsequently borrowed the money from the ICC and have since been charged considerable interest on this loan.  We now earnestly ask your support in having the Funds of Suitors grant raised to £500,000.</P>
    <P>The present debts of Comhaltas are in excess of £750,000.  The Minister keeps talking about little grants of £4,000 and £59,000 which will help them with the running of the operation.  On the grants <Col N="1515" /> which they are receiving it will be difficult enough for them to manage on a current basis and that is the point.  If their current debts amount to a sum of £750,000, it must be quite obvious that we must throw a lifeline to them and give them the opportunity to clear the bulk of those debts by giving them £500,000 and leaving them to do the rest themselves.  We know that the current moneys given to them have been reduced in real terms. This is in line with what has happened in other areas but they are concerned about their debts.</P>
    <P>Apparently, when the promise of £200,000 was made in 1981 &mdash; Members on the other side of the House have made much play of this because it is probably the best political point they can throw into the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

      <P>The promise was made in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The promise was made in 1981.  The Bill was prepared in April 1982 but the promise was made to Comhaltas in 1981.  I read that for you a short time ago.  Their current debts stand at £750,000.  Deputy Carey is a businessman and must realise that if the current debts stand at £750,000 and their forward position is very difficult with a reduced grant, their position will be very serious. As I was saying, the sum of £200,000 was promised in 1981.  The cost of the buildings at that time was in the order of £400,000 and apparently the £200,000 was related to that cost.  They went ahead and got sub-contractors on the understanding that the money was allocated to them.  The money did not come and late in 1982 they had to renegotiate their contract. Various amendments were made and they probably believed it would come soon after that.  By the autumn of 1982 they had to borrow from the ICC and the total cost of the buildings was over £800,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not talk about Fianna Fáil and try to throw glib, snide, cheap, petty remarks across the House especially at a time when people on this side of the House are trying to be serious and sincere. <Col N="1516" /> Anybody who spoke here was sincere and all they got were these snide remarks from the other side of the House.  They should keep those for other occasions.  At least this was an occasion on which we could approach something objectively and constructively without throwing in all the terms that the handlers suggest to the Minister, to try and demean Deputy Woods, in any way they can.  That does not bother me in the least. What they have to say about me is irrelevant. They may get satisfaction from it, their handlers may enjoy it; they pass it on to the papers and something crops up in the papers the next day which is great fun.  I have said before in this House and I say it again that what happens here in this House is the ultimate in democracy, not what appears in the papers.  What appears in the papers is good fun and good sport for the day but what happens here in the House is what they have to face and, in relation to this section of this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating it to what the Minister said.  In any event let us face facts.  For whatever reason we have heard Ministers from that side of the House recently having to defend situations in which costs escalated in recent years because of delays in contracts and so on, and when special arrangements have had to be made.  Perhaps this is a case in which something like that happened.  Perhaps this House is to blame for having had so many elections and changes in the interim that delayed this Bill coming to <Col N="1517" /> the House.  The Government cannot wave all the blame away because obviously they could have introduced it very much sooner also.  Whatever the reason the cost of the buildings jumped from £400,000 to over £800,000 and that difference had to be met by them.  Let us not start going back over the reasons. For instance, take the example of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards where there was a massive escalation in cost over a similar period which had to be dealt with and sorted out by the Government.  Here we have the reality that the costs increased.  Apparently the interest payable to the Industrial Credit Company is £80,000.  In regard to the financial costs of running the building their calculations were entirely thrown out because their cash flow was disturbed.  All of their earlier predictions had been based on the fact that this money would be forthcoming, that the contracts were to go ahead, that the cash flow was to function because they have various means of bringing in cash within the building&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The main concern of the people over there is to allocate blame to somebody else.  They want to allocate blame to somebody.  They want to blame Fianna Fáil, if they can and, if they can get away with that with the media, leading them off on another errand to print something that will knock Fianna Fáil. The fact of the matter is that it has nothing to do with Fianna Fáil.  Both of us, as Governments, were responsible for the fact that delay occurred in this case &mdash; that is the first point &mdash; and that upset these people in the job they were doing. Perhaps that happens much too often in government, in public administration, that people are delayed, they are given promises, undertakings and, because of the inefficiency of the operations of the whole system of Government, the undertakings <Col N="1519" /> or promises are not delivered in anything like the time intended originally. Consequently people are left in considerable difficulty.  The fact of the matter is that the cost escalated to that extent.  Also the fact of the matter is that their present indebtedness is in excess of £750,000.  Let us take the position as it obtains today and not go back into the history of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or anybody else.  What are we going to do about the current situation?  What we have suggested is that from this windfall money which is available we should do something for that sector.  The Minister agrees with that and has gone some of the way.  We contend that, by going that much of the way only, we are leaving them still in financial difficulty.  We suggest that the Government go the whole way affording them a good opportunity to get on with the job.  Initially we were not differing with the Minister, we welcomed what he was doing but we just felt that an amount of £500,000 would be necessary.  It has nothing to do with Dutch auctions or anything like that.  It is a question of what is the reality of the present position in regard to that organisation. On that basis we would ask the Minister to reconsider the position.  If he has not been given all that information then, in the meantime, he should satisfy himself that that is the real position because that is the position as we understand it.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I support the amendment put forward by my party requesting the Minister to increase the contribution to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann to £500,000.  The Minister has said on a number of occasions that we have not even attempted to justify this figure.  It must be clear from what our spokesman has said that we have clearly justified the figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should realise that in every parish, hamlet, town and county there are people working continuously, on a voluntary basis, for the expansion <Col N="1520" /> and development of our culture our music, song and dance that are unrivalled throughout the world.  The involvement of so many people in a voluntary capacity alone justifies the fact that this great organisation, great cultural institution is entitled to moderate financial support. The Minister should realise also that this organisation runs 600 classes weekly in which are involved over 50,000 people throughout the length and breadth of this land.  We must remember that we live in times when multi-channel, modern satellite communications have brought about a situation in which our culture must now compete with alien cultures and other influences heretofore unknown in this country.  As representatives of people with this identity we must ensure that it is preserved, that the opportunity for so many people to be involved and make a contribution to the preservation of that identity is sustained, so that we parliamentarians will not be found wanting in the provision of the necessary finances to ensure the continued development of our culture.</P>
    <P>We must also realise the tremendous tourist attraction our culture has been, the numbers of tourists who go away always remembering the music, song and dance so typically Irish, so entertaining and valuable to our country.  We must remember that these voluntary groups go abroad constantly giving displays of traditional music, song and dance in foreign parts.  These people week after week, month after month, year after year, go abroad voluntarily and give displays of traditional music, song and dance in foreign places.  Not alone does that help to bring together our many emigrants in cities and towns throughout the world, but foreigners get an opportunity of hearing our songs and seeing our dances performed and then they come to Ireland for that reason alone.</P>

Even the staff, of that institution have not been paid for some time.  I have no objection to whatever investment goes into the King's Inns because we must have lawyers and other people involved to ensure that our judicial system is right and that justice is available to every person, but they are a minority grouping.  Compare them with the masses involved in our culture, our songs and dances, through the organisation of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, Surely that alone is clear proof of the necessity to give them the type of financial support we are seeking for them.  It is important that we preserve our Irish identity. Because we have been for a number of years part of a major international forum, the EEC, it is more important than ever that we preserve that identity.</P>

    <P>(d) not more than £100,000 may, on the application of the Minister for Labour, be applied in or towards the defrayal of the cost of the Community Youth Recreational and Employment Programme administered by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>Under this amendment I am proposing to make an amount of £100,000 from the dormant balances in the funds of suitors available to the Minister for Labour for the purposes of providing additional funding for the Community, Youth, Recreational and Employment Programme which is administered by the Department of Labour.  Funds available for that programme are used on a nationwide basis to help finance the construction of community recreational facilities.  No new funding has been provided for the programme since 1981 and I understand that all of the financial resources hitherto available to the programme are committed to existing projects so that no new projects can be grant-aided without the commitment of additional resources.  The Minister of State at the Department of Labour has already indicated, in the course of the debate earlier today on the Second Stage, who the beneficiaries will be under the proposed amendment.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I do not have any briefing note on that.  It is not relevant to this.  This amendment is for a fund to which no new resources have been allocated since 1981.  Projects which were grant-aided then have not been finished, for example, the community centre in Ennistymon in County Clare, the one in Banteer, County Cork and others.  The allegation that the youth employment levy is allocated to the Department of Labour is not relevant to this discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the sense that the point was made on Second Stage that it might be possible to find moneys to enhance those from that fund and the contributions made by taxpayers in that area.  It is for that reason I thought the Minister might have had the figure. Obviously he does not.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): It would be as relevant to ask for an explanation of all the funds in the Department of Justice and what the full budget was.  This money is not allocated to youth employment but specifically for centres where grants were discontinued in 1981.  The projects had reached a certain point in their development and there is a series of white elephant projects around the country. A small input by the State now could be matched by local funds which, in some cases, would enable projects to be finished completely and in other cases brought to a point where the community could make use of them.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage a number of Deputies on this side asked questions about the youth employment levy. Whether such funds are used is irrelevant.  The Government have power to use funds in whatever way they suggest to the House.  The Minister indicated earlier that sums of £5,000 or £10,000 would be given to a series of different projects which needed additional funding.  Since <Col N="1527" /> these are special windfall funds there would appear to be funds available to the Government on a more regular basis which could be used in this direction.  It was for that reason that I asked how much the funds are at present.  The Minister does not have the figure so I will leave it at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Woods repeats in more moderate terms the points made by Deputy Tunney.  There has for some time been an ongoing programme of capital grants whereby youth groups and com munity groups received State support on the basis that a local contribution is matched by support from the State.  This year's estimates provided a sum of £1.2 million for that purpose.  That is an increase of 25 per cent on last year's figure.  It has come to my notice that there are a number of community centres which received State support in the past and found the funding inadequate, even if matched by local funds, to complete the project.  It also relates to groups who did not receive any State funding but who are now in difficulty.</P>
      <P>This proposal allows me to select a number of groups all of which have shown tremendous local drive, initiative and commitment and to say that we admire what they are doing and the achievements they have made in collecting their level of funding to date.  We will give them a small amount of money to help them out of their difficulties and enable them to finish their projects.  As regards the groups which have been selected that is the position with each one of them.  In each case the group are finding it heavy weather to complete their project and a relatively small injection of State funds could make all the difference. It is a splendid way to use the funds available under this Bill.  If we think of the way funds which became available in the past have been used, this is in accordance with the tradition of helping volunteers and those involved in working with young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment moved by the Minister <Col N="1528" /> for Justice gives expression to the principles about which Deputy Tunney spoke at considerable length.  He praised the principle of volunteering and suggested it was not adequately recognised by Governments in the past.  This amendment does that and helps groups made up of people who give their time voluntarily. It is saying that we know what they have done and know what has been achieved and we are determined to see that they succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the list in my brief contribution on Second Stage. The criteria were as I have indicated.  A small amount of cash at this stage would represent a morale boost to the local community so as to enable them to finish the project they had embarked upon and which would be too difficult for them to complete otherwise.  The list is: Ennistymon, County Clare will receive a grant of £9,000.  Banteer, County Cork will receive £5,000 for their community centre.  That is a project which is in some difficulty.  They were not able to complete the final details of plumbing, heating and so on.  The Dromtariffe community centre is getting £10,000.  The Irish Wheelchair Association in Blackheath will get £5,000.  That is a much bigger project but it is a volunteer group working with the disabled and they have taken on an enormous burden in terms of interest repayments.  It represents the Oireachtas saying that we want to support them and stand in solidarity with them.  They have already indicated just how appreciative they are for that sum. In the case of Durrow, County Laois, a figure of £3,000 is being given for a community centre which is all but completed. Caherdavin, County Limerick will receive £11,000 and South Hill will receive £5,000.  This is a community <Col N="1529" /> working in an area of high unemployment. With all the odds stacked against them they have been extraordinarily successful in raising funds.  This injection of capital in the closing stages of the project will put them over the hump.  In Newcastlewest a sum of £9,000 will be given for the community centre and Emyvale will receive £5,000.  That is a community with particular difficulties and it was an enourmous achievement when the small group collected well over £150,000.  In Cashel, Larkspur Park was a site donated by Mr. Guest to the local community.  There is a substantial project under way but the local group are unable to continue supporting it and there is a danger that the project might turn into a white elephant. However, an injection of capital will turn it around.  In Nenagh a sum of £14,000 is being given for the athletics complex about which the Ceann Comhairle will know so much.  A sum of £5,000 is being given to the Catholic Youth Council's outdoor centres in Wicklow.  This project involves the provision of three outdoor centres.  The difficulty is that their interest repayments are inhibiting their day-to-day activity in serving young people.</P>
      <P>The sports complex at Mullingar, County Westmeath, will receive a sum of £5,000 &mdash; a small contribution for a very large project involving the local community raising well over £500,000.  They have made very substantial progress but now find that the pace is becoming quite difficult.  This is an attempt to tell them we know that this is a difficult time for them and we want to show our support for them in the hope and expectation that this allocation will assist their efforts in local fund raising.</P>

I accept that description because this is a once-off sum.  It is extremely important that the benefits of this windfall should be felt throughout the community.  Nobody would appreciate more than a north city representative how greatly many community centres need this injection of funds.  My regret is not that this amount is being spent but that more money is not being spent.  This money, as well as the money allocated for the Children's Court and the legal aid system, are most welcome; but I only wish they could have been more extensive.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt but that the projects listed by the Minister of State are very worthy, but there are hundreds of other very worthy projects which have not been touched.  But that is not the point.  The point is that here the Minister of State has succeeded in persuading his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to give £100,000 to make up for the cutbacks in his Department and for the misuse of the youth employment funds.  Here is money going from the Funds of Suitors Bill to a Government Department.  I object to that, and we should all object to it.  There are many community projects to which this money should be allocated.  This money should not be allocated to make up for cutbacks in Department's Estimates.  The Minister of State has not been able to persuade the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, to give him £100,000 but he succeeded in persuading poor Deputy Noonan, the Minister for Justice, to give him this £100,000 out of this windfall.  This is not hurting any taxpayers and fair dues to the Minister of State for persuading the Minister to do this.  In my view this is wrong and we should not allow it to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education could grab another £100,000 to help leisure centres which do not have funding.  There are hundreds of these centres not only in Dublin but all around the country.  The <Col N="1531" /> Minister of State has succeeded in taking this money which is required for other community projects.  The Minister for Justice is using £1 million to build a children's court.  His Department should have provided this money.  Again this money is being given to a Government Department to make up the money the Minister for Finance did not provide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are supporting this but we have to point out that if the Government cannot find £3,000 for one project or £5,000 for another, when the community are working so hard and contributing all they can, they should have another look at how they are allocating money.  As Deputy Mac Giolla said, this is a windfall, a once-off situation and the money should be made available to the Minister to fund these very worthwhile projects.</P>
      <P>I remember when a previous Minister was given £5 million in one year.  Now this Minister is being criticised for giving this money.  If the Government were imaginative in their approach they would provide this money and help the Minister for Justice to solve his problems with crime and youth.

I had the privilege to visit Larkspur Park together with the Minister of State and the local committee comprising of all political shades.  The Minister was amazed at the voluntary work which had been almost completed in Larkspur, but unfortunately they ran out of funds.  The Minister gave an undertaking to try to get funds to enable them to fulfil this very worthwhile project.

This shows <Col N="1533" /> once again the complete lack of interest this Government have in doing anything for the people of the west.

I have a vested interest in the allocation, and it surprises me that Deputy Mac Giolla has taken such a narrow view of justice, crime prevention and law enforcement.

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to say what the value of the residual amounts will be until the cost of completing the children's court project becomes known but the amendment would enable me to provide some added funding for legal aid services.

There are various options and I will have to examine each carefully before I make a decision.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 are simply consequential.  However, there is a matter which makes it difficult for me to estimate what the residual amount will be, apart from the cost of the children's court.  It is that I do not know when the sums of money being provided under section 3 will be drawn down.  Until they have been drawn down, obviously there will be a interest accruing.

Staff are moving on for one reason or another and therefore the staff embargo could cause a problem. A serious situation is developing.  We support this useful provision of moneys, but future Governments will have to consider how to deal properly with this area of civil legal aid and make adeqate provision, always bearing in mind that the cost can become too great.  It is that fact which has held back Ministers for Justice and perhaps has caused Ministers for Finance to hold them back.

      <P>On this amendment, I am putting in a further plea to that made on Second Stage for a community law centre in Tallaght.  When the Minister becomes aware of the amount of money which is available and is considering uses for it, he might note that the law centre in Coolock is very efficiently run by the community and is of vital importance to it.  This centre is doing a much greater service than the Government's free legal aid services and at much less cost.  There is very little cost to the taxpayers.  A similar centre is required in Tallaght.  The community there believe that it would cost them £64,000 to £70,000 actually in 1984 terms.  It would be of tremendous benefit if the community had a guarantee of three years, and they are looking for something in the region of £200,000.  The Minister should have a look at the operation of the Coolock centre &mdash; I am sure that he has already &mdash; and at the desert land out in Tallaght where the people have nothing.  There is a population of 70,000 out there and any small town in Ireland has better services and more facilities.  A law centre there would be of tremendous help.  I am appealing to the Minister to make that one of his priorities in allocating the money, rather than putting it all into free legal aid centres.  The <Col N="1538" /> funds are required for that because they are so far behind, but a community centre in Tallaght is suggested and perhaps one in Ballymun or some other similar centres.  These should be a major priority for the Minister.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, there is a requirement for the establishment of a law centre in Tallaght and I hope the Minister will be able to meet that requirement. I have met the group who intend to set up a FLAC centre there.  Of course, there are a number of problems with a large population in a developing area. The area has not received the recognition which it should have as an important urban centre.  It would be of immense assistance to the sense of social cohesiveness in Tallaght if a law centre could be set up.  Money under this heading would be ideally spent in providing such a facility and most social workers will agree to the need for this.  I hope the Minister can meet the needs of the good people of the FLAC centre who reckon that on a three-year basis it would require certain funding which could be met under this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be extremely brief. I raised this matter on Second Stage.  For the first time since I came into this House I am finding myself in agreement with Deputy Mac Giolla and I welcome the comments made by Deputy Michael O'Leary.  I urge the Minister to consider making funds available for the community law centre in Tallaght as rapidly as possible.  I spoke at length on this matter on Second Stage and will now only make one point.  The Minister seems to be envisaging spending the funds which are available in the context of the children's court and then seeing what is left over and making provisions.  He appeared to be saying that there would be sufficient funds to provide the children's court, as I suggested this morning, and the court buildings.  It is clear that the funds are there to do so.  However, the amount left over is not known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem that the Minister could, with ease at this stage, when the Bill will have passed all Stages in both Houses, <Col N="1539" /> make available funds to establish a free legal advice centre in celebration of the ten years of existence of the Coolock community law centre which I had the pleasure of being involved in opening.  It would allow commencement on a new project of providing a community law centre in Tallaght before the end of this year.  I urge the Minister to make funds available this year rather than allow them to accumulate and generate interest over two or three years to provide the purpose-built Children's Court which the Minister is proposing.  I hope the Minister will consider that very seriously and, if he has not done so, will meet with the council of the free legal aid advice centres with a view to taking steps towards meeting their reasonable requests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to welcome the intent indicated by the Minister in this amendment.  This, along with other comments by the Minister during all stages, would indicate that he is reviewing the value which the State and the public are getting for money in free legal aid, with a view to making significant changes.  This is particularly welcome. I support the case made by other Deputies in relation to the value of community law centres in areas where many people will need a range of advice on legal matters.  The Coolock community law centre has proved itself to be a valuable contributor to a wider range of services than is available in the legal aid centres, while they also have a value and a place in the system.  I would encourage an extension of these community law centres.  I urge the Minister to do what he can to remove the regular dilemma facing the Coolock law centre year in year out as to its future.  Deputies have made a plea for areas like Tallaght. Another area which would have an immediate need and an obvious population which could support a community law centre is the Finglas-Ballymun area. Other urban areas, I am sure, would repeat this pattern of need.  I ask the Minister, in the commitment made in this amendment to look seriously at these areas and these needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted an opportunity to say something on this section.  Under subsection (2) (a), the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Arts, who is present, are provided with a sum of £600,000.  I want to emphasise that there have been no capital grants provided at all for the arts in the past year or so.  References made earlier tonight to various groups getting certain sums of money are incorrect. These got no capital grants at all.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to one project in particular which, while it is centred in Cork, is a national project, the Irish National Ballet Company.  They are erecting a new headquarters in Cork.  It is one of the few opportunities nowadays for real meaningful decentralisation of any sector of a publicly supported activity.  I ask the Minister to be generous in this respect.  Apart from the fact that it is the first major training and educational centre for this particular art form built in this country it is also a major urban renewal project in the centre of the oldest part of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures are daunting.  Cork Corporation are giving £50,000.  An appeal is being made for an EEC grant <Col N="1541" /> of £25,000 to £30,000. Public contributions from industry and individuals will represent at least 75 per cent of the total funding of about £900,000.  I hope the State will allocate about one quarter of the £600,000 available to the Taoiseach's Department and to the Minister for the Arts.  If that money is provided quickly it will enable this project to commence and will enable it to be completed during 1985 which, by a happy coincidence, is the 800th anniversary of the city of Cork.  I urge the Minister to allocate £150,000 to this project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to point out that it is the Taoiseach to whom the Deputy will have to make representations once we agree to the allocation of this sum tonight.  The other items which have not been dealt with in detail, because the amendments did not relate directly to them, include the provision of the Children's Court and the provision of the funds to the Minister to spend as he may see necessary in relation to the extension, repair and maintenance of other buildings and services relating to the courts. These are very worthy objects and we support them.  We are back to the basic principle we were talking about earlier, the use of these funds.  We know that the capital programme in the Department of Justice was reduced by approximately £6 million.  The Minister may say that just delayed the prison building programme or some other aspects but these are things which should be provided for in the annual allocations.  Nevertheless, they are not being provided and, consequently, we support the Minister in his request to have some of the funds allocated in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously we all want to see a suitable children's court.  We want to see a modern building with proper facilities. Maintenance and repair, which are provided in subsection (2) (e) (ii) are what one would consider would normally be provided for in the annual allocation.  The Minister has taken a number of imaginative steps during the debate on the Bill and we will not oppose him in relation to this because otherwise he may not get his children's court for some time.  We agree <Col N="1542" /> with it while pointing out in principle that it would be preferable if the State provided this.</P>

      <P>Earlier tonight I mentioned the request I put in for £150,000. At the time I was out of order so I would like to get back into order now.  One cannot ask for a sum as large as that without some justification.  I have asked the Minister to bring this request to the notice of the Taoiseach.  It is based on the fact that Galway for a very long time have only had one theatre, the Taidhbhearc. That theatre did wonderful work for a long time but Galway also needed an English theatre.  Into the void came a very young group called Druid who, with very little funding brought great acclaim to Irish theatre by going abroad and winning many awards.  They have come to Dublin on successive occasions and have taken the city by storm.  It is a terrible thing to feel that when these young people go home to Galway they have no theatre.  It is because they have done so well that I feel I am justified in making this request.  I am glad to see the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, here tonight.  I ask him to give every consideration to this young group who have not any theatre.  If they decided to build the theatre I ask the Minister to go further than the £150,000 I asked him to give tonight.  I am sure Deputy Woods or the National Ballet would not disagree with this.</P>

These works relate to the King's Inns at Henrietta Street and the adjoining gardens.  We had some discussion <Col N="1543" /> on this earlier.  I ask the Minister to consider specifying some conditions in relation to the allocation of these funds. I know the hall is given free of charge for charitable organisations from time to time, for State functions and other public use.  In allocating these funds there should be some formal recognition of the spirit in which they are allocated.  Perhaps the Minister would consider this before the funds are paid over.</P>

The money will be allocated to the Office of Public Works to carry out only the works specified here.  The works cannot cost more than £600,000.  If they do the money will not be drawn from this fund or from Government funds.  It will have to be put up independently.</P>
      <P>With regard to commitments, I take the point made by the Deputy.  I have some commitments already, continuing use of the premises if needed for the High Court, public access to the library in Henrietta Street for anybody who has a legitimate interest in using it and access to the park which is there already.  I have some views also on the access of students to the courses.  While I have not got a commitment on that we have the basis for opening a discussion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my appreciation to you for having given me the facility to raise on the Adjournment of the House the most critical and worrying situation which has arisen about the itinerant problem in Tallaght, County Dublin.  I am quite happy to share my time with other Deputies from the area who are equally concerned about the position.</P>
      <P>Studies show that one quarter of all the itinerants in the country are at present to be found in the new town of Tallaght, County Dublin.  The responsibility for dealing with the matter of itinerant resettlement until now has rested with the local authorities, in this case Dublin County Council.  Some years ago because of a decision of the Supreme Court, under injunctions the county council were prohibited from removing or resettling itinerants even from unauthorised sites unless they were in a position to make an offer of an alternative halting site to the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on that Supreme Court decision, a number of itinerant families moved into Tallaght and, in particular, the Tallaght by-pass, a new road constructed by Dublin County Council at a cost of many millions of pounds but never opened, and also on to lands which are the property of Dublin Corporation and intended to be the site of a new town centre for the town of Tallaght, and other <Col N="1545" /> lands belonging to the corporation and intended to be the site for the new Tallaght hospital.  Both of those amenities are urgently required in Tallaght. The population of the new town of Tallaght has been deprived until now of both those facilities.  Both of these sites have been used extensively, and continue to be used, as unauthorised camp sites by itinerant families.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council endeavoured on a number of occasions to bring in a programme of halting sites spread throughout County Dublin, some of which were to be located in Tallaght.  At first the council ran into difficulties in getting a majority of the membership of the county council to adopt this plan. Eventually the plan for the halting sites was adopted by a majority of the members of Dublin County Council. Unfortunately, however, as a result of the long delays, and the increased suffering of the settled community in Tallaght, and also the itinerants who are located on the unauthorised sites, an appalling degree of anger built up among the people of Tallaght.</P>
    <P>It is no secret, and it has been reported in the media that in the past few weeks thousands of people &mdash; and I mean literally thousands of people &mdash; have been blockading the Tallaght by-pass and other arterial roads in Tallaght, sealing it off from traffic on three occasions each week at peak times.  In addition to that, there have been other angry demonstrations and the mood in Tallaght, to say the least, is ugly and dangerous.  There have been confrontations between demonstrators and itinerants.  Threats have been exchanged between one group and another on many occasions.  Fortunately until now the matter has not escalated beyond that.</P>
    <P>This is a potentially explosive situation. It would take little to trigger off a potential disaster in that area which could quite easily lead to serious injury or loss of life, whether among the settled community or among the itinerants or both. On these occasions the Garda have kept a relatively low profile.  Indeed, by reason of the very large numbers of the members of the settled community who demonstrated, <Col N="1546" /> they had little choice but to do so.  The people of Tallaght came out in overwhelming numbers running literally to thousands.  Public meetings were attended by 2,000 or 3,000 people on a number of occasions indicating the level of feeling in the area.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to control the situation in the present circumstances.  The Garda force in Tallaght, or the entire Garda force in Dublin, in my view would be unable to control the anger of the people of Tallaght at the problem which has gone on there and escalated over the past couple of years.  If something is not done quickly, there is a serious danger to life and limb.  I want to sound this warning note, with no alarmist intent, but in the hope and expectation that central Government will recognise this fact, grasp this nettle and undertake responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>By reason of the depth of feeling in the demonstrations which have taken place and continue to take place in Tallaght, the halting site programme which was adopted by the county council is not capable of implementation in the absence of an overwhelming degree of force by the authorities, which would require the use not only of Garda forces but also of Army forces.  This would involve pitched battles on the streets of Tallaght.  As a public representative for that area I could not contemplate that for one moment, or envisage as being permitted to happen.</P>
    <P>For that reason and having thought about this matter long and deeply, I have come to the conclusion regrettably that the local authorities in this instance, and Dublin County Council in particular, are not in a position to make any meaningful contribution to the resolution of the problem of itinerant resettlement in this new town.  This is a new town with young people and a population of some 70,000 or 80,000.  They have numerous problems in that area and numerous difficulties in setting up their new community in that new town.</P>
    <P>They suffer grievously from unemployment to a higher percentage than in many other areas.  The Garda strength in the area is well below the par which would be warranted by the population.  There is <Col N="1547" /> no hospital in that area.  There is no third level college in that area.  There is no enterprise centre in that area.  There is no town centre in that area.  All there are, are the gaping holes where those basic amenities should be.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the itinerant problem has increased to the extent that in this relatively small area are to be found on unauthorised sites one quarter of the entire itinerant population of the entire country.  The matter will have to be tackled on a national basis, if it is to be tackled at all.  Let us be clear about this. I say this, having thought about it deeply. If the matter is not tackled on a national basis it will not be tackled at all.</P>
    <P>Dublin county is the smallest county in the country.  With that concentration it is simply not possible to achieve a reasonable spread of resettlement which is a crucial precondition towards achieving the agreement which is so essential among the settled community and the itinerant community.</P>
    <P>At the very least the adjoining counties to County Dublin must be involved in this resettlement programme and that can only be achieved if there is national acceptance of responsibility for the problem. The writ of Dublin County Council does not extend beyond the borders of County Dublin.  It requires ministerial action to achieve that and that fact was recognised by the Government.  I recall that a the last Fine Gael Ard-Fheis the Taoiseach stated quite clearly that he recognised the inadequacy and failure of the local authorities to do anything towards meeting this escalating problem. In his speech he indicated he was setting up a task force of junior Ministers to prepare a plan to resolve this problem nationwide on a fair and equitable basis. We have been waiting anxiously for that report and I understand it is ready now.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that this is a national problem that must be tackled by the Minister or by the task force with plenary powers to deal with it on the basis of fair resettlement throughout County Dublin and also the adjoining counties and the rest of the country.  More than 50 itinerant families have been resettled in <Col N="1548" /> Tallaght in conventional housing. Tallaght has, and will, fulfil its role on a fair and reasonable basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Taylor for giving me the opportunity to speak on this important and serious matter and I wish to thank the Chair for accepting the suggestion put forward by Deputy Taylor that the matter be raised on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>This is a very important and serious matter.  As a person who has been moving about Tallaght for many years I regard it as one of the most serious problems that the area has faced.  Tallaght is now a new town with a population of between 70,000 to 80,000.  This problem has developed over the past few years.  I appreciate that Tallaght is under the jurisdiction of Dublin County Council but the problem was brought about largely by Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>When this House was discussing the Estimate for the Department of the Environment I referred to the problems caused by Dublin Corporation.  However, there is no point tonight in blaming anyone.  The situation is serious and major trouble lies ahead.  Unless something is done the existing situation may develop to such an extent that we may have loss of life.  It behoves all of us to come together and try to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>Recently proposals came before the county council of which the council approved.  There may have been some modifications but nevertheless a full programme was proposed and passed by a majority vote.  In good faith and in the interest of having something done, I proposed that the programme be accepted but the situation has deteriorated considerably and like Deputy Taylor, I am afraid there is no hope now of having the programme implemented.  Leaving politics aside completely, I appeal to the Minister to have this matter dealt with on a national basis at Government level.  That is the only way a solution can be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that as a result of this debate tonight a solution will be found.  The county council and the people of Tallaght have accepted that itinerants should be <Col N="1549" /> housed in the general area and quite a number have been accepted.  The Minister is a very humane person and I know he realises the situation.  I appeal to him to ensure that something is done to resolve this serious problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only two minutes left before the Minister replies, so I shall be brief.  There is no disagreement between the Deputies for the constituency that this is a very serious and urgent problem.  Prophecies tend to be self-fulfilling and we must be very careful about the language we use in describing this serious situation.  However, it can be said without exaggeration that there is a potential for violence in the situation at Tallaght in relation to the problem of the travelling people, and that potential for violence must be defused.</P>
      <P>Deputies for the area met the Tallaght Community Council this evening and we listened to their views.  The position is that Tallaght as a community has not the facilities to deal with any further halting sites.  The requirement is that the families who are at present blocking the by-pass must go from that by-pass.  The view of the community, with which we agree, is that Tallaght has done more than its share as a community to absorb traveller families and the facilities are not there to cope with any more.  We are meeting the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other Deputies have pointed out, we must solve this problem on a national basis.  It must be spread out over more communities, not concentrated in Tallaght and Clondalkin.  It should be dealt with by involving the counties adjacent to Dublin and each neighbourhood community in Dublin must accept its responsibility.  The report of the ministerial task force has been before the Cabinet. I do not know what that report recommends but I say to the Minister that it requires more than a response at county council level at this stage.  It is a serious situation with a marked potential for violence and that must be defused in a constructive fashion.  This we are attempting to do by meeting with the <Col N="1550" /> Tallaght Community Council.  There must be a broader way of dealing with the entire problem than simply going ahead and concentrating its solution in Tallaght and, to a lesser extent, in Clondalkin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of the sad situation in Tallaght as outlined by the Deputies.  The position seems to be that some residents are seeking to have the travelling familes moved off the Tallaght by-pass while other residents from a different part of Tallaght are protesting against Dublin County Council's proposals to develop a temporary site to which the families can be moved from the by-pass.  The families cannot, of course, be moved from the by-pass until basic facilities are available for them elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The nub of the problem seems to be that at least some people in Tallaght do not want travelling families near them, even as a temporary measure, and do not seem to care that the families on the by-pass are living in unacceptable conditions which are a potential health hazard to themselves and to those living near tham. What is more, these protestors now seem to be prepared to take the law into their own hands to prevent the county council from taking action to move families off the by-pass.</P>
      <P>There are a number of matters to be considered.  Firstly, there is the matter of the by-pass itself on which £4½ million has been spent so far.  Because of the families camped on it, the by-pass has not been available to serve the purpose for which it was provided, namely to relieve traffic congestion in Tallaght.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, there is, as I have mentioned, the potential health hazard and nuisance to those residents living near, and using, the by-pass arising from the large number of travelling families camped there.  These residents have rights, just like everyone else, and are entitled to consideration, but this does not excuse the action of blocking part of the by-pass and other roads.  Finally, and most importantly, there is the matter of the travellers themselves who, like any of <Col N="1551" /> us, have rights.  Quite frankly, they must live somewhere.  Simply moving them on would not be acceptable and would not be a solution.  This would just shift the problem to somewhere else without care for the consequences for the travellers, or for others.</P>
    <P>The only answer to the problem of travellers on the roadside is to provide them with acceptable accommodation. This is the direct responsibility of the local authorities.  My function is to provide the necessary finance to local authorities to enable them to provide this accommodation whether in standard housing, group housing, or on halting sites.  My role is, and the role of my predecessors has been, to encourage local authorities to meet their responsibilities in this respect.  The travelling family numbers in the whole country comes to about 1,300 on the roadside.  In County Dublin as a whole, there are about 400 families.  In Tallaght, we understand that the numbers are about 140 families or one-tenth of the national total at most.  The Minister of State has had discussions with the manager about new proposals for traveller accommodation which has already covered Counties Kildare and Meath and we can expect developments in these areas as a result.</P>
    <P>While local authorities have made progress in accommodating travellers, their efforts have not, for various reasons matched the growth in the number of families, so that in the past four to six years the number of families on the roadside has greatly increased.  However, in 1983, for the first time in years, the number of families on the roadside reduced by over 100 due to stabilisation in the total number of families and an increase in the number accommodated.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at my Department to whom day to day responsibility in this area has been delegated has been keeping up to date with the situation by meeting with various managers, and encouraging them to bring forward additional accommodation proposals.  Some months ago he met the Dublin City and County Manager and was fully briefed on the situation and on the proposals to deal <Col N="1552" /> with the families on the roadside in the Dublin area &mdash; by far the largest concerntration of families.  In April of this year, Dublin County Council approved a programme of 12 halting sites in the county, in addition to the five approved in 1982, making a total of 17 sites at different locations in the county.  With each site capable of accommodating ten families, the county council reckon that their programme should meet the accommodation needs of those families in the area who do not wish to be housed in the conventional manner.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that either standard or group housing provides the best solution to the problem of travellers on the roadside and, in fact, the great majority of those accommodated have been housed by local authorities as part of their normal housing programmes. However, many travelling families are either not yet ready for housing, or do not want to be housed, and have expressed a preference either for halting sites or, simply, to be left as they are. While settled people are often opposed to having halting sites near their homes, it is unfortunate that the high standard and quality of the sites now proposed is not properly understood.  For a start, each site is designed to have not more than ten pitches.  Sanitary services blocks, public lighting, water and hardstands are all to be provided to a high standard. There is also to be an effective caretaking service.</P>
    <P>The Ballycoolin site is the only site which the county council have formally submitted to my Department, and approval to seek tenders for this was given last month.  The cost of this particular proposal is substantial, but rather than hold it up, I approved of it on the basis that the county council's future proposals will involve a more economic layout, without sacrificing basic standards. I believe this is possible.  I understand that the county council are in the process of preparing proposals for some of the other permanent sites for submission to my Department in the near future, and there will be no delay in examining these in the Department.</P>
    <P>The question of national policy for <Col N="1553" /> travellers has, of course, been under consideration by a task force of Ministers of State, who have put forward their recommendations to the Government.  I expect that the Government will be making decisions on these in the near future, and the House will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this stage on that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties which face Dublin County Council in resolving the Tallaght situation, which has now developed into a series of ugly confrontations. I would appeal to all concerned to review the positions they have adopted and to adopt a more rational approach. No one can expect that a situation which grew up in Tallaght over a period of years can be resolved overnight.  It is unfortunate, to say the least of it, that action was not taken sooner to provide accommodation for the traveller families concerned but it is ironic that, when the county council have just decided on a programme of permanent sites, and on temporary arrangements, progress should be impeded by the kind of action we have seen in recent days.</P>
    <P>It has long been a matter of public knowledge that the county council were intending to provide a temporary site in the Tallaght area to accommodate as many families as possible from the by-pass in order to meet the requirements arising from court rulings.  I understand that the county council had intended to commence development work on the temporary site last week but, following local objections, deferred this to see if some agreement or compromise was possible. Unfortunately, I am given to understand that these efforts at agreement <Col N="1554" /> or compromise have not, so far, been successful.  I have seen reports that local residents are adamant that not even one family will be allowed on to the site. If this is true, it is a very sad situation and one which in my view cannot be tolerated. While the county council have not yet, to my knowledge, decided when to proceed with the development of the site, I know they are still open to compromise on the number of families to be accommodated, and I would very much hope that local objectors will withdraw their objections even at this stage.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious situation when people already housed assume a right to exercise a veto on who may, or may not be accommodated.  The county council have had a bad press in the past because of the number of families on the roadside in their area.  It is disappointing that when the county council try to do something about it they are prevented from doing so.  If other local communities adopted a similar attitude, and were allowed to do this successfully, there would be no programme to accommodate travellers and a sharp increase in the number of families on the roadside.  Imagine what an outcry there would then be, not just from the travellers but from local communities.  I do not have a direct function in the Tallaght affair.  It is a matter for the county council to decide how to proceed, but they have my full support in any action they take to ensure that the travellers are reasonably accommodated, that the by-pass is opened and that the fears and concerns of the settled community in the Tallaght area are removed.</P>

      <P>In many Community countries all adult citizens must have official identity cards for internal use in their own country. Where such cards are already held it is clearly an advantage to be able to use them, as provided for in Council Directive 73/148 of 21 May 1973, for entry to other Community countries.  In Ireland however there is no internal identity card requirement.  The question of such a system or requirement would be one for the Minister for Justice.  In the absence of such an internal identity card system there is no card that citizens already have that could be used by them to travel to other countries.</P>
      <P>The system the Deputy suggests would therefore involve the introduction of a special card for travel purposes, valid for Community countries only.  Such a system, however simple the format of the card, would duplicate the passport system including the necessary checks on identity and parental consent.  It would introduce two kinds of passport, one valid for all countries and a second valid only for Community countries, which could be inconvenient and confusing.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the amounts mentioned in the question represent the fortnightly figures in respect of a retirement pension paid to the taxpayer and the tax <Col N="1361" /> deducted therefrom.  The amounts specified are correct.</P>
      <P>In addition to the retirement pension the taxpayer is also in receipt of a social welfare contributory old age pension. Both pensions are chargeable to income tax.  In accordance with standard practice, the aggregate tax-free allowances under PAYE for the current year, 1984-85, are reduced to take account of the social welfare pension which is paid gross, the tax attributable to it being recovered under PAYE from the retirement pension by means of the restricted tax-free allowances.  The aggregate tax-free allowances have also been restricted to effect collection of part of an underpayment of tax which had arisen for the year 1982-83.  The balance of the 1984-85 tax-free allowances is available for set off against the retirement pension.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to determine whether the taxpayer is in receipt of all the tax-free allowances to which he is entitled as he has not submitted fully completed returns of income for a number of years. In the circumstances, the inspector of taxes will issue a 1984-85 return of income to him for completion.  This will enable the appropriate amount of tax-free allowances for that year to be determined.</P>

      <P>A minimum of one child care worker for every four children is the recommended general guideline for children's homes. However, in agreeing staffing complements for the individual homes, health boards have been advised to have regard to the type of service provided by homes, the particular needs of the children catered for and normal rates of occupancy. There are obvious cases where a ratio higher than the general guideline would be justified e.g. in the case of homes catering for severely emotionally disturbed children.  There are no standard formulae on degrees of variation and health boards have been asked to consider each home on its own merits.</P>

      <P>The Midland Health Board have given top priority to three projects in the acute hospital area: the provision of a second theatre, mortuary and autopsy room at Tullamore where construction work is now in progress; the overall development of Mullingar General Hospital which is scheduled to start later this year at a cost of £8 million; and the establishment of an elective orthopaedic centre at the District Hospital, Athlone, which is currently in the early stages of planning.  I might add also that earlier this year I approved a grant of £300,000 for the up grading of the theatres and wards at Mullingar Hospital in advance of the main development. In the light of these developments, and given the present financial situation, there is no possibility that the new medical unit at Tullamore Hospital can be provided in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>The entitlement of an applicant to pay-related benefit with flat-rate unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that the sum of weekly flat-rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and income tax refunds may not exceed 85 per cent of the average net weekly earnings of the claimant.  The method of calculating the 85 per cent is prescribed by regulations.</P>
      <P>The person concerned made a claim to unemployment benefit on 8 November 1983.  The 85 per cent limit for pay-related benefit purposes applicable in his case is £60 weekly based on his earnings in Ireland during the 1983-1984 tax year. However as he is in receipt of flat-rate unemployment benefit at £82.50 weekly and as this amount exceeds the 85 per cent limit in his case, he is not entitled to pay-related benefit.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was employed in Libya from June 1983 to November 1983 and his earnings from this employment have not been taken into account in the calculation of his 85 per cent limit. Earnings derived from employment outside the EEC area are not normally included in the calculation of the 85 per cent limit.  He has stated that his contract of employment in Libya was with an Irish company and that PAYE and PRSI deductions were made by his employer during the period in question.  He has been requested to furnish further details of the employment and when these are received his claim to pay-related benefit will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Citizens of the countries in question are amongst those required to obtain visas beforehand as a condition of being permitted to land in the State. Where a person arrives without a visa and asks permission to stay for a short or long period, he is questioned by the immigration service who because such applications are relatively rare are usually able to consult the Department in the matter.  A decision to admit a citizen of one of the countries concerned who had not got a visa would be taken only if there were some very exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>As stated in my speech in the course of the adjournment debate on 12 June 1984 it is necessary to distinguish between persons who are applicants for political asylum and other persons who for one reason or another would prefer to live in this country or in some other specified country though I would emphasise that the category into which a person comes does not depend in any way on whether he uses the phrase &ldquo;political asylum&rdquo; or words to like effect.</P>
      <P>It has never been the practice and it would be quite impractical for the authorities here to allow transit passengers to remain in the country simply on the chance that an application by them to be admitted to a third country might in due course be approved by the authorities in the third country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards political asylum the criterion applied is taken from Article I of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) and is whether the person has a &ldquo;well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion&rdquo;.  While I could not give any commitment on the matter since circumstances can vary so much, I can say that if a <i>prima facie</i> case exists the decision on <Col N="1380" /> such an application would normally be taken by the Minister.</P>

      <P>On 7 May 1982 the EC Commission submitted to the Council of Ministers proposals for a directive concerning temporary work.  These proposals were considered at a Council of Social Affairs Ministers held on 10 December 1982, but the member states failed to reach agreement on the proposals.  Subsequently, the EC Commission decided to amend its proposals in the light of the reservations expressed by the council on the original proposals and the opinions of the European <Col N="1385" /> Parliament and the economic and social committee.  A revised text was submitted by the EC Commission to the council on 11 April 1984 but to date these proposals have not been discussed.  I am not in a position to indicate if and when the latest proposals will be adopted by the council.</P>
