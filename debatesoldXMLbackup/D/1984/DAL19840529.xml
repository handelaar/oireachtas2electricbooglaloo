    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will discuss with President Reagan the possibility of relaxing immigration laws for Irish citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me, nor is it the practice, to disclose publicly details of all matters to be discussed with visiting heads of State or Government.  In my discussions with President Reagan I will, of course, cover in the mormal way matters of mutual interest to our two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach tell the House what is the present quota of Irish citizens who can go into America legally and take up permanent employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that arises directly.  I am not sure that I could give the Deputy the details.  The number of immigration visas issued over the past four years has been of the order of 600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that many suitably qualified people would like to go to America and take up <Col N="2214" /> permanent employment and they are unable to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that that is probably the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall having made a statement when he was in the United States recently that he would like to see the quota increased?  Can he state to what quota he was referring?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Begley asked a question to which the Taoiseach failed to give an answer.  He asked what is the quota.  Surely there is no such thing as any quota.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I did not answer Deputy Begley's question in that form.  There is a number issued which is static at around 600 rather than a specific national quota.  The fact is that the numbers involved are around 600 each year, <i>de facto.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>To what quota was the Taoiseach referring at his press conference in New York?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recall using that phraseology.  If I did, it would have been an inaccurate way of describing it in the strict legal sense.  I am concerned with the limitations which exist on the number of Irish people going there, because there would be value in a somewhat larger number of Irish people being allowed to go, many of whom could gain experience which they could bring back to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach like me to send him the cutting from the newspaper to refresh his memory on his statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always glad to have my memory refreshed.  Let us be <Col N="2215" /> quite clear on the position.  I am concerned that it would be desirable that the number of Irish citizens who are able to go on immigrant visas to the United States should be somewhat larger than has been the case.  They could gain experience which would be useful to us in many cases when they came back subsequently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism whether he is aware that a society (details supplied) which is registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts issued letters to potential investors before it went into liquidation stating that the security of its investors is guaranteed by investing in a group with assets in excess of £7 million: that within its group, there are two deposit-taking institutions, which are registered under Government-enacted legislation; and that the State-appointed registrar is responsible for ensuring that every society operates in a manner which is consistent with the provision of maximum security for depositors; whether he is satisfied that such societies should use the fact of their registration as an industrial and provident society in such a way as might mislead members of the public that their investment is in some way guaranteed or secured by the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is satisfied with the legislation governing industrial and provident societies in view of the fact that the management of a society (details supplied) now in liquidation, positively encouraged some investors to change their investment from the registered society to an associated company, some few months before going into liquidation, as a result of which, some depositors may be seriously discriminated against, and may have lost all or the greater part of their investments, while the depositors who switched their investment, having been advised to do so, to an associated company, may be re-paid in full; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is satisfied that the type of advertising engaged in by some societies, registered <Col N="2218" /> under the industrial and provident societies legislation and, specifically, if he is aware that a society (details supplied) is now in liquidation, distributed a publication which did not contain any clear indication that it was published by that society although the publication described the activities of it as being surely one of Ireland's success stories, and that in the present economic climate, it was indeed a pleasure to see such an outstanding home-based achievement; if he is satisfied that such advertising by a provident society should take place; and if he will consider introducing legislation obliging all provident societies to clear in advance of publication their advertising with the registrar of provident societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to amend the existing legislation governing deposit-taking industrial and provident societies in view of the fact that the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1978</P>
      <P> (a)  remove the scope for the establishment of any new deposit-taking societies and</P>
      <P>(b)  provided for the winding down of the then existing societies. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the points made by the Deputy in his questions in relation to advertising by societies, it should be noted that the Act of 1978 provides that no society could advertise for the purpose of raising funds or accepting deposits except under and in accordance with the written permission of the registrar of friendly societies.  Since the enactment of the legislation in November 1978, a number of societies, including the society which is the subject of the Deputy's questions, sought the permission of the registrar to advertise but all such applications were refused.  The controls requested by the Deputy are already embodied in legislation and are being actively enforced. I should also point out that the letter to which the Deputy refers in one of his questions was not issued by the named <Col N="2219" /> society but rather by an associated company. Similarly, the give-away newspaper referred to by the Deputy was published by the group of which the society is a member and not by the society itself. This once again demonstrates the lengths to which societies went to thwart the legislation.</P>
    <P>The transfer of depositors funds to an associate company referred to by the Deputy involved a debenture issue by the associate.  The matter of the debenture issue was referred by the registrar of friendly societies to the Director of Public Prosecutions and in the circumstances it would not be proper for me to make any further comment on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's reply in so far as the last point is concerned. If that matter is still continuing it is obviously difficult for him to comment on it.  However, in relation to the advertising point I raised in Question No. 2, will the Minister ensure that in future any society registered under the Act will not use any device such as the formation of an associated company or other society through which it could advertise or issue letters like the letter I referred to in my question?  It has the effect of seriously misleading the public if these societies use their registration under the Act to suggest that in some way the State is a guarantor or an additional form of security to their operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two questions involved, the question of the implied guarantee by the State and the question of advertising at all.  As to advertising by the mechanism used, which was through an associate company, I have to say that it is regrettable that it was not possible to sustain a prosecution in that case.  On reading the report on the matter my first reaction was that such a prosecution should have been issued but I understand that the legislation, while it is generally quite effective, does not allow a prosecution where it was not the society itself that placed the advertisement.  If a review of the legislation is to take place that will be one matter that will, obviously, be <Col N="2220" /> taken into account but it is unlikely that one would promote legislation just for that sole purpose.  As far as the other matters are concerned, I should like to tell the House that I understand that the advertisement in question was rather cleverly worded.  There was nothing said which could be strictly interpreted as being untrue.  However, misleading advertisements of any kind are capable of being pursued criminally as a result of the Consumer Information Act.  The Director of Consumer Affairs could be asked to investigate any allegation of misleading or untrue advertising of this or any other product or service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that if a review of the legislation is to take place he will do something but I should like to know if he envisages such a review taking place?  If so, will the Minister correct the weaknesses that have been shown to exist in the existing legislation which allowed this matter to go on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated that I do not envisage such a review taking place for a number of reasons.  Most of these societies have either been wound up or are in the process of being wound up. They were given a five-year life cycle commencing in 1978 with the result that most of them will be gone within a relatively short time.  There was a delay as a result of constitutional actions and so on &mdash; the Deputy may be familiar with them &mdash; but they have only a limited time to run.  To sponsor a whole <i>corpus</i> of new legislation just to cope with a few loose ends would be hard to justify in terms of parliamentary time.  For absolute clarity in respect of my last response to Deputy Molony I should like to say that the Director of Consumer Affairs examined the matter at my request.  He said that while there were grounds for believing that the circulars were misleading in view of the collapse of the group in question he saw no point in pursuing a prosecution of a group that was no longer trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole point. Is the Minister aware that there is one individual who was associated with all <Col N="2221" /> those companies?  The Minister has said that he regrets a prosecution did not take place but would he accept that it reflects seriously on the system of registration we have for these societies?  Will he agree that it reflects seriously on the legislation governing the registration of these societies that the law can be abused?  Will the Minister agree that notwithstanding the fact that this was done through an associate company that nevertheless the deposit holders who lost thousands of pounds do not draw such fine distinctions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the use of the loophole provided in the Central Bank Act, 1971, which allowed deposit-taking institutions to be established as industrial and provident societies and thereby escape the controls of the Central Bank Act is an abuse.  That was recognised by the Oireachtas in 1978 when legislation was enacted, one provision of which was to wind up all these societies within five years.  There is no dispute about what the Deputy has said and there has not been any dispute by either side of the House since 1978.  It is simply a question of sorting out the remaining problems and have them all wound up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider introducing legislation whereby any advertising either directly in the media or to individuals by way of mass circulation letters by any provident or friendly society should be approved by the Registrar of Friendly Societies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a provision, as I indicated, whereby a society to undertake an advertisement must get the consent of the registrar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>What about an associated company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to answer the Deputy's full question.  The societies must get permission and I accepted that in response to the Deputy's first supplementary. There was a certain hiatus in <Col N="2222" /> the legislation in that that did not extend to associate companies.  I also said in response to Deputy Reynolds that while I could see that in theory there was justification for introducing legislation to close that loophole, because we are winding up this subject area questions must be asked as to whether promoting such legislation to fix up the few small remaining loopholes would be the best use of parliamentary time.  However, I am prepared to have the matter reviewed further but I would not hold out any great hopes that we will introduce legislation. The best answer is to enforce the legislation as it stands as rigorously as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the money of existing or future depositors will be safe in the timescale it will take to wind up the rest of those societies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Repeatedly in this House warnings have been given to people that they should not invest in these societies.  Since 1978 they have been given the indication that it is not wise or prudent to invest in these societies because the same guarantees do not exist in respect of the safety of people's deposits as exist in respect of deposit-taking institutions which come within the provisions of the 1971 Central Bank Act.</P>

The meeting was an important stage in our continuing efforts to secure new Ford investment in manufacturing in Cork.</P>
      <P>We presented to Fords a number of product areas which we expect to be of interest to them and outlined the attractiveness of this country, and of the Cork area, as a location for investment in these high technology areas.

    <P>In relation to the second part of the Deputies' question, the House will be aware that the Government established a high level expert working group to advise on the impact of measures being taken to provide jobs in the Cork area, the action needed to provide additional new jobs and all action possible to safeguard existing viable jobs.  The decisions of the Government on the recommendations of the working group were announced on Friday, 11 May 1984.  The principal decisions related to the designation of Ringaskiddy Port and Industrial Estate as a free zone, the designation of Ringaskiddy Industrial Estate and three Cork city industrial estates for higher IDA grants and the new allocation of £4.9 million for infrastructural work in the greater Cork area.  In addition, Bord Gáis Éireann will supply natural gas directly to companies on the Ringaskiddy Industrial Estate at oil-related prices, Cork Harbour Commissioners will now award a contract for the construction of a deep water wharf at Ringaskiddy, an industrial waste disposal facility will be provided at or near Ringaskiddy, a new instrument landing system will replace the existing facility at Cork Airport and special emphasis will be placed on manpower training and development and the <Col N="2224" /> further development of food processing, electronics and services sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, generally speaking, a high-level of satisfaction was expressed by the representative people I <Col N="2225" /> met in Cork with the Government task force and the decisions taken on it.  I think I can say that in Cork or anywhere without fear of justifiable criticism or contradiction.  Secondly, in so far as the quantification is concerned, I was asked that very question at the press conference when the matter was being announced. I said that we did not propose to quantify the number of jobs to be created because as a result of this task force jobs were not being created by Government edict.  The Government were creating the conditions within which Cork people themselves could by using the various facilities provided, particularly higher levels of grant for small industry, come forward with projects which would create jobs. The number of jobs will not depend upon Government action alone but on the response in Cork to the conditions created as a result of the Government decisions on this task force.  That is the appropriate, modern and sensible way to deal with an unemployment problem. The Government alone do not and cannot provide jobs on their own.  A response is required and I am quite confident that we will get that response in Cork because I have noticed in my recent visits there a very high level of optimism on the part of people who are interested in setting up industries and other service employment in Cork.  I believe that we have created the conditions in which that optimism can have full expression.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is vitally important that we have some very positive information of his meeting with Ford management in the US?  We want to know the possibilities of continued employment in the Ford plant. What efforts has he made to secure the manufacture of a component part at the Ford plant?  Regarding the second part of the question, I must take the Minister to task when he says that he is looking for a response from the people of Cork arising out of the task force.  Last week I asked him to make available the full text of that report to interested people in the Cork area such as public representatives, trade unions and the business community. Finally, does the Minister not agree <Col N="2226" /> that the areas of employment recommended by the Government from the task force report do not give immediate employment which was the main object of the task force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the various implications in the Deputy's question.  As far as the task force were concerned, the intention all along was that they would do a number of positive things to improve the infrastructure and the conditions for employment creation in Cork.  They have done that and, contrary to the presentation of Cork opinion by Deputy Wyse &mdash; which I believe is inaccurate &mdash; there will be and already is a very positive response in the city and county of Cork to these measures and I believe that we will see many Cork people coming forward with industrial ideas who would not have done so were it not for the improved provisions that have been made as a result of the task force report.  Secondly, I have already dealt with the question of publication last week and I do not propose to go back on it again.  Thirdly, as far as Fords are concerned we were presenting them with a number of options in respect of new products in the rapidly developing application of electronics in the automobile, something which is developing at an indeterminate speed at this stage.  Many of the products that Fords might be interested in locating in Ireland are not ones for which the market is necessarily ready this year.  It might be three or four years before the world Ford operation would have use for these products.  We are discussing with them a number of possibilities, not just one, so it is quite impossible for Fords to tell me that they are going to put in a plant at the end of this year, next year or at any particular time.  It depends on the market and the product that they select.  However, I will say that the atmosphere of the meeting in Fords was extremely positive.  I think we succeeded in opening their minds very much to the possibilities that exist in the electronics industry in Ireland, particularly in Cork. I feel that we have made a great deal of progress with Fords as a result of this <Col N="2227" /> high level meeting and I intend to follow up this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At this moment it is possible for people to begin planning industrial projects that could be located in the industrial estates and thereby qualify for the higher levels of grants.  The consent of the EEC is necessary before a designation can take effect and the higher level of grant become available but I am confident that work is already taking place in that direction. I have had discussions with IDA regional people in Cork to this effect.  We are already witnessing the response and I am confident that these efforts will prove to be significantly successful.  It would be my hope that the Deputy, rather than denigrate these initiatives, would seek to give them every support possible and would use his considerable influence to encourage people to have industrial ideas to contact the IDA with a view to availing of these unique facilities that are being made available in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The present situation at Verolme is that, in the absence of further shipbuilding orders and because of the rundown of work on the patrol vessel for the Department of Defence, the company are attempting to reduce their workforce of 670 employees by about 250.  This very unfortunate state of affairs was one of the factors which the Government took into consideration in their recent initiation of special measures for the Cork region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government policy in relation to the future of Verolme was decided in May of 1983 and set out in my speech in the House on 1 June 1983.  In that speech, I indicated that, in the absence of any prospect of further shipbuilding orders being available from either the Department of Defence or the State shipping companies, Government policy could only consist of assisting the yard to win orders on the open market by offering it the maximum production subsidies acceptable to the European Commission.  It is a regrettable reflection of the state of the world shipbuilding market, both in terms of the small number of orders available and the cut-throat competition for those orders that are available, that Verolme had been unable to win orders even when quoting on the basis of production subsidies of as much as 30 per cent.  Regarding action to safeguard the future of the company, if the Deputy has in mind guaranteeing the future of the company, there is no such <Col N="2232" /> action that can be taken.  Even the placing of a further State order would merely provide temporary relief and would not alter the fundamental fact that the shipbuilding market is in a deep recession from which it is not expected to emerge for several years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not read this reply with the same gusto as was evident in the speech he made a few moments ago.  Has he the figures as to what was the original workforce at Verolme, what the figure is today and what he expects it to be at the end of the year? It is obvious from the Minister's reply that the Government have no intention of placing with the yard further orders which could provide temporary relief. They had the opportunity of placing such an order but failed to do so.  Is the Minister saying in effect that the future of the yard is very bleak?  Can he say what employment prospects there will be after October next when I understand work will finish on the Department of Defence vessel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered almost the entirety of that question.  The figures which the Deputy asked for are, 1,070, 670 and now a proposed reduction of 250.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be inclined to accept figures produced from the Government side.  In response to an earlier question the Minister said that the priority of the Government was to safeguard existing jobs in the Cork area but in reply to this question he has contradicted that statement because it is obvious that the Government have no intention of carrying through any such safeguard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that question.  Government policy on this matter was outlined on 1 June 1983 in a speech made in the House. I indicated that, in the absence of any further shipbuilding orders from the Department of Defence or the State shipping company, Government policy could only consist of assisting the company to win order on the open market by offering production subsidies acceptable to the Commission.  As I indicated, these can be as high as 30 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there will be a reduction of 600 in the workforce and that at a press conference in Cork, when asked to quantify the number of jobs in relation to relief for the whole Cork area, he gave a figure of 400?  We are losing 600 jobs now.</P>

Beyond that I am not prepared to make any statement because it depends on the number of orders for shipbuilding and ship repair.  As far as the job targets of the task force are concerned, I made it clear in Cork that we would not put figures on the total package because it depended on the response.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if the Government have decided to invest a further £80 to £90 million in Irish Steel; if he will make a statement on its present and future viability; and if the EEC have agreed to the new programme of aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that on 29 June 1983 the European Commission gave its decision on the application of the Government for approval to invest up to £89 million in Irish Steel Limited in 1984.  That decision indicates that the proposed aid is not compatible with the orderly functioning of the common market and may not, therefore, be paid to the company unless the Commission is satisfied, on the basis of information supplied to it by 31 January 1984, that the company can return to financial viability by the end of 1985.  Information to enable the Commission to decide whether in its opinion Irish Steel would be financially viable after the end of 1985 without any further State aid, given an investment in 1984 of £89 million, was forwarded to the Commission in January 1984.  Discussions with the Commission arising from that information are continuing and it is not expected that the Commission will have decided on the viability question before mid-June 1984.</P>
      <P>The financial viability of Irish Steel depends on the investment by the Government of up to £89 million in 1984 and on the ability of the company to continue to increase the volume of its sales, reduce production costs and obtain realistic prices for its products.  It is expected that the Government will decide in the near future on the question of investing up to £89 million in the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We had lengthy discussions with the Commission regarding the viability of Irish Steel.  The most recent meeting was held between Deputy Collins and Commissioner Andriessan. As a result of that it was jointly decided to recommission the consultants to study the matter further and deal with outstanding matters of argument between the Government and the Commission about the viability of Irish Steel.  I expect that the report will be furnished on 8 June to the Government and the Commission. A decision could then be taken.  It is important that we have all available information on the company before making a decision of this kind which has major implications for us and for European steel policy, because many steel plants in Europe have been closed as a result of pressure from the Commission. It is against this background that we are seeking consent from the Commission to make a further injuction of funds into our steel plants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultancy study is a serious exercise.  It was initiated by the Commission but we are agreeable to it.  My understanding is that Irish Steel are meeting their sale projections and exceeding them but the price realised is not as good as was projected by Sofresid. This is partly due to the state of the steel <Col N="2237" /> market and partly due to the commendable sales strategy of the company.  They are quite successful at winning orders abroad but the question to be decided is whether these orders will realise enough money to assure us of viability.</P>

You cannot give a premises to a company who do not have a financially viable structure, which they have to have to obtain a grant. I said that if a viable project was decided upon by the IDA in consultation with the company, then the premises would be available.

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I quote from the Official Report of Thursday, 24 May 1984.  I said:</P>
      <P>and there is sectarian advice from outside the Civil Service being brought into the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>and later:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2296" /> I will back it up if I am given the opportunity.</P>
    <P>First of all, I want to quote from the Official Report some points of my philosophy in this matter when I was Minister for Education:</P>
    <P>As far as my philosophy is concerned, there are citizens of this country and there are children citizens, all of whom are treated equally and I deprecate and condemn the introduction of sectarianism, because there will be no &ldquo;factory of grievances&rdquo; in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>That was at column 1605 of Volume 318. Later, at column 1609 I said:</P>
    <P>Again I must say that I deprecate strongly that the Fine Gael Party are making a party-political matter out of religious issues.</P>
    <P>This philosophy I outlined in detail to a meeting of Comh-Comhairle Corcaigh at a meeting in Cork which was attended and addressed by such varied and representative public figures as the late Val Jago, the Reverend Michael Hurley, SJ and Mr. Gerald Goldberg.  They approved it and commended me for it. The Leader of the Opposition, now Taoiseach, came into this House and, on an occasion when convention does not allow a reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, many of us listened with some astonishment on the last occasion to what purported <Col N="2297" /> to be a personal explanation by the Minister for Education.

And the present Minister for Education had the affrontery to turn up to unveil a plaque there on Monday.  I received the group one month after I took office in August 1977 and agreed to sanction the establishment of the Dalkey school at that time.

      <P>As quoted in <i>The Irish Times,</i> dated 20 December 1979, 20 per cent of my meetings in the previous year had been with representatives of the minority.  The heinousness of making untrue statements for party political purposes, without regard to the reaction to them, when repeated in Belfast newspapers was borne in on me with special force during our studies at the Forum and when repeated to me by Belfast friends. The advice of this Fine Gael Policy Committee, if still as sectarian minded as the Fine Gael leader showed in his speech, is one this country could do without and is the advice which on Thursday last I decried.  I was denied an opportunity to expand them, although when Minister for Education I provided two successive Fridays for debate on the Education Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hussey, Minister for Education, <Col N="2302" /> in an unbalanced and hysterical reaction, personalised everything.  I am telling the Minister to check with, to name but a few, the Church of Ireland, the Methodists, the Presbyterians in Dalkey, Tubbercurry, County Sligo, Cootehill, Bailieborough, the Royal School, County Cavan, Drum, County Monaghan, Glengara Park, Kilkenny College, with Dean Griffin of the Cathedral Choir School and the Church of Ireland Bishop of Cork as to my care and concern for minorities.  I am claiming no credit.  They are free and equal citizens.</P>
    <P>I make no party political point of it.  A personality was mentioned by the Minister for Education in this connection.  I never met this man.  I had two contacts with his school, one to recommend the pupils from a certain family for acceptance in the school.  I am glad to record that they were accepted.  The other was when I gave instructions in my Department that pupils of the minority religion should be provided with transport to that school even if it meant modifying the regulations.</P>
    <P>I am not sure of the motives of the Minister for Education in the matter.  She knows that I have a substantial number of the minority religions, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian and Methodist in my constituency.  I am not convinced that her party political posturing will impress them.  She also has in her constituency a substantial minority, particularly in the Greystones area.  In the recent town commissioners election the Fine Gael vote dropped from 49 per cent to 28 per cent.  As they say Verb. Sap.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The high level of unemployment and particularly the high level of unemployment among our young people continues to be the single most important problem facing us at this time.  It is a problem which bears down on the community as a whole without divide as between urban or rural or between the young and the not so young.  All are affected in some way by this slow moving cloud which has been hanging over this country and many others since the recession commenced. This is a problem which will not go away unless we work hard at it in order to remove it.  There is not just one solution. The causes of unemployment are varied and complex and therefore a number of initiatives on a number of fronts will be necessary, firstly, to alleviate the problem and, secondly, to remove it.</P>
      <P>While many measures are under way, aimed at creating and maintaining employment as part of the Government's overall strategy, we must also address ourselves to the question of how the available jobs might be shared among those seeking employment.  Measures such as early retirement, job-sharing and temporary work have been suggested at both national and international level but, it seems that the most promising movement lies in the area of reducing normal working hours and limiting overtime working.  This is an area of work sharing which has been under consideration for some time at EEC level; indeed, a draft Council Recommendation on the reduction of working time and limiting overtime working is currently in the course of preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House represents <Col N="2310" /> one such initiative.  It is not a panacea.  It is but a step which I consider will take us in the right direction.  In my Second Stage speech in the Seanad, I referred to a study of overtime working which had been carried out by University College, Galway, in 1979-80.  The purpose of the study was to establish if, by reducing overtime, extra employment could be created.  The study concluded that extra jobs could follow a reduction in overtime working.  It is estimated that if 20 per cent of the overtime worked were replaced by extra employment, as many as 12,000 jobs could be created in the non-agricultural sector.  Since this study took place, the recession has deepened, but a 1982 study &mdash; also undertaken by University College, Galway &mdash; confirmed that, despite the recession, specific cases still existed across industries where there was scope for increased employment on the basis of reduced overtime.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately there is little statistical information available to us on the level of overtime being worked at present, but it is highly likely that a significant amount of overtime is still being worked in some areas.  Such overtime should, especially in the present economic climate, be converted into extra jobs, where possible. This is particularly so in the case of continuous excessive overtime.  The persistent and systematic working of overtime in some undertakings cannot be justified in a situation where many remain idle. The Bill before the House affords us an opportunity to determine our attitude to this question.</P>
    <P>The Bill applies to all workers except for those in firms primarily engaged in the transport of persons or goods, those in essential services, fishermen, residential caretakers and close relatives.  The Conditions of Employment Acts, which were enacted in the thirties, applied only to industrial, shop and hotel workers. They fixed the maximum normal working week at 48 hours for industrial and shop workers and 56 hours for hotel workers. Conditions have fortunately changed since then and the maximum normal working week &mdash; normally established by collective agreements between employers and workers &mdash; is now generally 40 <Col N="2311" /> hours.  The Hours of Work Bill also establishes the normal working week at a maximum of 40 hours.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that there are some categories of workers to whom the Bill does not apply.  These exceptions are listed in section 2 of the Bill.  However, should it become necessary to include a class or classes of workers who do not at present come within the scope of the Bill, the Minister may, having consulted with representatives of workers and employers, make an order under this section, bringing them within the Bill's provisions. Such an order would require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 4 and section 5 are the main provision of the Bill.  Section 4 fixes the normal working week at a maximum of 40 hours or, where weekly hours vary, at an average of 40 hours.  It has been suggested that 40 hours is too high, and that the working week should be reduced to a maximum of 35 hours, or a figure between 35 and 40 hours.  If we were to reduce working hours to that figure, difficulties could be created for some employers by adversely affecting the efficient operation of their businesses or, perhaps, adding to their operating costs. Such a step could put our industry at a disadvantage in relation to our EEC and other international competitors.  The statutory normal working week in most western European countries is 40 hours or more, with the exception of France, where it is 39 hours.  In fact, a survey of ILO member states published this year shows that almost all the countries surveyed had a statutory normal working week of at least 40 hours.  I would like to point out, however, that there is nothing in this Bill which would prevent employers and workers from negotiating shorter working hours.  The Bill lays down maximum working hours; it does not set out to fix minimum working hours.</P>
    <P>Section 5 limits the amount of overtime that can be worked at a maximum of 40 hours in any period of four consecutive weeks, or 100 hours in any period of 12 consecutive weeks.  Both section 4 and section 5 allow for the averaging of normal hours and overtime, ensuring that <Col N="2312" /> the Bill is sufficiently flexible to take account of areas where particular difficulties might occur, for example, in industries which are subject to seasonal fluctuations in their activities.  Additional flexibility is provided by section 3 and section 6.  Section 3 enables the Minister to exclude, by order, any class or classes of workers, from the provisions of the Bill.  Before making such an order, he will be obliged to consult representatives of employers and workers.  It will also require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Regulations permitting the working of additional overtime by a class or classes of workers are provided for in section 6.  Before making such regulations, the Minister will be required to consult representatives of employers and workers.  This section also enables the Minister to issue permits permitting individual firms to exceed the overtime limits where there is a significant decrease in the number of workers employed and available for work in the firm or a significant increase in the volume of work required to be done.</P>
    <P>Workers and employers may, under section 11, negotiate and give effect to arrangements for time-off in lieu of payment for overtime.  This provision will introduce flexibility into the area of compensation for overtime working.  The Bill does not specify any particular rates of payment for overtime.  I consider that this matter is best left for negotiation between employers and employees under our system of free collective bargaining.  The provisions in the Conditions of Employment Acts governing payment for overtime working will, however, still apply in relation to industrial, shop and hotel workers.  Overtime rates provided for in Employment Regulation Orders and in Registered Employment Agreements made under the Industrial Relations Acts will also continue to apply.</P>
    <P>Few, I believe, will disagree with the need for section 8.  This section is aimed at discouraging &ldquo;double employment&rdquo;.  It restricts the working hours of a person who has more than one employment to the maximum working hours allowed in respect of one employment.  Many <Col N="2313" /> people have expressed the opinion that the holding of more than one job should not be permitted when unemployment is at such a high level.  However, I believe that the approach towards the restriction of &ldquo;double jobbing&rdquo; adopted in this Bill represents the best way to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Agreements can be made under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977, to vary the maximum weekly hours permitted for young persons. The Act does not however, set limits, in such cases, to weekly working hours.  Section 7 of the Bill provides that any such agreements will not permit the employment of a young person in excess of 50 hours a week.</P>
    <P>The Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, contains a provision which gives the Minister for Labour power to prohibit the employment of female workers on particular industrial work or to fix the proportion of female workers employed on such work.  I consider this provision to be discriminatory and it is repealed by section 12 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of the Bill will be carried out by inspectors of the Department of Labour.  Section 9 provides the necessary powers for the inspectors to do this.  The remaining sections of the Bill are standard provisions relating to necessary definitions, penalties for offences, regulations for the keeping of records by employers, commencement order and the Short Title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives of this measure as set out in its long title is to facilitate the expansion of employment in the economy.  I am confident that, with the co-operation of all concerned, this objective will be achieved.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister's contribution is so subdued.  He seems to be uneasy in his estimation of what the Bill will achieve, and this is in stark contrast to his earlier optimism about 10,000 to 12,000 new jobs being created.  He now refers to the UCG report of 1979-80 which would, it was estimated, produce 12,000 jobs if only 20 per cent of the overtime worked was replaced by extra <Col N="2314" /> employment.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Unfortunately there is little statistical information available to us on the level of overtime being worked at present...</P>
      <P>It would appear as if the UCG study was able to come up with information some years ago and, though it is out of date, surely it would give the Minister the ability to make a reasonable estimate of how much extra employment this Bill would create.</P>
      <P>In the Seanad debate, as reported at column 1021 of the Official Report for 9 May last, the Minister said that it would be unrealistic to assume there would be extra employment even when the recession is over &mdash; that employment would not automatically increase.  I believe the Bill will make some contribution to the creation of additional employment but it is a far cry from the euphoria of 10,000 to 12,000 extra jobs.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives little hope to the thousands of boys and girls who will soon sit examinations to look to future employment opportunities.  They want a positive policy to provide opportunities for them to work.  The long-playing record which we have been hearing for years about budget deficits being the true cause of the problem has been finally smashed by the Minister of State today, but particularly in his Seanad contribution.</P>
      <P>However, on the basis that something is better than nothing, I give a qualified but lukewarm approval to the Bill, which is in sharp contrast to the euphoria we have been hearing of for years.  The Bill will create limited employment which will be welcomed by all.</P>
      <P>The Minister and everybody in the country are agreed that unemployment is the greatest single evil in the State.  It is a festering sore, a cancer which, if not treated urgently, can prove to be the death knell of democracy as we know it. There is very little in this Bill to suggest that the Government realise that.  We can only hope that urgent consideration will be given to the formulation of positive policies to get rid of this evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the statement that the Minister <Col N="2315" /> has taken the opportunity to repeal section 16 of the Conditions of Employment Act and therefore to abolish prohibition of females from certain employments. It was discriminatory and I congratulate the Minister on this move.</P>
    <P>I wonder why he chose ten hours of overtime to be permitted.  Does he consider 16 hours a minimum rather than a maximum number of hours to be worked in a week?  What would the position be if a worker was asked under section 4(2) (a) whether he or she wanted to work ten hours in one day and to do 70 hours the next week?  This would give an average of 40 hours a week, as the Minister said, and would raise the problem for many employers and workers of whether 30 hours in the second week would be subject to overtime rates.  Would he clarify the position of whether officers in local authorities or the Civil Service who might have other employments will be asked to resign from the local authorities or Civil Service or from their second jobs?  If they resign, will they be eligible for the normal benefits that apply to their posts?  Will the Minister clarify the position of the majority of local authority firemen, many of whom are in full-time employment? As the legislation now stands, they will not be eligible to work with a local authority as firemen.  I do not have to point out to the Minister that these men have built up during the years vast experience and expertise.  Their position should be seriously considered in the interest of public safety.  I ask him to consider placing part-time firemen in the categories mentioned in section 2 and to do this on Committee Stage rather than by order later on.</P>
    <P>This Bill, above all other Bills, will work only if there is full co-operation between employers and unions.  While the principle and the theory are impressive and welcome, the implementation of that principle in the hard and sometimes cruel market place will be most difficult. In a number of industries, notably those most vulnerable to imports from the cheap labour market areas of the world, substantial overtime is necessary if workers are to get a reasonable weekly <Col N="2316" /> wage.  A succession of taxes on employment means it is practicable and more attractive for employers to give overtime to their existing workforce rather than to recruit additional people.  The Minister knows the unions will seek to prevent any decrease in the standard of living of their members who, over the years, have seen overtime as an integral part of their earnings and, in many cases, essential to allow them to fulfil their many commitments with regard to mortgages, educational fees that are increasing constantly and the many other expenses they must meet every day.</P>
    <P>There is considerable disquiet with regard to this Bill.  Perhaps some of it is fear of the unknown, of what will happen when the Bill becomes law, but significantly it is a disquiet that is shared by the unions and the employers.  The list of amendments tabled by Senator Kirwan in the Seanad emphasise the disquiet of the ICTU with regard to this legislation.</P>
    <P>Employers also, particularly small employers, are at their wits' end struggling with VAT inspectors, PAYE inspectors, PRSI inspectors, with filling in many forms and coping with safety measures.  Now they will have to cope with yet another inspector.  They will have to open their books to another person.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any thoughts with regard to how many inspectors will be necessary?  Where will they be based and what will be their powers?  Under section 9(2)(3), can they search a private residence at night?  How does the Minister interpret the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; as used in section 9?  Subsection (1) states:</P>
    <P>An inspector may for the purposes of this Act do all or any of the following things:</P>
    <P>(a)  subject to the provisions of this section, enter at all reasonable times any premises or place where he has reasonable grounds for supposing that any worker to whom this Act applies is employed in work,...</P>
    <P>(d)  Require any person whom he has reasonable cause to believe...  </P>
    <P>What might appear reasonable to the <Col N="2317" /> inspector could be something entirely different to a householder if the inspector sees fit to call at what he might consider a reasonable time at night.</P>
    <P>There is disquiet among the unions and the employers about this Bill and this is shared by members of the public.  The Minister should have further discussions with interested parties because a law that cannot be implemented, that may lead to confrontation and that has not got the full co-operation of the unions and employers, is a bad law.  There should be further consideration of the various views expressed to obtain a consensus as far as possible with regard to this contentious and sensitive situation.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the Bill, fines of up to £600 in the case of a worker and £1,100 in the case of an employer could be commonplace if the Minister does not reconsider the matter.  Section 2 lists exemptions. The hotel industry relies heavily on functions and that industry will be severely restrained and affected by the provisions of this Bill.  I do not have to tell the Minister or the House of the dire straits of the hotel industry at the moment.  If he insists on going through with the Bill, will he consider, in conjunction with this measure, the introduction of legislation to enable employers, particularly in sensitive and vulnerable service industries, to take on part-time workers for a specified period?  They may have the right to do that already but nevertheless many employers are unhappy about taking on additional people in case they may have to keep them on after the specified period.</P>
    <P>The work ethic will be further diminished by this Bill.  When a worker is punished under the law of the land for working long hours, one must start to doubt the exhortations of the Government spokesmen to the Irish people to work harder to produce more.  Workers have been subjected to a torrent of advice and they have been admonished for seeking additional wages.  They have been told their only chance of getting a greater slice of the national cake is to increase the size of the cake.  Now they are told they will not be allowed to work the hours necessary to create that larger cake.  How can <Col N="2318" /> any Government while removing certain discriminations in the Bill against women now discriminate against children?  While adult workers are confined to a maximum of 100 hours overtime for 12 consecutive weeks the Minister permits children to work for 50 hours.  Their conditions should be the same as those of adults.</P>
    <P>While I can appreciate the motive behind the Bill I earnestly ask the Minister to think again on certain aspects.  In the light of the reservations expressed in the Seanad, by employers, by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, by me, and which I am sure will be repeated here, the Minister should consult with various organisations, unions and employers and change it as a result of those consultations. The result will be a much better Bill with more consensus which in an area as sensitive as this will mean better law and a wider acceptance of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In my approach to this Bill I am mindful of a number of things but before I detail them I would like to preface my remarks by saying that the caution with which I welcome the Bill and the points I put forward should not be misconstrued as opposition to the policies put forward by the Department of Labour to deal with the major problem of unemployment.  I know that the Minister of State has done valiant work in this area, the enterprise allowance scheme is a notable example of a major innovation in the creation of employment and is the type of positive thinking we require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment brings about social justification for many things which we would otherwise not see but we should not go overboard in this regard.  We know there are many changes in Europe in relation to work sharing and the length of the working week.  However, I hope to give details as to why Ireland is not in an identical situation and to pinpoint in specific sectors like small businesses &mdash; in which I have a special interest &mdash; and in agriculture how this legislation could be counterproductive, the net effect of which would bring about a greater burden, as previous employment legislation has done, and will have the opposite <Col N="2319" /> effect to employment creation.  The intentions behind the Bill are fine but the outcome in terms of operating this law will perhaps be quite different.  I understand that the origins of the Bill are the national understanding in 1980 and that for some time there have been numerous attempts to share the existing workload. It could be argued that the amendments in the Bill to the 1938 and 1936 Conditions of Work Acts relating to the industrial, hotel, retail and shopkeeping areas basically standardise and give statutory effect to what is already agreed work practices in operation in certain sectors.</P>
    <P>I have seen the UCG study in 1979, 1980 and 1982 but I accept that the Bill goes further than that.  We should review certain aspects of the Bill.  One would have to be sceptical of the UCG study because of the word &ldquo;if&rdquo; and I have doubt as to its practical application.  We can take many different points of view with regard to the principle of work sharing. From a philosophical point of view it is a gross interference in a person's individual right to work and also gross interference in free market activity.  I suppose it could be argued that this is socially justified, but we must realise that there are many young couples who have inordinate expense such as mortgages which they might not have later on in life and they have to do overtime to survive.  Moreover, I question the approach to the provision in relation to double employment. This is in a way a question of &ldquo;Do as I say and not as I do&rdquo; because many Members of this House hold down more than one job.  It does not only apply to politicians but to many other categories. We must realise that for various reasons people must do this.  I realise that the Bill does not outlaw double jobbing; it just gives the same hours of work criteria to the cumulative effect of double employment. Worksharing must be treated with extreme caution and the major reservation I have in that regard is its effect on competitiveness.  It is cheaper for an employer to get skilled employees to work longer hours than it is to recruit extra people.</P>
    <P>I know of a company which have a <Col N="2320" /> wages and salary bill of £14 million and they employ 1,000 people.  They have told me that this Bill will have a very negative effect on their work practice because there are extra costs in PRSI and administration.  The administrative manager is in extreme difficulty because this company are fighting off cheaper imports from Third World countries.  This legislation and EEC legislation does not affect Third World countries, but I will deal with that later.  There are limits to what this company can pay in wages and, even if they lose a share of the market, they cannot pay more.  Their only option is to demand.  The implementation of work sharing has the opposite and counterproductive effect to what was intended. I am probably in a minority in holding this view because many people prefer to take the opposite view but our primary concern must be employment creation.  If people who are in the business of creating jobs and sustaining employment say that this will have a restrictive effect their views should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I will give another example of the way similar legislation in the non-employment area has had a similar effect to what I believe this legislation will have.  This was in relation to the tacograph.  At the time it was thought that the tacograph would create more jobs because of the eight hour restriction on driving.  In one company it had the effect of reducing the staff by 11 lorry drivers.  In principle worksharing is socially justifiable but its operation in commercial practices could have a counterproductive effect.</P>
    <P>If we are to encourage employment creation measures &mdash; and I notice the Minister makes reference to this &mdash; I would have much more interest in and enthusiasm for job sharing where the hours, wages and taxation are split, thereby meeting the dual need of extra numbers employed without any extra cost to the employer.  There are people more suited to part-time work.  This whole area is one of a carrot and stick approach, this Bill having the stick approach only.  Job-sharing, carrying the necessary attractions, would be the right way of distributing the existing workload <Col N="2321" /> given that we have extreme numbers of people unemployed.</P>
    <P>Another area to be considered is that of early retirement.  I understand that if the retirement age was reduced from 65 to 60 it would automatically create a minimum of approximately 10,000 jobs, admittedly on a once-off basis.  I know there would be a cost on the pension side but that would be a worthy way of applying the carrot approach in the creation of jobs for young people.  In relation to work-sharing, in principle in times of deep recession and high unemployment it is justifiable to introduce practices that interfere with individual freedoms, with commercial practices, but we should not go as far as doing anything which would hinder our competitive position.  Because of the costs of energy in industry and our peripheral geographic location there is no doubt that we have a non-competitive base to start with.</P>
    <P>If we are to be positive about the creation of jobs then it must be realised that the single greatest reason there is not more employment is something quite specific which has been documented.  In the work of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses there were a number of individuals who told us that they could create 20 to 40 jobs in the morning if conditions were right.  Time and time again the one factor pinpointed was the employers' share of PRSI.  In that respect employers perceive correctly that they get nothing, no return, except in the event of non-payment of redundancy sums, whereas the employee is socially insured and does receive some perceivable benefit.  Basically it constitutes a tax on employment. Indeed, it will have been seen that there is a change of thinking in Europe in this respect, as illustrated by Mr. Nigel Lawson's most recent budget in the United Kingdom.  Tax relief should be related to the creation of employment and we should not interfere with anything which would erode our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>With regard to the exemption of certain classes of workers by ministerial order, one area that should be exempted is agriculture because that sector is unique in the form of employment it provides. The 40-hour, five day week &mdash; 9 to <Col N="2322" /> 5 p.m. or whatever &mdash; is not as mandatory or as common in agriculture as in other sectors and there is no doubt that seasonal factors come into it also.  For example, there are times of the year when cows are calving, silage is being cut, at harvest times and so on, all unique to agriculture.  The Minister might well contend that because of the average clause in the Bill, under which the ten hours per week or the 40 hours overtime per month can be averaged over the whole year, one can overcome that problem.  There is no point in saying to a cow: &ldquo;This is Sunday, you cannot calve today&rdquo;.  Neither is there any point in saying to sheep: &ldquo;You cannot break into the barley today because it is Saturday&rdquo;.  The agricultural sector is not amenable to these provisions, nor is the 40-hour week applicable.  It must be remembered also that low paid workers are more common in the agricultural sector, with many people earning only approximately £80 per week.  For various reasons there are many farmers not paying the full minimum agricultural wage, basically because they cannot afford to. Therefore this area should be exempted or at least given further consideration.</P>
    <P>Another area of difficulty &mdash; and this arises from my experience in the Joint Committee on Small Businesses &mdash; relating to all employment legislation is the policing of the legislation.  I understand that under the provisions of this Bill the penalty for an employer on a first offence is £500, with a subsequent fine of £50 a day, and that for the employee it is £100 on a first offence and £10 per day subsequently. I understand also that the Department of Labour are to provide the inspectorate.  In that Joint Oireachtas Committee we were told, through submissions, that a succession of employment legislation &mdash; the Maternity Protection Act, the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Redundancy Payments Act, all had the net effect of encouraging people to operate outside the law because there was a disproportionate burden imposed on small companies who did not have the flexibility to cope with those problems.  I have said publicly that the evolution of employment legislation has been one-sided and unbalanced throughout the <Col N="2323" /> period of office of successive Governments. To give one brief example, the Maternity Protection Act provisions have meant that we have been told in our committee that people have demurred from employing women where they might have done so otherwise because of the constraints imposed on them under that Act.</P>
    <P>Given the difficulties experienced in these recessionary times what is required is flexibility not restriction.  I know that under the provisions of the 1936 Act the retail sector is covered already with regard to conditions of employment, that there is a fruit and vegetable inspector, an NPC inspector, a health inspector, a planning officer, a fire officer, employment legislation officers &mdash; a whole series of people who give the impression, correctly or otherwise, that they are anti-employer, anti-self-employed people. Employers find it very difficult to conform to such legislation.  Therefore inadequate policing of the provisions and lack of consultation mean that the net benefit of this type of legislation is to the black economy.  People will say: &ldquo;I will pay cash to my employee.  I will operate outside the law and to hell with the Act.&rdquo; That is what will happen and, mark my words, they will get away with it.  I have seen it contended that anything from 3 per cent to 9 per cent of our GNP is operated through the black economy. Legislation such as this is the genesis of the black economy because people are afraid of its provisions, they do not understand and they endeavour to avoid it.  They will take cash in the hand, they will pay out cash to their employees and it will be the &ldquo;nixer&rdquo; type of employment which will reap the net gain.</P>
    <P>In terms of legitimate employment within the EEC I am aware that there is a standardisation of the 40-hour week, the only exception of which I am aware being the French who have a 39-hour week.  I am aware also of the many reports of the International Labour Organisation and of the draft Council recommendation of the EEC itself.  Running through all of these is the experience of other countries, where they have been <Col N="2324" /> cutting back on the working week, where the progressive trend appears to be that one works less, and there was mention of this fact in the Minister's introductory remarks.  But what has not been mentioned &mdash; and this is my fear in relation to operating European conditions in Ireland &mdash; is that time and again negotiations for a reduced working week have been on the basis of a pay deal, on the basis of a cut in pay or a minimal increase in pay.  There is no mention of that in the provisions of this Bill.  Therefore, I would be afraid that we would get the worst of all worlds, that we would have a restriction on the working week with no corresponding improvement in our competitiveness by making it part of an overall pay deal.</P>
    <P>There is no central national understanding or pay agreement on which to negotiate such things because we are on a plant by plant operation.  I agree with the Minister of State that this is the best approach because of the practical differences on the ground between different companies and work practices.  My difficulty is that the presentation of this legislation is not in the same environment as it is being presented in other EEC countries where there has been a trade off between a reduced working week and a reduction in pay &mdash; which seems unbelievable in this country &mdash; or a minimal increase.</P>
    <P>In terms of competitiveness the biggest threat to jobs through import substitution is not necessarily from our traditional competitors such as the UK, France and Germany.  The biggest threat is from the developing Third World and places such as Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan where there is no legislation such as this.  Over a period of ten years they will decimate our work practices because they are uncompetitive.  I am not saying we should reverse the trends which have arisen over the years, but we must be mindful of the real world and how jobs are sustained. That can only be done by sustainable, competitive and profitable production.</P>
    <P>That is most of what I wanted to say about this Bill.  I would not like it to be construed as suggesting I am totally opposed to the Bill.  The intentions <Col N="2325" /> behind the Bill are fine, but there will have to be a review of all employment legislation.  I understand that the unfair dismissals legislation is being reviewed by the Department of Labour because what was intended in it has had a counterproductive effect on employment creation. It may well be that this type of legislation will not stimulate employment. If you start to make macro-economic or systematic conclusions about what UCG puts on paper, that is a recipe for something which will work in theory but will not work in practice.</P>
    <P>I fully support the efforts being made by the Minister of State and his Department to create employment, most notably the enterprise allowance scheme and other innovations which are on the way. I hope the positive Bills he initiates will not have the opposite effect to what is intended and that in future there will be a carrot and stick approach to this.  My plea would be for flexible legislation.  I hope legislation which is restrictive will be accompanied by tax relief for such things as employers' PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Labour are seeking ways to create employment in the First Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Small Businesses we outlined a completely new approach, namely, a jobs tax credit whereby for every new employee taken on there would be a credit against the employer's tax liabilities, PRSI, VAT and corporation tax of £400 in the first year and £250 in the second year.  Measures like that will win the support of the people who have to put their money where their mouth is and invest to create the jobs. Those are the types of sustainable jobs we need in this economy.  I hope my comments will be taken up and examined on Committee Stage to see what can be done to overcome my fears.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just come from a meeting of the Committee on Public Expenditure of which Deputy Yates is a member.  Our main preoccupation there is to ensure that we do not build up a bureaucracy which will cost more and have a negative impact in terms of the cost to the private sector.  That has been <Col N="2326" /> a concern of ours for some time.  I am very glad I got here in time to hear what Deputy Yates had to say.  I find myself almost entirely in agreement with him, apart from when he said he did not want to be seen as being totally opposed to the Bill.  He gave a list of the most cogent arguments why this Bill should not be before us.  I understand the position of any Government backbencher.  He has to qualify his very reasoned analysis from his practical experience of the small industries who met his committee.  He had to give some words of consolation and assurance of support for what the Minister is proposing.</P>
      <P>Our spokesman, Deputy Calleary, dealt with the Bill in a precise and detailed way.  I intend to take a broader outlook and in a sense to use a wide-angled lens in dealing with this whole matter.  I should like to state a few facts. The number of jobs in manufacturing industry here is about the equivalent of what it was in 1966 before the great drive for employment and investment in manufacturing industry.  All of our problems are not attributable to a population bulge.  Very many of our problems are attributable directly to the hostile environment which has been created in the past two years by a Government hell bent on imposing taxation wherever they can and on whomsoever they can to bridge a current deficit which we now see to have been a vain exercise.</P>
      <P>I want to touch on a few of the consequences of that reality and develop further some of the matters mentioned by Deputy Yates.  Let us take the PRSI contributions. This year income tax has grown to about £2,000 million, the equivalent of total taxation about four or five years ago.  It will startle the House to learn that PRSI contributions are almost of the amount at something over £960 million or £970 million.  That is what PRSI contributions represent as we address ourselves to this topic of employment creation through shorter working hours or a curtailment of overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have full respect for academics, but without consulting any academics, or any advisers in the public service, and without trying to reach a compromise between <Col N="2327" /> policies where compromise is not possible, as Deputy Yates said &mdash; although I do not suppose he wants to be supported too strongly by me &mdash; we all know the real disincentives to employment are such measures as a 1 per cent income levy which is meant to be for youth employment but which we see as only building up a bureaucracy, a 1 per cent income levy which is for nothing except to raise revenue, and PRSI contributions which have increased substantially.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increase in the PRSI contribution there is the fact that this Government reduced the tax-free allowances on the PRSI contributions from £312 two years ago to £286 last year.  This year they insist on maintaining the same. We did not have many people to listen to our arguments on the Finance Bill over two weeks.  I recall one Deputy from Fine Gael and no Deputy from the Labour Party.  We had a full House for the votes. All the Deputies over there voted against restoring the tax allowance on the PRSI contribution to what it was two years ago, apart from trying to adjust upwards in terms of inflation.  Let that be recorded. They all voted against any allowances in terms of the tax bands.  They all voted against any adjustment of the 1 per cent levy.  It is the hostile tax climate here, the highest rate of taxation, direct or indirect, in Europe, that is killing employment.  The evidence issued today &mdash; I brought it up in the House six months ago &mdash; is that money that could be used for investment here is flying out of the country in a way that makes a mockery of the fiscal rectitude boasts of a Government who claimed they were getting their budgetary aggregates right.  I will reserve the detail of that until Thursday when I believe a special debate will be held.</P>
    <P>We must look at it from the employer's point of view as to the burden which all of these new regulations, procedures, penalties and supervisions impose on him or her.  What is happening is that the capacity of the State to send out more supervisors, more instructors and inspectors seems to be limited but the capacity of the person in business in a small way to cope with the inspectors, supervisors <Col N="2328" /> and instructors is not unlimited.  The Bill seems to add more supervision, more penalties, more inquiries and more regulations.  Are we not prepared to acknowledge that?  If we are not we should take the choice and go all the way and say that if we want to have State control a State economy, let us go all the way with The Workers' Party and the socialist economies &mdash; I do not mean those in Western Europe but those further afield &mdash; and have a totally State-controlled big brother economy where big brother can say all the time that his way is the way things should be done.</P>

      <P>I agree entirely with the Deputy.  I will deal with that £500 million later.  When we raised questions about that £500 million at the beginning of the year we were told we were dreaming but now it has been proved that somebody else was dreaming.  I will reserve further comment on that to later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the impact of this from the workers' point of view.  At this time there is another important meeting going on in this city, the annual conference of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union.  What is the focus at that meeting?  Are there any motions about reducing overtime?  I do not believe there are.  I do not believe any representative at that meeting will be calling for a reduction of overtime to provide more jobs.  I do not have the full details of the agenda but from what I know it is not suggested.  That meeting is <Col N="2329" /> considering the levels of taxation, unemployment and the impact the high levels of taxation is having on growing unemployment. That group represents the workers in the trade union structure.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the views of employers in regard to this.  That being so, I wonder where the practical push for this type of legislation is coming from.  I have a suspicion as to why it is before the House.  I acknowledge the commitment of the Minister of State in the House in terms of hard work and having an open mind on all issues.  I doubt if he would bring in this given the scope of the authority he would wish to have.  The Minister's introductory passage dealt with the major preoccupation at the moment, the high level of unemployment, particularly among our young people.  He said that it continues to be the single most important problem facing us at this time.  The Minister went on to indicate that this would demand a whole range of actions and policies &mdash; we are still waiting for them. We have been told that next September, two years after the Government took office, we may have a plan.  However, the Minister told us that there is not just one solution &mdash; there never is &mdash; and the causes of unemployment are varied and complex.  He told us that a number of initiatives on a number of fronts will be necessary, firstly, to alleviate the problem and, secondly, to remove it.  It is into that jigsaw that this little piece of legislation we are discussing is meant to fit. This will be presented to the unemployed and the workers as an initiative to cope with the problem of unemployment.  I reject out of hand that this represents anything like an initiative to deal with those crushing problems.</P>
    <P>For reasons that have been presented already in the House, if not pushed to a hard conclusion by Deputy Yates, it is clear that this will probably have, unfortunately, the other effect.  In the course of the speech the Minister made the point that the Council of Ministers of the EEC are now considering a draft regulation. From my experience in the EEC I am aware that it will take a considerable time to adopt such a regulation because of the variety of conditions that exist in member <Col N="2330" /> states.  What are we doing in the mean-time? We are deciding to go ahead and introduce restrictions on overtime working that will not apply by law, EEC or otherwise, in the countries to whom we export or in the countries with whom we compete in the EEC.  Are we aware of the disability we can impose on ourselves by introducing regulations of a kind that have not yet been adopted, and are not likely to be adopted for some time within the EEC?</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with what Deputy Yates said and what the Minister for Labour said in the course of an interview this week.  He said that certain provisions in relation to unfair dismissals and guarantee of employment in worker legislation are now proving to be a disincentive against employment.  It was the former leader of the Minister's party, Deputy Michael O'Leary, now of the Fine Gael Party, who introduced that legislation to keep us ahead of what was happening in the EEC.  Now we find an awareness coming through that what may seem to be fine in theory, worth while, justifiable, equitable and so on, can in practice have quite the opposite effect.  The same can be said for the legislation under debate. We cannot introduce legislation as if we were dealing with robots, as if every employer or employee affected by this will respond immediately as if they were robots or puppets on a string.  Deputy Yates referred to the one growth area in our economy, the black economy.  One of the reasons it exists is that we have introduced a series of regulations, restrictions either through the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Labour, of a kind that have ensured that those with an agile and fertile brain for escaping from these supervisory powers can do so in the black economy.</P>
    <P>We have seen evidence of another black object which has been confirmed absolutely, the black hole through which most of potential investment funds are being sucked out because of the hostile tax climate.  Therefore, we are going to ensure that we will have other regulations and restrictions which, as Deputy Yates said, will strengthen the <Col N="2331" /> black economy but will do nothing to encourage investment, encourage the entrepreneur, reward the worker or do other than punish those who will now suddenly be amenable to the law for what was up to this moment regarded as being not only acceptable but commendable, namely, working as much as they could to provide independence for themselves and their families.  The penalty is there. The work ethic which hitherto has been promoted is now by law for the categories covered here to be confined to 40 hours a week and no more.  Those covered by this Bill will be amenable presumably to a criminal charge if they exceed that.</P>
    <P>Are we seriously aware of what this little initiative, if I may so call it, is now about to achieve?  It will achieve a total change in our work ethic when we want to promote a new spirit of drive, commitment and common purpose.  That is why I say that this kind of legislation, brought in as a small, insignificant piece to deal with the whole jigsaw of unemployment, is looking backward not forward. We are reacting again, giving an impression of action, of initiative, when the whole range of options for investment and promotion of activity are being ignored.  There is no central plan for the generation of employment in any of the areas we are talking about, the service sector included.  In this year of 1984 we have exactly the same number employed in manufacturing industry as we had in 1966.  Therefore, we are ensuring that those employed in manufacturing industry, particularly young couples, married men &mdash; or women &mdash; who want to work harder and for longer hours to support their families, in the early stages particularly, will be penalised if they go outside the scope of this Bill.  The employers who will offer them that opportunity or incentive will be penalised also.  I find that unacceptable and contrary to the direction we should be giving now.</P>
    <P>Yes, a UCG study was produced.  With all due respect to objective economic studies from UCG or elsewhere &mdash; they are very useful &mdash; the compilers would not suggest themselves that they were ever charged with introducing legislation. <Col N="2332" /> They would not themselves suggest that part of their role or function is to measure the impact of a piece of legislation on the overall climate for investment.  No one action in iteslf will solve any problem, but a signpost pointing back to a <i>cul-de-sac</i> instead of pointing consistently forward with other signposts will cause problems and people who might now contemplate investing from outside this country &mdash; I suspect they are a diminishing number &mdash; will become aware incidentally that another restrictive piece of legislation has just been passed by Dáil Éireann.  They might not be so encouraged by that, particularly if they come from basically free enterprise societies such as the US, Japan, the Netherlands and West Germany, the first two in particular, who are the main promoters of external investment here.  Has anyone considered the effect this will have on them if they find that for one reason or another a good man or woman working a certain period could be effectively more productive working another ten hours in a week &mdash; on overtime of course &mdash; but under our law that is now absolutely unacceptable and they may be punished for providing that opportunity?  Have we really considered the effect of this?  Have we consulted people on the ground or are we listening all the time to the people who are not?  I am not saying this with any undue &mdash; I hope &mdash; criticism of public servants.  They are there to advise a Government to have a concept as to how their legislation will be implemented, but surely we are not going to ignore the experience of those who create employment or who sometimes reduce the level of employment because of the problems they face.  Are we to ignore them and take the view from public servants who, in fairness, I suspect did not dream this up but had to come up with some idea on the basis that parties who could not find a common purpose wanted to show some degree, albeit of very little consequence, of initiative?</P>
    <P>As I have said, an idea such as this is a signpost pointing backwards.  We need to get all the signposts pointing in the same direction.  In this sense we could create a new industry in signposts.  If <Col N="2333" /> everything the Government say and do points in the same consistent direction to encourage investment, work, employment, effort by employees and cohesion, then we will begin to generate the kind of climate that was generated here previously in a short time after a deep recession that we experienced in the fifties.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of this is that this Bill applies to certain categories of employees.  Already we have seen the reaction of the workers to whom it applies.  It is divisive.  What have many of those who are covered or will be affected by this legislation said already?  I have had telephone calls about it from people who resent the fact that we here &mdash; some of us at least &mdash; as they see it, are double-jobbing now.  We are approaching the stage where before one is qualified to be a Member of the Oireachtas one should not by definition have any other qualification, ability or job.  Those of us &mdash; I suppose nearly all of us &mdash; who have had the opportunity or privilege of being educated, trained or equipped for other jobs should now almost be excluded from membership here or should drop our qualifications as soon as we come in here.  That is a reaction, very understandable, from people who say: &ldquo;Yes, but you have your farm, business or profession and you are a Member of the Dáil and I am told that I am being confined&rdquo;.  It is causing division already among those who see themselves as being the only people to whom this restriction applies.  I sympathise with them in that reaction because a Bill that tinkers with one element and limits the scope and opportunity for a limited number of people will cause a reaction.  At this point we need more than ever a degree of cohesion in our society between town and country, between employer and employee, between people outside and those of us who live in this little incestuous environment in Leinster House, talking to ourselves, believing that we are the world and that we determine the conditions of the world.  Fortunately, the world out there is much bigger and we need to encourage cohesion in our country at this moment, not division, and I am <Col N="2334" /> afraid that this legislation is going in the direction of causing division.</P>
    <P>If the Minister in the House at the moment is not aware &mdash; I suspect he is &mdash; of the situation, let me bring some facts to his attention.  There has been a fall in consumption at a dramatic rate here in the last two years across a whole range of activities.  We argued this in the course of the debate on the Finance Bill, which some people say is rather boring because we go into details.  Nevertheless, we must do it.  In the course of those very lengthy debates, section by section, detail by detail, we demonstrated that there was a fall-off in consumption in, for example, beer 20 per cent, petrol of the same order, products of the electrical and allied trades of the same order also and a drop in the clothing industry of considerable importance.  Why?  Because of the disparity between our tax levels and those applying particularly at the other side of the Border.  We are losing jobs. Ask any trader in the electrical business in this city.</P>
    <P>Further south traders are also experiencing this fall-off.  This underlines the loss of jobs in this sector.  The fall-off in consumption leads to a fall-off in tax revenue. This is an area in which the point of diminishing returns has been reached. A Government who focus only on extra taxation to maintain tax buoyancy are bound to be defeated in their purpose because of the consequences of fewer in employment having to pay a greater level of taxation to meet what seems to be the voracious public expenditure appetite of this State.  We do not need either the department of economics of any university or Public Service advice to underline that.  There is a fall-off in investment. The level of GNP in terms of investment is, at about 22 per cent, the lowest for about 14 years.  We may ask to what this situation is attributable.  Presumably investment for employment is something we wish to encourage, but when our words are pointing in one direction and our actions in another one realises what the genesis of the problem of unemployment is.</P>
    <P>Although it may be up to two years before we have figures from the CSO in <Col N="2335" /> regard to emigration, I submit that our unemployment figures would be considerably higher but for the numbers who are emigrating.  When the figures emerge eventually from the CSO we will find that in 1984 young people are leaving here to find prospects elsewhere.  Many of these young people are ill-equipped for the new way of life that faces them.  They are out of work and can no longer cope.  There is the general pre-occupation about young people being at risk, engaging in drugs and so on.  The whole theme is one of young people with problems rather than of young people with potential.  To find evidence of the numbers who are emigrating one need only go into any village or town.  I am sure people are leaving the cities too, but they are usually more anonymous.  Many of the Irish societies in Britain could tell the Minister of the growing numbers of young people who have gone there to seek work for which in many cases they are ill-prepared. Despite this situation we are dealing with legislation to penalise those who work more than 40 hours per week with the exception of certain sectors.</P>
    <P>In relation to promoting employment for young people, it has been demonstrated by those whose track record has been proven, a record that we would do well to study and emulate, that the best guarantee for the future so far as young people are concerned is to provide them with the necessary educational skills, technical ability, confidence and ambition to generate sometimes their own jobs but in conditions in which we would know that a properly-educated workforce, as distinct from a trained workforce, was available.  I emphasise a properly educated workforce.  Recently on radio I heard a very distinguished professor in this area express in a rather pithy way what I have been trying to express in the past 18 months.  He put it very well when he said that you educate the human to use his or her imagination, to be capable of meeting the opportunities and challenges of life, but that you train an animal for one job.  The Government have got it wrong by training for a particular job and ignoring the potential of education.  Last <Col N="2336" /> year the Minister for Finance took the step of cancelling oral examinations in modern languages.  Whatever about the short-sightedness of the decision of the Minister for Finance, I doubt if the Minister for Education would have favoured such a change.</P>

      <P>I am talking about employment.  This House must be relevant and it will not be rendered irrelevant by a little tinkering of this nature.  Perhaps I do not commend myself to the officials of this House but I am prepared to be guided by you as distinct from being guided by the response of the officials. We are the representatives of the people and we are the ones who must answer to the people as to how we discharge our responsibilities.  Surely we would do better to equip our young people to promote market outlets for employment by reason of their being fluent in modern languages, by being aware of the market conditions in the countries to which we sell and by being aware of the habits of life in those countries.  If we are to create jobs by way of exports we must know about the countries to which we are exporting.  In what must have been the most short-sighted decision ever taken, the Minister for Education was forced to cancel oral examinations in modern languages.  In fairness, however, in view of the reaction to that decision a review of the situation has been forced on the Government this year.</P>
      <P>To take the practical implications of what the Government are doing as distinct from the general situation, what are we to say to the young married man who works an extra five to ten hours per week in order to provide for his family but who is not in a position, as would have been the case previously, to benefit from a relatively appropriate tax allowance against the cost of providing a home for himself and his family because the tax allowance in respect of mortgages has been reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Deputy Dowling suggesting that people who live in such houses are wealthy by reason of the homes they have?  If he looks up tax-free allowances in respect of mortgages he will realise that what I am saying is right. However, we can deal with that at a later stage though it was dealt with during the course of the Finance Act.  We should be encouraging young people, particularly young married people, to provide homes for themselves.  If they undertake extra work they are penalised.  As Deputy Yates said they will find another way in the black economy.  Nothing will be registered or recorded.  The Minister for Finance will be the loser.  More money will go down the black hole.  That will be a consequence of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Yates when he said that we should use legislation whether on PRSI or income tax to encourage the generation of employment. We on this side have argued that there could be a reducing level of employer PRSI contribution for extra jobs created.  Instead the employer will find that if he gives extra work to good, skilled men who can produce a product for which there is a market that he has to get a licence.  We will have a big inspectorate dealing with licences and people will make representations to us asking if we can get them a licence.  There will be new employment in the public service. Who will create jobs?  Is it those in the Department of the Public Service or those who produce?  We will ask people to get licences to work.  That is laughable. That is what we are bringing in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard employers say that they need a separate section in their enterprises to cope with the help they get from State agencies.  These agencies advise and assist them.  Look at the allocations we <Col N="2338" /> provide for them through the Department of Labour.  The people who are out there sweating and worrying are those who will now find that in addition to coping with agencies which help them they will have to cope with another one. There will be more forms to be filled in. Are we serious?</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Committee on Public Expenditure and I thought we were reaching some conclusions in terms of curtailing the growth of bureaucracy. Instead this legislation will expand it.  In deference to those in the Department of the Public Service with whom I was privileged to serve, we have the best personnel and we should be privileged to have them.  We are curtailing them with this kind of approach.  We will ensure that their contributions will be negative, restrictive and supervisory.  We are entering into a new era.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance spoke about competitiveness being the sole basis for employment generation.  I agree that is more important than what we are discussing now.  However, the Minister who said that has ensured that by the imposition of high tax rates and PRSI it is next to impossible for our industries and services to be competitive.  If we want to achieve growth in employment the area we must look to is the services sector. Some services such as nurses, doctors, para-medical staff, ambulance personnel, workers wholly or mainly employed as residential caretakers and people primarily engaged in transport of persons or goods or an undertaking which is primarily engaged in ancillary services or facilities necessary for the transport of persons or goods have been excluded.  I do not know why these should be picked out more so than others.  What will we tell the hotel industry?  If we are lucky enough to get a positive response from President Reagan's visit when the 40-hour clock strikes, bang, out.  I will not go into the extremes of how ridiculous it will be.  Are we not trying to encourage people to work?</P>
    <P>The Minister has a dual responsibility. I wish him well.  In discharging that responsibility I hope he will be more conscious of educating for permanent <Col N="2339" /> employment rather than training for a particular job that it may go.  Educating and preparing through added value skills is the guarantee of permanent employment in other countries.  Japan and Switzerland are witnesses to that.  They have added value skills to maximise employment on all fronts.  Product development marketing and research technique is the basis for the future but it is not so with us.  For us it is more important to bring in legislation of this kind.  We are killing competitiveness.</P>
    <P>There is scope for voluntary retirement and work-sharing.  I agree with Deputy Yates on that.  It could be expensive.  Will the Minister not consider having consultations with the unions? Some nurses and teachers, both male and female, have suggested to me that they would be quite happy to work for half the hours for half the pay in certain circumstances.  That could be pursued.  I would not be in favour of introducing regulations to insist that it happen.  These people were relatively young, married couples who had children.  Early retirement is voluntary and I would support it.  This Bill represents a stick which will ensure that those who want to work harder will not be allowed to do so unless by permit.  It introduces a new concept and is exactly opposite to what is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amused by the reservations expressed by Deputy O'Kennedy about the Bill.  Listening to him I was intrigued by his lack of knowledge of the situation in factories and workshops.  With the deepest respect for Deputy O'Kennedy, whom I admire very much as a person, let me say that when I hear people speaking against legislation the intention and the spirit of which is good in itself, I ask them to look at it a little deeper.  In the early decades of the last century Lord Londonderry, speaking before a commission of the House of Lords on conditions of employment in this country and in Britain, on behalf of the mine owners of Scotland and Wales, defended the practice of bringing children under the age of five years down the mines of the grounds that if the employers <Col N="2340" /> did not get them at that age they could not develop the stoops on their backs which were necessary for the type of work they had to do.  Keir Hardie, who founded the Labour Party in Britain, said that until he died he would never forget the fear that assailed him when in the underground passages of the mines his lantern blew out.  He was ten years of age.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy had the temerity to refer to the shortcomings of the legislation introduced by the 1973-77 Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>A waterhen cannot serve two sides of the stream.  I want to put it on the record that the Coalition Government introduced more legislation in favour of the workers than had been done since the foundation of the State in 1922.  I am referring to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, the Holidays Act, 1973, and Anti-Discrimination Pay Act, 1974, the Equality of Employment Act, 1977, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Protection of Young Workers Act, 1977, and the Protection of Employment Act, 1977.  They were all introduced by a Labour Minister and they stand unparalleled in what they have done for the workers.</P>

      <P>There are some shortcomings in those Acts, but I do not cry many salty tears for the employers Deputy O'Kennedy referred to because <Col N="2341" /> they are never slow to find ways to circumvent the provisions of these Acts.  We have at the moment what is un absolute scandal by any standards.  Some unscrupulous employers are deliberately playing with legislation to circumvent its impact.  I am speaking in particular about commercial cleaners and what is happening to women commercial cleaners.  This is only one short step above white slavery. These women are being degraded and exploited by employers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>We are speaking of the Hours of Work Bill and the working week of these women is being deliberately pitched at a number of hours to fall short of the qualifying number for the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, the Redundancy Act, The Holiday Pay Act and other Acts.  This is an absolute disgrace.  I am taking this opportunity to ask the Minister to introduce a JIC or JLC to protect those workers from employers who should be in jail for what they are doing.  These women, who are forced to go out to work because their husbands are unemployed, are the most deprived section of our community. This blackguardism is worthy of a public inquiry.</P>
      <P>There is wholesale abuse of the 1936 Conditions of Employment Act.  In some factories machinery is left unguarded but when they hear the Department's inspector is coming, there is a rush to cover the machinery before he arrives.  I ask the Minister to ensure that it is legally obligatory on inspectors to give the trade unions a report of their findings where an employer had not fulfilled the regulations.  I am speaking particularly of threats to safety and health.  We have plenty of experience of such happenings for instance where because of an emission of fuels due to lack of protection workers are suffering and in some cases have to be taken to hospital.  Employers should be far more vigilant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1936 Truck Act is a combination of Acts brought in during the last century. A subsection of that Act expressly forbids <Col N="2342" /> employers to stop or deduct money from a worker's wages in respect of goods damaged or lost during his employment.  That is still being contravened by employers. Under the law an employer cannot stop money from a worker's wages because goods belonging to the employer are damaged or lost during the hours of work.  Workers do not know that, and they are still being penalised.  This is one area where the Department's inspectors could be more vigilant.</P>
    <P>I have a mixed reaction to this Bill.  I welcome the spirit and the intention as outlined by the Minister, namely, that it would have a good social impact, but I am completely at odds with the Minister in his optimism that it will achieve the stated aims.  Not for one minute do I think it will create significant employment. I would like to see that quantified. Before the Minister puts this Bill through both Houses, I ask him to have in-depth discussion with the trade union movement about the implications of this legislation. In this Bill I see a reference to a limitation of ten hours per week.  That must refer to the Labour Court <i>ad hoc</i> ruling on the determination of the number of hours worked.  This point arose because a young boy or girl in a factory might be anxious to play football and to them two hour's overtime would be excessive because they wanted to play a match, but, on the other hand, a company might need 20 hours worked to get out an order and they might say that that was not excessive.  The Labour Court gave an <i>ad hoc</i> ruling of ten hours in that situation.  I imagine the Bill is based on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that section 5 limits the amount of overtime that can be worked to a maximum of 40 hours in any period of four consecutive weeks.  Does that mean that if I do not work overtime during the first three weeks I can be legally obliged to work 40 hours overtime in the fourth week?  That point needs to be given some attention and I am sure the trade union movement will have much more to say about this.  The Minister very coyly declines to determine what the minimum rates of overtime should be and says that under section 11 <Col N="2343" /> workers and employers may negotiate and give effect to arrangements for time off in lieu of payment for overtime.  In my view, the Minister should state specifically in order to protect workers, that where there is such an agreement with an employer, time off in lieu may be taken in respect of overtime and that the overtime shall be at the enhanced rate.  For example, if the minimum rate of overtime is time and a half for the first four hours, anybody opting to take the four hours should get six hours off instead of four. That has been contravened, very often, in some cases legally.  There are some categories of Government employees &mdash; one which readily comes to mind is that of VEC caretakers &mdash; who are paid a flat rate for overtime.  This is grossly unfair and archaic.  Minimum rates of overtime should be laid down by the Minister in order to protect workers.  I would not leave it to the tender mercies of employers to do this, especially with workers who are so foolish and shortsighted as not to become members of a trade union or are nervous of joining a trade union movement, and leave themselves open to exploitation.</P>
    <P>May I use this opportunity, as we are dealing with legislation, to reassure low paid, badly educated workers especially in catering establishments and in other types of work whose employers traffic on their fears, telling them that if they join a trade union they will be dismissed?  In this country one cannot be dismissed for joining a trade union.  I cannot stress that too often and hope that the newspapers will pick that up.  It is enshrined in the Constitution and is the first major exemption under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  It and pregnancy are the two main exemptions.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to have the deepest consultation with the trade union movement.  I was amused by Deputy O'Kennedy's contribution.  He is a man who knows as much, apparently, about the internal workings of factories and the lives of workers as a pig does about a bank holiday.  It is obvious from the tone of some of his remarks.  I am saying that in the gentlest possible way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2344" /> The intention of the Bill is good but unless it rests on the will and co-operation of the trade union movement it will be totally counterproductive.  I was speaking about the exploitation of women workers and cleaners.  It is surprising to what degree that also applies to married clerical workers who want to earn some extra money.  Some of the national newspapers are not above criticism in this regard.  They are deliberately splitting the working weeks and asking women to work for 18 hours a week.  These workers tell me that they got no minimum notice, do not qualify for holidays and are being made redundant.  I had to tell them, regrettably, that they did not qualify under all those Acts.  I ask the Minister to examine that position in particular again in the context of hours of working.</P>
    <P>May I remind the members of Deputy O'Kennedy's distinguished legal profession that members of that profession were named the biggest defaulters by the Labour Court in several successive years for not implementing the terms of the national pay norms.</P>
    <P>I do not have much sympathy with non-trade union people who ask me if they are entitled to a national wage agreement or whatever it is.  I point out that one cannot enforce such on an employer unless one is a member of a trade union. Women workers whose parents bothered to have them properly educated and given a commercial training work on a one to one basis for employers and are being unscrupulously exploited, not qualifying for the minimum legal amount of holidays, pay movements or whatever.  I ask the Minister to have regard to my comments as a practising trade union official.  These are the areas of gross exploitation of workers.  The Minister, in conjunction with this Bill, might far more effectively look at these areas to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I have the deepest reservations about what this Bill will achieve in terms of creating extra jobs.  I welcome the limitation on hours from a social point of view, but from an economic point of view will extra employment be created?  I urge the Minister to have the fullest consultation <Col N="2345" /> with the trade union movement before this Bill is passed in the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Prendergast is critical of us on this side of the House about our unawareness of some of the problems at present facing industry, the trade unions and people in general.  Listening to Deputy Prendergast's contribution, it was difficult to determine whether the Deputy was for or against the legislation. I do not particularly disagree with this legislation but he probably feels, as I do, that this is middle of the road legislation. It probably will not be very useful.  In line with what other speakers have said in previous debates, it seems more concerned with improving working conditions for people in employment rather than doing what the Bill sets out to do &mdash; facilitating the expansion of employment in the economy.</P>
      <P>The strategy being talked about here and running through the Minister's speech was spoken about in the eighties and discussed at length over the past ten or 12 years.  It was one of improving working conditions of employment, rather than dealing with what the Minister says is the major problem of the high level of unemployment, especially among young people.  This legislation will do very little, if indeed anything, to resolve the very serious national unemployment crisis.  I urge Deputies not to confuse the improvement &mdash; and there is a need to for such improvement &mdash; in working conditions for employees generally with the important need to find solutions now to deal with this major crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take exception to the fact that the Government are using this legislation as a smokescreen or a cover-up in an attempt to show this as major legislation which will deal with the unemployment crisis in our economy.  That is not the position.  The Minister in discussion on this legislation both in the Seanad and here has acknowledged that fact.  He said the most promise lay in the area of work sharing, early retirement and temporary work schemes.  If this is the most promising movement that the Government can come up with now to deal with the present grave situation I am very disappointed. <Col N="2346" /> I would have expected a far more forthright attempt by the Minister who has the energy to tackle and deal with these problems.  We need to see a better indication of a more energetic approach in his Department than we see here.  The Bill is a middle of the road one which will not create any worth-while job opportunities.  It will not provide the type of jobs mentioned in the UCG survey which has been selectively used to bring forward a figure of 12,000 new jobs that could be created in the non-agricultural sector by the curtailment of overtime. This study indicated that management looked at overtime as a necessary device for flexibility in industry.  When that study was done they were unwilling to do away with approximately 60 per cent of the overtime done.  A second study by UCG was less optimistic than that one. The full study should be put before us so that we can see clearly what the study said.  The Minister acknowledges that we do not have the type of information which would enable us to have any worthwhile policies to deal with this situation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is to deal with a particular issue which we are not very fully aware of.  I question the usefulness of the Bill. The latest survey figures available to us indicate that the average number of hours worked now is about 42½ hours per week. In practice very few people work more than 40 hours per week.  I would like to get a message across to the general public that in introducing this Bill the Government are bringing forward a major piece of legislation which, they say, will create 12,000 more jobs fairly soon.  But this is really clouding the issue and trying to pretend that some action is being taken to deal with our economical crisis.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about our competitive position and how important it is to keep it.  I am worried that a Bill like this may trigger off claims for loss of earnings which will add to our problems.  Senator Hillery has pointed out that there were indications some years ago that the highest levels of overtime in Britain occurred in the lowest paid industries.  It is likely that the same applies here.  If that is the situation we are really asking the lowest paid workers to face the burden of curtailment <Col N="2347" /> of overtime.  This will put their income situation at a disadvantage and it may very well lead to increased claims being made for loss of earnings from overtime.  This will add to the difficulties the Government will have in the future in negotiating reasonable wage rates.</P>
    <P>There is a possibility that the rigid enforcement of this Bill will cause a curtailment of jobs rather than provide job opportunities.  I do not disagree with the Bill but I am rather cautious about its usefulness.  We need economic investment and we need policy measures.  We need to see the new economic plan, about which there has been a lot of talk.  We need to see the new industrial strategy, the new industrial policy, which we hope will determine the future development of industrial strategy over the next ten to 20 years.  We need to see investment in forestry, fisheries, tourism and agriculture. We need to see infrastructural development in roads, telephones, sanitary services and communications.  We want to see a genuine effort made at import substitution which will ensure that we use our own resources for the benefit of our people.  These are the type of important measures we need to see the Government bringing forward rather than the introduction of this Bill which has been looked at for quite a long lime.  People genuinely feel that this Bill will not be any great advantage to us.</P>
    <P>Developments are taking place, as the Minister acknowledges, in the European Community which may well mean that the Bill will be out of date before it is implemented.  We know there is a campaign in Germany to reduce the working week to 35 hours.  Are we to see initiatives taken at Community level in the next few years which will tackle that area on a Community basis, regularising and harmonising hours of work and conditions throughout the Community?  Are we likely to be in the situation in a few years' time, when the detailed discussion taking place in the Community is finalised, that the Bill we are discussing today will be out of date and that we may well have to introduce another Bill to deal with a changing situation in Europe?  We <Col N="2348" /> are likely to see changes here because of the dynamic changes taking place in the new technological advancement throughout the European Community and the world.  In the pattern we see developing in relation to working conditions over the next 25 years we will see almost a revolution taking place when this whole area will be looked at in more detail and a European initiative will be taken with which we will have to comply.  We will see desirable changes which will be beneficial to people in jobs and to economies in the next few years.</P>
    <P>We need to take initiatives in relation to industrial development.  The Government have no plans in relation to any area one wishes to talk about.  I deal specifically with forestry and fisheries, but the Government have no coherent plan to deal with those major industries which are now in the doldrums.  We need to look at small industries and to recognise that there will be fairly substantial development in small industrial projects in the next few years.  Over two-thirds of new jobs created in places like the US during the past ten years have been in small industrial projects.  If we are talking about initiatives which will help to deal with our unemployment crisis these are the areas we need to see the Government paying attention to.  There is an urgent need to press ahead with essential legislation and, above all, with the economic planning which is so necessary if we are to give the economy the required boost and attempt to solve the worsening unemployment problem.</P>

      <P>It is important to get a clear indication of Government strategy so that we can see where desirable legislation will fit in and help young people to get employment.  They welcome training opportunities and the work of the Youth Employment Agency, AnCO and Manpower but they want permanent, fulfilling jobs with a prospect of advancement. They want these jobs at home and it should be possible to manage our affairs so as to provide them.  Is it not strange that 40.000 people are on waiting lists for local authority housing while 50.000 or 60,000 building workers are unemployed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The building industry is in a very depressed state and we must organise ourselves to provide houses for those who need them while giving work to the unemployed at the same time.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that there will be massive changes in the area of technology and this will bring more pressure for legislation designed to improve leisure time. In this Bill the Government are only scratching the surface and they are not dealing with the problem.</P>
      <P>Deputy Prendergast referred to the exploitation of women in industry.  Perhaps the Minister of State would tell us what effect this legislation will have on such women.  Statistics show that women account for about 30 per cent of workers in industry and their average weekly earnings are about 60 per cent of male earnings.  Will this legislation help to change that?  Will it widen the gap still further between the earnings of men and women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with much of what Deputy Yates said but I would take issue with him regarding the statement that the maternity legislation introduced during my term of office is having an adverse impact on employment creation.  That legislation was desirable and essential and we deplore recent attempts by the Minister for Social Welfare to curtail payments under the legislation.  We all know <Col N="2350" /> what happened regarding discrimination against women in industry.  Any attempt by the Government to interfere in any way with the maternity legislation would be a backward step which would be resisted.  Women in the workforce are a fact of life and we will not solve our unemployment problems by taking work from one person and giving it to another. Our problems can be solved only if we make the proper planning decisions and implement proper economic policies.</P>
    <P>This is middle-of-the-road legislation and I do not believe there can be any such solutions to our unemployment problems.  The Government are not dealing with these problems effectively. People who walk in the middle of the road are invariably knocked down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is concerned, as we all are, about the growing level of unemployment.  The background to this Bill may be an attempt to secure jobs for the unemployed, but I am of the opinion that this further addition to social bureaucracy in relation to the rights of employers and workers will do very little to secure any further employment.  It may have the opposite effect.  It is clearly stated that this Bill is not a panacea.</P>
      <P>Much political support can be generated during election campaigns by matters relating to employment.  I would remind the Opposition that they built their 1977 manifesto on an attempt to create full employment.  I do not believe the policies of any one Government from one year to the next can bring about any significant change in these developments. Fianna Fáil must take some blame, perhaps a greater share than this side of the House, in that regard.  They would like to achieve a certain kudos from the fact that the Government find themselves in an appalling position in trying to counter the growing level of unemployment. However, I hope the Minister will give some hope for optimism later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can look at the problems in other countries.  The growing use of technology would appear to ensure that fewer and fewer people will be at work.  Certainly, the machine that stops at 5 o'clock or some other time is not a protection for <Col N="2351" /> workers.  Apparently it is far easier and better for investment to instal machinery to do jobs more efficiently than workers. There is an increase in this kind of thinking. I am not suggesting it is right, if we are to make any improvement in the employment position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to the black economy.  I do not think an honest attempt has been made to tackle it.  I have seen the growing influx of goods from Northern Ireland.  They are on sale in every small and large town in the country. Many of those responsible for bringing those goods in, without any revenue to the State, are drawing unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I am mainly concerned with sections 2 and 3 which deal with the types of workers affected and with exemptions from the provisions of the Bill.  Deputy Yates spoke about this and I should like to repeat the fears he expressed, particularly in regard to farming.  Fishermen are to be exempt, and one can respect the reasons for exempting doctors and nurses in whose hands lives may depend. The same can be said for the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána and certain other State employees.  However, on farms the lives of animals may be at risk and I do not think that is any less important, so I suggest that the Minister must consider the extension of the exemptions to farming for the reasons set out by Deputy Yates, which I support.  This applies to certain times of the year when crops are being saved.  It applies to the dairying industry in which people are employed to look after herds and who will therefore exceed the statutory number of hours.  There is the problem of the care of animals which may transmit disease and so on.  On Committee Stage I hope the Minister will introduce an amendment to extend the exemptions.</P>
    <P>The number of hours laid down in section 4 is good thinking.  There should not be a free-for-all.  Workers are greedy in this respect and so are some employers. I do not apologise to the Opposition for the reforming legislation introduced by the Coalition from 1973 to 1977.  I have seen workers with families having <Col N="2352" /> to depend on social welfare benefits. Even today the level of pay-related benefits does not go anywhere near the amount necessary to maintain families, particularly those who have invested in houses and the acquisition of other amenities. Any benefits workers get in this respect must be regarded as part of the cost of production.  However, the PRSI system has affected small employers particularly.  Many of them have said to me that they could employ up to ten people if it were not for the high level of the employer's contribution.  This needs examination and updating and Deputies who have spoken and who have had experience of working in small firms have had this brought home to them.</P>
    <P>Is there a possibility that there will ever be full employment?  I do not think so &mdash; I think it is a myth &mdash; but I should like to think we can come somewhere near it.</P>
    <P>Could we not reconsider 65 years as the retirement age?  It could be brought down to 60.  Of course life expectancy has been increasing and the cost of that would be enormous.  I doubt if the country could afford it, but we should consider some form of legislation that would encourage, say, voluntary retirement.  I speak particularly of nursing and teaching, where there is great scope for job sharing.  The Bill does not do anything to protect the pension rights of teachers and nurses.  If that were done we could have more vacancies for younger qualified people who have been denied this so far.  This should be regarded as important in any legislation if we are to create additional jobs.</P>
    <P>Two-job families would be relevant here.  When the husband is working the wife may have to go out also to help to repay mortgages and so on, apart from the satisfaction derived from working and getting out of the house.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy waffled on about what took place in the area of education. He does not seem to remember that the Estimates were produced by a spokesman for his party and that provision was not made for modern oral language examinations.</P>

      <P>I would not advise the Deputy to be too optimistic at this stage. The Minister is doing an excellent job in his Department.  I do not know how the restriction on double employment in section 8 will work.  Quite a number of the Members of this House have double employment.  We must ask ourselves if we are happy to have legislation for one section of the community while exempting ourselves from it?  I put that question to the Minister and to all Deputies. Deputy Prendergast referred to the legal profession.  They seem to be the greatest culprits in regard to their level of additional work and duties outside politics.  It appears that politics is only a passing interest for these people and that they <Col N="2354" /> just make occasional contributions in this House.</P>
      <P>Section 8 must be discussed and debated to find out the full implications. Unlike last year, when we were dealing with our pay allowance, we must not be seen to treat ourselves in a different way from other sections of the community.  If we took note of that point we might not have the same level of cynicism on the part of the public that exists at the present time.  I wish to highlight the people who are exempted from the provisions of this Bill.  I ask the Minister to consider including the farming community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill would be welcome if it was going to do what the Minister claimed for it in his opening speech or if it contributed substantially to our social legislation.  A number of sections are worth-while but one of the main sections, that relating to a working week of 40 hours, is no improvement on established practices.</P>
      <P>In introducing the Bill the Minister claimed it was one element in the Government's proposals to reduce unemployment and to share existing employment more equally among those available for work.  The Minister quoted a 1980 report to show that as many as 12,000 jobs could be created in the non-agricultural sector.  He quoted the <i>Study of Overtime Working In Ireland</i> report which was produced jointly by the European Commission and the Department of Labour.  However, he did not quote one significant paragraph on the same page. The report stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A majority of firms surveyed see no scope for creating extra employment from overtime hours.  However, on the basis of responses from firms it is estimated that about 12,000 jobs would be possible from reductions in overtime. <Col N="2355" /> An annual limit of 150 hours overtime would have the greatest employment impact but output would also be affected in many firms.</P>
    <P>The report continued:</P>
    <P>Introducing double rates for overtime working would have given rise to some increase in employment but labour costs would also have risen in many firms.  Such a step does not seem appropriate in reducing overtime.</P>
    <P>My reason for quoting this statement from the report is to balance what the Minister is claiming, namely, that it is possible, even given the recession, to create a significant number of jobs by reducing overtime.  There is no evidence whatever that any significant amount of overtime is being worked at the moment. The 1980 report referred to overtime of 150 hours per year while this Bill will allow overtime to be worked for up to 100 hours for 12 consecutive weeks.  On a simple calculation that would allow overtime in the region of 400 hours per year while the 1980 report states that overtime would have to be restricted to 150 hours per year to have the results claimed by the Minister.  Even on the basis of claiming that if a certain number of overtime hours are not worked this would be converted automatically to jobs does not stand up when one considers what was stated in the 1980 report.</P>
    <P>The Minister is introducing this Bill as part of the Government's job creation programme.  If the Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn, had introduced the Bill he might have taken a different line, although judging from recent statements he has made about job creation I am not at all certain he would have taken a socialist position on job creation.  The fact is that sustainable, long-term jobs will not be created simply by sharing the few jobs that exist at the moment.  Anyone who looks at the situation realistically will agree that the only possible basis for future long-term job creation is an increase in the productive capacity of this island and our ability to export and to win markets abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2356" /> There is an inherent contradiction in the arguments put forward by the Government in the past 12 or 18 months with regard to wage restraint and their introduction of a Bill relating to overtime. When one takes the findings of the 1980 report, what the Government are proposing is more likely to increase production costs than to reduce them.  There seems to be a lack of coherence in the approach to the question of job creation. I do not accept the Minister's argument that there can be any job creation arising from this Bill.  That is not to say that proposals to reduce overtime are not welcome because, in the vast majority of cases people work overtime because they need the money as their basic income is so low, despite the fact that 60 per cent of what they earn is taken back in PRSI and PAYE.  The 40p they are left with out of every pound they earn is so essential that it is necessary for them to work overtime.  I would be far happier if the Minister also brought in a Bill for a minimum wage to ensure that everybody was paid a decent wage for the work they do.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to double jobbing and the last speaker said that there are a number of Deputies who also have other jobs in private enterprise of one kind or another and this Bill does not affect them in any way.  There is also a gap in the Bill which does not prevent a person from being employed by a company, either private or semi-State, and at the same time be self-employed.  It is common for various professional people and tradesmen who are employed full-time to also take on jobs in their spare time, and there is no restriction on that in the Bill.  It is the people at the bottom end of the employment market, the unskilled worker, who will be affected most by this restriction on working overtime because they do not have special skills to sell in the black economy.</P>
    <P>The question of making the 40 hours the statutory working limit for each week is something of a &ldquo;con&rdquo; trick in that the Minister is talking about providing additional employment by reducing working hours.  It has been the common practice for most people to work 40 hours or less per week.  The 1980 report which the <Col N="2357" /> Department of Labour and the European Commission carried out indicated that many workers in the clerical and managerial areas work less than 41) hours per week.  Apart from the question of creating additional jobs there is no social advantage in fixing the maximum at 40 hours when the whole impetus in Europe and the demands of the trade unions here is for a 35 hour week.  This is not as a sleight of hand to share out what work is available, because nowadays it is regarded that no person should have to work more than 35 hours per week and that their income should be adequate to enable them and their families to have a decent home and to have recrealion available.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking the power to enable firms to work in excess of the limits laid down in the Bill without any reference to the workers' representatives in these firms.  I ask the Minister to look at that to ensure that where a firm has applied for permission to work outside the hours established by the Bill that it would only be given in cases where there is full agreement from the representatives of the workforce in a particular firm.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the 40 hour week.  If the Minister was serious about creating additional jobs, setting it at 40 hours will not have the desired effect and perhaps he should consider setting it at 35 hours.</P>
    <P>The section removing the restrictions on women workers is welcome and is long overdue.  I am not happy with the section which exempts close relatives from the terms of this Bill.  It is not unusual to have close relatives working for their parents, brothers or sisters on an employer-employee basis and paying PRSI and PAYE.  Some of the worst exploitation takes place in family owned firms and on farms where sons and daughters are employed for a pittance and in some cases work a six day week.  I strongly urge that close relatives should not be excluded from the terms of the Bill where they are listed as employees and paying social insurance and so on.</P>
    <P>As I said, overtime is worked by employees because of the need for money to make ends meet.  There is, of course, the other side of the coin that in the vast <Col N="2358" /> majority of cases, as pointed out in the study in 1980, most firms indicated that overtime was necessary because of their production schedules or processes. Indeed, 80 per cent of the firms surveyed stated that it would not be possible to implement their processes without resorting to overtime.</P>
    <P>The exclusions set out in the Bill are fairly extensive.  For example, members of the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána or the prison service, fishermen, doctors, nurses, paramedical staff and ambulance personnel, residential caretakers, workers employed in the common home, close relatives, transport undertakings or the provision of ancillary services and facilities necessary for the transport of persons or goods.  There are other people who are also exempt although not specifically mentioned in the Bill, that is people who are employed by a company and work for themselves outside company hours.  These are not covered by the Bill nor are Members of either House of the Oireachtas.  There is the extraordinary situation in which there is at present a sort of media tit for tat going on between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael about who is most honourable in regard to the dual mandate in Europe while all three parties &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour &mdash; voted against an amendment to the European Elections Bill in this House which would have precluded the dual mandate.</P>
    <P>While I am sure the Minister did not intend it, the fact that a Bill is introduced in this House which appears to legislate for Joe Soap in the street restricting him in certain ways from earning money in order to make ends meet and at the same time excluding ourselves from coverage of its provisions, either specifically in terms of the Bill or by not referring to the fact at all, leads to a further growth in the cynicism already evident among the ordinary voter.  There have been a number of incidents in this Dáil in recent times which have led to a growth of that cynicism.  Some other speaker on the Fine Gael benches mentioned the increase in Dail salaries last year at a time when demands were emerging, practically one a day, from the Government side for <Col N="2359" /> everybody else to tighten their belts.  The most sophisticated arguments can be advanced about how justified or otherwise was that increase but the plain fact is that to the public it seemed contradictory and to be saying that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor.  So long as this or any other Government continue along those lines then the degree of cynicism among the electorate will grow.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to drop the charade that this Bill will in any way improve present employment levels and ask him to amend it, ensuring that it will constitute socially progressive legislation. One of the most important elements in that regard would be to fix the hours of work at 35 per week rather than 40 per week.  If the Minister is really serious about socially progressive legislation then he should also introduce a Bill setting a minimum income for all workers.</P>

      <P>The objectives of the Bill are laudable in view of the large number of people at present unemployed.  It must be said also that there is no way &mdash; and here I am expressing a personal opinion &mdash; that this Bill or its provisions would reduce the number of people unemployed. I shall endeavour to set out the reasons for so saying.  We should be more positive in our attempts to reduce the large numbers at present on the unemployment register through incentives in another area rather than by the introduction of legislation determining the amount of overtime somebody will be allowed earn.  For instance, the provisions of the Bill will militate against those people who have already committed themselves to various financial undertakings in the last couple of years and who may have committed themselves on the basis of projected overtime.  For instance, take the one-income family who heretofore may well have committed themselves to certain financial obligations on the basis of projected overtime and on which they are entirely dependent to meet such commitments.  If this Bill were to be enacted they would find themselves in a situation in which two-income families <Col N="2360" /> would have a distinct advantage because the limitation on overtime would not have the same traumatic effect on the two-income families.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill will militate against families generally.  In the case of large families nearly always they are dependent on a single breadwinner.  If we set out to create a disincentive, to legislate to limit the amount of overtime that that breadwinner can earn in a year, then we are adopting a very negative way of resolving the most serious problem with which we are confronted at present. There are a number of other ways available to us if we want to discourage those who abuse the overtime system.  For example, it can be done by way of taxation, although those disincentives exist already by way of taxation.  If we endeavour deliberately to pass a law limiting the right of any individual to work beyond a specified time then we are creating a problem, a situation in which we should not become involved at all, because in so doing we are becoming involved in a huge bureaucracy.  I seldom agree with what Deputy O'Kennedy has to say but on this occasion I would have to agree with him.  There is no sense whatsoever in creating a bureaucracy which would be detrimental to the interests of both the employed and unemployed by virtue of the fact that no extra jobs would be created in any event.  I believe the provisions of the Bill would militate against those people anxious to work, who perhaps have overtime available to them and who, by virtue of this Bill, will be debarred from so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To legislate in a manner which would discourage people from using their initiative or the time available to them for productive purposes is wrong.  From the point of view of the farming community &mdash; and a number of other speakers have referred to the possible effect of this Bill on the agricultural sector &mdash; I would emphasise that one cannot legislate in a way which will take account of all possible circumstances arising in the course of a year in the agricultural sector because it can vary from day to day, week to week or year to year.  The provisions of this Bill would bind people involved in agriculture <Col N="2361" /> to unnecessary restrictions, which would be detrimental to productivity and to initiative which is all important.  We must be very careful not to stymie those very important characteristics.</P>
    <P>The objectives set out in the Bill could be achieved by way of taxation and the structures to do so are already there. There are a number of other ways, for instance, early retirement and temporary work about which I have spoken in the House on many occasions.  Far more could be done in that way to achieve a reduction in the number of people unemployed than by introducing this legislation. I do not want to be too critical because I know the Minister of State has his heart in the right place in introducing the Bill.  We are all acutely aware of the crying need to resolve the unemployment problem.  We should all address ourselves to this problem in whatever way possible.</P>
    <P>While this is one way around the problem, it is not the ideal way.  From the point of view of employers or prospective employers, in order to achieve the same output or the same man-hours in a particular sector, it would be possible after the passing of this Bill for an employer to employ more people.  On the face of it that is good and seems quite positive, but it would involve the firm in greater overheads. Instead of paying a few extra hours overtime, the firm would be forced to employ more individuals.  That solves one problem, but it creates a problem because increased PRSI and PAYE overheads are incurred.  This is the biggest single issue employers are raising at present as a disincentive to giving jobs to people who need them.</P>
    <P>So far as we can, we should avoid creating disincentives.  Anything that increases the overheads of employers is a distinct disincentive, and we can well do without it.  In the present economic climate it is difficult enough to encourage employers to take on extra people.  In the past there were incentives such as write-offs for tax purposes against plant and machinery.  If we pass this Bill as it stands, we will create even greater disincentives for employers who are proposing to employ people.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the possibility of temporary <Col N="2362" /> employment even in the public service.  All kinds of economic arguments can be put forward to the effect that it would involve the State in capital expenditure which is not desirable.  The whole question of temporary employment in the public and private sectors should be examined with a view to attempting to resolve our unemployment problem.  If we could find a simplified system for those who wish to obtain temporary employment we would make a far greater impact on the number of unemployed than we can make by passing this Bill.</P>
    <P>I understand that another speaker wishes to contribute to the debate.  Suffice it to say that I fully understand the reasons for the introduction of this Bill. I do not accept that it will resolve the problem at all.  I have reservations about any legislation which would attempt to curtail the right of people to work if there is work for them, and particularly if somebody is willing to offer them work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I welcome this opportunity to make a brief contribution on this Bill which will affect the low paid worker more than any other person in employment.  Deputy Durkan said this Bill, if passed, will not reduce the number of people in employment. That may be quite true, but it will reduce the take home pay of the low paid worker.  To me that is more important than anything else because of the increase every day in the cost of living.  Are the people who drafted this Bill, and civil servants in general, aware that many workers are taking home anything between £60, £70 and £80 a week.  In some cases overtime is included in that. If this Bill is passed, what about the young couple who are purchasing a house?  How will they pay their mortgage?  The Bill is very much against the low paid worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a limitation on the number of hours a low paid worker will work and a very strict limitation on overtime. Any reduction in the working hours of a low paid worker means a reduction in the take home wages of that worker.  For the low paid worker in most jobs overtime is essential particularly when the basic rate is very low.  The low paid worker will be <Col N="2363" /> very much affected if overtime is limited. If the Bill provided that it would affect workers on a certain basic rate only, that would be better, but no matter what your basic rate is this Bill will affect you.  The basic rate is not taken into consideration. I am very much aware of how this will affect the low paid worker because, before I became a Member of this House, I was a low paid worker myself.  I know what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Yates who said that the Bill will have the opposite effect to the effect it is meant to have.  It will not create employment.  I cannot see how it could.  Many people employed in low paid jobs will discover that they would be far better off on the dole.  If there is a limit on overtime and the hours a low paid worker works, he will have no option but to give up his job and revert to the dole.  I am quite sure of that.  Many people who work overtime have no desire whatsoever to work overtime.  Nobody wants to work any longer than 40 hours.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to proceed immediately with the building of the briquette factory at Derryfadda, Ballyforan, County Galway and in the national interest to take all measures necessary to secure the maximum development of the potential of our bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2364" /> I am moving that motion on behalf of Deputies Leyden, Kitt, Noel Treacy, Connolly, Hyland, Power and all members of the Fianna Fáil Parly.  There are two reasons for tabling the motion.  The first is because of the continuous delay on the Ballyforan project.  It was delayed in 1981 when the Coalition were in power and delayed again in 1982-83 and 1984. Another important aspect of the motion is to try to elicit from the Government their policy in relation to the ESB strategic plan which concerns the midlands and many other rural areas.  Are those areas to be decimated and turned into economic wastelands or will the Government give us the decision we have been pressing for?  The first part of our motion which concerns peat development in the midlands and other areas and the future of the ESB power stations does not need as much comment from me as the second part.  We are all aware that a by-election campaign is in progress in Laois-Offaly. On a few occasions in the House I asked for a statement on the Government's position in regard to the future of the 14 ESB power stations and the Bord na Móna operation involved in servicing those stations but I failed to get a response.  Indeed, I forecast that we would get a decision during the Laois-Offaly by-election campaign and I will not be surprised if that decision is imminent. The Minister may take the opportunity of clearing the air tonight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will lose more than his cap in Laois-Offaly if he is not careful and for that reason I believe he will produce the right decision soon. I am aware there was disagreement as to who should make the announcement and <Col N="2365" /> I agreed with the Minister that it is his area of responsibility.  As Leader of the Labour Party and Tánaiste, why should he permit the Taoiseach or a Fine Gael Minister or a Fine Gael Deputy from the constitueney to announce that decision? Do not have the rug pulled from under you as it was in regard to the announcement of the National Development Corporation by the Minister for Industry. Trade, Cornmerce and Tourism late at night.

      <P>We do not care where the announcement comes from but if it is not a favourable one not alone will the Government lose their cap and their hide-in Laois-Offaly but they will get their answer from the electorate throughout the country.  It is economic lunacy to decimate the midlands.  The livelihood of thousands of people depends on bog development.  There is no alternative employment in the offing.  If one examines the 1982 annual report on the cost per unit of milled and sod peat in the ESB operation one will see clearly that the figures being tossed around publicly are not the same.  One can see from that report that the unit cost arising from the mix of milled and sod peat compares more than favourably with the cost in many of the stations that burn imported oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the right decision is on its way.  We will welcome it when it is announced but we will recognise it as a by-election decision.  It is unfortunate for areas like south Roscornmon and east Galway that they do not have a by-election in progress.  I accept that the electorate there will be voting in the European election but we are aware of the Governments attitude to that election. In some areas the Government have thrown in their hat as far as that election is concerned.  South Roscommon and east Galway have not the opportunity to <Col N="2366" /> put the pressure on Government Ministers in regard to their area.  I am glad Deputy Naughten is present for the debate.  I suggest that if he does not stop being weak-kneed, as he has been up to now, in tolerating the 18-month reviewing of the Ballyforan project he will regret it.  I am aware what that Deputy and the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, said when in Opposition.  Now they are prepared to stay quiet while an 18-month review of the project is carried out.  I will give you a brief history of the project.</P>

      <P>In May 1979 the Fianna Fáil Governnment approved of a peat briquette operation to be started at Ballyforan, serviced by the Derryfadda group of bogs and to provide employment for 600 people.  That project was to be built in two phases and give production capacity to Bord na Móna for approximately 260,000 tons of peat briquetts.  Work went along nicely until the Coalition took office in 1981.  In that year work stopped and the project was pushed back for a review or to be considered by a committee or task force.  The hallmark of the Government is that they push decisions over to committees of inquiry, reviews or consultants.  They are not a substitute for decision-making.  The Coalition went out of office very quickly and then Fine Gael members during Question Time and Adjournment Debates were asking the Fiannna Fáil Government what was happening. They claimed that they put £8.4 million into the non-voted capital part of the capital budget for 1982 but they did not tell the people in south Roscommon that Bord na Móna were not in a financial position to remunerate that capital.  They did not tell the people that the European Investment Bank would not loan the money to Bord na Móna to continue with the bog development.  The memoranda that were before the Coalition Government were rejected out of hand and they were not prepared to take the unpopular but correct decision to put the financial <Col N="2367" /> position of Bord na Móna in order.  You did not do that.</P>

      <P>I recognise it every few seconds and I am looking at you.  I am not disregarding what you are saying, but you are inclined to break my stream of thought on this and I have to pull facts out of the air or out of my head.  The review of the financial position was carried out.  I took the politically unpopular but right decision in granting Bord na Móna a four-stage price increase which would remunerate them properly for their products which were totally underpriced at the time.  That put Bord na Móna in the position that they could go to the European Investment Bank and raise the money to proceed with their bog development programme, which had been stopped by the previous Government, and proceed with the Ballyforan project.  I announced here in May 1982 that the project was going ahead with one slight change.  Instead of the large project in two phases it was going ahead in two separate factories, one to give an employment content of 110 people with 300 people employed in bog development to service the factory.</P>

      <P>We went out of Government and the Coalition came in again. Again they stopped the work on the project, or rather they stopped it in their own minds or their own offices or whatever. They decided that this project was not proceeding.  What is the position today?  An amount of £16 million has been spent on this project.  There are contractual commitments to the tune of between £3 million and £4 million on this project.  A total of £20 million of taxpayers' money has gone into this project and the Government have been reviewing and reviewing this project for the past 18 months despite the fact that the review was carried out by Bord na Móna themselves in 1982 and the decision taken to go ahead on the basis I have just outlined. The Government have spent £20 million. They took the decision at Cabinet or ministerial level perhaps, but they did not pass that decision down the line, with the result that work has gone ahead, more and more money has been spent, more contractual agreements have been entered into which will have to be paid for and milled peat production in advance stockpiling for that project stands around 150,000 tonnes.  The ludicrous situation is that stockpiling has taken place for the project, £20 million has been spent and nobody, least of all Bord na Móna, know where this project is to go.  Is that good financial management by a Government who have constantly preached financial rectitude?  They stand indicted on their management of this and for not taking decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole problem of this Government in a nutshell is that they have taken no decision.  When asked the other day on the campaign why this Government were not falling out between Labour and Fine Gael I asked how they could fall out when they had taken no decisions.  Decision after decision coming up to this Government is being passed back to a committee of inquiry or for a consultant's report or to a task force.  I do not know why it takes 18 months to review an economic analysis of any project, the Ballyforan peat briquette factory or any other. <Col N="2369" /> but the Government cannot make up their minds as to what they are going to do despite the fact that all this money is being spent in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Today in Ballyforan the management called in the unions and said that they wanted to discuss redundancies in the whole bog development area.  I understand that tomorrow the worker directors will attend at Derryfadda for a full consultation on the situation.  Is this decision being made by stealth?  Have the management been told that the project is not going ahead?  I ask the Minister to clarify that tonight.  Why does it take 18 months for a Government to make up their minds in relation to it?  It should not take anything like that.  When they come to an analysis of this project neither I nor any other Deputy in this House want to see a very narrow economic analysis brought in.  Surely it is the kind of project we are looking for, based on natural resources in the first instance.  We want to develop natural resources.  I ask the Minister, the Leader of the Labour Party, if his party are committed to the development of natural resources, and if not, why not?  If this project is not going ahead why is it not going ahead?</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna were set up by an Act of the Oireachtas in 1946 to develop the peat resources of this country and in so doing to provide employment.  If any area at the moment needs employment, surely the Derryfadda area in south Roscommon and east Galway needs it badly.  To pull the rug out from under them at this stage would be national economic suicide. The Government have spent up to £20 million on the project.  They have 150,000 tonnes of milled peat stockpiled for the project and they have been sitting around for 18 months unable to make up their minds about whether to go on with it.  What are the drawbacks?  What has this delay cost the economy?  The delay in this project has opened up the market for German briquettes which are much inferior to our native briquettes but they are sweeping the midlands market.  This product is a very bad briquette made of dust and something else and does not compare in any way with the peat briquette from Bord na Móna which everybody <Col N="2370" /> here and abroad accepts as the best briquette on the market and can command a decent price.  They have allowed the Bord na Móna market to be undermined. Now the Government are putting a bigger job in front of Bord na Móna in trying to regain the market.</P>
    <P>It is not long since the market in the North was closed off to Bord na Móna because they could not get briquettes.  It is not so long since briquettes were rationed here and could not be obtained. With all the forward planning that went into this project, surely it is a negative Government and negative thinking that delay for 18 months.  If the project was not to go ahead it would have been decent to say so at the start and not spend taxpayers' money on Bord na Móna and allow outsiders to come in and take our market from us.  I look to the Minister to give us a clear decision, &mdash; surely that is not unreasonable after 18 months of dilly-dallying &mdash; that produce based on our natural resources that will provide employment in the black spot for unemployment which Deputy Naughten and Deputy Connaughton said, quite rightly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity I have not 42 minutes left because I could continue without any bother on a project such as this.  The Bord na Móna annual report for 1982-83 states that the turnover for that year as at 31 March 1983 was £91.63 million of which £80.46 million represented added value.  That is the type of industry this economy needs, that this country needs and that any Irish Government should be promoting.  Exports represented £13.5 million of that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna activities are very commendable in the area of horticulture and research into what to do with cutaway bogs.  Maybe the Minister will tell us whether he has a policy on the cutaway bogs.  It is high time that such a policy was set out clearly so that we can know what use is to be made of them.  I am aware of the research and development that Bord na Móna have put into this.  It <Col N="2371" /> is an area where employment can be increased and imports can be decreased by vegetable growing and the development of the cutaway bogs for grassland feeding for beef.  Bord na Móna are also proceeding with biomass development. They are a progressive semi-State body who should be allowed to go about their business which was held back for a few years because they lacked the financial resources to do the things they wanted to do.  Why should this Government hold them back for 18 months after I had set their financial situation right and given them the go-ahead and the opportunity to do it?  The Government stand indicted in the eyes of the taxpayers for having squandered money.  They stand indicted in the eyes of the people of south Roscommon and east Galway for having deprived them so far of opportunity.  We want a clear statement of the position from the Minister tonight.  My colleagues in speaking to this motion, whether they come from the area in question or from Laois-Offaly will elaborate on other aspects which they knew even better than I do.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I look forward to the Minister's statement here tonight and to a clear direction from the Government and the decisions that I believe imminent in the case of the ESB strategic plan.  If the Government did not intend going ahead with the ESB strategic plan, why did they accept the very expensive redundancy plan which concerned the closure of the same power stations and which was at a rate never before experienced in the State?  This involved six weeks' pay in addition to the average for redundancies. However, with the by-election about to take place, the Government may have to change their minds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion proposed by Deputy Reynolds and I am very disappointed that the Government are not accepting this motion.  Surely after an examination of the economic viability of this project, an examination spread over 18 months, the Government ought to have made up their minds.  It is almost five years to the day since Fianna Fáil in <Col N="2372" /> Government sanctioned the project but we are still in the dark as to its future. The decision of the then Government resulted from a deputation in 1977 from the local public representatives and the Ballyforan Development Association. We were given a favourable hearing and we continued to press for a decision. Much consideration was given to the project and almost two years elapsed before a final decision was reached.  Having been made aware that the project was sanctioned we hoped it would proceed rapidly. Naturally, we were very disappointed when, on the coming into office of a Coalition Government in 1981, a review of the whole matter was ordered. Obviously, there was no enthusiasm for the project so far as that Government were concerned.  Two years later there was a second review.  Because of all the confusion that has been created it is incumbent on the Minister to let us know what the position is.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil were in power in 1982 and at that time an interest was taken suddenly in the project by the Coalition Deputies in Counties Galway and Roscommon. Deputy Connaughton, who is now Minister of State, raised the issue on a number of occasions.  It was raised also by Deputy Naughten.  The matter was raised on the Adjournment of the House in May 1982 when the then Minister, Deputy Reynolds, said that a new factory would be built which would have a production capacity of 140,000 tonnes per annum with employment for 110 people. As Deputy Reynolds has pointed out, the factory was to be built in two phases.  In May 1982 he was speaking of the first phase.  His commitment was welcomed by the people of Galway and Roscommon but Deputy Connaughton's response was that we were getting only half a factory.  He repeated that assertion during the debate.  It was a negative approach on his part though we have not heard any such reference from him since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other point I should like to make about that Adjournment debate was that the Minister said work would commence on the factory within four months of that time.  The sod was turned in the following <Col N="2373" /> November which happened to be during a general election campaign.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As the record will show, that could not be labelled as an election gimmick because the Minister had said that the sod would be turned within four months of the debate taking place.  However, when the Coalition were returned to power they ordered a second review. I regret that Deputy Naughten is not here this evening but he will be aware, from meetings which we as public representatives have attended in Galway and Roscommon, that the feeling among the people of the area is that there is a bias against the project, that there is no enthusiasm among the Government for it and also that it represents discrimination against the people of the west.  It has been suggested also at these meetings that the reason for the lack of interest on the part of the Government is that the project was sanctioned by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The Minister should answer these various arguments.  Morale is very low among the workers concerned.  The 160 people in full-time employment there are very concerned about their jobs after these past 18 months of uncertainty.  In addition, the 45 to 50 people who worked there part-time have not been taken on this year.  For them that part-time employment was a very important supplement to their incomes since many of them are smallholders.</P>
      <P>We cannot afford to wait any longer for a decision.  Let us hope, therefore, that the Minister will announce a favourable decision this evening.  We had to wait a long time for a decision on another project in the area.  I refer to the Tuam sugar factory.  After many representations in that regard a decision was reached to maintain the factory.  We are talking here about the continuation of a factory that has begun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very proud of Fianna Fáil's record in regard to this peat briquette factory. From the moment it was sanctioned there was a definite commitment to proceed with the building.  The necessary financial <Col N="2374" /> arrangements were made.  The site was cleared in 1982 and the sod turned on 8 November of that year.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister why the project is not continuing.  The civil engineering contract was to go to tender early in 1983 but that was suspended following the change of Government. It was natural for Bord na Móna to assume they would enter into contracts. I understand that happened.  In one newspaper report I read it was suggested that contracts of up to £6 million were entered into by the board.  This semi-State body will find themselves in a serious position because they entered into contracts on the understanding that the project was going ahead but now they find that a second review is ordered and there is a possibility that the factory will not be built.  On 29 November 1983 I received a reply from the Minister for Industry and Energy on this matter.  He said that contracts entered into by Bord na Móna in connection with the factory project were as follows: site development, entrance road, turbine and generator, boiler, presses, screens, site lighting, site electrics and an intake system. All those contracts were entered into. The Minister should tell us the position regarding these contracts.  Will Bord na Móna have to honour them?  It seems obvious that they should have gone ahead when the sod was turned for the factory. The next phase would have been to put the civil engineering contract out to tender.</P>
    <P>Last year was a confusing one as regards trying to get that information about the future of Derryfadda briquette factory.  In June 1983 on the Estimates I asked the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, what was the outcome for Ballyforan.  He said that a review was to be carried out and spoke in terms of whether the investment would justify paying back loans.  I was amazed to hear that because I understood that all aspects of the viability of the project has been dealt with and that there was no economic argument against building the factory.</P>
    <P>When we discussed the Turf Development Bill in July 1983 the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, commented on the <Col N="2375" /> Ballyforan project.  He said that a review of the Ballyforan project which was projected in the revised Public Capital Programme for 1983, published by the Government, was at an advanced stage and that the Minister hoped to be in a position to put the outcome of the review to the Government within the next few weeks.  That was July 1983.  This is May 1984 and we still do not know what the outcome of that was nor did we have a Government decision to continue with the project.</P>
    <P>Last summer we met the Minister, Deputy Bruton, with a deputation from the area and after talking to him on 14 August we were no wiser.  He spoke about the review and said he hoped there would be a decision before the end of 1983.  No decision had been made.</P>
    <P>This year we were told that £15.4 million was provided in the Public Capital Programme.  In 1982 it was £8.4 million and last year it was £5.2 million.  All this money was provided yet the Government tell us the review has to be carried out and considered by the Government.  Last January the Minister said we would know the outcome within a few months.  I hope the Minister will tell us the position tonight.</P>
    <P>Galway and Roscommon County Councils are the local authorities involved. They have done a lot of work providing the infrastructure for the factory. They have co-operated in strengthening and repairing Ballyforan bridge which connects the two counties.  Roscommon County Council have provided a water supply and housing there.  We know it will benefit this area which has been so poor for so long because it was bog. There was no development there until Bord na Móna came in.  Roscommon County Council were so concerned about the delay that they held a special meeting to consider the review.  The meeting was held in January and Deputy Naughten told the meeting that there would be a decision on the factory within the next few weeks.  This phrase is used by Government Deputies, Ministers and Ministers of State.  It is disappointing that we have not had any definite decision.  I <Col N="2376" /> call on the Minister to give us a decision on this tonight.</P>
    <P>Farmers in the area sold the bog to Bord na Móna for as little as £25 an acre. They did this in the hope that there would be jobs there for their families so that their children could work in their own area.  They have, so to speak, given away their bog and it is frustrating for them to hear about reviews.  What could be more important than developing our natural resources and providing jobs in Counties Galway and Roscommon?  There is very serious unemployment in both these counties.  In the last four years unemployment in County Galway increased by 100 per cent.  The permanent jobs are in jeopardy.  The people involved are very concerned about their future.  I am sure they have written to the Minister and other Government Deputies.  They came into the Dáil on a number of occasions and made a strong case for an early decision. The small farmers got part-time work there which helped them supplement their incomes.  They are also disappointed at the long delay.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to give us a definite decision on the future of the project. It is the most important project in the west.  There is no economic argument against it.  We have waited for five years for a decision.  It would be welcome and end the confusion and boost the low morale of the workers in Counties Galway and Roscommon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I would like to refer to <Col N="2377" /> remarks made by Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Kitt.  Deputy Reynolds raised a question of the ESB's strategic plan and the fact that there would be by-election influences brought to bear on decisions about to be made by the Government.  It is an open secret that decisions will be made by the Government because they have had the plan for some time, but I want to put it on record that in the course of preparing a Department reaction to the strategic plan, at no time were my officials or myself motivated by by-election or any other election considerations.</P>

      <P>Quite the contrary. Deputy Kitt said there is a perception in the west that there is a Coalition bias against this project.  I emphatically refute that.  Any project within my ambit as Minister for Energy will be looked at on its merits.  The Deputy seems to feel that this Government &mdash; and the implication was that all Coalition Governments, or inter-Party Governments &mdash; have a bias against the west.  That too is something I would like to refute because it is obviously untrue.  It may be the Deputy's perception, and it may be many people's perception &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That depends on how one looks at it.  There is no in-built bias to making what has to be a straightforward decision on the merits or demerits of any capital intensive projects, like Ballyforan, which come before us.  In order to understand the difficulties now facing Bord na Móna in relation to a decision whether to proceed with the Ballyforan factory project, I feel it would be of assistance, <Col N="2378" /> and necessary, to try to understand some of the board's difficulties at the present time, and some of the serious problems which Bord na Móna face.  In that context I should put on the record of the House that Bord na Móna have had a great record as a semi-State company in the development of our national resources and in carrying out the whole programme for peat production.  If we look back at the history of this project we can see that the present situation is not caused by any one event but is a cumulation of a series of misfortunes over the years, some of which were brought about by the Opposition when in Government and some which resulted from external factors which directly and indirectly affected the financial situation of Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>To get a true picture of the position Bord na Móna now find themselves in over the Ballyforan project, we must go back to the oil crisis of 1973 and the formulation of the third development programme which was a response to it. Deputies will remember that this was a time when the high cost of imported energy caused a rise in domestic prices and the balance of payments deficit.  It can be said that the ensuing increases in inflation stemming from this period created huge problems for companies like Bord na Móna whose rising costs were not matched by corresponding price increases for their products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third development programme which commenced in 1974 was aimed at expanding peat production for electricity generation and for industrial and domestic use.  The programme was subsequently extended to the 78,000 acres, which is under development today; the main development area being west of the Shannon where it was planned to produce 700,000 tonnes of milled peat from the Derryfadda group of bogs in County Galway and County Roscommon.  It was originally proposed that this milled peat would be used to fuel an 80 mw power station in the Ballyforan area which would be located near the centre of the region being developed.  Subsequently, however, this plan fell through when the ESB decided that it would be preferable <Col N="2379" /> to provide extra generating capacity by extending the Shannonbridge station.</P>
    <P>In 1978 Bord na Móna indicated that they had reviewed their plan for the utilisation of the produce from Derryfadda and proposed that the milled peat should be used to produce briquettes at a factory to be erected on the Derryfadda bogs. The reasons given by the board in suggesting this change were two-fold&mdash;first, the market for briquettes had become buoyant and, second, supplies for the existing briquette factories were inadequate to meet demands.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of the oil price rises in 1973 had been to boost the sales of solid fuels.  Sales of machine turf had increased during 1973 to 1977 from 431,000 tonnes to 580,000 tonnes and briquettes from 330,000 tonnes to 360,000 tonnes in the same period.  In the case of briquettes the market demand was constrained by supply and all available production was sold.  Indeed, Bord na Móna estimated that an additional 150,000 tonnes could have been sold in 1977 if this amount had been available. It can be seen from this that there were strong arguments at this time in favour of using the milled peat from the Derryfadda bogs to produce an additional 260,000 tonnes of briquettes.  From an economic aspect also it seemed more advantageous to use the turf for briquettes than to generate electricity and it was felt that more employment would be created by the briquette plant.  An evaluation of the estimated capital cost of the project which took into account the price at which briquettes could be sold and indications of a possible future market convinced the Government of the time that a briquette factory would be an attractive alternative option to a power station.  In May 1979, Government approval was given to the erection of a briquette factory at Ballyforan.  The plan proposed was to erect a full size factory capable of an ultimate output of 260,000 tonnes but to equip it to produce 130,000 tonnes only as a first phase.  The estimated cost of the project was £13.2 million for the factory on top of the £16.3 million of bog development at Derryfadda <Col N="2380" /> which was being incurred anyway under the third development programme making a total cost of £29.5 million.</P>
    <P>Difficulties in financing the project beset Bord na Móna from the outset.  The board considered different methods of financing, the first being Exchequer financing which would be repayable in half-year instalments over 25 years at 12 per cent.  This was the most attractive method from the board's point of view, but it was ruled out by the then Minister for Finance.  The third development programme was already being financed by repayable Exchequer advances and the interest on these had been waived for a five-year period because there would be no return during this time on capital invested in bog development until the bogs came into production.  A request for an extension of this waiver for a further five years to help finance the factory was, however, turned down.  The second option involved seeking finance in the form of a loan from the European Investment Bank over a 15 year term repayable in the final 11 years at 12 per cent.  This would have required higher charges for briquettes than with Exchequer financing during the nineties which were regarded as crucial years for the project.  This method was used initially to finance bog development but was not available for the project when in 1981 the EIB refused to lend money to the board because of the tenuous viability of the project&mdash;as in the EIB view the sale price of products was too low.  Another option remaining was to finance the project completely from its own resources which would mean increasing sale prices for all turf products. Given that scope existed for increasing the prices of turf products which since 1973 had been underpriced in relation to other fuels, and in the case of briquettes so low as to require rationing to distributors, there seemed to be scope and the board had strongly pressed, indeed, for a price increase.</P>
    <P>The price of briquettes was subject to the decision of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in the light of recommendations by the National Prices Commission.  Bord na Móna's prices and, therefore, profits had been constricted by <Col N="2381" /> Government policy from 1974 onwards when prices were kept down; increases recommended by the National Prices Commission on allowable cost basis were in fact reduced by the then Minister for Energy.  It is of interest to give Deputies some insight as to the treatment which was meted out to Bord na Móna by previous Governments and, in particular by the Fianna Fáil Government of the day, in relation to prices sought by Bord na Móna as they endeavoured at that time to finance their projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister is not including me in that category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It was before the Deputy's time.  In October 1979 the board sought an increase of £9.5 million and the National Prices Commission recommended £7.5 million.  Regrettably, at the time from the board's point of view the Government approved £5.4 million, £4.1 million short of what Bord na Móna sought on a cost level basis to finance their project at that time.  In September 1980 an increase of 32 per cent was sought for domestic sales yet again by Bord na Móna, but the Government saw fit at that time to limit the increase to 10 per cent. In August 1981 an increase of 26 per cent was sought but the decision on this, in fact, was postponed to June 1982.  We should look at the overall implications from 1979 to 1982 in relation to what the board had sought and actually got from the Governments of the day.  As a result of the decisions mentioned just now, from 1979 to 1982 the total increase allowed in peat prices was only 28 per cent compared with approximately the 73 per cent it would have been on purely allowable cost basis if full National Prices Commission increases had been allowed. The effect of all of this on Bord na Móna in relation to the running of their affairs and their conduct of everyday business was to cause the build-up of a heavy burden of debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1979 the Government when giving their approval to the erection of the Ballyforan factory also approved the drafting of a Bill to raise the statutory limit on the amount Bord na Móna could borrow for <Col N="2382" /> the performance of their functions.  I have to say, looking at it perhaps with the benefit of hindsight at this stage, that surely it must be accepted that it was totally contradictory for the Government to withhold price increases, to allow interest payments on Exchequer advances for turf production to be deferred, at the same time to approve an extension of borrowing and also to allow a situation to come about in which because of Government policy the board were forced to sell their products at prices which, while remaining keenly competitive, would have to be recouped as a minimum, allowable cost.  It is true to say that if Bord na Móna had been free to increase their prices on a more reasonable basis during the seventies a stronger capital base could have been built up from the revenue generated and the board put in a stronger position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the subject matter of this motion, the Ballyforan project.</P>
    <P>On the board's side there were lower figures projected for cost inflation which ran at figures near the twenties over the critical years.  These higher cost inflation levels than expected, coupled with the fact that prices obtainable for the factory's output under the then pricing policy would be insufficient to cover projected total costs, resulted in a decision to proceed with the factory being deferred until the viability of the entire development programme had been reviewed.  The board had indicated that State grants and Exchequer finance, and interest waiver or deferment would in fact be required to make the project viable.  The Minister for Energy had a comprehensive review carried out, in conjunction with Bord na Móna, of the viability of the project and indeed of the financial needs of the board.  This review had particular regard to the financial resources which the board must derive, in the absence of Exchequer funds, from the sale of their products to enable their operations to go ahead.  Consequent on this review the Government approved in June 1982, in accordance with the board's proposals, a pricing structure for turf products which it was felt would enable the Ballyforan project to go ahead.  The <Col N="2383" /> increases, in the board's view, could not be applied all at once but were to be phased over the next year and these increases would be conditional on the Minister for Energy being satisfied that the relativities of the market warranted them.</P>
    <P>Since September 1980 the price of milled peat to the ESB has increased by about 145 per cent and sod peat to the ESB has increased by 48 per cent. Increases approved on the domestic market since 1980 were sod peat 66 per cent and briquettes 54 per cent.</P>
    <P>At this stage the land had been acquired, a bridge had been built and a road and railway tracks laid to facilitate development and indeed considerable bog development and factory site preparation carried out.</P>
    <P>The projected bog development and factory costs which had been in the region of £30 million in 1980 had now escalated to a sum expected to be in the region of £48.2 million.  In May of 1982, the then chief executive of Bord na Móna had stated that, even with realistic pricing levels, Bord na Móna would have to reduce the cost of the project and shortly afterwards the board decided to cut costs by scrapping the original plan and replacing this by a plan which would allow the project to be carried out, but with two separate factory units, the first of which would be designed to produce 150,000 tonnes with employment for 110 persons and to proceed at once; a second similar factory unit to be deferred until later. The effect of this would be to reduce factory costs by one-third and to ensure that the second unit would not be proceeded with until the success and viability of the first unit had indeed been established.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to look at the statutory obligations of Bord na Móna from which we can see that the board are required to remunerate capital fully, that is, to provide out of revenue for the payment of interest and the amortisation of debt.  The board as a statutory corporation have no equity capital.  Over the years sales revenue and depreciation provisions have <Col N="2384" /> provided some measure of self-financing, but prices sanctioned for their products pegged too low have not allowed the board to build up reserves of cash towards the cost of new development. Exchequer finance is no longer available following the Government decision in 1978, which, by wisdom or otherwise of the then Government, rejected the question of Exchequer advances for Bord na Móna's bog development programme.</P>
    <P>Continuing board anxiety over funding caused doubts to persist about the viability of the project and, as Deputies will be aware from the published estimates, over the last two years an appraisal of the project was carried out last year by my predecessor the Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy John Bruton, as part of a Government review of major public expenditure.  For a major capital project of long duration and slow initial payback&mdash;it takes seven years development expenditure on a bog before production from it can begin&mdash;the most comprehensive review was seen as essential.  The major cost elements had to be thoroughly examined, in the light of the board's own deep anxieties.</P>
    <P>This is something which Deputies may not appreciate.  In the course of the discussions which have taken place over the last few years in relation to the viability of this project there has been at all times deep anxiety by the board in relation to having the cost elements thoroughly examined to make sure that a major capital project like this would not be undertaken without having the viability ascertained. The marketing projections which were, obviously, of major importance, were also seen and have been at all times seen and understood by the board and by my Department in relation to the whole project of producing these briquettes. Mid-1983 saw a halt to world energy price rises&mdash;indeed, a fall in the price of oil&mdash; also keener competition emerged in the Irish solid fuel market and consumer spending on energy tightened.  A new briquette factory at Littleton had come into production.</P>
    <P>I am outlining these factors for the benefit of the House in relation to many variable elements, the many fluctuations <Col N="2385" /> which have taken place in the last number of years which obviously have a crucial bearing in relation to this project, the building of the factory and the coming on the market of 150,000 tonnes of briquettes and in relation to the marketing and marketability of this increase in production which will be coming forward from the Ballyforan project.  The indications from this review are that the project is one of considerable risk.  Its viability is based on the fulfilment of the assumption that the further annual output of 150,000 tonnes expected from Ballyforan could be marketed at the projected prices and that a rate of price increase could be assumed in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>Fears on this score persist.  Market resistance, indeed fall-off, has been encountered.  Bord na Móna's experience of higher prices and free marketing over the past year has meant that the third phase of the price increases already approved for briquettes could not be applied as planned because of a drop in sales.  Following one year's experience of a phased increase in the price of briquettes the board found that the market was sluggish and the price itself appeared to be too high.  In consequence, volumes were not being taken by the market from the new factory at Littleton.  This has caused doubts that market capture at higher prices could be easily achieved and underlines and re-emphasises the crucial nature of the marketing projections and the need for thorough reappraisal.</P>
    <P>In addition, because pressure by the ESB against the milled peat price increased, Bord na Móna have had to come to an arrangement with the ESB not to apply any increase since July 1982 in the price of milled peat.  The net effect of quantity and price shortfalls for all peat products has been to show a drop of £24 million over the past two years in the financial projections of Bord na Móna on which Ballyforan was planned.  In 1982-83 Bord na Móna had a surplus of £15 million to apply to debt servicing.  In 1983-84 the result is expected to be £13 million approximately.  In 1984-85 because of reduced volume expectations and price projections down on previous estimates, coupled with increased costs, the outturn <Col N="2386" /> is expected to be almost a break-even position with no surplus for debt servicing.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the financial exposure of the board arising from the situation which I have outlined to the House and which I have tried to present in a totally unbiased way because I understand the feelings of the Deputies not only on the opposite benches but in the Government parties in relation to a project like this, shows the need for a comprehensive review of further investment in the Ballyforan project.  Despite the criticism from the opposite benches in relation to the time lag in making decisions, in relation to the long period which has passed by, in relation to the Government making decisions, Deputy Reynolds is well aware of the fact that he had a considerable time and I am at a loss to understand why, if he was so convinced of the merits and viability of this operation, it was not commenced during his time as Minister.</P>

      <P>I received a communication from Bord na Móna.  I want to inform the House of the important aspects of this communication.  In this communication the board decided in their wisdom, having looked at the various questions raised by my Department with the board over the past 18 months, to look at the current situation and at all the aspects which I have outlined.  They looked at the marketing of solid fuels during the recession and they have admitted that the depth and duration of the recession is much greater than had been anticipated and the depression on the fuel market has been far greater than the board anticipated, demand has fallen and that competition is intense.

I am putting fairly and squarely before the House the <Col N="2387" /> information available to me for the benefit of the House rather than have anybody accusing me of misleading the House, not that I expect the Deputies to do anything like that.  The board formed the opinion having considered all the factors which were brought to their notice and from their own research on the project that this project should be deferred for a period of 12 months.  They feel this would be the best decision, given all the market uncertainty and the depression in solid fuels sales.  They have also brought to my notice that unless moneys are provided by the Government for ongoing development work, men will be laid off on this project.  In view of the information which has been brought to my attention this very day, there is no option but to suspend the project for one year.  A further review will then take place.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity of speaking on this motion but I am absolutely shattered by the Minister's speech.  When he changed his portfolio I thought that he, being an energetic young man, would bring a new dimension to the Department of Energy, which was being segregated from Industry, and that we would see energy projects moving forward, particularly projects which had been planned and <Col N="2388" /> analysed over a number of years.  All he needed to do was take a <i>de facto</i> decision and give people the opportunity to become involved in vital projects involving indigenous natural resources.  That did not happen.</P>
      <P>During recent weeks and months Deputies opposite have changed their stance in relation to this project.  When Fianna Fáil initiated this idea six years ago and made a decision on the project a year later, Deputies and Senators cast serious doubt as to whether the factory would be built.  Speaking in this House on 26 May 1982, Deputy Naughten stated:</P>
      <P>We stated clearly that the project would go ahead.  This was reiterated by the Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs while speaking in the area.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister is now leaving the Chamber.  Recently we have seen members of Government parties change their stance to blame Bord na Móna.  The thirty-third annual report of Bord na Móna for the years 1978-1979 stated:</P>
      <P>Derryfadda, south County Roscommon, is the board's 23rd and latest works location.  It will provide services for the development programme in the area which will embrace a total of 18,000 acres, providing employment for 590 people.</P>
      <P>The thirty-seventh annual report of Bord na Móna for the years 1982-83 stated:</P>
      <P>Design work for Ballyforan briquette factory progressed very satisfactorily and had reached an advanced stage by the year's end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt about these two reports emanating from an organisation which has served this country well since it was set up in 1946 by Fianna Fáil.  These are the sentiments and the commitments of the board.  It seems that recently, probably due to Government pressure in an effort to balance the books, they have been pressurised into a change of heart. That is what is being said in the media and at public meetings by Government <Col N="2389" /> spokesmen.  It is very sad for the west that the Minister should say:</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna, after extensive review, decided at their meeting on 25 May 1984 to suspend the project for one year, when it will be reviewed again.</P>
    <P>That is one of the saddest statements ever made in this House <i>vis-á-vis</i> the west.  Do the Minister and the Minister of State accept this?  Is the Minister for Energy presiding over the demise of that Department, similar to the situation over which he presided in the Department of the Environment?  Local authority workers are on short time and redundancy is staring them in the face.  The authorities are not in a position to provide the services to which people are entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is central.  The board are being blamed and they are being forced to review the project again. Fianna Fáil in Government gave commitments on various projects and always honoured them.  This Government are charged with the responsibility of running the country.  Are they reneging on that responsibility?  Are they afraid to invest money in an area which needs investment, in an industry which has proven conclusively over a number of years that it is viable and profitable?  Is this the attitude of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various reviews have been carried out by Bord na Móna and in 1982 they conducted a major review of this project.  It resulted in a decision by the board to go ahead with the Ballyforan factory and they were given full support by the then Fianna Fáil Government, as well as a further commitment that the financial position within the board would be rectified in order to ensure that the project would go ahead.  The then Minister, Deputy Reynolds, granted an increase in the price of peat briquettes to ensure that the energy projects would go ahead.  Not alone did Fianna Fáil see the need to stimulate the economy and provide <Col N="2390" /> employment by utilising our natural resources but they also saw the economic advantages of having a project like Derryfadda to offset our balance of payments and stem the tide of imports.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be giving the marketing position as one of the reasons the project cannot go ahead.  Is he saying that Bord na Móna are not able to market briquettes successfully?  Is he saying the board are falling down in their marketing strategy and in their ability to persuade people to purchase home-produced briquettes?</P>
    <P>No credit is due to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Bruton, who also indulged in this political procrastination, analyses and reviews.  During all this time we have allowed second grade German briquettes to be brought in here and this, of course, has affected the stability and the potential viability of the briquette production of Bord na Móna.  The longer we postpone a project like this the more expensive it will be to finalise it.  We have been waiting two-and-a-half years already and now, apparently, we will have to wait longer.</P>
    <P>Naturally, the effect on our balance of payments of being self-sufficient in domestic energy is incalculable.  The more home produced fuel we can get, and the quicker we can produce it, the better for Bord na Móna and other companies involved in energy supply, including the ESB.</P>
    <P>The viability of this project was assessed thoroughly by the IDA in 1982 and a grant was approved for it.  Surely that was proof positive of its potential viability.  The record of the IDA is known and respected worldwide.  We all know of their ability to attract here the best industries, the highest skills and technology. They approved a grant for this project but after the general election in 1982, when Fianna Fáil were not returned, the Coalition once again failed to go ahead with the completion of this factory, one of the few prospects the west had of getting much needed jobs.</P>
    <P>It seems that Bord na Móna have accepted the Government's attitude about postponing this for another year. We know there has been a change in <Col N="2391" /> personnel at the top in Bord na Móna and we know that earlier they were in favour of this project.  Every new head of an undertaking like Bord na Móna is due a honeymoon period and the Government used this to put official pressure on the board, many of whom are not in favour of the postponement.  This further postponement coincided with the appointment of the chief executive.</P>
    <P>We must consider what will be the cost of completing this factory at the end of another year, what will happen to the £20 million already spent at Derryfadda? Bord na Móna purchased 18,000 acres of bog cheaply from the farmers who had committed themselves to the project as a source of badly needed employment. Indeed the farmers virtually gave away the 18,000 acres.  What will happen to the turbines, the generators and the other equipment, some of which is lying under the elements in Ballyforan or in stores in Dublin rented at high cost?  Will all this not add immensely to the final cost of the problem and add to our ever-growing national financial problem?  Is it to be called financial rectitude?</P>
    <P>We notice particularly that Deputy Connaughton, the Minister of State, is not here tonight.  As a Senator he slammed this project at the beginning and became known as &ldquo;Senator Slam&rdquo;. Where is Deputy Naughten tonight?  Has he, too, run for cover as a member of a Government party who have no commitment to the west, to this project or to continued expansion by Bord na Móna, one of the finest semi-State bodies we have.  They are being denied the opportunity to expand and develop so that they could make a professional economic contribution to the most deprived and disadvantaged area in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Government are ignoring the importance of bogland for the supply of domestic fuel.  This could be vital to the economy in these days of scarce energy because it could help our balance of payments enormously.  I suggest that this postponement can be attributed to one man in the Government, the pin-striped politician, &ldquo;Mr. Bloomer&rdquo;, who has been unable to find the missing <Col N="2392" /> £500 million which has thrown the economy and the State's security into jeopardy.  Deputy Dukes has had a major influence and has played a major part in this postponement.</P>
    <P>The turf industry is vital and this was recognised as far back as the last century under an alien administration.  In 1933 Fianna Fáil set up a special section in the Department of Industry and Commerce to appraise and analyse the potential of turf as a contributor to the economy.</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the continuing dispute at Ranks and the steps the Minister for Labour proposes to take in the matter. The Deputy has been disallowed part of his request concerning the imprisoned worker as the Minister has no responsibility in that matter.  It is a matter entirely for the court and the Deputy has been so advised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter with the Minister for Labour.  This dispute has been in progress for some 18 months.  As the Chair has indicated, a man is in prison arising from the dispute.  I realise the Minister has no responsibility in that regard but I think resolution of the dispute could lead to the man's release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil debated this topic early last year.  The then Minister for Labour received a report on the dispute in February 1983 which went into considerable detail about the various elements.  At that time, the demand of the workers in dispute was that the redundancy payments being offered were far below the figures recommended by the Labour Court but Ranks were pleading inability to pay.  I commented then that it seemed extraordinary that a subsidiary of a huge multinational company, Ranks, Hovis and McDougall, in Britain, were pleading inability to pay adequate redundancy to <Col N="2393" /> men and women who had given long years of service to the firm and who had amassed great profits for that company.</P>
    <P>The dispute has moved on some distance since then.  In the intervening period the men involved have become far more interested in having jobs rather than in getting redundancy.  They have indicated to me that they are aware of at least three parties who are interested in the mill and in maintaining it as a going concern.  However, Ranks and the liquidator operating for the company are more interested in doing away with the milling section and in establishing the Phibsboro' facility as a distribution depot.</P>
    <P>In considering that aspect of the problem, it is worth referring to a circular letter received from the Irish Flour Millers Association dated 25 May 1984.  I am sure all Deputies, including the Minister, have received a copy of that letter.  It is signed by the chairman of the Irish Flour Millers Association and in the course of the letter he indicated that the Irish flour milling industry is under threat because of what he claims to be dumped imported flour from the United Kingdom.  In his letter he stated:</P>
    <P>Following the closure of the Ranks mill, a decision appears to have been taken by major milling concerns in Britain that they would seek to capture the total Irish flour market.  They have set about doing so by selling flour in Ireland at prices below those obtaining in the UK and this does not take account of the cost of transportation. The consequence to date is that 20 per cent of the domestic market has been lost to these mills, the larger of which exceeds in size the total industry here combined.</P>
    <P>The letter mentions a 20 per cent penetration by British flour millers in our domestic market.  At the beginning of last year in reply to a question, the then Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism indicated that imports of flour were in the region of 15 per cent.  There appears to have been a substantial increase in the amount of imports as a result of the closure of Ranks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2394" /> I am convinced that the closure of the mill is not unconnected with the fact that flour imports are rising fairly rapidly and there appears to be a concerted attempt to supply the Irish market with imported flour.  I have been told that in at least one instance baked bread is being imported daily which seems extraordinary given that we have a number of men who have demonstrated their capacity and willingness to work in that area.</P>
    <P>The whole question is tied in with the food processing industry in Ireland but I do not propose to go into that matter in detail tonight.  While mills are closing down in this country, approximately 80 per cent of the wheat used in Irish flour milling is imported.  It seems extraordinary that we do not appear to be able to grow sufficient wheat to mill flour for the Irish market, never mind trying to export it.</P>
    <P>For more than 18 months the men involved in this dispute have demonstrated their determination to work and to maintain their jobs.  They demand that a viable flour milling industry be retained.  Today we dealt with a Bill dealing with the hours of work.  In that connection the Minister of State indicated it was the intention of the Bill to improve job opportunities.  Yet we have a situation where a number of men have been sitting in in a mill simply demanding work.  We are told frequently that the work ethic does not exist in this country anymore but here people have demonstrated quite clearly that they are responsible and have what is called the work ethic, although I am not at all sure I would define the work ethic in the same way as those who talk about it in other respects.  These men have demonstrated their sense of responsibility because during the occupation they have ensured that the wheat in the mill has been maintained in good condition, that it has been turned over and sprayed for pest control and so on.  In fact, they have done a job of work for the liquidator and for Ranks in ensuring that the main asset in the mill has been maintained in good condition. That is something that should be kept in mind when discussing this dispute.</P>
    <P>As the Ceann Comhairle indicated, <Col N="2395" /> one man is in jail as a result of this dispute. I ask the Minister to refer to the fact and to state what he thinks can be done to achieve that man's release.  There are a number of questions which have to be asked in relation to this dispute.  What effect has the embargo which was announced by the government by way of press statements some time ago had, that the IDA would not involve themselves with companies where sit-ins were in progress?  Would the Minister indicate if that instruction has affected the dispute in Ranks?  What negotiations, if any, are taking place to ensure that the milling facility is retained at Phibsborough? Have the IDA made approaches to the three parties to which the Rank workers referred to see if there is a viable opportunity to ensure that jobs are maintained at the site?  Has the Minister tried to secure Harry Fleming's release?  There are a number of other points which do not relate to the Minister's area of responsibility.  The dumping of flour on the Irish market needs to be examined and has a bearing on the dispute at Ranks.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, if he has not already done so, to intervene directly in this dispute to ensure that jobs are maintained on the site, that the milling industry will not be taken over and destroyed by flour imports and to ensure that the men who have been struggling for so long to maintain their right to work and insisted on the right to do so will be given first opportunity on any jobs which may be created.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the House that this dispute began as long ago as January 1983, as Deputy De Rossa indicated.  Following a dispute over redundancy the company decided to close in early February 1983, offering statutory redundancy payments plus 60 per cent for an orderly closure.  The company also offered to fund company pensions at a stated cost of £250,000 per annum.  At that time Ranks employed about 300 workers, 70 in Dublin and the remainder in Limerick.  In a joint ballot of union <Col N="2396" /> members in Dublin and Limerick the majority agreed to accept the terms offered.  About 40 workers in Dublin refused to participate in the ballot.</P>
      <P>A separate ballot of the Dublin workers on 29 January 1983 rejected the company's terms.  Some of the Dublin workers decided to accept the company's terms.  The remaining 26 or so commenced unofficial industrial action and engaged in a sit-in on the day the mills closed on 4 February 1983.  Subsequently, the company sought and secured an injunction against those occupying the mills.  As a result of an order of the High Court not being obeyed 14 workers were imprisoned for contempt of court.</P>
      <P>A report on the dispute was prepared at the request of the then Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, by Mr. Ercus Stewart, Senior Counsel, and, following further discussions at the Employer Labour Conference, a formula was agreed on which ended in the workers concerned being released.  On 2 May 1983 the Minister for Labour, Deputy Kavanagh, appointed a mediator in the dispute, Mr. John Horgan, Deputy Chairman of the Labour Court.  Following a ballot Mr. Horgan secured the agreement of the workers in Limerick to a further set of proposals which were an improvement on the earlier ones.  Again, the workers in occupation of the mill in Dublin would not take part in the ballot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new proposals, which were accepted, provided for a substantial improvement in redundancy payments as well as a lodgment of £¼ million in a new bank account to meet the cost of these payments.  The agreement provided for a review of further payments every year up to 1988 and the mediator, in consultation with an independent chartered accountant, was to make a recommendation on the level of any further payments in the light of the trading position of the company and all relevant factors.  The final review in 1988 was not to exclude the mediator from making a recommendation for a final fixed settlement over future years.  The company undertook to continue the payment of unfunded <i>ex gratia</i> pensions and to make good any deficit of the non-contributory fund.  The <Col N="2397" /> situation is, therefore, that a settlement was arrived at in Limerick but, the sit-in in Dublin continued.  In relation to the settlement in Limerick, which a minority of workers opposed, a statement was issued by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions asking affiliated unions not to support the sit-in which was in progress. Congress stated that through the failure of workers not to abide by a majority decision former employees could suffer serious financial loss.  The statement continued that it would be intolerable if the democratic decision of the majority was to be set aside and thwarted by the actions of a small number of people.  If such actions were to succeed the result would be the negation of democracy in trade union affairs.  Unions must defend the basic trade union principle that was involved in this matter.</P>
    <P>A similar statement was issued by the main union involved, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, who deplored the refusal to uphold the fundamental principles of trade union democracy.  The national executive sought the full support of the Limerick Council of Trade Unions in expressing their abhorrence at what it described as &ldquo;the unwarranted intimidation and interferrence in the affairs of the local flour mill section&rdquo;.  I am putting these statements by the ICTU and the ITGWU on the record of the House as I do not agree with the tactics used by the former employees who have occupied the mill in Phibsborough for the past 15 months.  As Deputies will have gathered from my account of the course of this dispute, no effort has been spared in seeking a solution. The matter has been to the Counciliation Service of the Labour Court.  There has been a full hearing of the Labour Court itself and a subsequent meeting with the relevant division of the court.  A special report was commissioned by the Minister for Labour conducted by Mr. Ercus Stewart, Senior Counsel, and the Employer Labour Conference met late into the night where an agreed formula to release the imprisoned workers was arrived at.  Since last May a mediator appointed by the Minister has worked <Col N="2398" /> effectively and exhaustively to find a compromise acceptable to all.</P>
    <P>Ranks (Ireland) Limited are now in official liquidation.  The liquidator is acting under the supervision of the High Court and, as Minister for Labour, I have no authority to interfere in any way with the statutory obligations of the liquidator. I cannot interfere with the liquidator or direct him to sell the assets to any particular individual.  If the mill is reopened as a going concern I hope that priority would be given to the employment of as many of the former employees as possible.  I am referring to the 70 employees who previously worked in the Dublin mills.  I have been in touch with the mediator as recently as today following the request from Deputy De Rossa to have this matter raised on the Adjournment. As the House will be aware, the mediator was appointed last May by Deputy Liam Kavanagh, Minister for Labour at that time.  The mediator has informed me that he is receiving a report on the situation in Ranks from a firm of chartered accountants this week, following which he is to have further talks with the main union involved, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union on the entire matter.  The mediator has informed me that he is at all times willing to talk to any of the people involved in the dispute including those sitting in at the mill at Phibsborough.  Therefore I would ask the workers involved to pursue their claims through the normal trade union and industrial relations channels so that a final settlement to this very difficult dispute can be arrived at as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Labour, and on behalf of the families involved, it is a matter of deep regret that one of the workers has been imprisoned.  The Stewart Report in relation to the imprisonment of 14 workers last year stated:</P>
    <P>.... it appears that only the 14 men themselves can obtain their release from prison by applying to Court, giving an undertaking not to break the High Court Orders and so purging their contempt.  I think the matter is solely in their hands, and it does not <Col N="2399" /> appear that any outside party, including the Minister for Labour or the Department of Labour, or their union, could obtain their release from prison, as they are there on the order of a High Court Judge, purely by reason of a breach of an Order of a High Court Judge and a refusal to obey Orders of the High Court, prohibiting them from occupying or trespassing on the Company's premises.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of references in the press to the use of the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act, 1971.  Quite frankly that has not been the case.  That Act has had nothing whatever to do with the way in which the present situation has been dealt with.  It has not been used by any of the parties or by the Garda Síochána in this case.  Therefore, the use of the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act in trade union disputes does not arise in this situation. The situation described by Mr. Stewart is equally relevant, regrettably, in respect of Mr. Harry Fleming today.  While you have indicated, a Cheann Comhairle, that I have no function in the matter, in response to the matter raised by Deputy De Rossa, I would say simply that the Ercus Stewart judgment, to which I referred earlier regarding the 14 men who were previously imprisoned, stands in relation to Mr. Fleming today.  As a consequence I would ask him to reconsider his position and to realise that more can be achieved at the negotiating table than in prison.</P>
    <P>In relation to the vast number of other issues Deputy De Rossa raised &mdash; and on which I have many opinions, a lot of which would be shared by him &mdash; I have no official or legal responsibility in this regard and so I have confined my remarks exclusively to the issues at hand which relate to the labour relations aspect of the affair.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a party that is affiliated to the trade union movement, that has had a long and close association with the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union who indeed celebrate their seventy-fifth anniversary this very <Col N="2400" /> week at their annual conference.  That union, to my knowledge &mdash; perhaps Deputy De Rossa not being in the position I am in is not aware of it &mdash; has exhausted every possible avenue and will continue to use every possible avenue to find a democratic resolution to this problem. Although he did not say so, I know that Deputy De Rossa would be the first, on behalf of his party, to deplore the suggestions of non-democratic action that have been hinted at or connived at by some of the people who would have liked to support the workers in their legitimate struggle to secure their employment and the best possible deal for themselves.  As a trade unionist, and as a member of the Labour Party, with close links with the trade unions affiliated to my party, I regret very much that the procedures of the union&mdash;procedures that have in all cases been worked at by competent officials and have been negotiated by competent officials &mdash; have not been fully or properly observed by the majority.  There is a fundamental principle in trade union affairs; that it be non-violent, non-militaristic, in its traditions, background or current practices, that at all times it recognised that the strength of the individual is found in the majority opinion democratically arrived at.  In this instance the best interests of the majority of workers and of their families are to be found in the majority decisions freely arrived at without intimidation or recourse to extraneous influences of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I share very much the view of the House that as much as possible of Irish manufacturing capacity be utilised within the home market so as to ensure that we achieve the maximum degree of import substitution open to us.  Without necessarily referring to the various points Deputy De Rossa raised regarding the role of the IDA or indeed the role of the prospective three buyers, all I can say is that the mediator appointed by the former Minister for Labour is an extremely competent person in the area of industrial relations.  If there is a possibility of a purchaser, then those purchasers should make themselves known to the mediator, who would be more than anxious to meet <Col N="2401" /> them.  I think Deputy De Rossa is perhaps misinformed when he says that the Government gave a direction to the IDA not to attempt to find prospective purchasers for plants or factories which had gone or attempted to go into liquidation and were currently being occupied.  The Government gave no such direction.  The IDA indicated to us, by way of information, that it would be impossible for them to attempt to find prospective purchasers for such companies when those companies were occupied by workers, for whatever reason.  They simply informed us that that was their professional view as people who have a reasonably good record in this area.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to add to the matters raised by the Deputy except to say that I deeply regret the minute any worker is imprisoned in this country.  Personally I would like to be in the position <Col N="2402" /> in which I could ensure that no worker would find himself or herself in that position.  There is no labour law on the Statute Book that has any worker in jail today.  The legislation that has Mr. Fleming in prison today is the same legislation that had the 14 workers in prison before, that is their conscious contempt of court and of an order of the court.  They have the instruments of their release in their own hands and Mr. Fleming has the instrument of his release in his own hands, that is the purging of his own contempt.  For our part we will do everything possible to ensure a democratic and peaceful resolution of this sad affair, hopefully with the prospect of retaining a viable economically and efficiently run flourmilling industry.</P>

      <P>The rules for the taxation of married couples in the year of marriage were changed by the Finance Act, 1983.  That Act provides that, for the year 1983-84 and subsequent years of assessment, a married couple are <Col N="2252" /> to be taxed as single persons throughout the year of assessment in which marriage takes place.  A measure of relief is provided by way of repayment where the total tax due and paid by the couple under that arrangement exceeds the total tax for which they would have been liable if they had been married throughout the year of assessment concerned.  The relief is the amount which bears the same proportion to the excess as the period of marriage in the year bears to the full year.</P>

I may add that officials of my Department recently met representatives of the advisory committee to outline the proposed changes in the legislation.</P>

Secondly, provision for the restriction of smoking in certain designated areas and facilities used by the public. Thirdly, provision for the payment by tobacco companies of a health education levy of two per cent of their advertising and sponsorship budgets.  This money will be made available to the health education bureau for public education in the area of smoking and health.

    <P>The sum of £2,588,000 covered additional amounts due to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in respect of 1981 (£717,000), 1982 (£1,743,000) and 1983 (£128,000) and were based on revised estimates furnished by that Department in respect of those years.  The revised estimates were necessitated by pay awards to Post Office staff and an increase in the number of encashments of pension and allowance orders.</P>

      <P>The estimate for postal expenses for any year is based on the number of items which it is estimated will be posted in that year at the prevailing postal rates.  When actual costs become available subsequently from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs based on actual postings and actual postal rates an adjustment is made.</P>
      <P>The original estimate for 1983 provided for 23 million items of post in the year at an average cost per item of 26p. This amounted to £5,980,000 and an amount of £4,000 was added to cover the cost of postings to destinations outside the State giving a total original estimate of £5,984,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revised statements of postal expenses furnished by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in respect of 1981, 1982 and 1983 based on actual returns of postings for the two former years and more up-to-date estimates for the latter year indicated that a further sum totalling £7,251,000 was due split as follows 1981 &mdash; £3,856,000, 1982 &mdash; £2,015,000 and 1983 &mdash; £1,380,000.  At the time the original estimates for 1981 and 1982 were furnished firm up-to-date figures for the numbers of postings or average postal rates were not available because of the postal dispute in 1979.  The extra costs arose therefore out of increases in the <Col N="2277" /> volume of postings and increases in postal charges by comparison with the original estimate.</P>

The commissioners hope to receive the architect's report in the near future and will make a recommendation to my Department as to the placing of a contract.  My Department will then communicate with the school authorities.  It is not possible to state when building work may commence.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the article referred to by the Deputy.  The article seeks to dissuade pregnant women from smoking.  Reference is made to a 1902 survey which showed an increase in the miscarriage rate in French and Austrian women working in the tobacco industry.  It is not clear whether the increase could be attributed to the high incidence of cigarette smoking in this group of workers, due to cigarettes being freely available, or to occupational exposure to nicotine. In any event there is no evidence available to me to suggest an increased number of miscarriages in women workers in the Irish tobacco industry.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the present position regarding a <Col N="2295" /> grant of £166,000 made available some years ago for the Tallaght area, County Dublin, for the purpose of providing a community sports facility; if he will confirm that this grant is available, and make a statement on the conditions required to enable this grant to be obtained; if any negotiations are taking place with any association regarding the allocation of these funds at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The capital grant of £166,000 provisionally allocated to Dublin County Council towards the construction of a sports centre in the Tallaght area in 1980 is still available to that body.  In order to obtain the grant the county council will have to (i) identify and acquire a site for the proposed centre; (ii) satisfy the Department that the balance of the cost over and above the Department's grant will be available before the project commences; and (iii) make arrangements for the planning, management and maintenance of the completed facility.</P>
      <P>Dublin County Council have had negotiations with a number of community organisations in the area in order to identify a site for the centre.  Agreement has not been reached as yet.  My Department have recently written to Dublin County Council requesting full details of the latest position regarding the project and is awaiting a reply.</P>
