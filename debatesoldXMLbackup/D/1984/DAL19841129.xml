      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 2, 3 and 4.  By agreement, and notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the speech of every Member contributing to the debate on item No. 3 shall not exceed 15 minutes with the exception of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance who shall speak for not more than 30 minutes.  Also by agreement, if a division is challenged on item No. 4 today the taking of such a division shall be postponed until 8.30 p.m. next Wednesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I notice that we have neither the Taoiseach nor the Tánaiste here this morning.  I should like to draw your attention, Sir, to at least an implication in the Constitution that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste should not be absent from the country at the same time. It is extraordinary that the Tánaiste should find it appropriate at this time to go on a junket to the United States&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when this country is falling apart.  That by the way, may I ask the acting head of the Government, Minister Bruton, if it is proposed to provide time in any shape or form today for the House to discuss what is probably the most single important matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We had this twice yesterday.  I ask the Deputy not to start a debate on the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not start a debate on it but the question of bank and mortgage interest rates is of crucial importance at the present time, not least because the document <i>Building on Reality</i> was based&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not pursue the matter.  I will leave it to the commonsense of the House to understand the importance of the matter.  As you know, it was suggested yesterday that the Whips should get together and try to come to some agreement.  As I understand it, no agreement has been forthcoming between the Whips.  The Chair ruled out Private Members' Questions on it.  I should like to ask the Government what, if any, arrangements they can make for the House to discuss this crucially important matter today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste, to whom the Leader of the Opposition referred, is in the United States on industrial development business and I am confident the results will be of considerable assistance to the country.  As to the request made by the Opposition for a debate on interest rates, the Opposition have already indicated their agreement to the Order of <Col N="1093" /> Business for today which concerns three other matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have to have agreement to the Order of Business, only to certain arrangements for taking it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Government have considered this request and they do not think a debate of the kind sought by the Opposition would be either appropriate or helpful in view of the statutory functions conferred by this House on the Central Bank in relation to the management of interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to enter into any disputation.  The Minister referred to a debate of the kind sought by the Opposition.  We are not wedded to any particular form of debate.  We would settle for a Private Notice Question.  We would be prepared to have a short one, two or three hour discussion or we would be prepared to settle for a statement to the House by the Minister for Finance to which party leaders could reply.  I suggest to the Government that this is a matter of great urgency and of deep concern to many people.  It is obvious that if bank interest rates rise mortgage interest rates will also rise.  Surely because of its fundamental importance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In the view of the serious statements that have been made by Mr. <Col N="1094" /> Frank Chao of Hong Kong with regard to Irish Shipping, will the Government please let the House know now exactly what is the alternative to liquidation and will they postpone the relevant date?  It is a very serious matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>I wish to make a few comments on the extension of the time for the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown to report.  When a motion was moved in July seeking an extension to 1 December, we got a categorical assurance that the work of this <Col N="1099" /> committee would be completed by then. A number of Deputies &mdash; Deputy Shatter in particular &mdash; stated that they saw no reason why the committee should not complete their deliberations by 1 December. We are now being asked to extend the time to 19 February 1985.</P>
      <P>I ask the Chairman of the committee who has moved this motion if he can give us an assurance that this will be the last time he will come in here looking for an extension of the time.  Can he also indicate how often the committee met since the period was extended in July?  Did the committee meet in July?  Did they meet in August?  How many times did they meet in September, October and November? How many members of the committee attended those meetings?  How many of the meetings had to be adjourned because of lack of attendance by members of the committee?</P>
      <P>I put these questions because there is considerable concern that this committee appear to be grinding to a halt.  They do not appear to be able to conclude their deliberations.  It is very unsatisfactory that more than two years after the programme for Government promised the setting up of this committee in November 1982 and that they would report by December 1983, in December 1984 they are now looking for a further extension. Could we have an assurance from the Chairman of the committee that this is the last extension they will be seeking?</P>

      <P>I can well understand the anxiety caused by this delay.  If we were in a position to make our report available today, Deputy De Rossa would not be one bit more happy than we would be.  This is a very broad area.  It is not a matter of 16 people deciding whether or not to recommend a referendum and leave it at that.  We had to cover a very wide field.  When I made the application last July I was of the opinion that we would be able to report early in December. There were circumstances outside of our control.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> We had several hundred written submissions before us and 24 oral submissions. All of those had to be examined in detail.  We now have our first draft available.  We are dealing with people, and with a major problem.  It is very important that every aspect is examined. I should not like to come in here with a report which was not a good report, and which omitted something it should contain, or included something it should omit.  On 19 February we will have our report before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the attention of the House to the three major elements which we believe are contained in this report?  It is perfectly clear that the perception of the Office of Public Works, a subsection of the Department of Finance, which has been abroad for many years may be a little unkind to the Office of Public Works to the extent that our investigations showed clearly that quite often the difficulties and the unarguable waste of moneys which arise are not matters over which the OPW have immediate or total control.  I hope the report highlights adequately the degree to which client Departments with which the Office of Public Works deal are responsible on many occasions for problems in respect <Col N="1101" /> of which the OPW are asked to accept responsibility and are blamed.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it is clear in the report, and we are quite unequivocal as an all-party committee in asserting, that in their operations there are very significant systematic operational defects which give rise to management controls which are unsatisfactory, unacceptable and inevitably waste public money.  Thirdly, apart from pinpointing areas of deficiency in the samples of projects which we dealt with, the report also puts forward &mdash; and from my point of view this is the main contribution of the report &mdash; constructive and detailed proposals for implementation which we believe could make a major contribution to eliminating the problems as we saw them.  That constructive approach underlines the spirit in which this report was tabled before the House and which permeated the work of all members of the committee.  I hope that will be accepted by all those who have a chance to contribute to this debate and the Departments concerned in the report.</P>
      <P>The report systematically examines a relatively small area of the operations of the OPW.  That is outlined on page 6 of the document. In regard to the part of the report dealing with project procedures used in the acquisition and fit out of premises, we thoroughly examined 26 projects. At present the Office of Public Works are dealing with approximately 400 to 450 projects, so the sample is relatively small.  However, a careful examination was carried out to make sure that the sample was typical.  The projects involved the period 1981 to 1983.  It should be said that it did not deal with last year or, presumably, with current practice.  The 26 projects comprised a total of 349,152 square feet and covered a range of projects varying in cost from £13,000 to £1.2 million and in size from 800 square feet to over 50,000 square feet.  Accordingly, we believe that it is reasonable for us to deduce from that typical example that there are lessons to be learned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems which arise have been there for very many years and the essential <Col N="1102" /> problems are in relation to the systems &mdash; the absence of proper management controls at present and for many years to ensure beyond reasonable doubt that the public are getting value for money.  My committee are not satisfied that those controls exist at present.  We believe that that case cannot be contradicted or argued against.</P>
    <P>In relation to what the Office of Public Works have to endure &mdash; and they do so silently and, in my view, wrongly at present&mdash;in relation to the demands made upon them by client Departments, by which we mean Departments of Government, it was clear from our report and our work that on occasion client Departments, either asked of the Board of Works specifications or introduced changes in their specifications regularly and in a very cavalier spirit, occasioning large increases in cost, delays in the implementation of the particular works and slowing up of the project beyond acceptance.  The Office of Public Works on such occasions should spell out clearly where those cases arise.  One of the recommendations contained in our document on page 38 suggests a relatively simple solution for that problem of people going to the Board of Works saying that they would like another 20,000 square feet and a change from the original plan to open plan when the project has been six months down the line, namely, insisting that client Departments pay for the costs of all that they consume in the course of their work.  If the Office of Public Works are the repository of excellence in this general respect and if they are to lay down standards of operational control, in handling the taxpayers' money they should tell the Department &ldquo;We will give you whatever you want but you will pay the bill.&rdquo;  That simple recommendation is one that I have reason to believe would commend itself to the Office of Public Works at present. I am convinced that that is the way forward in relation to dealing with the difficulty of clients indulging the luxury of changing their minds months in, month out, and having the taxpayer foot the bill. Ultimately, I do not mind how it is done <Col N="1103" /> but we are insistent that it be dealt with. In fairness to the Board of Works, it should be said that the staff involved and successive departmental heads have had to endure this difficulty.  This has to be said very clearly.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it can also be said &mdash; and in our view must be said &mdash; that even within the context of the Office of Public Works at present there are operational changes which should be introduced in order to ensure value for money.  The office at present deal with a budget of approximately £155 million.  Obviously, it is not scientifically possible to extrapolate precisely how much money can be more wisely used or saved on the basis of the sample which we took.  However, certainly there are implications if it is reasonable for us to say &mdash; and we say so on the basis of scientific advice and expertise available to us from a number of resources which arose in the context of numerous meetings both with the committee and the officials of the Office of Public Works and agents for these bodies, before, during and subsequent to the report being produced &mdash; that savings of a certain amount could be made if proper procedures applied in relation to the projects with which we dealt, it is a reasonable assumption that there is at least a projected ongoing saving in the areas with which we have not dealt.  However, we cannot be as certain about that as we are about the areas which we examined. We are saying that, in general the manner in which the Office of Public Works at present handle projects leaves a fair bit to be desired.  We would like to point specifically in that respect to the findings in our report.  We say, for example on page 9, that in 24 of the 26 cases the overall project period was excessive and that the period for rent paid to occupation was grossly in excess of what would be accepted or sustained in the private sector, particularly in the cases of the ten projects where it was over two years and the two projects where it was over three years.</P>
    <P>We say further about start date for rent that there were substantial delays which <Col N="1104" /> caused loss of money and we spelled this out.  Rent paid up to occupation, we say on page 14, was in our opinion excessive in 24 of 26 cases and grossly so in the majority of instances.  Rent paid up to completion was in our opinion excessive in 23 of the 26 cases and grossly so in the majority of cases.  There were nine projects in which this period was greater than three months and in some cases it exceeded 12 months.  We say that the brief from the client Departments &mdash; the matter to which I referred previously &mdash; was a major contributor to the problem in nine of the 26 projects, a very substantial and significant figure which essentially at the present moment is outside the control of the Office of Public Works as they now operate, even though they are blamed by the public for these problems.  Regarding the start date for rent, in our view, in eight of the 26 cases mentioned leases were entered into at too early a stage and on each occasion the client brief had not even been defined prior to a lease being entered upon.  That is just not acceptable. In my view, it was almost incredible.</P>
    <P>We maintain that approvals caused major delays in 17 of the 26 cases.  These are mostly the responsibility of the client Department but in some cases were due to delays in getting landlord approvals, which shows some shortcomings in programming the fitting out project.  We say that this was only a major contributor in four cases but although that was so it was, nevertheless, a contributor in 15 of the 26 cases.  We suggest that the bid procedure in the Office of Public Works is not particularly complex as at present operated, and as they are the project managers they have responsibility for processing matters through their own system and improvement is called for in that respect.</P>
    <P>With regard to the construction periods we say that they were longer than would have been expected for the scale of the project in 12 out of 26 cases.  With regard to design layouts in general, these were produced in good time and were not a significant contributor to the problems arising.</P>
    <P>The analysis in brief of the 26 projects <Col N="1105" /> indicated the absence of the following: (a) A method to highlight the rent paid before occupation; (b) A method to highlight the extra inflation and interest charges occasioned by delays; (c) A system whereby client Departments are directly aware of the extra rent, fees, etc. occasioned by their delays, but absorbed in the Office of Public Works overall vote.</P>
    <P>From this, we say it is clear that a review of the existing procedures for the management of overall cost and programme of projects in the Office of Public Works is essential.  In essence, a major criticism which must be spelt out here is contained in page 17, paragraph 35 of the report where we were informed by the Office of Public Works, from whom we received nothing but courtesy and co-operation throughout this whole review, and by the Department of Finance that there is no routine procedure for comparing the actual out-turn of individual projects with the initial feasibility study.  In other words, people do not evaluate value for money comparing the out-turn with the initial feasibility project.</P>
    <P>My colleagues will deal with many of the other issues which arise.  The controls operated by the Department of Finance obviously do not operate properly.  We found no evidence whatever of the guidelines set out in the circular from the Department of Finance issued in March 1983 about capital projects having been implemented in the projects in the report.  The report before the House offers a systematic evaluation in that respect.</P>
    <P>Finally in relation to the question of rents, I want to make the point that there is difficulty in being scientifically accurate about assessment of rent but, in general, in our opinion the Office of Public Works had done a much better job in that area and credit to them for that.  I would like people to be able to take the report as a balanced one which gave credit where it was due and said honestly and openly what was necessary to be said.  The Office of Public Works may be doing themselves an injustice because they do not spell <Col N="1106" /> out sufficiently clearly to the public this question of value for money.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the report as a constructive contribution to a debate which it is hoped will assist him in the work he is doing in the Office of Public Works and which will ultimately prove to the public that the House can organise its affairs to ensure in an nonpartisan way that we can evaluate the way we do business and improve on it.  I thank all those who participated in the work, both officials and members of the committee, for the honest, forthright and very constructive way in which the work progressed.  I submit the report to the House.  I know my colleagues will deal with other aspects of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the adoption of the report by the House as proposed by the chairman of the committee. As the chairman said, the significance of this report is not just the analysis it made of things past, but from the point of view of those who served on the committee, the most significant aspect is the recommendations and conclusions we made in respect of procedures to be adopted for the future.  Neither the committee nor the House as such has authority to implement actions.  That remains a matter for executive responsibility, the responsibility of Government.  I hope as a consequence of this examination, which is very detailed and objective, that the Minister will be able to indicate to us that the Government will take note of the recommendations of the report and are determined to act on them.  To the extent that the Minister or the Government take issue with the conclusions we reach, we will accept that if the Minister gives reasons why our recommendations cannot be acted on.  Before he indicates whether the Government will act on them, it is important that the report be treated seriously.  If the Government do not propose to act on it, then they should tell us.  All these matters are matters of executive responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this committee we ranged over a wide number of areas.  This is a good example of the useful role of an all-party <Col N="1107" /> committee.  I acknowledge the excellent consultancy advice we had and the excellent, though limited, secretarial advice we had.  It was limited because only two people were involved.  We could only come to broad conclusions on the basis of the analysis we undertook and on the basis of the advice available to us.  That is why I said the Government could not overlook their responsibility.  Ideally within Government Departments there should be, as recommended in the Aireacht proposal contained in the Devlin report, that kind of analysis and serious scrutiny that we undertook so that the Minister could ensure that nothing would be spent over and above what is required to be spent and that public money would be accounted for by the only person who is accountable at any time, and that is the Minister.</P>
    <P>Hopefully this committee will continue in being under any administration.  It is important that whatever Government is in power would not just say that the committee have reported and have said their piece but there is no binding obligation on us to do anything.  The response of the Government to this and other reports is vitally important.  If it transpires that the Government do not take it seriously or do not implement the conclusions the committee have reached, then the committee will have to take another view of its role.  That is not something any of us who served on it would want to do.</P>
    <P>The report is sharply critical of some of the procedures or lack of procedures in the Office of Public Works.  It is particularly critical as well of the expenditure incurred through, one could say, the irresponsible attitude of client Departments to the Office of Public Works.  It is not good enough for Departments, with guaranteed taxpayers' money funding them, to present a brief which is not fully prepared or documented.  It is not good enough for them to change it halfway through or before it is concluded and, even if it is concluded, for them to engage in internal discussions before the premises in respect of which they made the original request to the Office of Public <Col N="1108" /> Works are occupied.  We found delays of up to two years and over between the date of request and the date of occupation in respect of premises which were originally earmarked at the request of a client Department.  That is not good enough. We recommend that from now on that should be chargeable to the client Department or should appear on their Estimate as an obligation on them.  Someone must be responsible.  To the extent that that the Office of Public Works is responsible let that be recorded against them, but it is not so in every case.  It is important that that be said.</P>
    <P>We were dealing with the market conditions for renting and leasing in Dublin in 1981, 1982 and some of 1983.  During those years the Office of Public Works, acting as agents for the State were the dominant force in the market place.  In 1981 the Office of Public Works had taken leases on 43 per cent of the total office space in the city.  Add to that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, which operated independently and did its own leasing arrangements, and the semi-State bodies which are not included in this, it would be fair to say that on a conservative estimate at least 60 per cent of the total office space in Dublin in that period was leased or rented to the public sector, namely the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>That raises a number of questions. That was a period &mdash; end 1981 coming into 1982 &mdash; when the rental demands on the part of the owner-occupiers from whom the State was leasing or renting were at the highest level.  In this report, in the annex to it and the letter from the OPW to the committee, the OPW point out that we were dealing with property in a seller's market.  The demand was considerable, therefore the OPW and others had to respond to that demand by the high levels of rents and by paying rents in advance of occupation.  The significant thing is that it was the State itself in that period 1981-82, which created and inflated the demand.  The State must have been regarded by the property developers and occupiers around this city as being almost Santa Claus or a fairy godmother, and most people who would consult on <Col N="1109" /> this would find that the State was regarded as being a very desirable client (a) because what it paid was guaranteed, and (b) because it paid the highest rents.  I think the Minister was responsible during most of this period so he may be familiar with the circumstances during 1981-82 and might be able to give us some indication on that.</P>
    <P>We also point out in this report that on the 26 projects that we examined, if the recommendations were adopted there would have been a saving of at least £2 million.  That is a considerable sum of money, roughly on average £77,000 per project.  It is important that we see the significance of that and ensure that henceforth, whether it be the responsibility or the blame of the client Department or within the procedures of the OPW, that kind of money will not be spent unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>It is significant that that office operates under the Department of Finance.  I want to make a comment in respect of the Department of Finance because that Department and ministry have been lecturing the rest of the country for a considerable time about how we should be disciplined and should not be wasteful of public money.  In a constant series of lectures and directives they tell the rest of the country how to behave responsibly. This report says that we were very concerned that no regular and routine management controls are operated by the Department of Finance, the very Department who are setting themselves up to lecture the rest of the public service on how we should have proper control of procedures.  I hope the Department of Finance and whoever occupies the role of Minister there at any time will ensure that what they preach, and have been preaching recently in particular, to the rest of the country they will adopt themselves. They might adopt píosa beag Fiannaíochtá, the principle of beart de réir ár mbriathar.  Otherwise we shall find a certain degree of cynicism on the part of the public.  In the time available to me I cannot go into the detail of the points made in respect of the Department of <Col N="1110" /> Finance, but it is vital that paragraphs 44 and 45 be noted.</P>
    <P>Much of this has arisen because almost all Government office space is here in the city and we are competing with ourselves. The taxpayer is being made to compete with himself through various agencies, semi-State companies, An Bord Telecom and the OPW, to pay the highest prices in this city.  For that reason, during our period in Government when I was Minister for Finance, we came to the conclusion that we should decentralise the offices of Government throughout the country where the rentals that would be charged would be much less, where space is available and where for a variety of good social and economic reasons this would be desirable.  I can only say as a personal interpretation, supported nevertheless by the facts, that this report is one of the strongest arguments one can get for decentralisation of Government offices.  Perhaps the Minister will take that on board and report back to the Minister for Finance so that the Government can review the decision they took to cancel the decision we took to decentralise Government offices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report.  I am proud as a member of the Committee on Public Expenditure to have made some small contribution to its content.  I compliment my colleagues on the committee and also the secretariat who worked in conjunction with us in coming to the conclusions before the House.  The amount of work that had to be handled by the officials in recent months was very large and the assistants are a credit to the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee on Public Expenditure were set up with other committees because of criticism about the relevance of the Dáil system today.  The performance of this committee has justified the decision of this House.  I was interested in becoming a member because I felt that the standards being adopted in the public sector in spending taxpayers' money were somewhat different from the standards adopted in the private sector.  Unfortunately, to date my experience on this <Col N="1111" /> committee has confirmed this view.  The whole question of public spending must continue to be scrutinised in depth so that value for money in the public sector programmes is obtained and guaranteed. Overall spending in the public sector is now a terrible burden on the economy. Work being carried out by our committee in recent months has aroused considerable interest in both the public and commercial sectors.  Public sector spending is becoming a greater and greater issue by the day because of the high proportion of national resources being devoted to the public expenditure programme.  We have managed to identify areas where large spending is taking place and we have set about investigating whether the money being spent in this area is being spent positively and economically, and also whether the organisation and financial management are efficient.  In other words, our job is to ensure that the overburdened taxpayer is getting value for money.  This is vital because of the critical state of our economy at present.</P>
    <P>My opinion after over 12 months on this committee is that the Irish economy and the Irish taxpayer have suffered badly over the years.  Members of the Committee on Public Expenditure have still a massive task in coming to grips with gross abuse of public money that has taken place in certain areas.  We approached our task conscious that, because of the shortage of public finance and the over-taxation of our people, the money being spent in the public sector must be spent efficiently.  We tried to approach the problem constructively at all times, and we have done so ignoring political division.  In other words, we have done it in a united way.  In the short time the committee have existed we have demonstrated that we are determined to come to grips with the problems in areas of public expenditure.  Overall we have received co-operation from officials and public servants, but from time to time I have detected a certain resentment that we should be making these sort of inquiries and investigations.</P>
    <P>The House may recall that earlier this <Col N="1112" /> year the committee took evidence from officials of the Office of Public Works on procedures operating in the board on the rental of accommodation on behalf of Government Departments and offices. The committee, and indeed the public generally, had been very concerned to learn that a number of office blocks rented and leased by OPW on behalf of the State were, in fact, lying idle and unoccupied.  Questions were raised as to how that could come to pass.  Given that the economy was operating during a continuing period of severe budgetary constraints, the committee felt that urgent attention should be devoted to inquiring how hard-pressed taxpayers' money was being channelled into office accommodation that was not being put to immediate use.</P>
    <P>From statements supplied by the Office of Public Works on 22 projects it was clear that in some instances considerable delays had occurred between the date leases were signed and the dates offices were occupied by the staff concerned. There are a number of outstanding examples: in the case of the new Garda Metropolitan Headquarters at Harcourt Square the lease commencement date was June 1981 and the buildings in question were not occupied until the middle of 1984. That is a scandal.  In another case, in Harcourt Street, Dublin, a lease was signed in January 1982 while the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs did not move into the building until March, 1984.</P>
    <P>This; and other disturbing information which emerged during the taking of evidence from OPW officials in January and February, led the committee to the conclusion that something was amiss in the whole area of acquisition of accommodation on behalf of the State.  Because there were financial and technical aspects involved in reviewing the board's role in the property market generally consultants were engaged.  It is their report that is before us.  Because of the committee's reservations about the overall picture presented up to that date, the consultants were also directed to examine in as much detail as possible the project procedures <Col N="1113" /> operating within OPW to control the overall cost and programme of office fit-out works and the provision of new office buildings.  Part of the consultants' brief was to compare those procedures with the best practices operating within the private sector.</P>
    <P>The committee's report before the Dáil summarises what has been the practice in the Office of Public Works in the area of acquisition and fit-out of office accommodation and makes recommendations how these must be improved.  I have to say that the committee was very concerned to find that overall project control left a lot to be desired.  The main problem areas identified by the Committee were:</P>
    <P>(1)  An examination of the overall project period in almost all cases showed that the project period had been excessive and the period for rent paid to occupation was grossly in excess of what would have been accepted or sustained in the private sector.</P>
    <P>(2)  Client Departments were in many cases responsible for long delays in construction and occupation of premises because they either delayed the completion of briefs or changed their minds on layout and so on before or after leases have been signed.</P>
    <P>(3)  The committee felt that the Office of Public Works, given its important role in the property market generally, should have been able to exercise a much more dominant influence both on client Departments and on property owners.</P>
    <P>An example of that is that the OPW never seek to go to arbitration where disputes arise.  They are uncompetitive.  In fact, there is evidence to show that in regard to an office block in Dublin the OPW have paid a lot more than another State body.</P>
    <P>The committee's report is divided into two fairly distinct areas: (1) project control; (2) rental and lease terms.  It was because of the importance of these two issues in their own right that we decided <Col N="1114" /> that the report should contain separate conclusions and recommendations on project control and rent-lease terms.</P>
    <P>As time is limited for the debate on this report and other Members wish to comment on individual sections of it, I shall conclude by pointing out that the committee was concerned with an expensive though relatively small area of the operations of the OPW.  Hopefully, when we begin the review of the board generally, we will not uncover a major waste of public expenditure in other areas. While the committee's report has some critical comments on the management of projects and property acquisition, I hope these comments are seen by the Commissioners of Public Works as constructive. I see no reason why tighter management and overall professional control should not be the order of the day in OPW, which is after all an area where there is a lot of professional knowledge and experience.  The committee hope that when it looks at the area in about 12 months' time many of the recommendations made will have been acted upon.</P>
    <P>There were many areas we did not like to comment on because the OPW were nervous about maintaining confidentiality. For that reason those matters could not be referred to in a public report.  I hope steps will be taken to act on some of our recommendations but my instinct is that a lot of them will never be implemented. Not only will public money continue to be wasted in this area &mdash; I am not referring to the OPW alone &mdash; but I believe it will continue to be wasted in all other Government Departments.  In my time as a member of the committee and in my dealings with other State groups I have noted a general lack of accountability with regard to the spending of taxpayers' money.  It is my belief that regretfully this will continue unless accountability established.  Until such time as people are identified if they make mistakes, this sort of practice will continue.  We have had examples recently where bad decisions involving State companies were made and those responsible got away handsomely, they got away financially well out <Col N="1115" /> of it.  The sufferers in such cases are the employees and taxpayers.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>As public representatives we must ensure that those who make bad decisions are brought to heel, disciplined and made pay the price in some way.  Until that is done we are all wasting our time.  We hear a lot about political interference in semi-State bodies from time to time. Accusations of political interference are made when things are going well, but when things go wrong we hear that political neglect is bringing about the problems. In areas where huge sums of money are being spent we seem to have a new breed of executive who sets himself up as an empire builder and resents any questioning by those who represent the public and are responsible for the spending of public money.  That question must be faced up to by us all.  My remarks on the report are meant to be constructive and in the interests of the public.</P>

      <P>I would like to preface my comments on the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure's report on property considerations in the Office of Public Works by stating that I have more experience than most of that office, having spent a term as Minister of State with responsibility for its management. During that time, I found the officers of the Office of Public Works hardworking, conscientious, diligent and committed to their duties.  A political head of the office I experienced nothing but co-operation and courtesy and I have no reason to believe that my predecessors and successors did not get the same loyalty and commitment.  Much was achieved but rarely was adequate credit given by the media and indeed I must say by politicians. Comment was often confined to criticism of isolated occurrences without any great regard to the causes or justifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this report.  Any new analysis or examination of existing systems must have positive results.  There is a lot of good contained in the document.  It acknowledges that despite the constraints imposed on the Office of Public Works, <Col N="1116" /> compounded by the attitudes and policies of the present Government, the Office of Public Works have managed to provide a good service and give good value for money.  The terms of reference of the committee in the production of the report were the examination of procedures in the acquisition and fitting out of premises used for Government Departments and rental and lease terms in the period 1981-83. Contrary to popular opinion the document reports favourably on the Office of Public Works in these areas.  It states that the Office of Public Works gave good value for money in the 26 fit-out projects examined, that the Office Public Works' rents were lower than average and that their rent reviews were less than those in the private sector.  Indeed, a national newspaper of no less standing than <i>The Irish Press</i> in its edition of 23 November 1984 quoted actual Office of Public Works' rent figures in comparison with those in the private sector, and those of the Office of Public Works were far lower, which surprised me.  This, mind you, was achieved within constraints that are imposed on the Office of Public Works that few are aware of.  Another positive aspect of the report is that it acknowledges at least some of these constraints.</P>
    <P>When accommodation is required by a Government Department, the Office of Public Works must usually provide a building of high quality in a high rent area, such as St. Stephen's Green of Dublin 2, and when I was in that office all the Departments were looking for office space near Dáil Éireann.  They must often provide this accommodation at little or no notice and are dependent on the Government Department for directions and briefs.  Often these directions are vague and the briefs provided are furnished late and changed regularly; I have experience of this.  To achieve favourable costings in fit-out projects rent and rent reviews within this climate is nothing short of miraculous, but it has been achieved, and was achieved, when I was in the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the report in creating systems for creating a more <Col N="1117" /> favourable operating scenario for the Office of Public Works to work in is however welcomed.  There is no doubt but that given these systems and the resources to implement them they can improve further on their favourable record.  The Office of Public Works have, of course, long recognised this fact and have previously on their own initiative made recommendations of this kind.  Unfortunately these recommendations were never allowed to be implemented and I personally did not spend long enough in the office to ensure that they would.  I now ask the present Minister and, more importantly, the Minister for Finance to ensure that these recommendations be implemented and that the Office of Public Works be given an even break in the property market.</P>
    <P>This of course can never happen without resources.  Contained in the report is the incredible statement that 19 executive officers, some of them quite young, are responsible for an average of 23 major projects each and that there is only one valuer for transactions in the whole city of Dublin.  I repeat, there is only one valuer for transactions in the whole city of Dublin.  That is completely inadequate.  This is typical of the adverse and damaging effect of the blunt-nosed staff embargo imposed by this Government. Its members sanctimoniously preach about reform, a more efficient public service and savings, yet they allow a most important and potentially costly area of the Civil Service be administered, by and large, by a young staff, a skeleton senior staff and a lone ranger valuer.</P>

      <P>The Government's penny wise, pound foolish mentality <Col N="1118" /> which has manifested itself in nearly every aspect of our lives was never more apparent than here.  How can you have the controls procedures and prescribed reporting without the necessary resources?</P>
      <P>In tandem with the production of this report I read in the <i>Evening Press</i> that contrary to providing resources, the Government have in fact allowed the Office of Public Works be denuded of a vitally necessary back-up service, particularly in the property area.  The area of property transactions in the Office of Public Works where you have nearly five million square feet in Dublin alone requires a daily, and indeed hourly, legal service.  Traditionally this was provided by the State Solicitor's Office which in my time was in the Office of Public Works in 51 St. Stephen's Green.</P>
      <P>Just last week the Government allowed these staff be moved lock stock and barrel to Dublin Castle.  This now means that each property transaction that requires legal opinion or signature &mdash; and what transaction does not &mdash; must now be referred to Dublin Castle.  This will inevitably compound an already difficult situation for the Office of Public Works and will lead to further delays and, dare I say it, wastage of money.  Of course inevitably and eventually the Office of Public Works will carry the can for the Government, but that same Government in the form of persons such as the present Minister for the Public Service and the chairman of this committee will continue to pontificate about reform.  Perhaps there is such a thing as reverse reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The property situation in Dublin of course nearly changed totally during my term of office in the Office of Public Works.  The Fianna Fáil Government at that time then embarked on a policy of decentralisation which would have moved large sections of Government Departments to 13 towns around the country.  Sites were purchased, plans were prepared and tenders were invited in a very short time.  This illustrated what could be achieved when the Office of Public Works got the necessary Government support.  The decentralisation <Col N="1119" /> programme would have released nearly a massive 800,000 square feet of office accommodation in Dublin; it would have given a badly needed injection to the building industry; it would have created a new, healthy economic and social climate in the towns in question and it would have allowed civil servants to return to their rural background and would have brought Government to the people. Lastly it would have relieved Dublin's overburdened infrastructures and would have solved State accommodation requirements in the city for generations. Indeed the State would be entering the sellers' market rather than a buyers' market.</P>
    <P>At the last minute there was a change of Government and, incomprehensibly and illogically at one unfortunate stroke, the Government abandoned the scheme and, without being in a position to plan, the Office of Public Works' long term property plans were scuttled.  The Government by their actions forfeited the considerable fees payable to consultants and incredibly forced the Office of Public Works to sell the sites purchased at what must have been a loss.  How the Office of Public Works survive these body blows and accept the criticisms levelled at them continually mystifies me.</P>
    <P>Having seen the reports of the press conference given by the Committee on Public Expenditure on 20 November and subsequently having read the report, it strikes me that some members of the committee must have been reading a different document and certainly must have had very little input in its composition.  I refer in particular to Deputy Keating who was associated with a figure of £2 million alleged wastage which mysteriously became £30 million.  The Office of Public Works have been quoted in the papers as stating that the consultants who prepared the report admitted that this figure was notional and even if it had substance the figures on which it was based were incorrect. This figure plucked out of the air related to 26 fit-out cases, the only ones carried out by the Office of Public Works in the period covered in the report. <Col N="1120" /> Whether inadvertently or otherwise Deputy Keating seems to have associated these 26 projects with 400-odd other building projects.  These bore no comparison with the projects examined and were outside the terms of reference of the committee.  However, I understand from the report that a random sample was examined by the consultant and he found that the Office of Public Works had got good value for money.  Associating the 26 offices which were fitted out with the 400-odd building projects, Deputy Keating misled the press into believing that £30 million could have been saved.  This is political sabotage of a Government Department and is merely a dishonest exercise for the purpose of making cheap copy.  It does nothing for the reputation and credibility of the committee's hardworking members and merely serves to undermine public confidence and public service morale.</P>
    <P>The examination of State organisations and productions of reports are good provided they are not abused by a few for minor personal gain and provided they are taken seriously by Government and are not just another exercise in window dressing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to inquire how Deputy McEllistrim would achieve fairly substantial savings having regard to the programme to which he referred which entailed fairly considerable expenditure. I refer to sites which were bought and subsequently disposed of and I cannot understand how anybody could say that substantial savings could be made by embarking on a programme of expenditure which obviously entailed either the spending of taxpayers' money or the borrowing of money outside the country to finance it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention the general role of the Office of Public Works which has come in for some criticism.  Because of the nature of the Department and its wide range of responsibilities, it is probably a target for allegations which may, in many cases be sustained, of misspending or unwise spending.  Much of the fitting out of public buildings and their <Col N="1121" /> restoration and improvement can be very tedious and requires a great deal of time which would not normally be expected in a job of that nature.  I wish to pay tribute to the Office of Public Works for the work they have done in many of those areas.  As passers-by on a casual examination of the operation might, unfortunately, condemn them for making errors but they should get credit for the successful operations which they have carried out.  I refer particularly to the tremendous work they have done in the restoration of public buildings and in the improvement of buildings of architectural or historical importance.  The standard of their workmanship is generally extremely good and to achieve that often requires tedious pursuit of the job, which probably results in extra expenditure.</P>
    <P>With regard to leasing of public buildings which was referred to by a number of speakers, in times of financial constraint it is important that greater regard should be taken of the fact that taxpayers' money is being expended.  In view of this, great care should now be taken to ensure that buildings which are leased are occupied as soon as possible.  Perhaps it is not always feasible to do this because the market moves very quickly, although in the present climate there is not much movement in that area.  Nonetheless, there may be occasions when the Office of Public Works have to maintain an option which could cost money.  Unfortunately, we have become somewhat blasé as far as public money is concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be too critical, but in future we should ensure that we have as few as possible public buildings on our hands which are not fully utilised.  In other words, we should cut out the habit of retaining public buildings if they are not fully occupied and utilised.  To do otherwise would be unpardonable at the present time where people generally are conscious of where the money is going.  I am not making a political point.  What I am suggesting should be done regardless of which Government are in power and it should apply always in the future.  For far too long we have been lackadaisical <Col N="1122" /> about the way we accounted for public funds on the basis that the system was good and strong and that nothing could go wrong.  However, the general public will condemn Members of this House and the people responsible in the Departments if the best possible use is not made of the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>The cost of fitting out public buildings can be arrived at in a number of ways.  It can be cost efficient or inefficient depending on the methods used.  Usually the criticism one hears in relation to the fitting out of public buildings by the Office of Public Works relates to the time taken.  The time factor has become very important, and private enterprise concerns often say they could do the same job in half the time.  In other areas, not necessarily connected with the Office of Public Works, I have seen at first hand evidence that suggests that private enterprise could carry out certain public jobs at at least half the cost incurred at present. That may seem an unfair criticism, but it is a fact.  Departments such as the Office of Public Works should have careful regard to their costings in future.</P>
    <P>It might not be a bad exercise to obtain quotations from private enterprise in relation to some of the works carried out. Again, I do not apply that specifically to the Office of Public Works.  It should be applied generally to a number of public works carried out by the State with taxpayers' money.  That would make for a better appraisal of what the job would cost if done by private enterprise and, at the same time, it would have the effect of making our public agencies more competitive and more cost-conscious.  That is one area that should be looked at in the future.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the committee for producing the report and I express the wish that it will make all of us here more aware of the need to spend the taxpayers' money more wisely.  I hope it will create an awareness in the minds of all public agencies, including the Office of Public Works, of the need to be able to justify the cost in all cases as against what the cost would be if the work was carried out by private enterprise.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Public Expenditure I am delighted to be associated with the report.  The committee went about their work in a constructive way.  They examined and investigated as constructively and as positively as possible the reasons or the underlying factors that caused concern and that were expressed by members of the committee and by outside agencies with regard to areas in Departments where there were cost overruns, delays or allegations regarding inefficiency.  I am delighted to be associated with the report and I am honoured to have had the opportunity of having some little input in the drafting or formulation of the report.</P>
      <P>While differences of opinion were expressed between individuals and parties &mdash; and which I have no doubt will continue to be expressed &mdash; usually a consensus was arrived at in a fairly harmonious way, and that is very important. I hope that kind of spirit and atmosphere will continue to prevail.  It is reasonable to expect that there will be occasional hiccups, but it is good to know that at the end of the day a consensus can emerge that will be helpful and important in formulating recommendations where improvements can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to compliment the staff who have operated on the committee.  I realise that members of the public do not have the opportunity to appreciate the enormous task of the staff as a result of the establishment of the joint committees. I have to issue a note of criticism and disappointment in that although a considerable number of committees have been set up the staffing levels have been very inadequate and unsatisfactory.  I urge Members opposite to use their influence to rectify that situation in the interests of the staff involved in the work of joint committees.  There should be adequate staff levels to ensure that the work of the committees continues to be productive and efficient.  I should also like to compliment out consultant, Mr Ballance.  He approached the task assigned to him in a very constructive and positive manner and the results of his work reflect a job well done.  I have no <Col N="1124" /> doubt his input to our committee will be recognised in time to come as significant and worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Our committee has a very important task, perhaps more important as financial constraints become greater.  In times of scarce resources it is important that the committee should examine ways and means to ensure that existing resources are used most productively and in a way that gives value for money.  We must also have the confidence of the public in our institutions.  The recommendations we bring forward should not dilute the confidence of the public in the institutions of State or in our public servants.  If that should happen I would hate to think of the inevitable outcome.</P>
    <P>The report deals with the Office of Public Works, and it deals specifically with two areas.  There was the matter of project procedures used in the acquisition and the fitting out of premises.  The task was to examine those procedures in relation to control over the overall cost and in relation to the programme of office fitting out works and the provision of new office buildings, and to compare these with the best practices in the private sector.  It was also our task to suggest what improvements might be made.  The second aspect was to report on the rental and lease terms obtained by the Office of Public Works in the period from 1981 to 1983 and to comment on the value for money obtained.</P>
    <P>When we set out to do these tasks I started out against a background of what I saw as public disillusionment with the Office of Public Works and in many cases a cynical attitude by the public towards that office.  In many instances the Office of Public Works are seen by the public to be the cinderella of Government and not treated seriously by other Departments. They should be.  I hope to make reference to a number of aspects of the report to support me.</P>
    <P>The role of the Office of Public Works is varied and very wide.  The report states their tasks and functions range from project manager to designer, to client, to agent.  That is a wide range of specific roles for any one organisation and I do <Col N="1125" /> not think they are fully taken account of by the various Departments.  In many respects the Office of Public Works see themselves as being there at the will and wish of the other Departments.  They are answerable for the requirements of other Departments however outrageous or illogical or costly the requirements. These requirements of client Departments have to be met by the OPW no matter where the location is or delays in taking up occupation.  At the end of the day OPW have to carry the can.  We hope that this report will go some way towards redressing the balance.</P>
    <P>When we see OPW answerable to other Departments and in liaison with them we can have a more realistic appraisal of their role than the public.  They are a Government Department working on public funds.  Irrespective of what interrelation exists there is a clear duty on OPW to give value for money at all times. Although I can see blame apportioned in many directions in relation to overall Government expenditure as between Departments and the OPW I am not upset on the basis of the evidence available to us.  I believe that OPW have discharged their functions within the criteria set out for them.  There are some underlying weaknesses in their <i>modus operandi</i> that make it difficult or impossible for them to function as a good sound organisation in the private sector would do or would be expected to do.</P>
    <P>Particularly in regard to their relationship with other Government Departments I have a private view.  The Chairman of the committee referred earlier to the public funds the OPW have in their charge, £165 million approximately. For that reason and others, the OPW should be represented directly at Cabinet level.  I do not think it is practicable or realistic to expect them to perform the kind of functions expected of them without having direct consultation. That is a personal view.  I know there are constitutional restraints on the Government in relation to the number of Ministries, but having the OPW as part of the Department of Finance does not seem to me to be satisfactory because I cannot <Col N="1126" /> see the Department of Finance being sufficiently able to represent the OPW at the Cabinet table.</P>
    <P>Deputy McEllistrim referred earlier to the rather vague way in which he as Minister responsible for the OPW had to represent that Department.  We acknowledge in the report that this aspect is a major contributor to delays and cost overruns.  It was the major contributor in nine out of 26 projects.  From my experience and from the research available it is fairly clear that Government Departments have issued instructions to the OPW on a certain basis.  One way that could be overcome would be by way of better representation for the OPW at Cabinet level.  The report states that other delays were mainly the responsibility of the client Departments, further evidence that the client Departments play a very important role.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 27 to 30 refer to capital projects.  I regard this as one of the most fundamental aspects of any examination of how a Department function &mdash; capital projects and efficiency.  The report states that in the circumstances in which the OPW work it is essential to have a projects control system.  There should be an original estimate for funds to allow control during the progress of any project.</P>
    <P>The difficulty here is that OPW do not think they have the power to function in accordance with present procedures. There was a report from a working party on cost overruns in 1982.  It was published and submitted to the Department of Finance. I understand the Department took most of the recommendations on board and in a circular issued in 1983 they outlined guidelines by which the OPW should approach management and control of capital projects and their implementation from the earliest stages.  My view is that the OPW, because of their intricate relationship with the other Government Departments, do not see themselves as being responsible or accountable in this respect.  One way in which they could be made accountable <Col N="1127" /> would be to give them a voice in the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>There are several features in the report to which I have not time to refer.  There is reference to the seeming inability of the OPW to take on the rent and leasing market.  The report in a number of respects and on a number of points refers to the fact that the OPW have a major portion of the lessee market.  Yet they are unable to achieve any significant inroads by way of a reduction of rates.  I hope the recommendations will be viewed by the OPW as constructive and comprehensive and as being in the best interests of overall efficiency and management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the comments made by the Chairman of the Committee on Public Expenditure, Deputy Keating, on this, the latest report, which is on the Office of Public Works.  With regret I have to dissociate myself from some of the remarks made by Deputy McEllistrim.  The committee included many senior Members of the Opposition.  We have always worked on a non-political basis in an atmosphere of goodwill.  We produced our report on that basis.  Having attended meetings of this committee and other committees, I hope that the goodwill and the non-political atmosphere at these meetings will find their way into this House.</P>
      <P>As mentioned already, earlier this year the committee examined a statement supplied by the Office of Public Works which outlined details on over 20 buildings acquired by the OPW on behalf of various Government Departments and offices. We were quite appalled to find that in several cases the buildings were lying unoccupied for long periods.  I found it difficult to comprehend how valuable property which was costing the taxpayers millions of pounds in rent, were not being fitted out and occupied as soon as the builders had moved out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a tendency to compare the public sector with what happens in the private sector from time to time.  This is probably one of the best examples I can <Col N="1128" /> think of where the procedures used and accepted in the State sector would not have been tolerated by private companies. The reason is obvious.  Private companies who decided to lease or invest in a new office block and who allowed changes of plan, delays in briefing, delays in fit-out, and so on, would not continue in business for very long.  Time is money but this simple fact does not seem to have sunk into the public sector despite the continuing difficult state of the economy.</P>
    <P>If the Committee on Public Expenditure achieve nothing else other than getting such facts across to the public sector, including the very important one of accountability by individuals for public expenditure, we will have achieved a very important goal.  While this debate is confined to the report on the OPW, I have to say that in recent months the committee were amazed at the lack of proper management controls in many parts of the public sector, both in Government Departments and in semi-State bodies falling within the Committee's terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Getting back to this report, the committee found that the question of empty office blocks was merely a symptom of something seriously wrong in the OPW. Through the good work of our consultant who analysed the data on our behalf, we found that empty office blocks were the result of an overall lack of management and professional control in the OPW.  I find it difficult to understand how the Office of Public Works, one of the longest established Government offices, could operate without basic management, monitoring and review procedures.  It is an indication of the lack of those controls that the committee had to spell out in their recommendations what needs to be done by OPW in order that basic and proper controls can be exercised.</P>
    <P>It became clear to the committee during the hearing of evidence from the OPW officials that the fault as regards delays and so on did not lie entirely with the board.  Client Departments are at least as much to blame as the board.  One client Department asked for fit-outs to be changed on three different occasions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> That was done at the taxpayers' expense. There is no reason why Departments should not be able to consult with the OPW on their requirements, agree briefs and get the necessary work and fitting-out under way without any wasteful delays. Departments should not be allowed to change their minds on layout and other requirements once the briefs have been agreed.</P>
    <P>The committee found that in general Departments were not unduly concerned about the cost involved because they were not being charged for the buildings, fit-outs, and so on.  The committee believe this situation should be changed. Departments should be charged and be seen to be charged in their annual estimates for buildings, furniture, and so on.  If individual Departments were held accountable for the cost of moving into a new building, we are confident this would reduce significantly the cost to the Exchequer of the acquisition and fit-out of Government offices.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that it could be argued that there are some slight inaccuracies in the chart on page 11.  If that is so, it is only a matter of two or three weeks compared with buildings which were unoccupied for over three years.  The information in the chart was supplied by OPW.  They had this report and they made no comment on that.</P>
    <P>It can also be said that the report lacks details and names.  In examining officials from the OPW, it was our experience that they were almost neurotic about confidentiality. The committee respected that.  The report is complimentary to the Office of Public Works on some of the rent reviews they have achieved.  These are related to a large number of small buildings.  When it comes to large buildings, unfortunately the OPW do not come out all that well.</P>
    <P>I hope the recommendations on project procedures and rental leasing of accommodation will be acted on immediately by the Minister so that the hard-pressed taxpayers can be assured that the <Col N="1130" /> major problems identified by the committee in this area will be eliminated as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems in regard to wasteful expenditure on the occupation of public buildings &mdash; and I want to couch this in the most diplomatic terms &mdash; is the laid back political attitude there has been within the Department for some considerable time.  Deputy McEllistrim gave a good example of that type of laid back approach in his contribution here this morning.  His attack on the committee was an attack on his own colleagues because we are talking about a joint all-party committee.  When Parliament is trying to come to terms with wasteful spending in the public sector, it is unbecoming for a Deputy to try to turn that into an attack on the all-party committee.</P>
      <P>Nobody in this House is out to gut the OPW.  This House has great respect for the good work being carried out by the Office of Public Works but that does not mean that it can tolerate wasteful expenditure by that office or by anybody else. It is our duty and responsibility to call the public service to account, and this area is one which has been the cause of much public comment and scandal in recent times.  It is very necessary for the House to examine this matter and nobody should feel resentful or think that anybody is out to do him or her down.  We are simply examining the areas of wasteful public expenditure, and this is one which sticks out like a sore thumb.</P>
      <P>If there are difficulties within the Office of Public Works with regard to this report or to comments made in this House, I would invite that office to circulate a detailed minute of their comments to Deputies so that we can look at what they have to say in defence of their case.  If they have a defence let us hear it and if not, let there be no more nonsense. Nobody wants to be unfair to anybody, but we will not be afraid to do our duty through fear of being accused of being unfair or taking political advantage.  We will give due consideration to any defence raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like some consultation <Col N="1131" /> between the staff of the Office of Public Works and the political system, perhaps through the committee.  One hears the most dreadful reports about the Office of Public Works which simply could not all be true.  As a public representative I know the good work that this office do, but there is a feeling among the public generally about wastefulness and, in particular, idleness within that office.</P>
    <P>It might be a very good exercise if we were to have a report from the Office of Public Works outlining their view of the attitude of the public and of public representatives to what is going on in that office.  It may be that the attitude is wrong and that there is not the idleness that is felt abroad.  However, if that is not the case they should not be so defensive &mdash; almost neurotic, as Deputy Joe Doyle has said.  We want to know what is going on in that office and a neurotic approach will not do.  If they are not prepared to give us an explanation, we must consider that the worst is the case.</P>
    <P>There is a fair amount of duplication in the presentation of the report to the House since the matter was raised some months ago by the Committee of Public Accounts.  That gives rise to the whole question of the work of these two committees and whether there is, yet again, wasteful public expenditure by the Committee on Public Expenditure in duplicating the work of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Perhaps those two committees should be merged so that they could together examine these matters instead of one after the other hounding the Office of Public Works and the press reporting these events twice, three or even four times.  It is time we considered whether the Committee on Public Expenditure should be told to involve themselves in works which are not already being carried on by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>The way to solve the problem with regard to accommodation is to appoint an officer in the Department of Finance, outside the Office of Public Works, to be specifically responsible for checking out Government contracts in regard to building, hiring and letting of public buildings. <Col N="1132" /> It is not just the Office of Public Works who are offending in this matter.  An Bord Telecom, when set up as a section within the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, went their own merry way against the advice, I believe, of the Office of Public Works and the Secretary of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs of the day.  They hired and rented premises at that stage against everybody's advice and were answerable to nobody.</P>
    <P>We now learn that the IDA in these grave recessionary times are going to spend money lavishly on premises.  So enormous is the estate of the Government and of public Departments in Dublin that the whole rent situation fluctuates on the basis of whether the Government let or do not let, occupy or do not occupy premises.  We need a specific officer who can be accountable to the Committee on Public Expenditure or the Committee of Public Accounts for the whole policy of renting or building, not just in relation to the Office of Public Works but to other semi-State bodies. That is the only way in which we will come to terms with this problem.</P>
    <P>The report is welcome is so far as it tries to pursue this problem.  It is a pity that it duplicates the work of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I hope that the future report of the Committee on Public Expenditure will be less garrulous. There is no disrespect meant to the clerk of the committee.  I do not think he has been given a free hand in drawing up this report.  If the report were shorter, more specific, with clearer identification of the problems and recommendations, the House would benefit.  I hope that future reports will be more specific in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would not like the debate to end here with nothing happening afterwards.  We must get a progress report, not just in relation to the Office of Public Works but in the whole area of Government renting of office blocks and other accommodation. There was a lot of press coverage at the time of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts about a year ago, but there does not seem to have been any specific Government or parliamentary <Col N="1133" /> decision to change the position.  I would suggest a progress report from either the Minister or the committee, perhaps shortly after Christmas, on what has been done to improve, control and account for Government policy in relation to the occupation of public buildings.</P>

      <P>First, I want to make it clear, as a member of the committee, that we are not here to castigate the Office of Public Works in any way.  We are here to reflect our views on how we find the spending of public moneys, as responsible public representatives.  Our duty is to see that the maximum value is got for every pound of State money expended on behalf of the Irish taxpayer. We see the Office of Public Works as doing a very good job, taking into account all the constraints and complexities imposed on them.  We see, too, a need to make this organisation more efficient and perhaps give them more powers and more professional staff.</P>
      <P>I wish to take issue with one remark made by Deputy Mitchell and I am sorry that he has left the House.  That is that our secretary has not been given a free hand in compiling this report.  There would not be much point in our being members of the committee if we had not an opportunity to make an input into the report and if we were not able to assist in compiling that report.  I am very pleased that we have one of the finest public servants in the country operating as secretary of our committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we are concerned we had a job to do.  We had a duty to assist the secretary in compiling the report.  We had every confidence in the ability of that man to do his job to the highest standard.  There would not be any point in having such committees if elected members could not make an important input into the compilation of the report.</P>
      <P>The general consensus, as I see it from the report, is that OPW are in a very invidious and precarious position.  They are the victims of circumstances.  They get vague instructions from Government Departments and agencies <i>vis-à-vis</i> their requirements.  When OPW provide facilities for them they may be told the facilities are in the wrong location or that they are not suitable or that they are not required at all.</P>
      <P>Recently some office accommodation was required by the Department of Social Welfare for the employment incentive scheme staff.  When the accommodation was provided by OPW, the Department informed them they could not accept the location and would have to have it near their computer division in Aras Mhic Dhiarmida.  It was incumbent on the Department to give clear instructions at the outset as to exactly where they required the office.  It is well known that most office accommodation required by Departments is required in the Dublin 2 area which is the prime office area in the city.  Consequently OPW, as the Government agency acquiring and renting office accommodation, set the norm for prices. They are in a very strong position.  They do not have sufficient powers to make use of the very important position they have.  The report proves that it would be better for them to acquire property, purchase it and make it available to Departments and Government agencies as they require it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We pay something in the region of £16 million per annum for office space in the city.  In view of that it should be within the control of OPW to acquire property and relocate Government Departments or agencies therein at their discretion. Until such time as we give them that kind of power we cannot expect to save the <Col N="1135" /> State expenditure that we would hope to save.  An opportunity was lost in the recent past when the Royal Hibernian Hotel, a beautiful building, was disposed of.  Architecturally it was an ideal building. It blended in and balanced with Leinster House.  It was a tragedy that the building was not acquired by OPW.  This beautiful building is being demolished and will be replaced by a cold modern office block and shopping centre.  It will not blend in with Leinster House nor is it conducive to the area.  Architecturally and from the point of view of location a more prime building could not have been made available in the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be pleasantly surprised with the finished building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, but we must try to preserve what was good in the past rather than have it destroyed for modern convenience.  There was one Member of the House who was very well acquainted with that building.  He had an important Government position at one stage.  I am surprised he did not make some recommendation in that area.</P>
      <P>Comparisons were made with the IDA and other bodies.  The IDA are to be complimented.  Deputy Mitchell used the word &ldquo;lavish&rdquo; with regard to expenditure. As far as I am concerned, the IDA operate on a very efficient basis.  They are now bringing all sections of the Authority under one roof so that the staff will operate as one unit and give a proper service to industry.  Their chief executive, Mr. Pádraic White and other executives are to be complimented for doing that.  They are saving money because they will not now have to pay rent for office space in different parts of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have discovered that the provision of telephone services for buildings rented or acquired takes so long that money is expended on rent for a long time before the buildings are occupied.  We hope under Bord Telecom that will not happen.  The Office of Public Works must be given authority to make realistic, sensible demands to ensure that telephone <Col N="1136" /> lines are either transferred or put into a building within a month.  In such a case the Department or agency could move into the building straight away.  There must be some authority or body that will have total control.  It is obvious that Departments have for too long procrastinated on decisions <i>vis-à-vis</i> their requirements. The buck must stop somewhere. There must be accountability.  OPW expend money in this area and the delays are not caused by them.  They have the expertise and information at their disposal. They should be in a powerful negotiating position to do a good deal.</P>
    <P>It is important that this report be considered seriously by the Minister for Finance and the Government and that the necessary powers to provide OPW with direct control over all office accommodation for the Government Departments and agencies be vested in them.  In that way money could be saved.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government we made major plans for decentralisation at 13 locations throughout the country.  That would release a great deal of office space in Dublin.  That has been postponed.  In the past moneys have been expended on professional services and on sites and so on and no other action taken.  Some of these sites are now up for sale.</P>
    <P>Permanent capital investment is the best possible decision when property is required.  Whether it is inside or outside Dublin city, necessary powers must be given to the OPW to acquire property in suitable locations to ensure that Government Departments have the best facilities, are located in the best areas and will be in a position to give maximum service to the people, and save and get the best value for money for the taxpayers.  If nothing else, I hope that the report from this committee will help in some way to give these powers to the OPW.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to address a few points on this report, which is very important.  Although it may be dealing with only a relatively small area of operation in State capital spending, its findings are symptomatic of problems that may extend far deeper.  The main problems <Col N="1137" /> are worth re-emphasising.  One was that no basic project data documents were prepared.  That lack prevents proper management control at any stage down the line.  We must set about rectifying that situation if we are to have proper control of what we are spending money on.</P>
      <P>We discovered that no regular or routine management controls were in operation by the OPW.  Again, that is serious.  It means that if you set out your costs over a project period you would include what might be called a critical path where the cost at month one would be so much and so much would have been achieved; at month two it would have been so much and so much would have been achieved, and so on throughout the project, and in any month you would know whether you had completed what you set out to complete, whether your costs were within the costs intended and, if not, you could identify where the difficulties lay, who was responsible and what action could be taken to correct it.  The lack of that sort of approach to projects within the OPW is a fatal weakness.  We have seen a number of shop window overruns that at the end of the day will trace back to this lack in the procedures being operated.</P>
      <P>We found within the OPW that the organisation of staff was not conducive to proper management control.  They did not have a project manager who would be responsible from beginning to end for a project.  That is entirely necessary. Other speakers have said here today that responsibility is essential.  You must be able to identify who is responsible if you are to have a system that will operate itself, otherwise you will have a myriad of rules propounded by various Departments and at the end of the day nobody will be identified with responsibility for getting the job produced on time and done to cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the working party on cross-over runs whose report back about 1982 led to a directive by the Department of Finance in March 1983 <Col N="1138" /> about the way projects should be conducted. We were disturbed to find that there did not seem to be a following of the details outlined in those reports and recommended for project management. It is worrying when you see the problems identified by that working party which are very similar to those we are identifying now.  The working party mentioned the fact that current cost is not used.  It continues to be the case that when setting out the cost of a project they do not take the trouble to consider what will happen to inflation and interest rates or how the cost will turn out as the project goes forward.  That is still a problem.  They pointed out that the procedure for control of design cost is not being used, despite a Department of Finance directive in 1971. They found ten or 11 years afterwards that directives issued in 1971 were not being implemented in 1982.  We are in the same boat here.  We are looking at weaknesses in the operation of the OPW that should, on the basis of Department of Finance directives in 1971, have been rectified.  Problems like design change after construction had started and persist, and we found them in our study.</P>
    <P>The problems we identify are symptomatic of incomplete attention to the cost of a project.  The OPW take far too narrow a view of the cost of a project. They concentrate on strict control of cash that they release for it.  It is very desirable that we should know that cash is issued only where appropriate.  That is essential, but it is not the sole test of cost.  Similarly, they concentrate on competitive tendering, again a very important aspect of cost but not the complete story.  The costs they tend to dismiss are costs such as the rental incurred while a project is proceeding and, therefore, if it is delayed, extra rent is incurred.  They ignore interest that accrues on money that has been expended already from the Exchequer without completing the project.  All the time an interest sum is building up and that is not considered when the OPW talk about the cost of a project.</P>
    <P>Associated with delays you get further fee increases, because the most amazing system of paying fees operated within <Col N="1139" /> the Government sector, namely that fees were payable as a percentage of final cost of a project, even if the project took six years to complete, and the vast majority of design work etc. had been done perhaps six years ago and, although the consultant had been paid a substantial amount on account at that stage, his final fee related to the inflated cost at the end of the project.  Therefore, the delay under our present system of paying fees, which is grossly inadequate for public sector needs, means that fees, interest, and rent all roll up.</P>
    <P>At no stage do the OPW say that these are real costs associated with this project that should be applied and the control involves keeping those costs down just as much as keeping the tender price down. We had one example where the rent plus the interest plus the bloated fees through the delay of projects came to more than the total cost of the fit-out.  In other words, by ignoring these aspects to which the report draws attention, half of the total cost of a project was ignored.  That is a critical problem, and it is urgent that the Minister set about putting proper systems into his Department.  Not alone his Department, virtually every Department in the State ignore things like interest incurred on money they have expended.  This Minister should not only take note of that but also convey it to his colleagues.</P>
    <P>A further dangerous flaw is that the OPW do not allocate their own overhead costs to the various client Departments who are putting projects before them. The OPW are acting as consultants and if there was a private consultancy they would charge fees to the client Departments. This does not occur.  The OPW must accept quietly as impositions on their own budget delays that may be caused by the client Department.  If a client Department provide inadequate briefing, change their mind or create delay that is incurring real costs for the OPW which do not appear on the client Department's account.  The client Department are not asked to account for these and say why they were incurred and <Col N="1140" /> pay for them.  Rather the OPW must accept them meekly.  The OPW are getting abuse or stick from us for something it should quite rightly put back on to the client Departments.  I am convinced that in a lot of cases the weaknesses do not lie within the OPW although, obviously, we are not content with the control procedures they operate.  The problem may well lie with the client Departments. However, if they put in proper control procedures they would be able to identify the client Department to blame.  They would be able to identify that the client Department had provided inadequate briefing or was too slow in coming back with comments or erred in bringing changes of mind to a project that was well under way.</P>
    <P>Later we will be reporting to the Dáil on the general management of capital projects.  I am convinced that the problems that exist in the case of fit-outs and minor projects of that nature exist in an equal or greater degree in major capital projects.  It will be an important aspect of the committee's work that we get into place a system of ensuring that the various directives on ideal cost management from the Department of Finance are not ignored as they were in the past. Earlier I mentioned that the directive in 1971 was found not to have been observed by 1982.  It would be a tragedy if the directive of March 1983 ended up in the same position.  We have made a recommendation that within the OPW there should be a small working party in operation to ensure that the best practice is applied in the execution of projects. Although I am always loth to suggest new committees or groups, or new anything that involves some extra spending, I believe the lessons of the past where directives were not observed suggest that such a scheme merits implementation. After all we are dealing with multi-million pound projects and we cannot afford to be scrimping on the management side when so much is at stake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been following the <Col N="1141" /> workings of the committee since it was established, and while some useful comments have come from it and some worthwhile examinations have been carried out nevertheless from time to time there has been a tendency for some members of the committee to be unduly critical without going into the full facts.  It is easy to be critical in hindsight and say that something could have been improved.  We all agree that there is a need to examine from time to time the operations of various organisations to see that the best possible value is obtained for the expenditure incurred, but there have been practical difficulties in some cases that have led to the problems.  If they were examined more closely it would be seen that there was good and genuine reason for the overruns that occurred.  It will be seen that there was good reason why the extra expenditure was not anticipated when the projects started.  One such project that got a lot of publicity recently was the development at Howth harbour.  That is a magnificent scheme, and I defy anybody to examine that project under any procedure and say that it was money badly spent or wasted.  It is well known that because of various difficulties there were overruns which resulted in the estimated cost of £3 to £4 million running to between £9 or £10 million.  A figure of up to £12 million has been mentioned.  I do not think that anybody, even with the best engineering advice available, could have anticipated when the development was planned the problems that arose in the course of the construction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain amount of confusion has been created in the minds of people because of the debates that have <Col N="1142" /> taken place and the publicity-seeking antics of some members of the various committees.  Suffice to say that the Howth scheme is a magnificent one.  The money was well spent and at the commencement of the scheme nobody could have anticipated the problems that arose later.</P>
      <P>With regard to office renting and leasing nobody could have anticipated with regard to the BIM move to Dún Laoghaire that problems would arise. There has been some harsh criticism of BIM and Government Ministers by some committee members in regard to the BIM offices in Dún Laoghaire.  All Members must be aware that there was a collapse in the market for such property.  When BIM experienced difficulty in getting staff to move to Dún Laoghaire a decision was made to lease some office accommodation, and I do not think anybody could have anticipated that there would be difficulty in leasing it.  At the time it was felt that it would be wise to lease the premises in Dún Laoghaire.  There were reasons why decisions were made which meant in the long run that expenditure was incurred that could have been avoided. That has happened before on numerous occasions.  The report of the committee is useful in that it highlights a number of ways difficulties like this can be overcome in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a Member of the House for 11 years and I have heard many Members suggesting how procedures can be tightened up, but even with the best tightening up in the world there will always be a dilemma where decisions will have to be made on whether projects should proceed or should be stopped half way through.  One has to measure whether one would be better to incur additional expenditure rather than leaving a project half finished and unusable.  The officials of the OPW come up against such problems daily.  Officials in other Departments must face them also.  They are all left with a limited choice.  Judgment must be based on whether in the long term it would be better to move forward and regulate the financial provisions at a later stage.  For instance, if a decision was <Col N="1143" /> made at the time foundation difficulties were experienced at Howth harbour to stop the project for reassessment by the design engineers and consultants the harbour would not have been completed. We would have a bad problem out there instead of the magnificent development that has taken place.  It is easy for Members to be critical because they do not have to make the choice when problems arise.  I accept that there is a need to tighten up and improve, but that does not apply to the OPW only.  Indeed, it applies to many Government Departments and private companies.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report which has some very useful recommendations in it but I am totally dissatisfied with the way this Government have scrapped the decentralisation programme.  I would like to see the Government setting up office in rural towns and regional areas.  We need to build up the regions by attracting office type employment and the movement of Government offices into major towns like Ennis and Shannon can have a very significant impact on the service office development operations in those areas.  This is why I think the decision to decentralise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important in relation to the concentration of office accommodation and leasing problems.  There is an over-emphasis on office accommodation in central areas in Dublin city and this is detrimental to the development of rural areas and is very expensive for Government Departments.  It would be more attractive and more economic if the Government were to decentralise their Departments and to acquire office accommodation in rural areas.  It may be argued that it would be just as expensive to do that now, but in my view that is not correct.  It would be far less expensive to acquire office accommodation in the larger towns throughout the country.  The scrapping of the decentralisation programme was a retrograde step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> This is a very useful report but there will always be room for improvement. Nobody should be foolish enough to think that they will be able to solve all the problems that will arise in this area because even with the best will in the world problems will occur and all anybody can hope to do is to minimise those problems.  This report is useful in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset let me say that I welcome this report.  There is much of value in it and there are suggestions and recommendations in it which will be studied carefully by the Office of Public Works and which should also be considered by all Departments who at any time are involved in obtaining office accommodation.  For some time past the Office of Public Works have been the butt of a great deal of criticism which was not merited because they were not guilty of doing anything wrong.</P>
      <P>However, I confess to being very disappointed with several aspects of the report and with the manner in which it was presented.  It was the Members of this House who established the Committee on Public Expenditure.  It would be more appropriate that their report be first and foremost presented to and debated by this House before it was made the subject of a press conference.  Furthermore, I can only regard as discourteous the fact that neither I nor the Commissioners of Public Works were allowed to see a copy of the consultants' report on which this report is based.  It was said here today that it was the actual consultants' report, but I do not know if that is right because so far I have not seen that report.  If nothing else we could have at least corrected some of the inaccuracies in it if we had read that report first and in so doing we might have stopped some of the nonsensical statements made by some members of the committee at press conferences and otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The indecent haste of the committee to rush to print with an unbalanced document which of its nature is controversial <Col N="1145" /> and then to hold an immediate press conference on it seems to me to be motivated by a desire to gain maximum personal publicity for some members of this committee. This point is further illustrated by the fact that at least one national daily newspaper reported the committee's critical interpretation of the report in the context of the Office of Public Works prior to the press conference being held and prior to the report being presented to this House.  I am very critical of that. I think that is very bad practice.</P>
    <P>Before I take up some specific points contained in the report, I would like to make some general remarks.  The report concentrates exclusively on the economic aspects of the Office of Public Works' activities without giving any weight to the political pressures and constraints that constantly apply to an office which has to house all Government Departments, many of which were expanding as a result of policy decisions which could not be predicted in advance.  In this situation you go out and get office accommodation wherever it is acceptable and as soon as you can.  You are not free to pick and choose your location.  You need the accommodation now and in these circumstances your ability to negotiate the best possible terms is also constrained.  I would at least have thought that some members of the committee &mdash; those who were office holders &mdash; would be aware of this and would have seen that this was explicitly referred to in the report.</P>
    <P>Throughout the report the committee endeavour to identify those areas in which delays were caused and to pinpoint who is responsible for these delays.  I am prepared to agree that some of the points made are justified and the report highlights areas in which improvements can be made.  However, are the committee being entirely honest with the Dáil or indeed themselves in this matter?  One would gain the impression that all the building projects referred to were carried out in a vacuum without any political dimension.</P>
    <P>To be more specific, did the committee consider whether political decisions <Col N="1146" /> helped to create the situation in the years in question which is now being criticised by us politicians?  Did we as politicians do anything to help to alleviate the problem? I think that all these questions are relevant ones for consideration by the committee if they are to make a serious contribution.  On the evidence provided in the report the committee seem to have ignored the questions and taken the soft option of criticising the Office of Public Works and other Government Departments. In doing so, I think they have failed to address the problem in its entirety.</P>
    <P>Let me expand a little on this last point. During the press conference Deputy O'Kennedy spoke of the necessity not to undermine the public service.  If the Deputy genuinely felt that way, he has a funny way of showing it.  Perhaps he might have made the point and, more importantly, acted upon it, before cooperating in this headlong rush to print. For my own part, let me outline briefly my own views on the subject and their relevance to this report.  I see the role of the politician and the public servant as being complementary.  In essence both are there to serve the people and to tackle their problems together.  Let me add that I do not object to criticism of the Office of Public Works or the public service generally.  I am all for examination and constructive criticism.  However, one-sided and misleading examination, as in the case of this report, which concentrates on one aspect of a two sided coin, is of little use and in the end counterproductive.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal with all the points that in my view call for comment but I will refer to some of them.  Mention is made of the length of time it takes to process tenders by the Office of Public Works.  I think all Deputies, and particularly those who have been office holders, should be well aware of the constraints in relation to public tendering under which the Office of Public Works must operate.  Nevertheless, this is an area which the Office of Public Works had been concerned about and sometime ago they initiated their own examination of <Col N="1147" /> their system &mdash; in fairness, I must say entirely independently of the report &mdash; with a view to speeding up the process.  I have had some discussions with the board and the chairman on this subject many months ago and I am confident that this will result in significant improvements in this area.</P>
    <P>The report illustrates the dependence of the Office of Public Works on the cooperation of other Government Departments during the course of works which are intended in the end to facilitate them. It is undeniable that there have been delays in the provision of briefs to the Office of Public Works by other Departments despite the efforts made to reduce this factor.  The Office of Public Works are conscious of this fact and will be exerting strong pressure in the future on all Departments to supply such information in the minimum time possible.  However, did the committee examine the question of why these delays arose?  Have they considered the fact that it might have been as a consequence of insufficient staff in these Departments to handle the problem? I put the question to illustrate the necessity to look behind each of the factors raised by the committee to find the reasons for its existence.</P>
    <P>In paragraphs 39 and 40 of the report it is stated that information was sought from the Office of Public Works about a number of fitting out projects.  That information, including a specification in each case, was supplied.  It is stated in the report that the OPW provided good value for money on these contracts.  That does not refer to some of them but to all of them.  If controls were in fact so scarce how did the commissioners manage to get such good value for money?  Of course there were controls but not of the kind that the consultant or the committee have in mind.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 41 it is stated that the OPW do not appear to operate a routine comparison system in the area of inflation costs and they were asked to do a spot check.  The report went on to say that &ldquo;the committee note that on two office projects which were checked the actual <Col N="1148" /> price variation amount paid (i.e. inflation cost) was significantly less than that based on the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors' Index&rdquo;.  Could that have been possible without controls?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>Press reports based on the report implying that there are no regular and routine management controls operated by the Department of Finance on projects are simply inaccurate.  Such controls have existed for many years.  Procedures have been agreed between the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance in connection with sanctioning work on projects.  The state of play on progress of projects and occupation of newly leased office premises is the subject of regular reports in both the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance. In agreement with the Office of Public Works, the Department of Finance have instructed Departments quite clearly on their role in ensuring that buildings leased for them are occupied as quickly as possible.  In part these procedures and controls are academic at present as budgetary constraints preclude the Office of Public Works from entering into rent commitments except in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to a very serious matter.  In paragraph 5 of the report it is stated that it is estimated that savings of the order of £2 million would have been effected if procedures set out in this report had been adopted in the case of the 26 cases referred to in chart 2.  The consultant has since admitted that that figure is purely notional.  But what happened? The figure was taken as gospel, which the consultant never intended, and has been used to conjure up a mythical saving of £30 million over a much wider range of projects of a completely different nature.  That sort of nonsense is no help to anyone and constitutes gross irresponsibility.  I do not blame the newspapers for seizing on the figure but I do blame self seeking politicians who bandy about unfounded statistics for headline seeking purposes.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works are criticised in this report for entering into leasing <Col N="1149" /> agreements too early and four of the instances referred to relate to the leasing of buildings in Harcourt Square for the Garda.  What happened there was that the Office of Public Works were instructed by the then Minister for Justice in June 1981 to lease this accommodation as a matter of urgency for a new Garda Headquarters.  In fact this had been agreed by the Government.  This was the first the Office of Public Works had heard of this proposal and they had, quite literally, to commence the necessary preparations from scratch.  In these circumstances they had no option but to take the building at that time.  Whether they felt that it was too early to enter into a lease did not enter into consideration. I am not making this point in a political context in spite of the fact that it was a fortnight before a change of Government after a general election.  I make it to illustrate that the Office of Public Works are not the master of every situation.  Of necessity they must comply with Government directions.  The Committee on Public Expenditure seem to have conveniently ignored this fact although some at least of the members should be well aware of these realities.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 45 and following paragraphs there is extensive mention of feasibility studies and documents.  It should be remembered that for the most part the Office of Public Works are acting on behalf of other Government Departments who require accommodation of one kind or another for staff engaged in tasks not directly relevant to the Office of Public Works functions.  It is no part of the responsibility of the Office of Public Works to decide on or question the need for a Garda station, an employment exchange or a customs post, neither is it within the competence or area of responsibility of that office to question a Government decision which requires the provision of a certain type of accommodation for the staff charged with implementing that decision.  The feasibility studies must be done elsewhere and the Office of Public Works must provide what is needed.  Very often too there is no need to consider whether to build or <Col N="1150" /> rent.  It is not often that a laboratory and AI station or a prison are available to rent.</P>
    <P>The last point I will mention on the projects part of the report relates to staff. It is quite clear from paragraphs 42 and 43 of the report that the staff numbers available to the Office of Public Works for the construction and fitting out projects which they are required to deal with are totally inadequate.  This has been the case down through the years.  The committee seem to have glossed over this fact.  No mention is made of why this situation arose or also of the fact that during the years under examination the Office of Public Works had to deal with an unprecedented demand for office accommodation.</P>
    <P>The committee have also considered rental levels, lease terms and rent reviews.  They say that because of the complex nature of the issues involved and the impossibility of assessing or recreating elements such as market pressure there is a significant elements of judgment in their comments.  I prefer to stick to facts.  One definite fact which the report mentioned is that in both 1981 and 1982 the weighted average of rental paid by the Office of Public Works was marginally below the weighted average of the known market rents.  When one considers that the Office of Public Works were acting on behalf of clients urgently needing accommodation and very often not only in particular areas but in specific locations, I consider this hard evidence that they were performing at the very least a competent job.</P>
    <P>On rent reviews I note that the committee find the Office of Public Works approach professional but defensive.  The latter view seems to derive from the committee's feeling that the Office of Public Works should have pushed the review situation to the limit and even gone to arbitration if necessary.  The Office of Public Works consider that operating as they were under rent review clauses which <i>inter alia</i> invariably assume that a building is vacant and available for letting at current rental values, the reviews in <Col N="1151" /> 1983 were negotiated to fair and reasonable settlements.  Passing control of a case to an independent third party at arbitration can be a double edged sword, but let there be no doubt about it: the Office of Public Works will go to arbitration in any case where a satisfactory settlement cannot be reached.</P>
    <P>The committee favours selective use of valuation surveyors and property consultants on negotiating rent reviews, new leases and research.  This will be borne in mind, though there are disadvantages. The suggestion to increase the staff when possible by recruiting a suitable qualified person is very welcome.</P>
    <P>As the committee recognises, it is the Office of Public Works policy to build rather than to lease.  A building programme has been in operation since 1976 and has been updated within the past year to take in the period up to 1988. This updating covers development on State-owned sites and disposal of some leased premises and State-owned properties. In the present financial stringency the question of purchase of buildings will hardly arise for some time.</P>
    <P>The market situation is kept under constant review and the strengthening of the valuation staff as recommended would be of great assistance in this regard.  Also of assistance will be the committee's declaration that Departments for whom the Office of Public Works act must accept that to negotiate effectively the Office of Public Works must be able to walk away if necessary even from a particularly desired building.</P>
    <P>The recommendation that any public sector bodies contemplating the leasing of office accommodation or site acquisition be first required to check that the Office of Public Works are not in the market for the same property has been anticipated by a Department of Finance letter to Departments of 15 September 1978 conveying this instruction.  I wish to assure the House that the worthwhile recommendations of the report &mdash; and there are some &mdash; will be put into effect where it is practicable to do so.</P>
    <P>I will deal with a few points raised by <Col N="1152" /> Deputies.  I can assure Deputy Bruton that fees paid by the Office of Public Works are paid in accordance with the scale of minimum fees set out by the professional organisations.  This applies to the private sector also.  The kind of pressures on the Office of Public Works with regard to rented accommodation have been mentioned.  Three examples of cases dealing with rented accommodation were mentioned in the report but there were two recent cases that were not dealt with in the report.  One instance concerned a labour exchange.  Negotiations were almost complete and the price was good but suddenly the staff threatened to strike because of bad accommodation.  The result was that the owner of the premises immediately increased the price.  In another case the Department of Social Welfare wanted accommodation for people who were providing a new service.  As Deputy Treacy told the House, they wanted the accommodation near the location of their computer but that left only one building available for the Office of Public Works. They were not in a position to go elsewhere even though other accommodation was available at a cheaper price. That is the kind of situation the Office of Public Works are up against.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen said there is evidence to show that the Office of Public Works have paid more in rent than another State body in respect of a recently leased building in Dublin.  I do not know what building the Deputy is talking about but I take exception to that kind of remark.  The Deputy has the duty to give the details to me or to the Commissioner of Public Works and we will have the matter checked.  I do not know if the Deputy is right or wrong but by giving us the details we can carry out the necessary investigations.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure Deputy O'Kennedy that the Office of Public Works intend to act on this report.  We are not backing away from anything because we have nothing to hide.  As Minister I would not tolerate the hiding of any facts.  I find the staff in the office most dedicated people and I know they will adopt any useful <Col N="1153" /> suggestions that are made.  It is not true that landlords like to have the State as tenant because it is thought the State pays the highest rent.  The report admits that in some cases it is lower than the normal rent.</P>
    <P>The question of complaints was referred to also.  Some 26 projects were examined, the total number of fitted-out projects in the office at that time.  The projects mentioned in the press conference are entirely different because they are building projects and there could be no comparison made with respect to those projects.  The committee spoke about a sum of £2 million but that is a notional figure.  I repeat that the projects referred to are totally different projects. I have not a transcript of what took place at the press conference but a report appeared in the press.  I am very glad to have this opportunity to scotch some of the nonsensical things that have been said about the Office of Public Works.  They operate under certain restrictions with regard to placing tenders.  We are not satisfied with the delay between the time we advertise and when we are able to place a tender.  The office operate under restrictions that are not imposed on the private sector and everyone knows that. We are dealing with public money and that is why we have these restrictions to ensure that the best value is got.</P>
    <P>I was glad to have had an opportunity to speak about this report because it gave me an opportunity to set out the case for the Office of Public Works and the officials.  As the person in charge of that office I am a little tired of hearing time and again that we are throwing money around.  I know there is the most strict control by our own financial section and the Department of Finance with regard to the spending of money on any project. It is nonsense to say there is no control. Everyone knows that in the period considered by the committee there was a rapid increase in inflation and costs went higher then estimated.  We are prepared to admit that but we can give the reasons.  I am disappointed that we were not given the chance to reply to the criticisms made.  We did not see a copy of the <Col N="1154" /> consultant's report and I regret that.  The committee concerned should not have made a mad rush to the press first.  It must not be forgotten that it is the Members of this House who appoint the committee members.  Their first duty should be to report to the House and have the report debated.  Then let them have all the press conferences they wish and put their points of view, if necessary.</P>
    <P>It is important that we get this message across to the public.  In regard to the public service in general there has been a new kind of bashing game.  There has been a rift driven between the public service and the public and the politicians. I hope this will be taken into account when other committees are compiling their reports.  I wish to say we are prepared to take on board the good parts of this report and if this committee have other things to say to us we will consult with them and listen to them.  I should point our that the OPW issue annual reports on the work carried out by them but in order to deal with the criticisms in this report the OPW would need to produce 50 reports annually with too much public money being wasted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear all the speech of the Minister of State but I heard his remarks about the OPW and the entire public service becoming whipping boys of the public and the other Departments. Some of the blame should be laid fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Government.</P>
      <P>I agree with many of the suggestions in the report, but in fairness to the OPW, with whom I had close contact as Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service when the decentralisation programme was in full swing.  I wish to record my appreciation of the dedication and the speedy performances of the OPW. The Minister of State was right when he said that very often they are the whipping boys of every other Department, and without reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, we have had experiences in relation to schools.  Complete sets of drawings would have to be changed because, according to the Department of <Col N="1155" /> Education, the toilets were too big or certain corridors were too narrow.  All that should have been checked by the Department of Education with the OPW before contract documents were prepared. If I have any complaint to make against the OPW it is that some direct labour contracts are allowed to drag on. We had the extraordinary delay in relation to the Members' and Visitors' Bars in Leinster House.  The work went on for three years whereas a pub in the city which had been burned was back in operation in three months.  I suppose in relation to the work here the dribs and drabs manner by which they were paid the money was responsible.</P>
    <P>The report refers to Howth harbour.  I do not know about Howth but like every other maritime Deputy I know about harbours in the country.  I know about the tremendous pressures put on OPW to extend and enlarge projects because at times the OPW do not take into account the views of fishermen and their needs because of weather conditions.</P>
    <P>The report refers to the amount of money spent on drawings without buildings being erected.  There is no use blaming the OPW for that because it is due to a Government decision taken unwisely. There is still much need for office accommodation and a need to help the economy of many small towns, like my native town.  However, the Government decided to stop the decentralisation programme.  In that regard I wish to repeat my appreciation of the speed with which the OPW did the work and the standard of their design.  It is of significance that when the team from the OPW were engaged on decentralisation projects, some of the best private architects in the country were engaged in larger programmes and the standard of design of the OPW was equal to if not better than the others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Members who participated.  The honesty of expression on all sides indicates that the committee have induced a worthwhile dialogue.  I wish to make a couple of <Col N="1156" /> points on what the Minister said.  In a very defensive speech he conveyed the impression that the report was sprung on the OPW.  On the morning of 19 November, approximately a week after the report was forwarded to the OPW, I met senior officials of the OPW and after a series of questions and answers and a discussion lasting one and a half hours both of the senior OPW representatives said they considered the report to be fair.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I deny that anybody on the committee acted in any way irresponsibly &mdash; I submit that the Minister should reconsider the use of that phrase.  I regret that he did not extend to the committee the normal courtesy of thanking the members for the work they put into the report.  There were numerous meetings, public and private, with the officials. Merely because the report does not suit the officials does not mean it is irresponsible. We endeavoured to have a dialogue and above all to be fair and just.  Much of the content of the report praises the OPW.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to a one-sided coin.  Yet he drew solace from the fact that the report praised the Office of Public Works in some respects.  He cannot have it both ways.  He cannot be selective about the report.  He made a point about the press conference and that is fair from the vantage point he occupies. Our difficulty is very simple.  The report is laid before the Dáil on a certain day. That means it is placed in the Library and becomes publicly available.  Past experience has shown that that inevitably gives rise to individual queries to individual members of the committee, which may or may not be answered on behalf of the committee, or perhaps answered in a selective or uninformed way quite without deliberation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the view of the committee that it was better to lay the report before the Dáil and answer collectively any queries which arose.  By and large that is a reasonable procedure.  We do not decide when the debate comes up here.  The Minister made the point about one daily national newspaper dealing with the report the morning before it was laid before the <Col N="1157" /> Dáil.  I can now tell him &mdash; because obviously he is not aware &mdash; that <i>The Irish Press</i> reporter in question was able to discuss the broad outline of our report, with quite a degree of satisfactory response, I understand, with somebody in the Minister's Department who answered his queries.  That was the basis of the report in <i>The Irish Press</i>.  I was at pains to find out how it came to be there, and I spoke to the reporter involved.  The Minister will be able to check that out independently for himself.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that we did not give adequate weight to the political pressures and constraints which constantly apply to an office which has to house all Government Departments.  I suggest to him that these should be stated clearly.  That kind of oblique language is of no satisfaction to the taxpayer.  We are not interested, in the context of this debate, with nebulous constraints.  If the deficiency in terms of systems control is such that a phone call from a Minister, or a change of direction by somebody, can upturn a major project, that should be clearly stated.  It should not be tolerated. That is not the way to plan major projects.  The Minister agrees that there are recommendations in the report upon which he believes improvements can be made.  I welcome that.  I am very pleased that he has seen it.</P>
    <P>He asked us did we as politicians do anything to help to alleviate the problem of political decisions helping to create a situation.  This report is addressed to the politicians and it is up to the politicians to respond and, in particular, the Minister involved who extraordinarily put forward the problem of a shortage of staff.  It is hardly my place to point out that the committee have no control over that he would have an influence there.  I have no doubt that he has a major concern in trying to ensure that improvements are made where that is a problem.  I do not accept for one moment that it is the problem. A shortage of staff is too easily and too readily advanced whenever there is a problem in the State sector.  We are talking about getting value for money and getting better quality for the money we <Col N="1158" /> are spending.  The basic problem is a lack of system.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that on the evidence provided in the report the committee seem to have ignored the questions and taken the soft option of criticising the Office of Public Works and other Government Departments.  We did not criticise.  We put forward constructive solutions to the problems as we perceived them.  We did that with respect, and not from any vantage point of absolute wisdom.  Of course we are fallible.  On the other hand, our record of fallibility could hardly be compared with the long history of a public perception of inadequacy in the area of the Office of Public Works which gave rise to this report in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to discuss the constraints he has in relation to public tendering.  I know those constraints are there, but essentially they are excuses.  If there are specific problems which hamper his Department, the Government should act and, by the way, not just this Government. This has been the system for years and years.  We reiterate the fundamental concern.  The public believe they are not getting value for money to the degree they should in this area.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to this.  Not once did he refer to the fact that there are in the order of two dozen separate recommendations in this report, all of them of a constructive nature.  In paragraph 35 we said that we were informed by the Department of Finance that there is no routine procedure for comparing the actual outturn of individual projects with the initial feasibility study.  We were informed by the Office of Public Works that, in their case also, there is no routine procedure for comparing the actual outturn of specific projects with the original feasibility data.  In layman's language that means nobody can be sure they are getting value for money, neither this House nor the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Minister of the goodwill of the committee in trying to help him to achieve the objectives he has set, and about which he is obviously concerned.  I am very grateful to him for <Col N="1159" /> taking what I would call a very energetic and vehement approach to the debate this morning.  I have no doubt that good will come from it.  I look forward to a continuing dialogue with his officials, from whom we received nothing but the height of courtesy and respect and for whom we have a collective admiration. That is not to say that jointly and working together we cannot make improvements &mdash; and that is the main concern &mdash; constructive, deliberate improvements. Nothing should impede the way forward in that respect.  I thank the House for the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be some limitation on what I can reasonably be expected to hope for.  It is a considerable pleasure and a considerable source of pride to me as Minister of State to propose to the House that it should take note of what I regard as a major, historic document, the Final Report of the National Youth Policy Committee published last month.  I want to express my appreciation and record the Government's gratitude to the chairman of that committee, Mr. Justice Declan Costello of the High Court, the rapporteur, Tadgh Ó Cearbhaill, and the other <Col N="1160" /> members of the committee, who laboured long and hard.  Members on all sides of the House will accept that an outstandingly good report has been produced within a year of the establishment of that committee in September 1983.  Such expedition could usefully be copied in other areas.</P>
      <P>At this stage it might be helpful to glance back at some of the reasons which prompted the Government to establish the National Youth Policy Committee and some of the reasons which prompted them to give the committee such extensive terms of reference.  The need to support and develop our youth services is not an issue of any contention or controversy on the part of any Deputy.  It must be acknowledged that Governments of different persuasions, since the seventies, have contributed to the support of voluntary youth organisations and the services they provide.  That acknowledged, that conceded, it has to be said that there has been no attempt to place the youth services in context either as to the established needs of young people or the place of such youth services in the overall Government provision of services more generally.  It was against that background of calls by the National Youth Council and other bodies for such an exercise that this initiative was launched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Youth Council and other youth organisations had been concerned to see emerging an overall youth policy within which they as voluntary youth organisations would find a secure place, and a valued place.  Prior to taking office the parties making up this Government made a commitment to the youth organisations to adopt a national youth policy. In pursuance of that commitment, back in September 1983 the Taoiseach established what has now become popularly known as the Costello committee.  He did so with the very extensive and wide ranging terms of reference which are to be found in chapter 2 of the report.  In accordance with the terms of that commitment and before the committee got down to business, I published a short discussion paper entitled <i>Shaping the Future,</i> of which some 5,000 copies were <Col N="1161" /> distributed, with the intention of aiding the committee in their work, raising issues and focussing discussion.</P>
    <P>The very personal involvement of the Taoiseach at all stages of this exercise, his involvement in the launching and in receiving the report shows very clearly that this Government afford the highest priority to identifying and then meeting the needs of our young people. Now, there must have been some scepticism at the news of another committee, because Governments of all political persuasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not using a script.  I have notes which I should be happy to extend to the Deputy, but I am departing very substantailly from them in various sections.  I may have been about to comment on a matter which might have been what stung Deputy Treacy to action &mdash; that is that Governments of different persuasions in the past have not been above establishing committees to talk away a committee.  I thought that he was going to suggest that there are some of us in the House who are free of such a charge but, of course, I would not make any such claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us should be happy that that has not happened in this instance.  The evidence of that is there because of the expedition with which the committee approached their task and because the Government have not been sitting back waiting for the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our first year in office, 1983, was a year of major departure for the youth services.  Deputies will recall the controversy that then abounded in relation to the development officers scheme.  Those officers, 54 of whom worked with the youth organisations, were, after much <Col N="1162" /> trial and tribulation, at long last made permanent and the grant-in-aid in support of their employment was increased from £5,000 to £7,000.  Deputies thinking back will recall that the provision for the youth service which we inherited at that time, which showed an inadequate increase of only 1 per cent, was immediately redressed and an additional allocation of some £550,000 was provided in order to ensure the development and expansion of the work of the various voluntary youth organisations.  In that context &mdash; as the funds being made available were growing and, as I earlier acknowledged, were growing under Governments of all persuasions &mdash; it seems to be important to put on a proper and formal basis an established set of criteria to govern the system of grant-in-aid for voluntary youth organisations.</P>
    <P>I have already commented that until then the situation, rather like the relationship between law and equity, was that the criteria to be applied in allocating grants to different youth organisations varied with the length of the larger toe of the Minister of State of the day.  It is important that there should be published criteria that have been negotiated with the youth organisations, which they have had a hand in shaping and against which people can judge how they are being treated.</P>
    <P>Youth organisations can take comfort from the fact that their developmental activities have been positively supported. The most basic figure, something like £1,400,000 was provided for youth organisations back in 1982.  This year it amounts to something just on £2.1 million. That represents an increase in two years of just on 50 per cent.  Equally significant is the fact that the allocation for this year contains a provision, admittedly small, of £150,000 in order to support youth groups at local level who are working with particularly disadvantaged young people.  That is an initiative which I was very happy to be able to introduce last year.</P>
    <P>In giving that historal resume, I do so not because of any desire for political self gratification or anything of that sort.  I do <Col N="1163" /> so simply in order to inform the House of the context in which the Costello committee were launched.  It cannot be disputed that youth organisations would not have been able to contemplate such a report, or to participate or respond, had it not been for the action taken to build up their financial security and to make permanent their staff resources. Had it not been for those decisions, it is inconceivable that the committee would have been able to define so clearly the role they were going to seek for special youth services as part of an enlarged national youth service.  That just would not have been on, had it not been possible to identify and to support individual local projects for disadvantaged young people over the last couple of years.</P>
    <P>Against the background of action over the last couple of years, we are in a position to stand back, consider and respond to the major recommendations of the Costello report.  Most importantly, we are able to do that with the support and goodwill of all those who are most closely involved in working with young people. Again, and in line with the spirit of the report of the committee, we have continued and developed the consultation process, pursuant to our commitment to a response to young people as a social partner.  Only this week the Taoiseach, the Minister for Education, the Minister for Labour and I met with the representatives of the National Youth Council to review with them the range of Government policies that affect young people. In accordance with our commitment on entering office, too, we have taken a policy decision to see to it that the voice of young people is heard where it counts. Young people have been appointed by this Government to the board of the Youth Employment Agency and to play a role in relation to An Bord Pleanála, to prison visiting committees and very many others, the most striking of which perhaps is the National Economic and Social Council, on which two representatives nominated by the National Youth Council now sit &mdash; and that on a much reduced body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> That is the background.  The House will accept, I think, that the timing is opportune for this discussion, coming as it does on the very eve of National Youth Year.  It is appropriate that at such a time this first debate in Dáil Éireann on youth policy should take place.  In examining the report, one of the first things which Deputies will have noted was that on the very cover &mdash; the logo for International Youth Year and its explanation and relevance to the themes of that year &mdash; participation, development and peace.</P>
    <P>In undertaking this major policy exercise, we were concerned that it should be seen as part of our preparations for International Youth Year, although, of course, that has not been the extent of our concern or of our interest.  I have also established a national committee to prepare for an organised International Youth Year and am happy to say that even at this stage we can look forward to quite a wide ranging series of activities at local, regional and national level.</P>
    <P>We can look forward to next year on the basis that the Costello report has laid the foundation for real and solid advance during that very important year.  I am sure that we do not simply engage in isolated, temporary and, indeed, perhaps cynical once-off gestures.  I was anxious that the House would have an opportunity at an early date after publication, to debate this report.  I wanted to have the benefit of the views of Deputies before I would come to submit to Government a statement on national youth policy for approval, which would, of course, be based on the report.  As members of the House will be aware, immediately on receipt of the report the Government arranged for its publication, which took place on 11 October.  At the official publication, I requested that any views, observations or comments of interested parties should be forwarded to my Department as soon as possible.  I am glad to say that we are receiving in some numbers the considered views of youth organisations, State bodies, Government Departments and others.  We will shortly be in a position to formulate the Government's considered response.  The <Col N="1165" /> House already knows something of the parameters because it will be recalled that in the national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> the Government asserted their commitment and determination to deliver during International Youth Year.  On pages 109 and 110 of the national plan it is stated:</P>
    <P>...... a national youth policy which will have its own distinct purposes but would interact with other policies and measures.  The policy will be aimed at assisting more young people to become self-reliant, responsible and active participants in society. It will include:</P>
    <P>a clear philosophy of youth development and a statement of principles to guide Government policies; an objective assessment of the factual position of young people in contemporary Ireland;</P>
    <P>a detailed plan for the provision of services to young people generally and disadvantaged young people in particular; provision for the participation and involvement of young people in an active way at all levels in Irish society.</P>

      <P>In advance of publication and in advance of an opportunity to consider the report, the Government set aside an additional sum of £1½ million.  The Deputy's question was not inappropriate in those circumstances.  It is proper that the Government should have so anticipated the findings of the report.  By making cash available they have allowed us to facilitate planning on a response to the priorities identified in the report.  That increase comes on top of an increase of almost 50 per cent in the youth service subhead in the Department of Labour.  It was £1.497 million and it is now up to £2.222 million.  I am prompted by Deputy Daly to remind the House that I will be spending an additional £3 million in capital support for community and youth facilities during the <Col N="1166" /> period of the national plan.  Members will recall that it is some years since we have been in that happy position.  This is the first injection of new money into this area since the early part of this decade.</P>

      <P>Deputies will accept that we have shown, in difficult financial circumstances, that we are prepared to put our money where our mouth is and have shown the priority we attach to youth needs as they are being met by voluntary youth organisations at local level.</P>
      <P>The report is so comprehensive and all-embracing that, without doing a grave discourtesy to other Members who want to contribute, it would be impossible to analyse the individual recommendations at this stage.  My comments have not had the benefit of the full range of detailed comments which I am awaiting from a number of interested organisations.  I approach this debate on the basis of having an open mind on some of the major issues raised in the report.  I see the report as being a landmark in the development of services to young people. It is charting the way towards a national youth service and providing an analysis of the position young people in society and the trends and prospects that face them over the next decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the initial statement made on publication of the national youth policy.  On that occasion on behalf of the Government I accepted the recommendation that any youth policy must be guided by a clear philosophy on youth development and be based on a statement of principle which would govern the detailed implementation of the policy.  In chapter 3 of the report the philosophy and principles expounded by the youth policy committee are articulated.  I welcome the fact that the committee have chosen in that fashion to make explicit the policy which underlies their recommendation. The democratic philosophy and vision articulated there is a healthy and compelling one to which we will have <Col N="1167" /> to respond.  The report spells out in the clearest way the importance of participation by young people in society and in that context it refers to the need for adequate social and political education.</P>
    <P>Members of all parties will be aware that I have already announced that I am prepared to consider applications from registered political parties represented in Dáil Éireann for grant assistance towards the employment of an education officer whose specific remit will be that of political education.  The intention is that such officers would be responsible for training programmes for young people within the youth movements of political parties and would be expected to demonstrate over a period tangible results in the form of increased participation at local level by young people in community affairs.  I can report to the House that all political parties have expressed interest in that proposal and have responded to it.  I am at present engaged in a series of discussions with their representatives.</P>
    <P>I do not want to overstate the benefits that are likely to accrue from that initiative. I accept that, for the most part, political and social education will have to be undertaken in the schools through a reformed curriculum.  I accept that will have to be supplemented by informal education which, for the most part, will be gained through youth organisations. That said, I am quite convinced of the need to strengthen our democratic political life through preparing and educating skilled and motivated young people to be involved at all levels.  The report and in particular chapter 15 has made a worthwhile contribution to that.</P>
    <P>The Curriculum and Examination Board are charged with the task of evolving a new curriculum.  It is quite clear what the task is.  The report puts it very clearly: the primary aim of the national policy must be to unleash the potential of young people and maximise for society as a whole the social capital that our huge youth population represents.  In chapter 11 of the report it is recommended that any new youth service should primarily offer young people, on the basis of their <Col N="1168" /> voluntary involvement, developmental and educational experience which will equip them to play an active part in a democratic society as well as meeting their own developmental needs.  That overall philosophical approach is at the core of the purpose of the youth service. I am confident that Deputies on all sides will concur with me and with the committee in that regard.</P>
    <P>One area of the report which is of great importance is the preoccupation with the needs of disadvantaged young people. I refer again to the initial Government statement which stated that, as a matter of social justice, the Government believe that the needs and rights of disadvantaged young people require special measures in order to produce equality of opportunity.  For that reason, it is very encouraging to see the report devote a whole section to the specific needs of the disadvantaged covering topics such as school attendance, neighbourhood youth projects, youth encounter projects, the issue of homeless young people, the question of substance abuse, young offenders and so on.</P>
    <P>Some of these recommendations and areas of concern have been the subject of Government response in recent months.  I give as two examples the question of substance in drug abuse and also the position of young travellers.  No Deputy in this House, most particularly no Deputy from an urban area, can be unaware of the absolutely horrific problem of drug abuse and cannot but have been affected by all the attendant evils, so there is no need to elaborate on that. The House will be aware that the Government established in 1983 a task force of Ministers of State to evolve a comprehensive Government response, bringing together Ministers whose responsibility was in the area of law enforcement, treatment facilities, education and youth areas so that the response would cover all of those areas and would not pretend that this problem can be met by the activities of any one Government Department when quite clearly it cannot.</P>
    <P>The National Youth Policy Committee met with the task force of Ministers of <Col N="1169" /> State in February 1984 and made known their views on substance abuse.  Deputies will be aware of the way in which the Government responded in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984 which was introduced to the House and amended the provisions of the 1977 legislation in quite a number of respects, in order to aid the drive against criminals who push drugs and bring death, misery and hardship to our streets.  I endorse the position taken by the report that properly developed youth services have a vital part to play in prevention. That fact was anticipated and recognised back in 1983 in the publication of the Government statement after the work of those committees.</P>
    <P>In regard to the position of travellers, Deputies will be aware of the Government statement in July 1984 which set out a comprehensive programme to respond, involving the provision of accommodation and other services for travellers.  As a matter of interest to the House, that response followed on the work of a number of Ministers of State who came together to look at the situation.  What is said in the Costello Report must be considered, particularly the very eloquent case made there to ensure access for young travellers to youth and community services. There are a number of areas of concern in the report which have already been the subject of Government response: the Green Paper on the disabled, the community services orders legislation which becomes operative this week, and I do not propose to go into any great detail there at this stage.</P>
    <P>One or two themes run right through the report to which I should address myself.  One is the extraordinarily detailed portrait presented in the document of the position of young people in Irish society politically, socially, culturally and in terms of economics.  I want to say something about the case stated for a comprehensive youth service.  It is extraordinary that within such a short time, an almost impossible time limit, the committee were able to provide us with such an incisive profile of the place of young people in Irish society.  They have <Col N="1170" /> provided us with a veritable mine of information in a very acceptable and readable way.  In doing so they were aided by the market research which they conducted and in particular the opinion poll commissioned by them.  We all will find ourselves in agreement with the statement of the <i>Irish Independent</i> last Tuesday which described the report in this area as presenting &ldquo;a broad picture of the contemporary lifestyle of Irish youth&rdquo;.  If that is so, then this report is not addressed just to Government.  Every agency active in Irish life needs to consider and respond, to consider in detail the negative and positive aspects of Irish life and Irish society and their perception by young people as identified in the report.</P>
    <P>By way of example, all of our Churches need to consider reviewing their approach to young people in the light of that report.  The evidence in the report suggested a very marked trend away from religious orthodoxy among young people.  The opinion poll I have referred to came up with the remarkable fact that of a list of some 14 concepts that were put before young people and which they were asked to evaluate, only reuniting Ireland by violence ranked lower than religion in young people's priorities.  If Church leaders are to find themselves a little concerned about some of the findings, there is little joy in it for all of us in this House because there is less comfort if anything in it for politicians than for anybody else.  Of nine categories of adults listed, trade union officials, public officials and, I regret to say, particularly politicians emerge as the group in society perceived by young people as being least prepared to listen and least capable of understanding their views.  We ignore that at our peril, at the risk of inflicting fatal injury on our whole political fabric and political life.  That perception that emerges so clearly is reinforced by the research that was taking place into young people's political attitudes which reveals at the best apathy and at worst active disinterest.  Only 1 per cent of young people in the 15 to 24 years age bracket survey belonged to a political group.  Against that background that I <Col N="1171" /> have been putting forward the need for developing participation and for adequate political and social education must be recognised.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned some immediate responses taken by me and the Government, but in this area the response of every Member of the House is required. This is addressed to us as individuals and to each of the parties in this House particularly and distinctively.  There is a fund of goodwill there waiting to be tapped. The negative perception I have referred to must be seen in sharp contrast with the very positive interest displayed by young people in issues presented to them such as achieving more equal distribution of wealth, protection of the environment, peace, the Third World and so on, all in contrast with this very negative perception by young people of a political system as we know it.  The fund of goodwill is there.  It is important that we take the opportunities provided, and I hope that all of us in this House will respond.</P>
    <P>I come to the core of the document, that is the recommendations that touch on the need for a comprehensive youth service.  Chapters 10 to 12 of the report deal with this and they describe in the first instance the present range of services available to young people, define a proposed new youth service, assess youth service needs and then give a proposed new structure to expound.  There has been a great deal of talk about the comprehensive youth service, but I am not sure that we stop often and ask ourselves exactly what we mean by that.  It might be instructive if we did so.  The committee were clear in their minds as to what they saw as being involved.  They recommended that youth work services, which they define as the out of school education provided in the main by voluntary organisations, together with special services to youth, such as information and advice centres, youth encounter projects, work with disadvantaged youth and unattached youth, should be encompassed together in a new national youth service.</P>

      <P>To date the committee have not recommended on the filling of any posts in the Department of Finance because no vacancies at the relevant levels have occurred in that Department since the new scheme came into operation.  However, officers of the Department of Finance have applied for vacancies elsewhere in exactly the same way as officers from other Departments and, indeed, an officer from the Department of Finance has been appointed to a post in another Department.</P>
      <P>I am aware that staff in the Department of Finance and indeed in other Departments have expressed concern about the comparability of the performance assessments which have been made by the heads of individual Departments for the committee's use.  I understand that this is a matter to which the committee are giving attention in consultation with the Departments concerned.</P>
      <P>As part of an ongoing process of appraisal the committee will shortly be seeking further assessments.  I would not be disposed to get involved in this aspect of the committee's operations.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware.  The individual heads of the Departments prepared assessments and returned them to the committee.  The procedure that is now being adopted is that the assessment forms are being somewhat refined and a further series of assesment are due.  It is hoped that assessments will continue to be obtained on an ongoing basis so that a profile will be built up over a passage of time regarding the cadre of eligible people.  One of the concerns of the committee was to assess the comparability of the assessments, as between one Department and another, and that is a matter to which they have been giving considerable attention in recent times.  Obviously, it is an important consideration in the context of the usefulness of the assessments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding that under the regulations of the Top Level Appointments Committee heads of Departments are asked to assess an officer's overall performance in comparison with the generality of officers in their experience of the level in question in the Civil Service generally.  I understand that the secretary of the Department of Finance has not done that.  Therefore, officers in that Department eligible to go forward for promotions are not doing so on the basis of the regulations or on an equal basis with their colleagues in other Departments.  If the Minister is aware of that, will he give an assurance that the officers in the Department of Finance will be treated on an equal basis with their colleagues in other Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly be very concerned if it emerged that there was any substance in the apprehension that is inherent in the Deputy's question.  An officer from the Department of Finance has gone already to another Department on promotion.  That, to some extent, indicates that officers in Finance have been given very reasonable consideration in so far as one of them was successful in promotion to a line Department.  I would be as concerned as the Deputy to ensure <Col N="1174" /> that the senior officials in all Departments are given fair and reasonable consideration. I will take the matter up with the Top Level Appointments Committee if the Deputy thinks that might be helpful.</P>

I should like to ask the Minister to take up this matter at an early date and, if necessary, have discussions with the Association of Higher Civil Servants who have been in correspondence with the Minister for Finance and the secretary of the Department for several months on this matter but have failed to solve it.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the huge increase in public service numbers in the seventies and particularly in the period 1977-1981, the Government are satisfied that considerable scope for staffing efficiencies still exists.  Any temporary difficulties arising are being alleviated by a policy of redeployment of staff to the areas where they are most urgently required.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any intention of making alterations in the embargo in regard to the Revenue Commissioners where there are 518 staff short at a time when under assessment of £3,500 million is due in tax?  In view of that, and the great loss to the Exchequer, has the Minister any plans to increase the staffing in the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Previously the Government placed a levy on other Departments so as to get more than 100 staff for the Revenue.  I am glad the Deputy has raised this matter, because it is worthy of consideration.  There are approximately 30,000 non-industrial civil servants in the various Departments of State.  Some 7,000 of them are employed in the Revenue Commissioners.  Virtually one quarter of the total non-industrial civil servants are employed in one form or another in the collection of revenue. That is a considerable proportion by any standards and by the standards of any service.  What is most important is to ensure that the staff within that large grouping are deployed as efficiently and effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the reference to £3,500 million of tax assessments I am glad the Deputy has raised that also.  This is a hoary old chestnut that is dragged up from time to time and, without wishing to be contentious, I must say it is dragged out very often by the Deputy's party.  It is advanced as if it represents tax uncollected. This of course is the total of assessments made by the Revenue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it is usually made on people who have not made tax returns to encourage them to do so.  Generally it is accepted that the assessments are set at a level far in excess of the probable liability so as to further the encouragement of returns.  It is a figure which can be very misleading if presented in isolation and not explained clearly.</P>
      <P>My Department at present are carrying out a comprehensive review of the operation and staffing of the Revenue in various areas.  We have already identified areas where if changes were made staff might be redeployed to other areas with the possible beneficial improvement in revenue collection.  We are in discussion with the Revenue Commissioners regarding this possible redeployment of staff to areas where they can be most effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the Revenue Commissioners have insufficient staff to go through these outstanding assessments to see how much is actually due?  Is it true that 120 tax posts are unfilled?  Does the Minister see this as a priority to bring revenue into the Exchequer so that taxes will not have to be paid by other people to make up for those who have not paid?  Does the Minister see this as a priority to get around the embargo to fill the posts in the Revenue Commissioners' office?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are sufficient people trying to find methods to get around the embargo without me joining that group and my task is to ensure they do not get around the embargo.  The Deputy asked if I agreed that the Revenue Commissioners did not have sufficient staff.  My belief is there are sufficient <Col N="1177" /> staff overall &mdash; 7,000 approximately &mdash; but I accept that there is a case to be made that within certain areas of Revenue additional staff might be redeployed from other areas with particular attention being paid to potential revenue outstanding. I take the essence of what the Deputy is saying.  Perhaps he is suggesting that the staff in Revenue might be more effectively deployed?  That is the subject of the review which my Department, in co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners, are carrying out at present and I hope we will be in a position to report considerable progress in the near future.</P>

      <P>What are the Minister's present powers in relation to redeployment or mobility of labour within the Civil Service?  The Minister has made it clear that he will not change the three in one system.  Must there be an investigation carried out in each Department before staff can be redeployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On several occasions over the last two years the Government decided to place levies on other Departments to meet an immediate or particular need in individual Departments.  The Revenue Commissioners are a case in point because, to my recollection, 104 staff were supplied to them early in 1983. The deployment of staff is exercising our minds more and more.  For example, when winding down the Land Commission, it will be necessary to carry out large scale redeployment of the staff of that office.  In connection with redeployment to Revenue where there are a number of departmental grades, there can sometimes be difficulty.  In general we have received co-operation in the area of redeployment and it is important that that should be so.  If the service is to operate is effectively as possible there has to be general recognition that from time to time activities on which personnel may have been engaged do not retain as high a priority as they might have had 20 years ago and it might, with benefit, be suggested that they be redeployed in <Col N="1178" /> some other area.  That is the policy we are pursuing at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the non-established grades, messengers and porters, have suffered unduly under the embargo?  These grades have always been used to reduce staff while the clerical grades have maintained their quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The embargo operates on the basis of filling every third post as it becomes vacant.  If this were bearing more heavily on one grade than another this could only be attributed either to extraordinary coincidence or, as Deputy Mac Giolla said, to people trying to get around the embargo.  We try to ensure that this does not happen.  There is some justification in the Deputy's suggestion that in some areas the embargo appears to have impinged on certain grades to a greater extent than on others and that is something we are trying to rectify.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that this information is available in any one Department.  The Deputy is asking about different wage categories whose average net take home pay is £100, £125 or £150 per week.  In order to assess that, there would have to be an examination of the wages and salaries of all public service employees, together with the benefits and allowance claimed by them for taxation purposes.  Other deductions from their gross pay would also have to be taken into account to ascertain how many had net pay in the bands mentioned. Information has never been compiled on that basis and to so do would be a mammoth job which would involve a number of different agencies.</P>

If the pay of civil servants <Col N="1182" /> is computerised &mdash; as it must be &mdash; can he not say how many cheques under £100, £125 and £150 are issued every week?</P>

      <P>The calculations are done by reference to the basic pay of personnel together with the estimated pay cost of numbers in each band and category.

The figures used for comparative purposes or for carrying out an exercise as to cost are gross figures, together with numbers.</P>

      <P>The central data processing service which is a costly State enterprise in Kilmainham can be coded in whatever way somebody wishes but, if the Minister does not have these facts, surely he can give us an idea of how many civil servants are in certain categories?  I know from experience that the computer system operates by grades.  The answer is probably that nobody bothered to calculate it.  Could the Minister say how many people are earning less than £200 per week?</P>

      <P>The House should be aware that public servants are not paid through one computer.  Civil servants, the Garda, the Army, teachers and health board personnel are included in the Exchequer pay bill.  Local authorities are directly involved in Exchequer costs but are not in the Exchequer pay bill. Those personnel are paid in a variety of different ways, mainly through computerised systems.  From the point of view of pay calculations, pay costs are calculated on a gross basis relating to the pay band and the number of staff in each pay band.  An annual figure is then given for the gross pay band cost in the public service and, unfortunately, it has never been found necessary to compile the figures on the basis of net take home pay. Therefore, it is not available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Members on this side of the House find the Minister's explanation <Col N="1183" /> incredible.  At the end of its calculations the computer sends out a net cheque. Surely someone at the end of the computer could count the cheques coming out which were under £100 and so on?  Is the Minister suggesting that he and the Government can have a serious approach to public service pay without the information regarding the number of people earning under £100, £125 and £150. Surely, in coming to decisions on public service pay that would be basic information needed to make any sort of judgment about our approach in any year to public service pay?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Government and I have available is the same basic information which Deputy Haughey and his Government had available to them when he was Taoiseach.  It is on that information that the Government, and presumably his Government, adopted their strategy in relation to public service pay.  The figures are compiled on a gross basis.  The assessment of the tax impact on the overall gross pay figure is available to the Government.  It has never been found necessary to assess the net take home pay in relation to individuals.  The information is not available now and the time and expense necessary to do so is neither worthwhile nor beneficial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister whether the public service provide any allowance for personal deductions by civil servants and is that why he cannot give the net pay in an individual case, as they vary so much?  One individual might be saving £10 per week and someone else might be saving £30 a week.  Is that provided for in the computer system which the Civil Service operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy realises, because of the operation of the PAYE system in relation to some people at certain times of the year, a greater amount of tax is deducted from their pay cheque. In addition, there are a number of what are known as &ldquo;check off&rdquo; facilities which <Col N="1184" /> allow for items other than statutory deductions to be taken from the gross pay cost to arrive at a net figure.</P>
      <P>The net figure could contain items such as suggested by Deputy Carey.  From that point of view it is not considered beneficial to the State to know in any one week the net amount which an individual earns. The important figure, which has always been used, is the gross pay figure in the band.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.  The estimates for the public service published on 15 November include provision, based on sanctioned pay rates, of £2,380 million for Exchequer pay and pensions in 1985. The budgetary discipline in the national plan requires that the Exchequer provision for pay and pensions in 1985 must not exceed £2,400 million.  Accordingly, the maximum amount which could be made available in 1985 for increases in pay and pensions above the £2,380 million would be £20 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's policy on wage increases for public service employees is set out in paragraphs 7.20, 7.21 and 7.22 of the national plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> which indicates that achievement of the Government's public expenditure targets requires that the growth in the pay and <Col N="1186" /> pensions bill be severely restricted.  In this context the maximum amounts which could be made available for pay and pensions in each of the years 1985 to 1987 are set out.  In general, the Government's approach to keeping within these limits will be based on a policy of curtailing the growth in average pay per head in order to avoid severe reductions in public service staffing.  They permit a nominal increase in expenditure in 1985 followed by a moderate increase over the remaining period of the plan.  In particular, they permit the payment of special pay increases already sanctioned or committed under the 1983 Public Service Pay Agreement including payments arising in 1985 and 1986.  It is not possible to provide for any further special increases over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>I have invited the Public Services Committee of ICTU to discuss with me public service aspects of the national plan and the operation of the present machinery for pay determination.  In this context I have indicated to the committee that I feel there is a fair measure of public consensus that there is a special need at present to protect the interests of low paid workers, and that this is an issue which could usefully be discussed with the committee in the context of the national plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's last comment dealt with low paid workers.  Is he now admitting that he agrees the document he referred to is totally unrealistic? Is he prepared to provide additional funds for low paid workers outside the £20 million?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the recent increases given to a number of State and semi-State companies, is the Minister still saying that the £20 million, which is roughly 1 per cent for public service employees with no special increases of any kind, is what is on offer to the unions? Does he seriously expect that the ICTU will meet him to discuss that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated the parameters in my reply.  I also indicated the concern which I think is evident in the community that at times like this the lot of lower paid workers should receive special attention and should be specifically addressed.  I made that suggestion to the Public Services Committee of the ICTU in my most recent letter to them. In the context of the 1983 Public Service Pay Agreement I endeavoured to have the question of low paid workers, especially those with heavy family commitments and outgoings, addressed specifically in the context of that agreement, but that was not found possible at the time.  I think that once again it is relevant to examine the position of lower paid public service workers at a time when we are endeavouring to contain expenditure generally and to meet certain targets with regard to public service pay.  As is evident from the introduction of the family income supplement scheme recently, there is a recognition by the Government that the position of those in employment and who are on low pay should be specifically adverted to and given attention.  I should like to be able to do that in the course of discussions with the Public Services Committee of the ICTU.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that £20 million is all that is available for public service pay and he has also said that he wishes to do something for low paid public servants.  Will he tell the House how this will be done?  The only basis I can see is a reduction in the pay of the remainder of the public service.  If the provision is for 1 per cent for the entire public service and if the Minister is now talking about making some provision without it being additional to the money allocated, how can this be done?  It is important that we know this if we are to try to follow his philosophy on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Estimates for next year estimate the pay and pensions bill at £2,380 million.  The Government's plan estimates that overall the public service pay bill should not exceed £2,400 million in 1985.  The Estimates provision for 1984 <Col N="1188" /> was £2,376 million but the outturn figure is not yet available.  The Deputy, like other people, can make calculations and come to various conclusions but it would be wrong for me to begin to engage in a discussion here that might more appropriately be concluded in the first instance with the Public Services Committee of the ICTU.</P>

A sum of £20 million has been set aside for wage increases in the public service and there are 68,000 public servants.  In setting out that money, will the Minister tell the House if the Government had some kind of plan or target?

      <P>As I said in reply to the questions, and as was said at the time when the plan was published, the overall expenditure figure for public service pay in each of the three years will mean there is provision for only a very nominal increase in pay during 1985.  We have to look at the overall numbers employed in the public service, their respective <Col N="1189" /> incomes and the aspirations in the plan. There is provision for a very nominal increase in global terms.  With regard to how that increase may be used in relation to the various categories in the public service, that is one of the subject matters I had hoped to discuss with the Public Services Committee of the ICTU.  It would be inappropriate if I were to begin to engage in what might be regarded as negotiations with individual Members of the House regarding the specific determination of the overall public service pay provision for 1985 at this stage.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the average industrial wage is £167,000 per week, men and women, and that there is a large body of public servants in regional hospitals and other such areas earning less than £130 per week gross, including Dáil ushers?  Does he consider all those to be in the low paid category and will he give special consideration to them on that basis?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I know inflation has taken its toll but the true figure is only £167.  I am very conscious of the position of the categories to which the Deputy has referred but I would find difficulty in defining the cut off point, the level below which a worker might be deemed to be low paid.  In general there are large numbers of personnel in various parts of the public service who are earning considerably less than the average industrial wage.  It is those earning considerably less than the average income that I would most like to see attention being given to. Some of those will be eligible for the family income supplement scheme, others might not be.  The Deputy probably shares my view of the position?</P>

I said there were particularly low paid public servants who would be qualified for the family supplement scheme and that people in that category are the people whom I would have a particular desire to help.  They are within and without the public service.

In view of that, and in view of the Government's policy to restrict public service pay, and to restrict increases in all sorts of social services and health services, does he think it is <Col N="1193" /> reasonable that pensions of this nature should be paid while Dáil salaries are also being received?</P>

I have considered that as a general question.  I do not think it fair that people in receipt of some superannuation benefit which they became entitled to on foot of their service should have that benefit removed from them at some stage during its course of payment.

      <P>I am not sure that I follow the Deputy correctly.  What I have been saying is that, where people are in receipt of a public service pension following a qualification period for entitlement, it would not be my intention to make a change in that arrangement.  If the Deputy is asking whether there is a distinction between those who are former officer-holders and Members of the House receiving pension, and people who have worked in other parts of the public sector and are now Members of the House and receiving a pension, there is no distinction.  Former Ministers or former officer-holders are not the only people who are Members of this House and are in receipt of pensions from the State or the public sector.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that a Dáil Deputy's responsibility and ministerial responsibility are different? The pension Deputy De Rossa is referring to is for a job which a person has actually left.  It is related to the years of service in that post.  It is unreasonable to try to equalise the two pensions.  It is not a case of somebody being paid for years of service as a Deputy.  If the Minister were to follow Deputy De Rossa's line of argument it could also be said that any person who is a Member of this House and has a pension funded in part or fully by the State should lose that? Ministerial responsibility is different from the responsibility of a member of a semi-State commercial body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Office-holders are paid from the Department to which they were assigned.  Members of the Dáil are paid from the Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The salary set for performance in office is set by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration who made it clear in their report that in setting salary levels they took into account the fact that a pension is payable after a certain period of service as an office-holder.  In 1937 the committee felt that, among other <Col N="1195" /> reasons, it would be reasonable that an amount should be paid to a former officer who was still a Member of the Dáil to encourage such people to remain in the Dáil so that there would be contained within the House a core of personnel with experience of Government whether they were serving on the Opposition Front Bench or on the back benches in Government or in opposition.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's second question, it is reasonable to say that, if it were to be suggested that former office-holders should not receive some recognition for their service in office while serving as Members of the Dáil, it could equally be argued that other people in receipt of public service pensions should not receive them either.  That has never been suggested.  I would not have thought it was now being advanced.</P>

They are still in the House and they are receiving pensions for serving for four years or thereabouts as Ministers or Ministers of State.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not seem to appreciate that Members of the House receive payments in respect of the service which they were elected to give as Members of the House.  All Members receive the same amount of payment irrespective of their length of service or experience.  From the first day he is elected a Deputy receives the same payment as a Deputy who has been a Member for 30 years.  The House has considered that on a number of occasions and felt that is the way it should be. Separately a decision was taken 46 or 47 years ago that an additional allowance should be paid separate to a Deputy's allowance when they cease to be Ministers. If they have served the required period they should be paid an additional amount by way of pension in recognition of the fact that they had additional payments as Minister and to encourage them to remain Members of the House.  That has been copperfastened by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration which suggested that they would recommend a far higher level of payment to Ministers whilst they served as Ministers, were there not this provision of a pension after a period of years available.  If the Deputy is suggesting that Members of the House should receive no other income from any other source, that is a different matter.  I do not think he can draw the distinction between people who have served in ministerial office and those who have served in the public sector and who are then elected to this House.  Let us be clear about this.  What Deputy De Rossa is trying to do in a very roundabout way is to attack the concept that former Ministers who are now Members of the House should have public service pensions and defend the idea that the other half of his parliamentary party, Deputy Mac Giolla, can be a Member of this House and still be in receipt of a pension from his former employment.  That is precisely what Deputy De Rossa is trying to defend.  He cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>I had been talking in terms of the comprehensive youth service proposed by the Costello report, explaining that that encompasses two aspects, youth work service and the area of special services.  It is submitted by the report that this service would be provided by local youth service committees, that those committees would be representative of voluntary and statutory agencies and that the service would be comprehensive in two ways.  First, it would be available to all young people <Col N="1219" /> throughout the State and, secondly, comprehensive in the sense that it would embrace a full range of services as required by young people from time to time, or from place to place.</P>
      <P>Much earlier in my contribution, I referred to the philosophy and principles which the report urges should inform a new service.  All the members of the committee were deeply impressed, I understand, by the dedication and selfless contribution made by the many voluntary youth organisations and, indeed, their leadership.  I want to take this opportunity of endorsing that and adding my tribute to the work of the voluntary youth organisations, singling out for mention their co-ordinating body, the National Youth Council.</P>
      <P>The report endorses what has been the policy of this Government and what I take to be common policy of the parties in this House, which is that the future development of youth services should be firmly based on promotion and development of voluntary and community involvement in the delivery of services. Having enunciated that philosophy, the report goes on to outline how that voluntary effort can be linked into the role of different statutory agencies.  I very much look forward to Deputies' views on how this is to be achieved.  It seems that the task of building a national youth service is one area where partisan attitudes are to be and can be avoided.</P>
      <P>I am listening with an open mind, as I have already promised, to all the views which will be expressed on this issue, so that when the Government come to approve of the shape of this policy statement, it will reflect what I believe to be the aspirations of everybody, which is the attainment, to the maximum extent possible, of the welfare and development of all our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can I say in conclusion that the report itself concludes with an acknowledgment that the recommendations which it put forward and those which are accepted will not be implemented overnight, but will fall to be implemented in stages.  I believe that a planned, phased approach <Col N="1220" /> is necessary, for two reasons, first, because resources are limited, but if that were never the case, I would still think it desirable because that means that we shall have an opportunity to keep on learning, so that we can review our progress and build on our strength and eliminate our weaknesses.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that any form of blanket, rigid prescription for the whole country to be imposed at once from Mespil Road would be a quite inappropriate course, not one that should commend itself to any Member of the House, or indeed any of the groups particularly interested.  We require a steady, constructive advance based on a clear national youth policy that responds constructively and positively to the Costello report.</P>
    <P>At this stage the immediate task must be to communicate that this is a highly important report and to do so as effectively as possible.  This debate taking place today has an important role to play. I mention also, for the information of the House, that the National Youth Policy Committee favoured the publication of a popular version of the report, taking the view that the number of people who would make their way through the almost 300 pages of this report would necessarily be limited.  There is a lot of merit in that view, so I am happy to say that my Department have arranged, in conjunction with the National Youth Council and with the publication <i>Young Citizen</i> for a popularised version of the report and 20,000 copies to be made available with a view to distribution in the 800 schools throughout the country and also to youth clubs.  I think that will prove of interest to the people to whom this report is primarily addressed and certainly we shall be interested to see the response of young people to this very essential report.</P>
    <P>I look forward very much to the views which will emerge during the course of this debate.  There is a great deal of work to be done and time is not on our side. However, we must all start and move along the road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>This document is certainly welcome in that it identifies all the problems affecting our young people.  It is the most comprehensive document yet produced.  It contains much food for thought for everybody involved in youth work, but particularly for politicians who are charged with the responsibility of providing for the welfare of young people.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I want to congratulate the Minister of State on his personal commitment to youth affairs.  He has certainly done his best to bring about many urgent initiatives and developments in so many spheres affecting young people.  Unfortunately, commitment begins and ends with the Minister.  It is in order to be of assistance to him in what so far has been a pretty fruitless exercise on his part that it is incumbent on me to put this report in context in terms of its necessity and implementation.  I do not have very many complaints about the contents of the report but was the priority to have yet another report or was it to provide action in so many areas which have already been clearly defined?  The report was commissioned nearly 12 months after the Government came into office in September 1983.  It was launched with the short report, <i>Shaping the Future</i>.  I could not help but feel at the time that it was a holding exercise after 12 months of total Government inaction on youth affairs and would provide a breathing space for another 12 months of inaction while the committee was sitting.  I have not yet been convinced that I was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the third major report on youth policy which we have received in the past number of years.  It follows policy for youth and sport by Deputy Bruton in 1977 and the O'Sullivan report in 1980, which was commissioned by Deputy Tunney.  It contains many of the same proposals and much of the content of the O'Sullivan report.  The O'Sullivan report concentrated mainly on mainline youth services.  Would it not have been more appropriate for the Government, who are supposedly committed to young people, to build on the work started by Deputy Tunney and continue with the implementation of the proposals outlined <Col N="1222" /> in that report rather than set about producing what amounts to a replica of that report?</P>
    <P>It is deeply disappointing, after listening to the speech made by the Minister of State, that we do not yet have a Government policy on youth affairs.  My understanding was that the report of this committee would put forward various options to the Government.  I expected that the Minister of State would outline the Government's policy on youth affairs in the House today.  It is deeply disappointing to me, youth organisations and young people that this debate will pass by without knowing what the Government's policy is regarding young people.  It is a far cry from the commitment made by the Fine Gael Party prior to the 1981 general election when they promised a policy on youth affairs.  We will leave this debate knowing as much as we did when we started it.</P>
    <P>There is much dissatisfaction with the structure of youth affairs at present.  The change from the Department of Education to the Department of Labour was a retrograde step and I urge that it be moved back to the Department of Education and that proposals be made on the duplication that exists in so many areas at present.  That is a prerequisite to effective action on youth affairs.</P>
    <P>The report states that it found disappointing the attitude of antipathy to politicians disclosed in the survey.  From what I have said about all those reports is it any wonder that young people feel antipathy towards politicians?  The area of youth affairs has been the greatest talking shop for the past few years.  The production of this report raises that talking shop to a new status.  As I have said, the contents of the report are good but they are only good if many of the proposals are implemented. The Government can only justify their decision to commission this report if they implement what is in it. There is no indication of what will be implemented.  The only hint we got from the Minister of State was in relation to travelling people when he said it must be considered.  If we have nothing more definite at this stage about the endless list <Col N="1223" /> of problems facing young people, frustration and antipathy will continue.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister of State is anxious to implement most of the proposals but they are clearly way down the list of priorities in the minds of his Government colleagues, particularly in the minds of the two people primarily responsible &mdash; the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance.  This is borne out by the paltry provision made in the national plan of an extra £1.5 million over three years.  If we had £1.5 million extra for this year there might be some reason for the Minister to feel happy.  This, together with an increase of 3 per cent in the Estimate for existing youth services, means in effect that there will be a decrease in real terms of up to 8 per cent in the provision for mainline youth services in the current years.  It shows one thing clearly: this Government are long on reports, promises, discussions and philosophy but short on commitment to positive action.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision for sporting bodies, there is a 9 per cent decrease in the provision for sporting organisations. That is a far cry from the pious platitudes we heard from Deputy Creed following the Olympics when he spoke about the Government's commitment to providing extra finance for sport so that Irish sportsmen could hold their own with the rest of the world.  This reports says all the right things but it does nothing.  It lacks body.  Many young people are looking for something to hang on to.  That something is not in this report.</P>
    <P>It identifies the greatest affliction on young peope, which is unemployment, but choses to ignore the subject.  Approximately 67,000 young people or 30 per cent of the total number on the live register are unemployed.  We can provide all the special services we like but until we come to grips with this problem we will not go anywhere.  This report speaks of a commitment to reduce the present social and economic inequalities.  It states that the major worry which emerged from the survey was the possibility of unemployment. It quotes young people as getting impatient and wanting corrective action. <Col N="1224" /> There is now a striking gap in the young population between the haves and the have nots.  This gap is widening and there is nothing in the report to arrest that trend.  We have yet to receive one proposal from the Government in two years which would arrest that trend or provide positive action to create jobs particularly for deprived and disaffected youth.</P>
    <P>I will not deal with how those jobs should be created at this stage.  I refer the House to the Official Report for 8 February 1984 where I dealt at length with the question of youth employment and put forward a number of proposals which I am satisfied would produce thousands of jobs in 1985 if they were implemented. I shall just refer to two specific proposals on job creation.  The first is the establishment of community resource centres which I shall deal with under the heading of mainline youth services.  The second is a youth lobby on employment. Everyone is dabbling in the youth employment area except those who know most about it &mdash; youth organisations and young people.</P>
    <P>We have seen various lobby groups in operation in recent years and how effective they can be, but we have not seen any youth lobby on employment.  There is a necessity not alone for a lobby but for a strong input into employment policy. Many worthwhile ideas and proposals could be put forward and I wish to put forward one such idea.  An incentive could be offered to a two-parent working family in return for one parent giving up his or her job with a view to creating a job for a young person.  It may be attractive to many married couples to be offered a gratuity if one partner would give up work not more than three years after marriage and if they received an improved tax allowance for a further three years.  Such a proposal could create many opportunities for young people and give an added incentive to older people to retire.  Such ideas as that are worth consideration.  We all know of two-parent families where the husband is working in a good, secure job and the wife is also holding down a professional position. Those who immediately come to mind <Col N="1225" /> would be in the nursing and teaching professions.  I am not suggesting that we would in any way put pressure on anybody to get out of work but we could provide them with a little incentive that would make it worth their while to get out and create jobs for those people who are walking around, many of them qualified in the professions I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the vital area of youth services.  The report's proposal that we have a comprehensive youth service is something to which I give total support. The commitment and mainstay of a proper youth service should be to complement amateurism with an input of professionalism. It is my priority that not alone should we preserve and nurture volunteerism but we should develop it to its full potential.  Implicit in that is the support of fulltime professionals providing motivation, training and expertise to maximise the voluntary effort.  The many urgent responses contained in this report may cloud the fact that the first priority, with the exception of special services, must be to put existing mainline youth services on a solid and permanent foundation. To that degree the present situation where full time youth workers attached to voluntary organisations are funded by Government grants and are below subsistence level is totally unacceptable and this situation is exacerbated further by the cuts in real terms of 7 to 8 per cent.  I ask the Minister as a matter of urgency to provide 100 per cent funding for all full time employees in the youth services and to provide a proper structure on a par with Civil Service terms of employment.  In addition I ask him to appoint extra youth development officers, who are needed in areas around the country where such people have not already been appointed.  It seems totally unfair that we could have taken a decision to appoint a number of them in parts of the country and leave other parts completely without assistance.</P>
    <P>I compliment the people involved in the youth organisations on their dedicated and committed work rate to achieve their objectives.  They are a fine <Col N="1226" /> example of the best in Irish youth.  However, I urge all organisations to come back under the one umbrella of the National Youth Council of Ireland while still having the ability to retain their independent identity.  I recognise that this will involve negotiation and discussion, but I am quite satisfied that it would be only as a result of all youth organisations speaking with the one voice that they can be most effective.</P>
    <P>I would like to express my appreciation and that of my party of the work of the thousands of volunteers around the country referred to in the report as the selfless dedication, concern and experience of the people involved in the youth service. On organisational structures at both national and local level there is a need for further discussion in order to establish the best organisational structure.  My priority would be that voluntary organisations would assume the most important role in local organisational structures, but those structures would be based on the statutory agencies which are in existence at present.  Setting up another administrative structure would be duplication and a wastage of scarce resources.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to a proposal to set up community youth resource centres based on second level school catchment areas. By that I mean county towns with two or three second level schools which have defined catchment areas.  This proposal is at present being considered by Fianna Fáil.  Such a structure has a great deal of merit in that it would make full use of existing community resources to provide a comprehensive youth service in each locality.  It would have at its core the voluntary organisations already involved in youth work, but it would also enable them to expand their role further in social education particularly in community based job training which at present is non-existent.  The report identifies unemployed young people as being the least well educated and, therefore, having the fewest coping skills.  Statistics in the Youth Employment Agency guarantee scheme bear out this fact.</P>
    <P>The number of unemployed young people who are becoming long term <Col N="1227" /> unemployed is leading to a growing scrap heap in every local community.  An absolute priority must be to bring this to an end.  We can no longer afford to talk any further about this matter, we must now do something.  Finance should be provided immediately to the voluntary organisations and local communities to provide resource centres.  Such centres can draw on the reservoir of skills and talents in each local community.  Management should be from the community, and youth organisations should identify job opportunities in the community, adapt training courses to meet these opportunities, select young people with whom they deal themselves for inclusion on the courses, ensure that the courses are suited to their needs and hire the necessary training personnel, who would be provided by AnCO and other agencies already involved.  Many of the present training centres are skill-centred places, whereas community youth resource centres would be people-centred places. Such a structure would give youth training agencies such as AnCO the other major ingredient that is lacking at present &mdash; a community base.  A strong voluntary input would reduce the cost of such centres to a minimum.  Accommodation could be readily acquired by local people in every town and district at present at minimum cost because of the abundance of vacant accommodation now available.</P>
    <P>Existing assets, both human and physical, must be utilised to the full to the benefit of the youth service in each local community.  The status of youth work must be raised to a new level.  Expenditure must be seen as a good return on investment.  While today we demand extra resources, I am aware that there is a limit to the amount of finance that can be provided.  To this degree present expenditure on young people in many areas should produce much better results, especially in education and training. Much of the money being spent at present could be expended much more effectively and bear better results.  A reallocation of resources along the lines I am suggesting would lead to more money being available <Col N="1228" /> where it should be available: in the localities where voluntary people would provide much of the initiative and employment along with the voluntary organisations at present in operation.</P>
    <P>Present expenditure on young people in education is yielding poor results.  To that degree it should be our policy to being about radical changes in our education system so as to make education for living the priority.  It is true to say that our education system is probably the greatest draw back to our young people.  It is a system for points and university places but ignores the reality of living in Ireland in 1984.  It ignores the problems young people face when they leave school.  It does not prepare them very well for life. There must be a radical change in this respect.  Youth services must be an extension of education.  They must complement each other.  The physical assets such as schools and school buses should be made available for youth services.</P>
    <P>Raising the status of youth work will attract many volunteers but we need to redefine the responsibilities of many people who are dealing with young people but not youth work.  Fianna Fáil are discussing this topic and our proposals, which will be among the most imaginative ever put forward, will be ready when we are required to implement them.</P>

      <P>I am referring to human resources and our proposals seek to put their potential into context.  If every primary and post primary teacher &mdash; there are 38,000 of them &mdash; and every member of the Garda Síochána &mdash; there are 11,000 &mdash; who supposedly deal with young people gave one hour each week to youth work than a total of 49,000 hours per week, the equivalent of 1,200 fulltime youth workers working 40 hours each week, would be devoted to youth work. That is the type of human resource we have failed to tap so far.  It involves discussions with those people and many <Col N="1229" /> others in the community.  They must accept that they have a responsibility in this regard.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand how in my town, Gort, which is typical of so many around the country, we have between 60 and 70 teachers and 15 or 20 gardaí who work throughout the week without any reference to youth work as it is now defined. I cannot understand why we have not made changes to ensure that part of their work extends from the classroom.  I cannot understand why part of the work of the Garda in regard to crime is not of a preventive nature rather than trying to catch the criminal when he has committed a crime.  We must do everything to get our people involved in the preventive area, which youth work is.  The problem is that our people have never been asked. With proper inducements many people will get involved.  From my experience people want to assist young people.  All types of physical resources in local communities are under-utilised.  All that is required is to put together a framework to tap this vast resource.  Perhaps International Youth Year is an appropriate time to start floating such ideas.  I hope that as part of the proceedings of that year a number of imaginative proposals will be put forward for examination.  It is disappointing that so far there has not been any worth while indication of what International Youth Year will mean for young people, although 1985 is only a month away.  That points to a lack of commitment by the Government to our young people.</P>
      <P>It is fine to put the logo of International Youth Year on the cover of the report but that will not mean much unless it is backed up by proper action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with special services, ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoin brón atá orm toisc nach bhfuil mórán suime sa tuarascáil i dtaobh na Gaeilge.  Sílim gurb í an t-aon caoí gur féidir linne an teanga, agus go háirithe an teanga labhartha, a chur chun cinn agus na daoine óga a spreagadh chun í a labhairt agus a bheith bródúil aisti.  The Irish language can be saved only if we get young people to be proud of the fact that they can speak <Col N="1230" /> Irish.  It is sad for me to relate that, although I was a fluent Irish speaker some years ago, now, due to lack of practice, it is almost gone.  Every effort should be made to promote the language among young people.  In our youth policy we must give Irish every possible chance of not alone surviving but of being developed.</P>
    <P>In the area of special services the report is positive and opens up an area which up to now has not been explored. I welcome the new input into the question of youth policy.  That area was not dealt with to any significant degree in previous reports.  For that reason it is worthwhile having in one document a resumé of the problems that affect young people and must be tackled through special services. One problem I should like to refer to is school attendance.  It has been confirmed to me by people involved in education in Dublin that the final years of compulsory schooling sow the seeds of a disaffected lifestyle for many young people.  I was shocked to hear some of the stories of teachers, career guidance teachers and school attendance officers about the problem in Dublin.  I consider it ludicrous that on one side of a street in Ballymun the school attendance officer was doing a reasonably good job but on the other side of the street nobody was operating.  The Garda try to deal with this problem but they do not have the resources.  The problem of truancy, of opting out of school in those final years, must be tackled immediately. It can be solved by preventive action.  We will have to spend millions of pounds in Dublin undoing the damage those young people are doing to themselves and the community because of the seeds sown in those final years at school. The Minister should put to the Ministers involved the priority required to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>The problem cannot be dealt with by the appointment of school attendance officers alone.  Young people in city schools who have a problem should be identified and the type of flexibility required to look after their needs applied. As far as they are concerned, going to school at 9 a.m. and having to sit there <Col N="1231" /> until 4 p.m. is ridiculous.  The sooner we realise that the better.  Their needs must be catered for.  Traditional schooling as we know it must be ended.  In the term after Christmas we must take action in this area.  Career guidance teachers in Dublin know what must be done and the Minister should consult with them.  Huge resources are not needed.  Department of Education officials must take their heads out of the sand and tackle the problems of those young people.</P>
    <P>On the question of homeless youth, my experience since I became spokesman in this area has shocked me.  This is the area closest to my heart.  I have seen the situation some of these young people find themselves in.  I will quote from the annual report of Hope from Eddie, aged 18.</P>
    <P>Sleeping out is very lonely.  You find a place to sleep during the day and night &mdash; you sleep anywhere.</P>
    <P>You lose a lot of friends, they don't want to know you.  People out on skip get very dirty and unhealthy and eat anything.  They have to rob to survive. They don't care for anybody &mdash; it can affect them for life.  They turn to wine and go to places like St. Vincent's Day Centre and get a cup of tea and two sandwiches for 10p.  They hang out in these places.  They are like a different race of people.</P>
    <P>Hope is the only voluntary body I am aware of which provides assistance for those young people who number definitely 200 and possibly many more.  Hope have this to say:</P>
    <P>We have not to-date received an allocation from this year's &ldquo;budget allocation to voluntary organisations&rdquo; despite six weeks of representation to the Departments of Social Welfare and Finance, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, and the Junior Minister for Youth Affairs...</P>
    <P>We need an immediate grant of £20,000 to continue in existence....</P>
    <P>This is the only service provided in the 26 Counties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> ... we would welcome any support encouragement or resources which you can give us.</P>
    <P>Is there anything so shocking?  What about the baloney we have heard from people like Garret FitzGerald, Nuala Fennell, Barry Desmond and all the others about a just society?</P>

      <P>Sorry, the Taoiseach and the Ministers.  What is this Government's priority if it is not to look after the most deprived section of our community?  Where is the evidence of action?  I at least expected to hear that part of this year's £500,000 would be spent in this area.  Why is the Minister keeping this money under the bed?  Why does he not give it to these people who have been making representations for six weeks?</P>
      <P>Our party leader, Deputy Haughey, has established a task force &mdash; Deputy O'Hanlon, Deputy B. Ahern, Deputy O'Rourke and myself &mdash; to examine this problem with a view to immediate action being taken as soon as we return to Government after the next election.</P>
      <P>Handicapped youth is dealt with in this report.  There is a great deal we can all do to become aware of the problem of handicapped youth.  This report will have been worthwhile if it does nothing else but get across to young people who are physically and mentally well off that there are a large number among us who are mentally or physically handicapped.  If we could create such an awareness we will have got off to a very good start in bringing assistance to handicapped youth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must deal with the problem of young travellers as soon as possible.  I am saddened by the Government's approach to this problem.  The Minister mentioned the report on the travelling people in July 1983.  My view is that that report came about following disturbances in Tallaght and the Government wanted to be doing something.  What was in that report was merely a rewrite of the report on the <Col N="1233" /> travelling people which was written by the committee set up for that purpose. There had been no action before that report and there is little evidence of any action since.  There is no point in mouthing pious platitudes about young travellers unless we are prepared to provide resources to improve their lot.</P>
    <P>I want to mention young people who get involved in crime and in trouble with the law.  Some of the existing services operated by the Department of Justice are very worthwhile.  Those services would be expanded under the community resource central programme I have just outlined.  I am shocked that we still feel it necessary to put young people in prison for three, four or five months.  I am convinced that no young person put in prison will benefit from that experience.  Instead of taking that road, I would like to see us redouble our efforts on crime prevention and when these people get into trouble we should give the special assistance outlined in this report to all of them.</P>
    <P>On the question of substance abuse, particularly drug abuse which is dealt with very adequately in this report, it seems nonsensical that we are trying to tackle this problem when drugs are freely available on our streets.  I urge the Minister to speak to some of his colleagues who even last week in this House refused to do anything about the importation position.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous that in a port like Galway there are no facilities for examining goods coming into the port unless the customs people get a tip off or the people bringing in the goods go to customs people and declare them.  It is ridiculous that we do not give our customs officers the powers to try to stop the importation of illicit drugs.</P>

      <P>I want to assure the House that as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned there will be no more reports on youth affairs. When we return to Government there will be action.  I will be only too glad to use this and the other two reports to implement a proper youth service and to bring about the kind of action we require. We will set out priorities, and cost them. In the process we will implement those priorities providing an ongoing, improving service for youth.</P>
      <P>I thought we would hear a number of proposals indicating what the Minister was going to do.  I was going to remind him to tell us what he is not going to do, because I anticipated that most of the recommendations in this report would not be carried out.  It is a serious disappointment to me, and I am sure it will be to the youth organisations and young people too, that we still do not know what the Government's intentions are. As far as we are concerned, the problems will be solved daily, weekly and monthly. We will have an ongoing review of our performance.  Unlike the Government, I will give a commitment to young people and youth organisations.  We will tell them what we are in a position to do and for the remainder of the Government's term in office, I ask the Minister to adopt the same approach.</P>

      <P>I have heard two excellent contributions and both speakers demonstrated a vast knowledge of youth problems. However, the last speaker spoiled his otherwise excellent contribution by using the problems of youth for political purposes which did his otherwise excellent contribution an injustice.  I was glad to hear him say that if his party gets into power they will take some action in this area because, during the last two years of the Fianna Fáil administration, there were very few advances in youth affairs. However, I will leave party politics out of my limited contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national youth policy final report is the first comprehensive report on youth problems ever published in Europe.  We <Col N="1235" /> have two reports, the Thompson report from the British Government, which is very limited, and the Schwartz report from the French Government which dealt basically with youth unemployment.</P>
    <P>Our report is wide-ranging and will be used for reference by many of our colleagues in Europe.  I should like to pay tribute to the people who sat on the committee and who brought in their report on time &mdash; within one year.  The Government made it clear in <i>Building on Reality</i> that, on receipt of the report from the national youth policy committee, there will be a Government policy report within a matter of months.  The Minister referred to that again today and said that there will be a policy document and action from the Government in 1985.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that time is not on our side.  I echo that by saying that time is running out for any Government.  The Government, in their decision to publish a youth policy, recognise through a number of policy statements the needs of young people and that urgent action must be taken to deal with the problems.</P>
    <P>The Government also recognise that young people today are in a tragic situation because of the obvious problems of unemployment and deprivation, especially in our cities.  That has caused many young people to become alienated from society and from our democratic process. The Minister referred to the lack of respect which young people have for Government Ministers, politicians and people who are running the democratic institutions of State.  Therefore, any Government policy must set out to get all our young people involved in the democratic process so that the institutions of State are respected by them.  That is a major challenge.  We must convince our young people that we are sincere and, to do that, we must reduce the ever widening gap between young people who have quite a lot and those who have nothing. The gap between the haves and the have nots in Irish society is, unfortunately growing daily.</P>
    <P>Deprivation and poverty is rife in our city and by deprivation I do not mean <Col N="1236" /> what a young person has in his pocket or on his back, I am talking about the deprivation of even being unable to utilise the services available from the State. The last two administrations recognised this problem and have set out to eliminate it.  Steps were taken in recent times to improve education in deprived areas. Perhaps we are not doing all that we could but at least the problem has been recognised and steps have been taken in the primary school area, which is where the problems begin.  It is no use talking about deprivation in third level education unless we change the attitudes that prevail in the deprived areas towards the educational system.</P>
    <P>Section 4 sets out policies to deal with disavantaged youth and I welcome its proposals.  I also welcome the suggestion that more programmes should be set up for disadvantaged young persons such as the youth encounter project and the neighbourhood youth project which are operating to a limited degree.  These projects are most impressive and go to the roots of the existing problems.  I have first-hand knowledge of one in my area which only opened last Friday.  It took a long time to put into operation but it is a welcome asset and will help to solve the problems which exist in that area.  It identifies the special needs of young people and sets about tackling them.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Fahey referring to the non-involvement of the Garda in his area because in Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda recognise the basic problems of youth and are getting involved in areas where these problems can be tackled.  The evidence is in the project which has opened in a neighbourhood in Cork recently where the Garda, the Southern Health Board, the VEC and <Col N="1237" /> Ógra Corcaigh are doing excellent work and have combined their resources and experience to get this project off the ground.  I do not want to be negative in dealing with the symptoms of the problems but I was asked to comment recently on a spate of vandalism in Cork and how the problem should be tackled.  I advanced the view that the breakdown in family life is one of the major problems which must be looked at.  The problems that young people face in the transition from youth to adulthood are not recognised in many homes at present.  Lack of parental control and advice must be regretted.  I am glad that section 5 of the report addresses itself to this problem and I welcome its sentiments.  It also recognises the need to co-ordinate the various educational and training services which are available at present.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Committee on Public Expenditure, I looked at the problems of overlapping and the frustrations caused by the young unemployed because of this overlap.  We recognised there were areas where improvements could be made.  I am asking the Minister to look at that matter because the overlap and the disjointed efforts at times of all the agencies is leading to much frustration for young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking ahead there must be an autonomous national body dealing with youth affairs linked to regional groups who, in turn, would be linked to existing statutory bodies such as the VECs, and experience in Cork in recent years can support what I am saying.  To ensure the continuing development of an even more comprehensive youth service it is necessary that a statutory duty be imposed on a local statutory body to fund the services required.  In view of the recommendation that the youth affairs section be transferred back to the Department of Education &mdash; a recommendation I would go along with &mdash; I suggest that this local statutory agency should be the VEC.  In view of their history of youth work involvement, the flexibility of their structures and their local control, the VECs are the appropriate statutory body to support and develop youth work services at local level.  I have <Col N="1238" /> first-hand evidence of that in my own area.</P>
    <P>In Cork, Ógra Corcaigh has developed during the years a close working relationship with the City of Cork VEC, particularly with regard to training, the provision of premises and resources and the provision of part time instructors.  This complements the view put forward already that we must avoid overlapping of services and attempt to utilise available facilities. This kind of co-operation has manifested itself in Cork in projects in the Hollyhill-Knocknaheeny area of the city and also in the Togher area which I would consider deeply deprived areas. This is a sector where effective co-operation is evident between the statutory and voluntary organisations responding to a perceived local need.  There is the necessity to establish a comprehensive service that will effectively co-ordinate and ensure the delivery and take-up services in disadvantaged groups.  An arrangement like this throughout the country would be appropriate.  Local youth organisations are striving constantly to achieve objectives in order to help young people to achieve their maximum capacities through recreational and other programmes. I ask the Minister to take this view seriously and to accommodate it in the Government's policy document that I hope will be available in 1985.</P>
    <P>My contribution today is a very limited one but I should like to pay tribute to the Minister.  I am not doing this because he is a Minister of my party but because he has been willing to listen and learn in the past two years in his role as junior Minister at the Department of Labour and the Department of Education.  The kind of progress made in recent times and the kind of funding made available through the Department to provide recreational facilities, the funding that became available through the Department to provide recreational facilities, the funding that became available through the plan <i>Building on Reality,</i> is a compliment to him and the work he has done in recent times.  I hope the policy document will be published early in 1985. There has been a response from some of the youth organisations as a result of the <Col N="1239" /> publication of the youth committee's document and I hope that will be followed by far more submissions.  I ask youth organisations throughout the country not just to make their views known to Ministers and to the Department but also to local Deputies.  We are the legislators and we are only too happy to give some of our time to hear the views of young people.  We may not be able to give everything that they want but at least we will listen and try to act on their views.  There has been a serious breakdown in communications between the youth organisations and the legislators.  I hope I will not be criticised for saying this, which I do in a genuine effort to get more communication, but I ask that any submissions made to the Minister should be made to us also as TDs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report.  I hope to spend more time on studying its contents and getting advice from youth organisations.</P>

      <P>I wish to know because I see that a number of other Deputies are also anxious to get in on the debate and I did not want to take all the time available.  I welcome the report of the committee.  However, I am disappointed with the Minister's response so far in that he does not appear, from what I could gather listening to the monitor, to have indicated when a Government policy document will be produced based on the report or to have indicated a timetable for the implementation of such a policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the report because it brings together a range of previous reports that have not been implemented but that have been left on dusty shelves.  I am glad that the report stressed the concept of democratic participation by young people in their own areas and in life generally. There has been too little emphasis on the need to develop our democratic structures <Col N="1240" /> in this State and on this island. While a number of people have been concerned, as I am, that the young have a low opinion of politicians, it is also significant to note that generally young people have a high regard for many other professional people such as the Garda and teachers and also for their own parents.  It is significant that the survey that was done on the attitude of young people indicated that only 4 per cent supported the use of force in Northern Ireland. That is very encouraging in these times when the impression is given that there is widespread support for that kind of activity.  Obviously 4 per cent is still a significant number of young people but I think it gives reason for hope for the maintenance and development of our democratic structures.</P>
    <P>The response to the report has been poor from the point of view of the resources allocated.  I will refer briefly to two submissions I have received, one from the National Youth Council and the other from the Community Games people.  The first states that there has been only a 3 per cent increase in the allocation for existing works, at a time when the inflation rate is expected to be 6 per cent. The submission from the Community Games organisation is particularly bitter, complaining about a 9 per cent cut.  I should like the Minister to refer to those two complaints, which are fairly serious, coming from two organisations who do not deal with these things in a light way.</P>
    <P>This report brings many other reports together, dealing with education, disadvantaged youth and so forth and the Minister should specify the policies he intends to implement, or variations of the recommendations in the report.  I suggest that disabled youth should be integrated into the youth services and the Minister should state what steps he will be taking to deal with home abuse which Deputy Fahey referred to.  He should also deal with the problems faced by young travellers which are much more serious than those faced by adult travellers.</P>
    <P>We should think of the disadvantages suffered by young people belonging to settled families not just because of their own incapacities or problems but simply <Col N="1241" /> because of poverty.  They are disadvantaged and at risk.  It is no accident that most of the offences being committed of a minor nature, some serious, are committed by young people.  Reports are choc-a-bloc each week with cases of young people falling foul of the law.  Perhaps it is something associated with their ages, backgrounds and so on.</P>
    <P>There is a section in the report called &ldquo;substance abuse&rdquo;, which includes alcohol, glue sniffing and drug abuse.  It is expected that abuse of alcohol is probably at least as serious as drug abuse but is has not been given the same degree of media attention.  In the eyes of the public, drug abuse, the use of alcohol and hanging about street corners are regarded as the main youth problems.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the thing which youths have most desire for apart from good health is a job and it was unfortunate to hear Deputy Fahey offering the idea of one job per family, or something of that nature &mdash; when two adults in a family would be working one should give up a job to make it available to someone else.  That is a very short term and simplistic approach to the problems of young people.  While there are skilled young people unemployed, the greatest number of unemployed young people are unskilled and it is no answer to the problem to say that if the mother is working she should give it up to allow one of her children to take it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy the answer but I am sure the Minister of State does not want me to go into it.  The answer is not job sharing or job splitting or one job per family.  If the Deputy listened to Deputies Ahern and Reynolds he would learn that their philosophy is to develop the resources of the country to make jobs available in the productive area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea has been put forward that the vocational preparation and education programme should be extended.  One suggestion may be to take people off the live register between the ages of 15 and <Col N="1242" /> 17 years and taken off the queues for second and third level education, but I am not happy with the programme about to be introduced providing £300 per year each for young people between the ages of 15 and 17 years without, at the same time, providing an education maintenance allowance for those who want to study in normal second level education. They might simply drop out of the educational system.  Instead of going on from the intermediate certificate to the leaving certificate, they might drop out because of financial demands at home or because £300 a year was available to them for training.</P>
    <P>There is an argument in the report about the provision of unemployment assistance for young people.  The fear is expressed that they would simply drop out of school to qualify for unemployment assistance.  It is suggested that the scheme which is available in Northern Ireland for an educational maintenance allowance should be considered as a counter balance.  That should also be considered in relation to the vocational, training and preparation schemes which the Government are introducing in 1985. There is a very real danger that young people will opt out of school in order to benefit from the financial inducement of £300.</P>
    <P>Pre-school education is mentioned in the report.  Increasingly it is being recognised that pre-schooling is essential for the development of children, their personality development and their social development.  Up to now this pre-schooling movement, if you like, has been of a very <i>ad hoc</i> nature.  Because of this it has been available on a voluntary basis in areas where they can afford to make it available.  In other words, pre-schooling is available to those who can afford to pay for it.  That is totally unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the proposals in this report might lead to the maintenance of that <i>ad hoc</i> system.  Pre-schooling is so important that it should be treated in the same way as primary education.  It should be provided with the involvement of people who want to give their time voluntarily. It should be provided for by law for children from a certain age and it <Col N="1243" /> should not be available only to those who can afford to pay for it.  That is an important point which the Minister should consider when he is deciding on his policy in regard to youth.  It has wide implications and the Department of Education would be more directly involved.  It can be argued that those who can least afford it are those who need it most.  For that reason maintaining the present <i>ad hoc</i> system and operating it through voluntary organisations is not a satisfactory response to the need which is there.</P>
    <P>I referred to the section on drug abuse and alcohol.  In the report they dealt with that area most effectively.  A number of specific demands should be included in any policy which the Minister produces. There is a grave need to retain in Jervis Street a detoxification unit.  It seems that the proposal is to move it out to Beaumount Hospital which will have in the region of five beds only available.  This would be totally inadequate.  There is a need to ensure that local treatment centres are available where the drug problem is greatest, that is, in most of our heavily populated urban areas.  Those two specific things should be included in whatever policy the Minister brings forward. This requires co-ordination with the Department of Health.  It emphasises the fact that youth and youth problems cannot be isolated and dealt with on their own.  There is a whole range of Departments, Health, Education and so on, which must have an input into the needs of youth.</P>
    <P>Another point about which I am not too happy in this report &mdash; and I hope the Minister will think twice about it &mdash; is the implicit acceptance that emigration will be with us for the future and that, consequently, the youth policy should make provision for it &mdash; in other words, presumably make money available for organisations in Britain, or wherever, to enable them to cope with young people going there in search of work.</P>
    <P>That acceptance was also implicit in the Government's recent national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>.  That is a very worrying aspect of the Government's thinking. <Col N="1244" /> The approach to unemployment, the attitude that emigration will be with us for the foreseeable future and the attitude that training is a substitute for jobs are very worrying and I cannot agree with them.  The Government must be more adventurous in their approach to job creation and the solution of the unemployment problem.  Youth on its own cannot be isolated from the rest of the population. The solution to the problem of youth unemployment can only be found in the context of solving the unemployment problem generally.  Obviously that means providing adult employment as well as youth employment.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the document to encouraging young people and training them to work on the land.  While those suggestions are quite welcome, they do not attempt to deal with the question of where the land they are to work on is to become available.  Who is to give it to them?  There is no reference to farmers who have become old, or incapacitated, or are not willing to work their land. There is no indication in the document before us as to what should be done in that regard.  That has to be tackled and, if young people are to be encouraged to work the land, land has to be made available for them.  There is no point in training them to work the land if they have not got land to work.  That has broader policy and political implications.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer also to the licensing laws, having already referred to substance abuse.  There is a need to tackle that area of licensing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this subject.  I wish to share my time with Deputies Griffin and Seán McCarthy. Unfortunately, Deputy Seán Treacy is not available.</P>
      <P>These mines have been closed for almost seven months with the loss of 120 jobs.  Much hardship has been suffered by the work-force during those seven months, with the uncertainty up to a week ago as to whether the mines would reopen.  They are a very experienced mining staff and this is a great blow for the area.  I raise the matter to ask what the Minister can do about the situation. I am sure that he will do what he can to see that the jobs are secure.</P>
      <P>There is sufficient anthracite in the mines to keep them in full production for at least 20 years.  That has been proved by various surveys carried out in connection with these mines by successive Governments over the years.  Massive injections of public funds have also been put into these mines by successive Governments.  It is rather sad to see them closed down now.  The orders from the Irish Sugar Company alone would be sufficient to keep the mines open and in full production for many years to come. There have been no problems at all with the markets.  What efforts has the Minister been making in the last few weeks?  I would appeal to him to do everything possible and as soon as possible to have the mines reopened.  We have been living in hope in Tipperary.  The Oireachtas Members in the area, the trade unions, the workers and the management have tried to find some solution to this great tragedy, but just a week ago we heard the very bad news that promised funds from the people who were interested in keeping the mines in operation have not materialised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank my colleague, Deputy Seán Byrne, for allowing me to take some of his time in speaking to this motion, and in thanking the <Col N="1246" /> Chair for allowing us the liberty of raising the matter.</P>
      <P>This is a very vexed and imminent problem in south Tipperary and, indeed, areas far beyond the constituency of south Tipperary.  Tipperary Anthracite Limited are an operating company wholly owned by Flair Resources, (Ireland) Limited which are, in turn, a subsidiary of Flair Resources Limited of Canada and have a very long, chequered and difficult background and history.  In dealings with this mine the one dominant feature of the history was the many openings and closings, many financial embarrassments and total uncertainty about the continuation of mining this very valuable natural resource.  Tipperary Anthracite Limited are now the operating company.  The mines have been closed for the past seven months.  A skeleton staff were there up to three or four weeks ago, just maintaining the machines and preventing the mines from being flooded.  Unfortunately, insurance cover ran out and the miners were not allowed to keep the pumps in operation and we have the sad plight that these very valuable mines are flooded.</P>
      <P>All interested groups, particularly the workers, the trade unions and the Oireachtas Members of all parties, have met on numerous occasions in Killinaule to try to see what could be done to resolve the situation and, above all, to keep the mines in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that the miners and their families are the main sufferers in this case, especially coming up to Christmas, with the lack of finance and the general uncertainty of their future.  It is primarily on their behalf that we speak here tonight.  There has been a very experienced mining operation in that area down through the years.  They were not interested in receivership or in liquidation.  Their primary concern was the continuation of their jobs to see that the mines could be kept in operation and, as far as possible, to bring them back into full production.  Unfortunately, all the efforts to date by management have proved fruitless and money which was promised week after week has failed to materialise.  I understand that last week there was a petition for liquidation by <Col N="1247" /> the solicitors on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners.  If my information is correct there is to be a hearing in the High Court on Monday, 17 December.  Unless there is an appeal for an adjournment on behalf of Tipperary Anthracite Limited, the mines will surely go into liquidation. It would be a great pity if this should happen because feasibility and other studies carried out by reputable firms experienced in these fields have indicated that there are at least four million tonnes of recoverable anthracite in these mines. This is valued at roughly between £20 million and £29 million.  It is an incontrovertable fact that there could be employment for a work-force of 120 for the next 20 years in that mine.  I am also reliably informed that it is one of the finest mines in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Our Minister of State, Deputy Eddie Collins, is here this evening and our plea to him is to see if he can, through whatever agency, semi-State or State, rescue the mines and ensure their reopening.  I understand that the IDA and Fóir Teóranta have been very helpful in the past and that the Revenue Commissioners have been more than sympathetic.  However, I am told that there is a figure of £1.3 million outstanding to the Revenue Commissioners in this regard.  When there was any prospect of moneys coming up, they stayed their hand but unfortunately a Doomsday situation has arisen for Tipperary Anthracite Limited and unless there is a prospect or promise of moneys again being produced before 17 December the mines will go into liquidation. At that juncture I would be fearful for the jobs of the miners who face unemployment for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>This is a disadvantaged area and it will be virtually impossible to attract alternative industry if this very fine national resource collapses.  I join in my plea with my colleagues, Deputies Seán Byrne and Seán McCarthy, and in his absence Deputy Seán Treacy who attended all the meetings and was very concerned, like all of us, for employment opportunities and for the livelihood of the miners of Tipperary Anthracite Limited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1248" /> I urge the Minister, if at all possible, to give further assistance even at this late stage.  Perhaps events have overtaken us and the mine is on its inevitable way towards liquidation.  Whether it can be stopped at this juncture, I do not know. Perhaps the Minister will inform us of the legal position at this juncture.  I am not aware if the Minister can act at this stage, but if the company goes into liquidation I hope he will use the full resources of his Department to ensure that the mine will be reopened under new management and that the valuable resource of four million tonnes of anthracite will be made available to the economy with the attending advantages of continued employment for the work-force in Ballingarry.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to be mindful and sympathetic to our plea on behalf of the work-force and the creditors.  We are informed that there are some creditors and the prospects of them receiving anything worthwhile are minimal if the company goes into liquidation.  I know a number of these creditors and they can ill-afford this liquidation.  I appeal to the Minister to take these facets into consideration and continue his efforts to ensure that the mine will be put back into production as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Byrne, for allowing me a few moments of his time.  I join with Deputies Byrne, Griffin and Treacy &mdash; I know he has a great interest in this &mdash; to see if we can salvage the wreckage of Ballingarry mines which is run by Tipperary Anthracite Limited.  We all worked together but unfortunately the tide was flowing against us and the company all the time.  The inevitable now seems about to happen on 17 December when the High Court will almost inevitably see that the company is put into liquidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This area is one which has a historical tradition of anthracite mining.  Most of the families there are what are known as mining families.  They would not know how to do anything else.  The tradition has been passed from grandfather to father to son and a great degree of expertise and commitment was built up by these families <Col N="1249" /> over the years.  It is very sad that these people will suffer most as a result of the inevitability of the situation now.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will, as far as he can, do everything possible to see if this can be salvaged.  I recognise as much as everyone else that his task will not be easy.  Even after the company has been liquidated perhaps some mining organisation might be found to take over the mine and give the workers the right to work it properly without fear of collapse. Unfortunately the mine has had a chequered economic history.  This is not the first time this type of thing arose there.  What amazes me and my colleagues is that over the last few months many of the workers have continued to work there despite the fact that they were not being paid.  Their commitment was such that they were prepared to work without pay.  Very ofter we are inclined to indulge in a bashing of workers.  If anyone had been tempted to do that they should have gone to Ballingarry in the last few months and observed the behaviour of the workers and the way they worked without being paid.  It would have changed their minds.</P>
    <P>The Minister should bear in mind, when he is considering how to salvage the mine, that this is a viable natural resource producing a commodity for which there is a high demand.  It is top quality anthracite. There are sufficient amounts, approximately four million tonnes, to give the mine a life viability of 20 to 30 years.  Some say it will have a viable life of 40 years.  These assessments have been made by independent mining experts. Several of them made surveys.  These surveys have been done by personnel outside of the State who are not connected in any way with the firm running the mine.</P>
    <P>Since we have such a resource, there is an obligation on us as politicians to do what we can to keep it alive in whatever way we can.  I know the Minister will do what he can when the time comes. I recognise that the workers have gone through a difficult time, as have the creditors and the Revenue Commissioners. They have all shown remarkable fore-bearance in holding back and in ensuring that they did not do anything to jeopardise <Col N="1250" /> the future of the mine.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately it appears as if the workers and creditors have to some extent been misled by the company.  There were promises on a day to day and week to week basis of copious amounts of money being made available which would ensure not just a continuation of work for those there but perhaps an extension of the mine to provide jobs for other people.  It now appears that they were false promises, and many people were deluded.  It is unfortunate and sad that any company should delude people whether they be workers, creditors or the Revenue Commissioners. Something that must be observed is the basic precedent of honesty, and that did not happen in this case. I appeal to the Minister to do what he can in the circumstances and see if he can ensure that this valuable national resource is continued for the mining families in south Tipperary for the good of the country.</P>

      <P>Like the Deputies who have contributed in a constructive way to the debate I am aware of the long tradition of mining in Ballingarry.  All Deputies are aware of the recent troubled history of the Ballingarry mine.  I appreciate that the mine made a significant contribution through the years to employment in the area and that its closure would be a serious blow to the area generally.  I fully accept that it may be difficult if the mine was not re-opened to get alternative employment for the many families whose tradition has been in mining.  In 1982 the then Minister agreed to the assignment of the State-mining lease to the present operators.  This has been in the hands of a receiver for a considerable number of years following the closedown of a previous operation. Considerable thought had been given to the matter at the time.  I had hoped that a continuing viable operation would be established at Ballingarry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the mine closed in June 1984, due to the lack of funds and the fact that further funding failed to materialise following protracted negotiations <Col N="1251" /> with a finance house.  I was following those negotiations in the course of this year.  I had been informed that the negotiations are to acquire funding to satisfy creditors.  I must say to be honest with the House that the debts of the company, the amounts owing to creditors, are very substantial.  I would be less than honest if I said anything else. Deputy Griffin mentioned the amount owing to the Revenue Commissioners which indicates the gravity of the debts owned by this company.  I would point out in fairness that negotiations are going on at this time with a mining company and I cannot give an indication whether those negotiations will be successful.</P>
    <P>While the mine is flooded at present, I am advised that this situation will not result in any serious damage to the mine for the next two to three months.  If operations were to resume at the mine within this period, I am informed that the mine could be restored to working order within two or three weeks following pumping and repair work.  Needless to say, in view of the situation I will be keeping in close touch with the mining company with regard to continuing negotiations and monitoring of the flooding.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for Energy approved the assignment of the State mining lease to Flair Resources (Ireland) Ltd., the parent company of Tipperary Anthracite Ltd., he has no stake in either of these companies which are privately owned.  The Minister's role is merely to grant the mine a lease to work State-owned minerals.  The State does not operate any mine.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of the mine to the Ballingarry area and of the difficulties which the company are experiencing, there has been support from State agencies for its operation.  It is important to point out that the IDA and Fóir Teoranta have given support.  Indeed, it is fair to say that there has been substantial assistance in the form of grants and loans from the IDA and Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>It is proper to point out that the basic problem is under-capitalisation.  Another aspect of the activities of the company is that they failed to raise production to a <Col N="1252" /> level that would be viable and profitable for them.  Of course, the kernel of any commercial mining operation is that the production at the mine would have reached break even levels or levels sufficient to generate cash to ensure the mine company's survival.  It is essentially a commercial decision whether the company would continue.  Substantial funds will now be necessary to ensure that the mine will be reopened, or if it is liquidated &mdash; I understand that the Revenue Commissioners are petitioning the court for its liquidation in December &mdash; there will be need for a substantial new capital injection.  I hope that the negotiations going on at present will be successful, but it is too early yet for me to be able to decide or to indicate to the House on the outcome of those negotiations.  The company were not successful because their management failed to raise production to a viable level to secure the continuing financing of the company.</P>
    <P>It is a difficult situation.  I do not wish to minimise it either from the point of view of business because it will require substantial revenue, or of the social effect on people living in the area which I realise is very serious.  The employment was about 110 men rising to 130 at peak point. This is a commercial operation.  It requires commercial acumen and decision for commercial companies to invest in the mine.  If there was sufficient investment and raising of production to a viable level the mine could be viable in the long term, but it is not up to the State to make that decision.  It is up to investors in the commercial world to do so.  I hope that the outcome of the negotiations going on at present will be successful.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer was married in July 1983.  Under the revised rules for the taxation of married couples, which were brought into effect by section 6 of <Col N="1203" /> the Finance Act, 1983, any repayment of tax, arising as a result of a couple getting married, is made after the end of the tax year in which the marriage takes place.</P>
      <P>A review of the taxpayer's liability for the year 1983-84 was carried out on 15 November 1984, and an overpayment arose.  A cheque in settlement was issued to him on 27 November 1984.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of removing VAT from hurleys or from other sports and recreation goods.  These are items upon which expenditure is largely discretionary and they therefore justifiably attract a VAT charge.</P>
      <P>The rate of VAT which applies to these goods, generally the 35 per cent rate, is high.  I have been examining, in the context of a review of the VAT rate structure, how this rate might be reduced. Reductions in the higher VAT rates may involve, however an increase in the low rates or the introduction of a positive VAT charge on goods which are currently VAT-free.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was examined on 25 October 1984 by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was not permanently incapable of work and asked to have him referred again for a further examination after four months. He is not, therefore, qualified for the receipt of invalidity pension.  The question of entitlement to invalidity pension will be considered after that examination.

His case has been referred to an appeals officer.  If the appeals officer decides to hold an oral hearing of the case, the claimant will be notified of the time and place of the hearing.</P>
