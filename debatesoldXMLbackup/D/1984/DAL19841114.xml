      <P>I would like, Sir, to seek your advice on one level and your permission to attempt to raise in some form or another the closure of the Storage Technology plant in Finglas.  It was ruled out of order both as a Private Notice Question yesterday and on request for time on the Adjournment, with an indication that there were precedents which indicated that it could not be done.  However, there were also precedents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot hear you, Deputy Flaherty.  If you have any trouble about finding some way about raising this matter within Standing Orders I would refer you to a study of Standing Orders.  If you would like a short cut, if you come to my office either I or some member of my staff will discuss the matter with you.  A liquidator has been appointed there and it is not in order to raise this matter in the way that it was sought to raise it yesterday and today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill which I am recommending for approval is a short one and it is required for technical reasons to enable payments to be made to the European Communities in order to enable them in turn to fund their programmes, and in particular, agricultural expenditure, this year and possibly next year.  The need for the Bill arises from an undertaking made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and by Ministers representing all other member states of the Community, on 2 October last to provide additional funds outside of the normal Community funding in the form of reimbursable advances.  This extra funding is required because the Community have reached the permitted limit on their normal funding of a proportion of VAT receipts, and of customs duties and agricultural levies.  The amount of Ireland's extra payment is £6.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary for me to seek specific approval for this extra payment for technical reasons.  As the House will be aware, our normal EC contribution is made from the Central Fund under regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972.  That Act provides <Col N="1939" /> that the EC Treaties, and all other Communities laws, are directly binding in Ireland. However, the undertaking of 2 October to which I have just referred was specifically designated as a voluntary undertaking and it was not possible therefore to make payments in accordance with that undertaking without this new legislation.</P>
    <P>The amounts of the advances in ECUs, rounded to the nearest 100,000 are as follows: Belgium, 34.6 million; Germany, 288.6 million; Denmark, 20 million; Greece, 15.4 million; France, 288.7 million; Ireland, 8.6 million; Italy, 153.8 million.  Luxembourg, 2.5 million; Netherlands, 50.1 million and UK, 201.2 million.  The additional funding by all member states will enable the Community to meet the supplementary expenditure required in 1984.  The total amount of supplementary expenditure is £1,340 million gross, of which £1,320 million is for agriculture.  Of the total of £1,340 million, £618 million can be met from normal Community revenue and balances. The remaining £722 million is being met by way of extra payments.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the possibility of making a further payment in the period up to the end of December 1985.  This has been inserted in the Bill because, as yet, there is no agreement on the means of funding the shortfall in Community receipts in 1985 although the Council are committed to providing the necessary funds.  It seems as well to provide for a further voluntary undertaking, although the Government hope for, and are pressing very strongly for, early implementation of agreement to raise the limit on the Communities' normal own resources which was made at Fontainebleau last June by the Heads of Government. Under that agreement the VAT limit is due to be raised to 1.4 per cent by 1986 at the very latest, and an increase to 1.6 per cent may be brought into effect in 1988.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware of the importance of the continuation of Community expenditure programmes not only in <Col N="1940" /> terms of their financial benefits to Ireland, but more generally in terms of maintaining the common policies of the Communities.  These programmes are essential and they are the concrete elements of European unity as achieved to date.  The Bill is required to allow those programmes to be funded adequately for 1984 and, specifically, to allow us to make our contribution under the arrangements that have been worked out for the Community and to provide for a similar arrangement being made in 1985.  I should like to stress again that the provision in the Bill in relation to 1985 is one which is dictated by prudence.  I would place great emphasis on the fact that the Government want a different approach to be taken to the funding for 1985 but it is a matter of prudence to provide at least for this mechanism so that we will be enabled to make a contribution were that method to be followed in that year.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In his conclusion the Minister said that these programmes are concrete elements of European unity as achieved to date and referred to the need to continue to promote the common policy.  He suggested that the Bill was concrete evidence of the common commitment to fulfilling the aims of the European Community.  It is my view that the Bill is concrete evidence of quite the opposite, not that that is the intention of the Minister or the Government.  The need for the Bill is concrete evidence of the failure of the European Community to provide adequate resources under the terms of the Treaties which were established at the beginning of the Community and to which we acceded in 1972.  It is because of the failure of the European Community to adhere to the principles of those Treaties, including our Treaty of Accession, that we have to introduce this Bill which, if it is concrete evidence of anything, is concrete evidence of that failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give some examples.  As the Minister said, the amount of money involved is about £1,340 million and we are expected, something that was not <Col N="1941" /> envisaged in the Treaty or in our Treaty of Accession, to make this type of <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement.  The Minister has focused on the need as being to fund agricultural expenditure and I am not suggesting that that is not the way it is but the Minister, frankly, might have put a little more before the House.  He should have put before the House the budget preoccupation of recent years and the cost of that to the European Community.  He should have told us why it is we have not got agreement on the lifting of the 1 per cent own resources.  I am speaking here particularly of the British budget issue. We are being asked now in this Parliament to vote an extra sum &mdash; in our case of the order of approximately £6.2 million, which represents close enough to approximately an 8 per cent or 9 per cent increase on our normal contribution &mdash; to keep the Community going on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    <P>What the Minister might have told us &mdash; and which I would invite him to do in replying &mdash; is how much of the funds of the European communities at present now needing to be replenished are swallowed up in what is euphemistically called the British budget arrangement.  One must ask how much are the rest of the members of the European Communities being forced to pay because the British have bullied the Community into changing the rules?</P>
    <P>Let me give the House something of the order of what I am speaking about. In 1983 the rebate to the United Kingdom was of the order of £600 million &mdash; a repayment over and above what was ever envisaged in their Treaty of Accession or ours.  Next year the figure will be closer to £1 billion if current arrangements come to fruition.  Bluntly, that is the reason that has forced the Community into its present position, that has even brought about the fact that from &ldquo;own resources&rdquo;, because of the need to repay the British for what they owe the Community, we now find ourselves in the extraordinary situation that all member states will be asked, as is the Minister asking us this morning &mdash; in this instance we are probably the first Parliament to <Col N="1942" /> be asked though I may be wrong in this respect &mdash; to give what might be described as good example.  I do not know whether that is the case; perhaps others have already dealt with this matter.  The reason this Bill is before us is that it is outside the remit of the Treaties.  It was not envisaged in anything we signed.  The reason this Bill is before us is not just, as the Minister said, to fund agricultural expenditure but rather because of the pressure imposed on all of us through British intransigence, by the manner in which they have turned the Community in on itself through their preoccupation with their budget rebate issue.</P>
    <P>It is quite significant that the proposals that emanated from the Commission in 1981 &mdash; I should know, I was a member of the Commission at the time &mdash; pointed out the need, in what was then called the mandate proposals, to increase the Community's &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; for the following year, which was 1982, to lift the ceiling above 1 per cent and have been consistently ignored since 1982-83, indeed to date in 1984 by the Council of Ministers. They have been ignored because that Council have capitulated to the British Government.  Because they have done so, because the Community's &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; cannot now be and have not been lifted above that 1 per cent ceiling, we find ourselves in this position.  Had that been done it would not have been necessary to have devised this kind of <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement which we are being asked to sign, we would have been able to have done so in accordance with the Treaties. But, because of the failure to lift &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; above the 1 per cent ceiling we must top this up at this point, that is ourselves and other member states.  One must ask which nation was the one that blocked any increase in &ldquo;own resources&rdquo;? No marks for the answer &mdash; the United Kingdom.  They blocked the increase.  They were consistently determined that they would not have it until such time as what was owed them was repaid as they saw it, casting aside the rest of us in the EC, our principles, aims and commitments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> That is the reason we are here discussing this Bill this morning and, let us not delude ourselves, it is a consequence of that failure that we find ourselves in this position.  That is not a view held merely predictably by Irish public representatives, Irish governments or people like myself, who dealt with the British in this connection both as Minister for Foreign Affairs and as a Commissioner.  It is the view of all the parliamentarians of Europe, and that of many others as well, that what is now being proposed is not really in line with the aims of the Treaties, particularly the procedural Treaties.  For that reason I must say that when the Minister said that this represented concrete evidence of European achievements to date I find it to be quite the opposite.  It is evidence of the failure of the European Communities to adhere to their own policy decisions.</P>
    <P>We have all become preoccupied with the budget of the EC, have we not?  That has been the constant pre-occupation of the EC over the last three or four years thanks to that great European torchbearer, Margaret Thatcher, that person of great European idealism.  The constant pre-occupation has been with the British budget issue, everything else taking second place.  In turn its consequence has been that the policies necessary to develop the European ideal &mdash; as proposed from the beginning, as were outlined in great detail in the mandate proposals, in relation to research and development programmes, to industrial technology, to unemployment &mdash; policies that were necessary, which represent the real test of Europe, and its relevance to the problems of Europe today, have not even begun to be launched because of the intransigence of the British and the weak reaction of other member states.  They have now reached the conclusion &mdash; which is of great significance to Ireland and our economy generally and which forms part of the understanding we are now being asked to endorse &mdash; that henceforth they will deal with the budget. They will curtail budget spending.  The next question to be posed is what is the <Col N="1944" /> relevant agreement presided over by this Government and Minister?  The agreement now reached &mdash; and it is unthinkable that an Irish Government could find themselves in the position of presiding over such a conclusion &mdash; is that from 1985-86 one thing will be clear &mdash; it is not as yet law because it cannot be, rather is it a discipline now agreed &mdash; that henceforth the rate of growth on agricultural spending will be less than the rate of growth in the budget.  That is something that never appeared in any Treaty, nor did it form any part of any arrangement to which we acceded in any Treaty.  Certainly it is not something that is part of the spirit of the European Communities, to which I shall advert in a moment.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that all of this has been drawn up by the Government opposite who happen to be presiding over the affairs of the European Communities for the current six months.  I am not saying that pressures have not been brought to bear on them by member states.</P>

      <P>If the Minister has, then he is misrepresenting the position. Perhaps then he would concentrate on the budget issue.  That is what we were told to do at the Stuttgart Summit at that time, and we did not do as we were told. We did much more, as the Minister will discover.  We did insist that one could not deal with the question &mdash; I wish the Minister would read it &mdash; purely on a budget issue.  As the record will show, we did insist that it was not just a question <Col N="1945" /> of rebates to Britain.  We insisted particularly that if the European Communities were to have any meaning &mdash; and it can be seen right across the whole range of the mandate proposals with which I was very definitely involved &mdash; then any Community that preoccupied itself with a budget was doomed immediately to turn in on itself and die.</P>
      <P>We presented a whole range of policies which Europe needed to be relevant to the needs of today and tomorrow.  The Minister present today who saw fit to make that intervention knows a fair bit about the effects of budget preoccupation on any community.  What he is allowing to happen in Europe he has done in this nation.  Anyone who concentrates on the budget issues is bound to see the consequences we see in Europe and in Ireland today &mdash; a sense of hopelessness and frustration, an all-pervading sense of gloom, which is the consequence of people of little imagination, no confidence and small minds.

      <P>We do not believe this Bill should be passed in its present form.  We seldom have an opportunity to protest at the way the European Communities have been turned away from their fundamental aims and obligations by the intransigence of the Council of Ministers, particularly the British Government and the way they have forced the Communities so far off the correct path.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill we are making provision for <Col N="1946" /> a contingency in 1985 which the Government do not want to see arise.  We are told that for 1985 there is agreement at Council level to provide the additional necessary funding and Ireland has been pressing for this to be done by way of raising the 1 per cent VAT limit in that year.  However, in case agreement cannot be reached in raising the VAT limit in 1985, the Bill provides for another voluntary agreement for that year.  What we are saying is that the Government want to see, even four years too late, the ceiling lifted on VAT own resources for 1985 as has been proposed by the Commission since 1980 and 1981, but in case we do not succeed and in case the British dig in their heels further, we want to get the sanction of this House now to enable us to continue this <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement whereby Ireland will top up payments in an extra treaty while the British Government in particular and others refuse to lift the ceiling of resources.  If ever there was a case of conceding before getting to the negotiating table this would be it. If the member states of the Community and their parliaments pass a measure such as this for 1985 and say that ideally they would like to have an increase in the 1 per cent own resources but in case others do not agree they will provide it through this type of topping up exercise, is it not clear that that iron-hearted lady of great European commitment, who has given a new sense of purpose to Europe and all its ideals, will see the mealy-mouthed weak-kneed members of the various Governments already conceding?  She will only have to assert, as she has always done, that there will be no increase in the resources in 1985 unless and until she gets back her money, and the rest of us see Europe on her terms.  That is the reality. We are not talking about an increase of own resources that would be necessary to fund agriculture, social policies or the new policies of technology.  If the Minister ever gets around to reading the mandate he will see that the total amount of money being spent by the individual member states on research and development was far in excess of that spent by Japan in any of the last five or ten years. <Col N="1947" /> Nonetheless, the results in terms of technological development are weaker and worse.</P>
    <P>When are we going to get a renewal of the commitment to European policies that is so needed while we are tinkering about with measures like this?  The only time we have anything to say about European development is when we are reacting against the European development we claim to be promoting.  This is an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement outside the Treaty and we should reflect on it.  Why are we being asked to make this unprecedented contribution? I have already given the reasons why I think this is happening.  The total shortfall this year is of the order of £722 million.  That happens to be a little less than the British rebate for this year.  It is time we said that out loud in this House, and not glossed over it by saying we want to keep up spending for agriculture.  The reality is that because of these mechanisms for repaying the British what they never paid in the first instance, we find ourselves in this situation.</P>
    <P>It is time we faced up to the argument of what are the resources of the Community. If funds collected by way of border levies, border taxes, border tariffs and agricultural taxes belong to the country collecting them, as Britain claim, then the basis of the European Community funding is turned on its head.  The Dutch through the free port of Rotterdam would be making a very major contribution if what she collects at the border were claimed to be Dutch contributions to the European Community, which they are not.  These are the issues we should constantly bring up at Government and European Parliament level &mdash; it must be said that the European Parliament have taken a leading role in these issues &mdash; otherwise there will be a further squeeze on agriculture, a reduction in spending generally and we will not have enough resources for enlargement.</P>
    <P>Even if we get the increase in own resources to 1.4 per cent in 1986 it will be inadequate even to meet the needs of enlargement, never mind to develop policies of the European Community.  It <Col N="1948" /> will also be inadequate to protect the interests of the communities which might be affected, such as the Irish fishing community. This measure will just about cover the extra cost of the accession of Spain and Portugal, should that come about, but it will not develop one new idea of policies.  Meanwhile, agriculture will continue to be squeezed.</P>
    <P>Is it not a scandal that, in a world crying out for food, where we see the effects of starvation, especially in the African subcontinent, Europe should be cutting back on food production instead of promoting at least in the short term a relief measure and not just for the selfish interests of Ireland?  It is difficult for anyone to understand why, at a time when millions are starving throughout Africa, we in Europe are deciding to curtail agricultural spending and, consequently curtail agricultural development.  I suppose we are to curtail, too, the necessary funds that would come through the Lomé Convention in which Ireland has played a prominent part, both during the Presidency of the Taoiseach and during my time as President of the Council of Ministers. The Lomé Convention is designed to help these African peoples to be as near self-sufficient as possible; yet we curtail the funds and then raise our hands in horror when the inevitable tragedy occurs.  I am not saying that all the responsibility lies with the Government, much less the blame, but it is time that all of us who have any belief in Europe and in what it represents in terms of balance and equity both within and in the context of a fair international world order, shouted from the rooftops that we will not be bullied, that we will not see Europe set aside.</P>
    <P>I recall the European Council which began in Dublin in 1978 and at which I witnessed the British Prime Minister thumping the table and saying, &ldquo;I want my money.&rdquo;  We have seen the consequences of that attitude for Europe in the meantime.  Unfortunately, the other Prime Ministers did not give Mrs. Thatcher the response she deserved but I am glad to say that they did not concede at that Dublin Council.  I consider that to <Col N="1949" /> have been one of our proudest achievements. However, the British Press were able to get through to our own Press and present that European Council as being almost a disaster, a crisis for Europe. We swallowed that story when we should have been patting ourselves on the back for not having allowed Europe to be focused on a narrow budget issue.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the subsequent European Council which is presented sometimes as a success and which was held in Luxembourg in 1980, signalled the beginning of the failure of Europe.  That was when the compromise was made and terms agreed that were unacceptable on the basis of any of the principles of Europe.  The slippery slope taken at that time is the reason for our being here today debating this issue.  We should not have given in on the basis of not causing a crisis.  We should not have heeded the threats of the British Prime Minister.  Perhaps what happened then was a reflection of the strength of that lady and of the weakness of the rest.</P>
    <P>Those of us who believe in European principles must not tolerate such developments. I understand that what is being agreed for 1985 is a budget discipline system so as to ensure that agricultural spending will always increase at a rate lower than EC levels.  That is no part of the Treaties.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that five or ten years ago spending on the CAP represented almost 75 per cent of the total EC budget.  Is it not farcical that the corresponding figure now is about 65 per cent when increasing numbers of people are leaving agriculture?  In the past two decades about 14 million people have got out of agriculture in Europe; yet by this arrangement we are ensuring that agriculture will expand at a rate lower than EC revenues.  There is not yet the legal authority for this but a discipline is agreed and that is to be followed up.</P>
    <P>By way of this discipline we are eroding the powers of the Commission and of the Parliament, both of which have expressed their views on this.  We are witnessing a situation, as envisaged in this Bill, where for 1985 there is a discipline agreed <Col N="1950" /> before the Commission make their proposals and before the Parliament go through the conciliation procedure with the Council.  Presumably this arrangement is being presided over by our Minister, though perhaps under great pressure by way of response to the other Ministers for Finance.  We have agreed something which cuts across and erodes the whole budgetary authority both of the Commission and of the Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that even the British Commissioner has described the arrangement as self evidently artificial in the sense that it will not provide enough resources to fund the needs of the Community for next year.  The Parliament have resisted the move as being contrary to and opposed to their principles but we are prepared to allow it happen during our presidency.  We must demand that the position be corrected.  The British have expressed their satisfaction with this self discipline for next year.  They are the only ones who are happy with it and the reason for that is that they have turned the whole budget argument in the direction they wished.  All of next year's envisaged expenditure should be incorporated in the budget for 1985.  Yet here we are presenting a kind of nonsense budget for 1985, a budget which by way of the provisions of this Bill, we may top up and are likely to have to top up.</P>
    <P>In the normal way this House would be supporting any legislation that would be important from the point of view of discharging our responsibilities and also any funds that would be in line with our national development, particularly agricultural development within the Community. The Minister rather plausibly told us this morning that the only reason for the funds is to meet agricultural expenditure but he has not considered the root cause.  He must know that the only reason for using those terms is because of the way agricultural expenditure is being squeezed and will continue to be squeezed unless we shout that we have had enough.</P>
    <P>We must not be seen to be the little boys who are happy to wag our tails when someone who has a strange commitment <Col N="1951" /> to Europe, perhaps the British Prime Minister, makes demands.  From my contacts both in the Commission and in the Parliament I know that the best example for us is to say that we will not accept this kind of <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement, especially in respect of 1985.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> As we know, agriculture is fundamental to our economy and this Bill is further evidence of the attitude now being adopted to agricultural development not alone by the Government here but by Europe generally. The decision by the Council of Finance Ministers that in future they will control agricultural spending and take that away from the Council of Agriculture Ministers is something which this side of the House cannot accept.  We will have to try to ensure that changes will be effected as soon as possible, because the Agriculture Ministers are the proper people to decide the agriculture budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am appalled at the decision which the Irish Minister, who presided at the meeting, allowed to be put through at that meeting and was party to.  He should have realised the importance of agriculture to our economy.  When we joined the EEC we did so as equal partners and our main interest at the time was the improvement it would bring to our agricultural production and marketing.  However, in the past couple of years since the Government began to represent us in <Col N="1952" /> Europe we have seen a general downgrading of agriculture and an ignoring of the problems of our small dairy farmers in their efforts to increase production. Many of them have to increase production in order to exist.</P>
    <P>Now, with the super-levy and the imposition of reduced production in dairying, the situation has become very serious and will be in the years ahead.  As a result of the many decisions that have been allowed to be made in Europe, a climate of economic turbulence has been created with accompanying downgrading of agriculture by Government policies both here and in the EC.  The Government allowed the super-levy to be operated, despite major work by Fianna Fáil Ministers when they were negotiating.</P>
    <P>This is no longer a farming issue but a national problem because it affects every household in town and city as well as in the country.  It bodes disaster for us.  The Minister concerned could not even get his sums right and we are now faced with a further reduction in production.  The earlier agreement was bad enough but we are to have our production reduced by a further 1 per cent of our 1983 figure.</P>
    <P>The reduction in farm incomes has been significant in the past two years and it has caused damage to the whole economy. It will lower the standard of living of everybody and will add to our already massive unemployment figures.  The dairying industry has been the bedrock of our national income from the export of dairy produce and three quarters of our calf production as raw material for our beef industry has come from dairying. Therefore, this new crisis in regard to the super-levy is bordering on the criminal.</P>
    <P>In the past our dairy farmers responded significantly to requests for increased output.  Now they have to face harsh penalites for that response.  Ireland's dairying industry is unique in the Community and this should be realised.  At the moment it is not.  When we begin to pay our penalites later we will be bitten in a serious way.  Even at this late stage the Minister should bring home strongly the consequences on us of the super-levy.  Our national interests are at stake.  We have <Col N="1953" /> been told that despite the super-levy our farmers have reached average European standards.  This is not the case.  The issue is one which affects our national interest. The dairying industry represents something in the region of 33 per cent of our total agricultural output.  Its contribution to the cattle and beef industry is immense as it provides 80 per cent of the raw material for that important industry. Beef exports accounts for 70 per cent of total agricultural exports.</P>
    <P>Significant changes have taken place in the dairying industry in recent years.  Our creameries have been rationalised.  There is a growing trend towards specialisation and greater efficiency on dairy farms. This augurs well for the future of this important branch of our economy.  However, it is important that pricing conditions remain attractive and that no barriers are placed in the way of progress. For reasons well known to the House our dairying industry, in contrast to that of our continental neighbours, has been denied the opportunity to realise its optimum potential.  Other member states have a distinct advantage.  They do not deny that.  As regards the super-levy, not to allow this country normal growth in milk output is inequitable.  In the future it will create a position where we will be permanently disadvantaged <i>vis-à-vis</i> other member states.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers act on proposals from the European Commission.  The Commission have publicly voiced their acceptance of the justification of Ireland's case.  They have a responsibility to translate that acceptance into a formal proposal to the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  The only form that proposal could take is to grant a total exemption to us until we reach the European average in milk production.  What we are asking is that the proposals be reasonable and just and that the Council of Ministers in making a decision should recognise the importance of the dairying industry to the economy.  The most appalling feature of the Government's handling of this matter was the acceptance by the Taoiseach of a 5 per cent increase for 1984 with no guarantee beyond that.  One would have <Col N="1954" /> expected that before he accepted a downright bad deal he would have tested the reaction of his colleagues.  He admitted in public that he did not do that.</P>
    <P>If we were in Government there would be no question of a super-levy being imposed on farmers.  I do not say that lightly.  It will be remembered that on two occasions the Minister for Agriculture resisted a proposed super-levy or any restriction on milk production.  The reported agreement I have mentioned by the EC Finance Ministers that agricultural spending will rise at a slower rate than Community revenue means a worsening of support for agriculture. Coupled with the restriction on milk production it does not hold out any hope for farming, particularly dairy farmers.  If Spain and Portugal joined the Community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Greater vigilance will be needed in the future to protect the interests of farmers.  As has been recently stressed, we must pay the closest attention to the terms of entry of Spain and Portugal.  The recent attitude to agriculture must not persist.  I am referring to the decision by the Council of Finance Ministers to restrict spending on agriculture within the EC.  It highlights the need for Ireland to ensure that the maximum funding from the regional and social fund will accrue to this country.  Whether we like it or not, Irish agriculture must increasingly look to itself for improvement of farmers' incomes.  A lot can be done within the industry to improve matters.</P>
      <P>Our attitude has been outlined fully by our spokesman on Finance.  While the Bill allows the Government to increase their contribution to the EC, nevertheless it will have a disastrous effect because of recent decisions taken by the Council of Finance Ministers to restrict agricultural spending in future.  I support the views expressed by Deputy O'Kennedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies opposite for their contributions.  Listening to Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Noonan I have had more than a little difficulty in deciding what was the main drift of their remarks.  I suppose it is my Christian Brother training but I like to look for good in everyone.  I did that this morning and I found a little good in the Deputies opposite in that they have shown the capacity, which seems to be widespread in the Fianna Fáil Party, of looking in two different directions at the same time, to perform the most amazingly complicated mental gymnastics and to put forward as a result positions which are contorted, to use one of Deputy Noonan's words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy <Col N="1956" /> Noonan expressed worry at the level of funding available now for agriculture in the European Community and the level of funding that will be available in future years.  They are right to do that.  There is no doubt that the level of available funding for FEOGA activities both on the market support and structural sides is a matter of very high importance to this country.  However, I cannot see the logic in the Deputies opposite expressing that worry and then saying that they object to this Bill.  As I said when I was introducing the Bill, it is needed in order to make sure that this country can participate in an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement that will recover the difference between the total amount of funding available under the Community's own resources and the total amount of money required to fund the decisions that have been made about expenditure right across the whole range of Community expenditure this year.</P>
    <P>The total amount of supplementary expenditure needed this year is £1,340 million gross, of which £1,320 million is for agriculture.  The extra payments are required in order to cover £720 million, the balance being met from Community balances and normal revenue.  If we do not operate that <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement, Community funding for agriculture this year will fall £720 million below what is required to give effect to policies as they are at present.  If the Opposition are saying that they oppose this Bill, I should like Deputy Noonan to say clearly and unambiguously that he objects to making money available to fund the Community's agricultural expenditure this year.  I will even give him a couple of minutes of my time if he is disposed to say that, although it might be disorderly of me to suggest it.  Deputy Noonan seems to be in the unhappy position of a man who is following a colleague who is cutting off his nose to spite his face.</P>
    <P>Is Deputy Noonan serious about the concern he mentioned in relation to agricultural expenditure?  If so, he should reflect again and change his mind about this because he would have the most extraordinary difficulty about going back to his constituents and telling them how <Col N="1957" /> he demonstrates his commitment to the funding of agriculture in the European Community by refusing to hand over £6.2 million of our funding which is a part of that required in order to make £1,320 million available to cover the deficit on agricultural spending in the Community this year.  If Deputy Noonan embarked on that enterprise I would nearly make time available to follow him because I am sure it would be one of the greatest amusements I would have had for quite a long time.  He might last for a while because, with the mental somersaults which he and Deputy O'Kennedy indulged in today, he might get away with that extraordinary two faced approach.  I do not use the word &ldquo;two faced&rdquo; in any pejorative sense.  He is like the Roman God of War&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would not be embarrassed even if I were to tell the House the amount of time I spent when I was an employee of the EC trying to head off or deal with some of the more mischievous effects of the famous mandate of which Deputy O'Kennedy is so proud.  It was not by any means roses all the way.  However, it is not relevant to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy went on at some length about how necessary it is to increase the total amount of resources available to the Community.  I strongly agree that it is a great pity that it has taken until this year to get agreement on <Col N="1958" /> increasing the level of own resources. Deputy O'Kennedy does not seem to be aware of the fact that we now have agreement in the Council that the level of the own resources of the VAT contribution to the Community will be increased to 1.4 per cent from 1986 at the latest.  That phrase &ldquo;at the latest&rdquo; is very important. That will be debated fairly keenly in the Council over the next few months and during the course of next year.  I hope it will not be for too long a part of next year, because I should like to see some positive results out of it during the course of next year.  The fact remains &mdash; and I do not attach particular significance to the fact that it has come about during the period of office of this Government, although I am sure we had a substantial influence on it &mdash; that we now have an agreement which raises the level of own resources available to the Community We also have indications of further progress after that for a further raising of the VAT ceiling to 1.6 per cent.  That must be seen in its proper context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just about to come to the question of the effects on the total availability of funding for agriculture.  If we had no increase in the level of own resources, in the percentage of VAT which can enter into Community own resources, we would have a gradual increase in the total availability of funds to the Community over a period arising naturally from the growth in GNP and the affects of that on the things which go to make up own resources.  Even on those grounds a rate of expansion in agricultural expenditure less than the expansion in own resources would not necessarily mean an actual restriction in the amounts <Col N="1959" /> of money being made available.  When you add the fact that we are raising the own resources base from 1 per cent now to 1.4 per cent in 1986 at the latest and a prospect of a further increase after that, we can safely say that there are provisions there which, if we pay due care and attention to what is going on, will cover our agricultural requirements over the years in question.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy has spoken at some length, making very colourful remarks about the activities of various member states in relation to budgetary limits.  The Deputy is more than a little out of date.  He seems to believe that there is still an objection to an increase in the VAT limit.  There is not.  As I said, we have an agreement that it will be raised to 1.4 per cent in 1986 at the latest. The main objections to that did not come from the member state which was the subject of so many of Deputy O'Kennedy's remarks &mdash; the United Kingdom. The main objections at the moment come from elsewhere.</P>

Member states have shown again that if you spend long enough time, have enough patience, and do not get too excited or rush around in a mad fury, you can achieve very substantial <Col N="1964" /> and useful results from Community discussions.  The Deputies appear afraid that this is going to restrict expenditure on agriculture.  I explained already to Deputy Noonan the framework of the whole operation.  I am just a little worried that Deputy Noonan seems to be repeatedly departing from his own preoccupations in saying that, in addition to increasing agricultural spending, he also wanted, if I understood him correctly, large increases in the amounts available for the Regional and Social Funds.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan made some remarks regarding the super-levy but I think the Deputy is a little behind once again.  If he saw the news on television last night or if he had read the newspapers this morning he would have known that there is now quite a disposition in the Agricultural Council to defer the determination and calculation of the super-levy for some months and to defer the collection of the levy for some months after that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more trenchant ways of saying that but they would not be proper language for this House.  Deputy O'Kennedy objects to having an arrangement in 1985.  I have provided for the arrangement so that we would have a backstop but that in no way takes from the strength of the case I will be making for a better arrangement in 1985, which is an earlier implementation of the increase in the own resources ceiling.  For the life of me I cannot see how it can in any way be interpreted as a sign of prevarication, weakness or lack of confidence to make sure that we have a backstop. There is no doubt in my mind that the fact that this House will have passed the Bill, as I hope it will, covering the requirement for 1984 and making provision for 1985 on the basis of the existing agreement, but which does not specify the mechanism, will put me in a stronger position in the Council when we discuss what we will do in 1985.  In the Council when we are discussing this I will be in a stronger position if I can say to my colleagues that the evidence is before them in the form of a Bill passed by this House, that I want this arrangement to be made in 1985 and then we can discuss the kind of arrangement.  That will strengthen my position rather than <Col N="1966" /> weaken it and from that point of view I ask the Deputies opposite to reconsider their objection to this part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>We are not the first member state to make this provision.  The Greeks have already provided for making their payments and provisions to give effect to the arrangement for this year are now being discussed in several other parliaments in the EC.  It is time we did it because we are now in the middle of November and the payments have to be made by the end of the year.  I was quite concerned to make sure that we had the Bill introduced and debated here at the earliest moment. In this connection I must record my appreciation of the Opposition who agreed to do this even after the Whips had come to an agreement last Thursday regarding the timing of business for this week.  It was a proper response on the part of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Opposition are making a good case for objecting to the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement for 1984.  I cannot see the logic in expressing grave concern, as they have, about the level of funding for agriculture not only for this year but also for future years while objecting to the measure that is needed this year to make sure we can cover the level of expenditure required this year.  Nor can I see the logic of objecting to making it possible to have a similar arrangement for next year.  The fact that we will have provided for a similar arrangement for next year will strengthen my hand and the hands of my other colleagues who will be involved when we come to insist on a satisfactory arrangement for 1985. This will include a very strong line on our part that the 1.4 per cent VAT ceiling should come into operation not just from the beginning of 1986 but at an earlier point.  The passage of this Bill will do two things.  First, it will cover our contribution in respect of what is required in 1984 and, secondly, it will strengthen our position in arguing for a better system in the course of 1985, a system which is quite consistent with the concerns expressed by the Opposition today.</P>

      <P>Of course.  Everything is left to the Minister.  Will he tell us how much of the funds of the budget of the EC in 1984 is taken up in providing for the British rebate to which I paid some attention?  I do not know if the Minister in his reply referred to the difficulties that the EC have experienced in the past few years and also at the moment because of the British position.  Perhaps he does not want to talk about it.  Perhaps he feels in the light of this special relationship we are trying to develop with Britain that it is not appropriate that we should say anything that might offend.  Nevertheless, will he tell us how much of the funds in 1984 and the projected funds for 1985 will go towards meeting the British rebate?</P>

      <P>That figure is the vast bulk of the amount we are being asked to pass to supplement the Community resources for 1984, namely, £700 million. It must be recorded that that remains the <Col N="1968" /> major problem and issue of the EC in relation to the budget.  While we will not be the country that will squeeze any section of the Community for the resources that are required, the fact is this issue would not arise now were it not for the disposition of the British budget.  The Minister does not need to comment.  I do not know how much he has said on the British question in his reply, but that is the view of this side of the House.</P>

      <P>During Deputy O'Kennedy's absence I said that I did not intend to go in detail into fighting past battles on this issue.  As far as the principles of the matter are concerned, in terms of the argument that Deputy O'Kennedy is making on the matter of a refund, if anything I would be ahead of the posse. There is an issue of principle there which seems inconsistent with the spirit of the Treaty.  However much we may dislike it, whatever our position may be on the substance of the principle, an agreement has been made which has been endorsed by the Community as a whole, and that provides part of the framework within which we now have to operate and which leads to a situation where we have to provide for a supplementary budget in the Community this year.  Apart from the niceties of debating the principle of that issue, the Deputy knows that he and I would be in rather more agreement than would appear from our exchanges this morning.</P>

      <P>In view of what the Minister has said in relation to that, it is important to note in this issue as to whether what Britain claims to be a rebate is Community resources of Britain's contribution, it is time the matter was resolved at Community level.  I hope that the Minister in his capacity as President of the Council will bring this issue constantly before the Council, because as long as it is left in the manner in which it is we are all committed to refunding Britain contributions which she did not make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 2, in relation to next year, 1985, this is the most serious reservation we have on this side of the House.  However the situation in 1984 came about, we recognise that we must accept the situation in which we find ourselves.  In regard to 1985, is it a fact that the Commission in respect of which I understood him to say in misrepresenting me had no authority on the budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all I was saying about the Commission.  The Commission proposed for 1985 a budget which would be something of the order of £21 billion. This proposal is in line with what Parliament recommend for 1985.  The Budget Committee of the Parliament have indicated already that they are recommending an increase of £2,348 million over a figure agreed by the Council so far.  The position now in relation to 1985 is that the Commission in their proposals, which are emerging already, are talking of a figure of that order of about £21 billion, and Parliament are recommending an increase over the figure mentioned by the Council of Ministers over which the Minister presides of the order of £2,348 million.  Would the Minister not acknowledge that in these circumstances this kind of agreement, in respect of which we are now being asked to endorse a further <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement in the event of failure to lift the resources he hopes will be achieved in 1985, will weaken his hand?  If the Minister hopes that the 1 per cent limit will be lifted for 1985 &mdash; as is not yet agreed; the only agreement is in respect of 1986 &mdash; can he not see that by virtue of having the endorsement of this House and the other Parliament already <Col N="1970" /> to provide for an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement in 1985 which would come into effect only if the 1 per cent limit is not increased, he is already conceding &mdash; I am not saying capitulating &mdash; the argument?  The member states who are opposed to an increase in the resources in 1985 can now say, &ldquo;Yes, but we already have agreement not just at Council level but in the various parliaments that in the event that we do not increase resources in 1985 we can go ahead on this <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement. After all, it is endorsed by your own Parliament and by the Danish Parliament&rdquo;&mdash; if that will be the case.  I will be very interested to hear the debate of the Danish Parliament on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the figures now mentioned by the Council for 1985 are of the order of £2,348 million below what Parliament are suggesting &mdash; and they are part of the budgetary authority &mdash; this will weaken his hand.  The Minister will be aware of what I said this morning, that even Commissioner Tugendhat said that the amount suggested by the Minister under our Presidency &mdash; we cannot do just as we would wish but it is under our Presidency &mdash; is unrealistic.  It does not represent the real needs of the budget for next year.  The Minister is asking us to ignore what two institutions have to say: the Commission, who I insist introduced the budget &mdash; and I presume the Minister will agree with that now &mdash; and Parliament who have a role in this budgetary authority.  In the event that the Council, who have been the stumbling block in the increase of resources, do not agree, the Minister wants the sanction of this House to strengthen his hand in the negotiations. I cannot see how it does that. What about the extent of the rebate for Britain for 1985?  I think it will turn out to be a considerable amount of money, perhaps of the order of £1 billion.  Are we just going to concede that argument also?  I would like the Minister to indicate how, in the face of Parliament and the Commission and their publicly expressed views on this, the giving of this <i>ad hoc</i> extension for next year against the possibility that there will be an increase in resources will strengthen his hand in <Col N="1971" /> bringing about an increase in resources, which is in line with the Treaty's Community obligations.  By contrast these proposals are not at all based on the Treaty as the Minister has said but just an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is punts.  Here references to £s may be construed as references to punts, when we are speaking as Béarla at least.  On the more general question raised by Deputy O'Kennedy, if a budget were to be produced for 1985 that remained within the limit of total own resources on the basis of the 1 per cent VAT ceiling and the other elements of own resources that come in, it is clear that it would be inadequate to cover the levels of expenditure foreseen from present policies.  The budgetary authority of the Community cannot adopt a budget that provides for expenditure which exceeds the total amount of own resources available to the Community and I am sure Deputy O'Kennedy is aware of that. Whatever the wishes or desires of the Council might be, particularly whatever the Parliament's wishes or desires might be, neither one of them is in a position legally to be able to conclude the whole budget process with a budget that calls for expenditure greater than the total amount of revenue available.  That fact, and the inadequacy of the total amount of funding available, are recognised by the Council.  It is for that reason that the Council have agreed that we will have a further mechanism in 1985, the nature of which is so far unspecified, in order to cover the difference between what is obviously required and what is there under the 1 per cent VAT ceiling.  We will be approaching that discussion over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no difficulty at all, for very obvious reasons, in disclosing my hand <Col N="1972" /> or my basic position in going into those discussions.  My belief is that the sensible thing to do is to bring the increase in the own resources VAT ceiling into operation earlier than the beginning of 1986. The Government have already made it clear to our partners in the Community that that is the case.  In the course of that discussion, if the Oireachtas passes this Bill, I will be able to say to my colleagues that we are going to need another arrangement.  I have already provided the main provision to be able to cover the kind of arrangement that is being made in 1984.  I do not think that arrangement is adequate and I believe that what we should do is to increase the VAT ceiling with effect from 1985.  Nobody can reproach me in the negotiations with not having made it very clear that the Irish Government are prepared to make available the extra funding requirement. There is no ambiguity in our position there.  Were we to be asked about the seriousness of our intent in that regard we could say that we have passed the Bill in our Oireachtas that provides specifically for this.  There could be no doubt about our seriousness, our intent or willingness to make whatever is the appropriate contribution for Ireland.  We start off then from a strong position and from that point of view I contend that section 2 as it is strengthens my position in those discussions rather than anything else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be the person involved in the negotiations and there is a precedent, one that I am anxious to adhere to, that those charged with the negotiations for the time being will have the full support of the House in terms of the common purpose we want to achieve.  I do not wish to say anything that will in any way undermine the Minister's position in the negotiations and anything I said was not an effort to do that.  We have to repose trust and confidence in the Minister who is negotiating, in this instance particularly, in so far as he is President of the Council.  However, I cannot see the validity of the case he makes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that it is not <Col N="1973" /> possible to adopt a budget in excess of the budget that applies.  That is understandable, but the institutions who have the authority to extend the budget by a reference to the increase of own resources to 1.4 per cent in 1985 are the people who can extend the budget.  They have the authority on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, after consultation with Parliament, to introduce the increase in own resources this coming year.  Obviously, an increased budget is required.  There is common case here. There is no doubt that they will require much more than is already written into the budget for 1985.  The people who have the authority to extend the scope of the contributions to the budget under the Treaties, the Council and Parliament are, after considering the Commission's proposals, entitled to say: &ldquo;Sorry, if we increase the budget now we are acting outside the Treaties because the budget as defined at the moment does not make provision for a sum of that kind&rdquo;.  They are the people who can ensure that it does.  Therefore, it is not reasonable to suggest that they would be acting <i>ultra vires</i> when, in fact, the authority lies with them to implement the increase in own resources for next year.  Then the new proposals for the necessary funds of the order of the figures mentioned by Parliament, an increase of something like £2 billion over this year's budget, would be entirely in line with the budget.</P>
    <P>It is not on to say that somebody may say that if they did this they would be acting illegally when it is entirely within their own competence to ensure that it would be entirely legal.  I cannot see how the Minister concluded that his hand is strengthened in his hope, expectation, assertion or whatever, that the own resources ceiling will be lifted for next year.  I cannot see how when he goes back to his colleagues as President of the Council to press for this, not just because Ireland says so but because it is in line with the European needs and policies, that his hand is strengthened by virtue of the fact that he can say that his Parliament agree with him and, just in case <Col N="1974" /> they do not increase resources, this Parliament had reposed so much trust in all of them that they had agreed to a continuation of this <i>ad hoc</i> mechanism next year.  I cannot see honestly how, by any standard of logic or persuasion, that strengthens the Minister's hand.  I would have thought it would do the opposite.</P>
    <P>Were I a British minister on that occasion when the heat comes on I would say &ldquo;This is a difficult question that we have been dealing with over the last five years and we must not create problems or give rise to tensions but for the time being have you not authority, not just as President of the Council but as a representative of Ireland, from your Parliament to continue with the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements for next year?  Therefore, for this year only it does not pose a problem for you and why should you press this to a limit that will give rise to tensions and problems?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know if the other parliaments will be adopting the proposal in the same terms as the Minister has put before us in respect of 1985; 1984 I understand, but 1985 I am not sure of.  I do not know if the British, the Danes, the French and the Germans are asking their parliaments to sanction similar legislation.  If they are it is a heaven sent response to any government that wants to oppose the increase in resources.  Any government can say in that event &ldquo;The mechanism is there.  Let us carry on on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis for another year.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, that is the way Europe has been going on for the last four or five years.  If the Minister says that strengthens his hand then we would have a different approach to tactics and strategy in Council negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy may think that we might have a different approach in tactics and strategy but we will not know that because it is a hypothetical question.  I am bound to say that the Deputy has picked the wrong example in putting words into the mouth in this hypothetical discussion of a hypothetical British minister.  As I stated earlier, the UK are rather anxious to have the contribution limit raised.  That being <Col N="1975" /> said, I must say that in making the argument to the Council certainly I would not do it in the manner Deputy O'Kennedy has suggested we might.  There is an element here of, &ldquo;It ain't what you say, it is the way that you say it.&rdquo;  That is important. I would not approach it on the kind of basis that Deputy O'Kennedy is advocating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right for the Minister to say that but I did not indicate how I would say it.  What I am saying is that what we are now sanctioning here &mdash; no matter what the Minister says or how he says it &mdash; will weaken his hand.  It does not matter whether it is a British or a German minister; that does not matter. By virtue of the fact that we are now giving the Oireachtas authority to expend extra moneys on an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement for 1985 in my view &mdash; and it might be contended that I have some experience of the European scene as a Council Minister and otherwise &mdash; will undermine the Minister's position in trying to achieve an increase in the &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; ceiling for 1985.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;have been enacted by the Oireachtas for the investigation and adjudication of complaints from the public against members of the Garda Síochána by or under the direction of an independent Complaints Commission, and until regulations providing for adequate safeguards <Col N="1977" /> under section 7, have been approved by the Oireachtas and made by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The situation in which we now find ourselves is a most unusual one in that we have an amendment from the Seanad, amended in Committee of the whole Dáil, and we have an amendment in my name proposed on Report Stage which I have just moved, we having accepted, on Committee Stage, the Minister's amendment since ours was not accepted at that time.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposed to the amendment agreed by Committee of the whole Dáil is to delete all words after &ldquo;provisions&rdquo;, in other words, that an order shall not be made under subsection (1) in respect of any of the following sections, namely, sections 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 15, 16, 18 and 19 until &ldquo;provisions&rdquo;&mdash; deleting all words thereafter and substituting the following:</P>

    <P>I should point out that our approach to this Bill has been consistent, critical and constructive from the outset.  In principle we accepted its main purpose.  We went on to propose amendments we considered essential to provide balance between the new powers sought by the Minister and the rights and liberties of citizens.</P>
    <P>As we know, crime reached record levels in 1983.  Indeed in parts of this capital city the Garda are virtually under seige in certain circumstances.  In our view, indeed in the view of both sides of the House, a strengthening of the law will help the Garda in their difficult task.  We accept this proposition in principle, that a strengthening will be of assistance to the Garda.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1978" /> We especially welcome the provisions allowing for majority verdicts in certain cases and for the giving of notices of alibis within a prescribed period.  We also welcome the provision for consecutive sentences for crimes committed by persons while on bail and the introduction of a new offence of failure to surrender to bail.  Those provisions had the support of all sides of the House.  Of course we endeavoured to have the granting of bail to persons accused of drug trafficking and distribution reserved to the High Court but the Minister rejected that proposal. We believe also that the introduction of proof by written statement will save countless hours of Garda time in court, hence leaving them freer to tackle crime on our streets and among our communities.</P>
    <P>Our main concern is with the sections of the Bill providing for the arrest and detention of persons, without being charged, for periods of six, 12 or up to 20 hours.  This represents a total new departure from our law, with the exception of the Emergency Powers and the Offences Against the State Acts which are confined to subversive activities.  Once the Minister's proposals become law it will mean that a citizen can be arrested on the suspicion of a member of the Garda Síochána, subsequently be detained for up to 20 hours in a Garda station for questioning, that questioning, of course, being limited to a maximum period of 12 hours, two six-hour periods.</P>
    <P>Originally those powers could be applied to any child from the age of seven upwards.  However, in the course of the Dáil discussions the Minister accepted our amendment to the effect that all children under 12 years of age ought to be excluded.  Indeed we even wondered whether that age should be 14 and the Minister gave an undertaking to consider that matter.  Nevertheless the age finishes up at 12.  The Minister agreed also that the provisions with regard to arrest and detention would apply for a limited trial period of four years only.  Again that has been agreed by the House.</P>
    <P>From the outset we also insisted on two other major provisions, namely, <Col N="1979" /> adequate safeguards for persons who were detained in custody and that a formal independent complaints procedure be introduced.  We advanced the safeguards we felt should be included in or which should accompany the Bill.  The Minister was in agreement with many of the safeguards we proposed but originally he would not include them in the Bill, nor would he allow them be discussed with the Bill.  We had several discussions about this aspect in the course of the passage of the Bill through this House.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year we also put forward a draft complaints procedure.  Here again the Minister insisted originally on having the Bill passed before he would consider any proposals for such a complaints procedure. The Minister would give us verbal assurances only that he would introduce safeguards at a later date. However, the subsequent Seanad debate forced the Minister to change his stance and thinking.  We have now a formal commitment from the Minister which of course is wholeheartedly welcomed in this House because it represents the kind of commitment we first wanted included in the Bill.  However, we would have preferred that the complaints procedure and the relevant safeguards would have been discussed with the Bill.  We believed that to be the right approach, that before taking the decisions which have not been taken in the Bill, those safeguards should have been considered, discussed fully in the context of the Bill and its consideration in this House.</P>
    <P>I should say that the minds of many Members of this House at that time were attuned to the whole problem &mdash; they were familiar with the law, with the realities of the law, the Minister had explained many of them and we had endeavoured to tease out many on Committee Stage. Therefore, Members were fully versed on and familiar with the situation throughout the passage of the Bill.  In that sense it was a suitable time to consider such safeguards and complaints procedure in the context of the Bill and of the new powers being provided therein. However, the Minister would not do this <Col N="1980" /> but now he has given us a firm commitment that sections 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 15, 16, 18 and 19 will not come into effect until certain provisions are introduced.</P>
    <P>We have always insisted that increased powers for the Garda must be balanced by adequate safeguards for the citizens. A person in custody must have access to a solicitor and should be provided with a custodial guardian or member of the station not connected with the investigation who will see to it that the person is treated humanely and in accordance with the regulations.  As they stand, the Minister's proposals discriminate positively against the poor and underprivileged.  If a person has the money he can call a solicitor who will advise him of and protect his rights.  We know from experience that this is a very important friend or aide to have if one finds oneself in a situation like this.  Many people engaged in a life of crime are very familiar with the system and will ensure that they have a solicitor available, but the many innocent people who will obviously be taken in and questioned under the powers of this Bill may not know that they have a right to a solicitor.  However, if they know and have a solicitor present, their position will be safeguarded.  We have heard in this House that, if a solicitor phones or lets it be known that he or she has an interest in the person in custody, that can have a beneficial effect for that person.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill we still have the problem of a person who does not have the money to employ a solicitor; and since the free legal aid does not apply until a person is charged, a person will be at a great disadvantage.  This serious discrimination must be removed before the new powers are applied.  That is one of the very strong reasons we support the amendment from the Seanad as amended by the Minister.  This is a very serious implication of this Bill.  While the Minister might not yet have found a means of dealing with this problem, I trust he is anxious to find a practical solution to it. Nevertheless, we cannot extend powers or introduce these measures unless we can ensure that those who are less privileged will have an equal opportunity <Col N="1981" /> before the law.  This discrimination must be removed before the new powers are applied and I trust the Minister will bear that in mind when he is considering the safeguards which will be included in the regulations.</P>
    <P>Special safeguards will also have to be provided for the mentally handicapped. Among the other safeguards which we consider necessary are provisions for informing the person detained of the offence of which he is suspected.  We felt that was very important because if a note has been taken of the initial offence one can feel fairly happy that the person has been taken into custody on reasonable grounds.  It is important that this information be recorded so that the reasonable grounds can be clearly seen to have existed.  We see the Minister introducing safeguards in the regulation covering the following: the keeping of records, the length of questioning time, not more than four hours, providing the person with material for note-taking, the provision of some form of electronic or other recording device, and not removing personal belongings, except where necessary because a person might feel out of place.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for an independent procedure for investigating and adjudicating on complaints against members of the Garda Síochána.  The Minister will be aware from recent experience that there is a need to have an independent complaints procedure but, given the new powers being introduced, there is even a greater need.  Now is the time to deal objectively with this issue.  There have been allegations of heavy-handed interrogations. We have available to us the very valuable Ó Briain report with recommendations both for persons in custody and for the Garda.  We have also pointed to the widespread public concern regarding the unsolved Kerry baby death and the interrogation and death of a citizen in Shercock Garda station, County Cavan.  Both of these incidents cry out for an independent inquiry mechanism.</P>
    <P>We have seen other examples which suggest that a minority of gardaí have misused the trust placed in them by their colleagues, by the Oireachtas and by <Col N="1982" /> members of the public at large.  In the interests of the Garda, the public and the politicians we believe that the new complaints procedure must be independent and be seen to be so.  We propose an independent complaints commission which would be outside political, ministerial or other interference, and I mention particularly the different kinds of interference and not just outside the Garda Síochána.  We went so far as to introduce this draft complaints procedure early in the year.  We do not propose that it was in any way perfect, but it was a reasonably comprehensive draft document which could have formed the basis for a full discussion on this subject.  I find it very hard to see why this suggestion could not have been taken up, developed and modified where necessary.  If this had been done we would now have a complaints procedure and the provisions which are seen to be so urgently needed could go into operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come half way to meet our proposals.  His latest amendment provides for adjudication by a body other than the Garda Síochána but the investigation is still not under the direction or control of the independent body. Until both the investigation and adjudication of complaints are under independent direction and control we will not be satisfied. The Minister's amendment provides for adjudication by a body other than the Garda Síochána and says:</P>
    <P>In the third line all words after &ldquo;investigation&rdquo; deleted and the following substituted therefor:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;of complaints from the public against members of the Garda Síochána not above the rank of chief superintendent and the adjudication by a body other than the Garda Síochána of such complaints have been enacted by the Oireachtas and have come into operation and until regulations under section 7 have been made&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister is talking about a body other than the Garda Síochána.  Why single out the Garda?  Why not &ldquo;other than the <Col N="1983" /> Minister&rdquo;?  Why not &ldquo;other than the Department of Justice&rdquo;?  Why not &ldquo;other than the politicians&rdquo;?  Why not just &ldquo;independent and free from outside interference of any kind, whether from the Garda, from the Minister, from the Department, from politicians or from the Oireachtas as a whole&rdquo;?  The complaints procedure must be seen to be independent and totally free from outside interference. We are saying that all ranks, including senior officers of the Garda, must be subject to the complaints procedure just as civil servants must answer before the Ombudsman in respect of complaints from the public.  The Garda deserve a true and impartial body so that they can be assured of justice and fair play.  This applies in both directions because any member of the Garda would be given objective and even-handed treatment which would not be related to the exigencies of time, moods, pressures or anything else.  I do not wish to go into individual cases but one can think of some that would be relevant at this point. When such cases arise, cases that evoke major publicity, it is difficult to appreciate that fair and objective treatment could be meted out in the absence of an independent procedure.  There is a danger of over-reaction in some cases and of under-reaction in others.  That is why the procedure must be independent.  We must have a procedure that will be fair to the gardaí in question and to the citizen. So far as citizens are concerned, they may often have to be told that they do not have a complaint but in such circumstances we would be able to stand over that decision if we had an independent body.</P>
    <P>The same situation applies in respect of the Ombudsman.  In up to 80 or 90 per cent of cases brought to his attention, it may transpire that the complainant has no case against the civil servant concerned. That situation is very good from the point of view both of civil servants and politicians.  We can all rely on the independence of the Ombudsman. Nobody, by innuendo or otherwise, can take from the independence of his office.</P>
    <P>This important Bill is now passing but <Col N="1984" /> the much needed extra powers are being suspended.  They are being suspended by way of this amendment despite our having heard so much about the urgency of providing those powers and of the effect they could have in terms of combating crime.  I am aware that some people here have put the opposite view but the official view was that there was an urgent need for these powers.  The powers are being suspended because the Minister, for some reason, wishes to have the new powers of arrest and detention agreed before putting the two trump cards on the table, the complaints procedure and the safeguards.  It is for the Minister to decide what his strategy is to be but it is clear that there was a difference of opinion within the Cabinet about the powers the Minister was seeking.  That was obvious from the day on which the Bill was introduced because it was accompanied by two explanatory memoranda. Obviously, there were second thoughts at the last moment on the lines that some form of independent body or procedure would have to accompany the legislation. That would appear to have come from the Cabinet just before the Bill was presented to the House.  It was an unusual and odd procedure for the Bill to have been accompanied by two explanatory memoranda.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the strategy all along has been, &ldquo;Give me the powers first and then I will talk to you about safeguards and about other measures such as the complaints procedure&rdquo;.  I cannot come to any conclusion other than that.  At least now it is being provided that the powers will not be implemented until the complaints procedure is available.  This is the unsatisfactory position in which the House finds itself.  We must be suspicious of the Minister's motive in that regard.  That is why we want our amendment to be supported.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that in our amendment we are talking about an independent complaints commission and about the provision of adequate safeguards.  We are talking also about members of the force at all levels being subject to the complaints procedure.  There can be no going back on these basic requirements.  They <Col N="1985" /> must be fundamental to our approach to this Bill.  That is why, having disposed of the Committee Stage, we considered it necessary and proper to wait a few days before taking the Report Stage so that we might consider this point.  Having considered it, we considered it necessary to emphasise the importance of these two requirements.  We would have been far happier if the Minister's proposals in these matters had been put before the House before the completion of the Bill so as to give some indication of what he was thinking.</P>
    <P>We know that legislation alone will not solve the crime problem.  The House is saying that the powers will be suspended until the safeguards I speak of are provided but the Garda say that the powers will be suspended until adequate resources are provided, including much needed additional training.  In that sense, the powers are being doubly suspended. However, our job is now complete and we can only hope that it will not be too long before the Minister puts his detailed proposals before us.  Let no one say that the House delayed the Bill unnecessarily. We can do no more with it until such time as the Minister has brought forward these other proposals.  The powers are not to be put into operation as a result of our not succeeding in having the Minister put details of these other measures before the House.</P>
    <P>We can do no more until the Minister gets his homework up to date.  We can only stand and wait for him to come forward with these measures.  The Minister excludes from the tribunal members of the Garda Síochána from the rank of chief superintendent up.  I wonder if some recent events have not warned the Minister that it might be wise to bear in mind that ranks above that of chief superintendent should be included.  After all, the instructions will come from the top and go down the line and it is therefore difficult to understand why those giving the instructions would not be subject to the procedures.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate Fianna Fáil <Col N="1986" /> have been critical, consistent and constructive, deliberately in our determination to contribute to the defeat of crime in Ireland.  We did not always have the support of The Workers' Party, who are totally against the giving of these powers in any event.  We are prepared to go along with this on the trial basis which the Minister is pursuing, once we have the safeguards and the complaints procedures. We have adopted this strategy deliberately in our determination to contribute to the defeat of crime in Ireland. We will continue in this manner so as to secure the maximum effectiveness of the Garda and the maximum protection for the lives and property of all the citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods made a point in relation to the extension of the complaints procedure to all ranks.  Has the Minister considered the implications of excluding any ranks above that of chief superintendent?  Each garda, from the day he comes out of Templemore, has an authority and responsibility vested in him by law.  The implication of excluding any ranks, which would vindicate them in many cases, could be interpreted as suggesting that below a certain rank gardaí are capable of being less than effective in discharge of their functions, but above a certain rank this does not apply.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister would not want to make such an implication but if we are to have a complaints procedure for the Garda Síochána I cannot see any garda enjoying the drawing of a barrier at a certain point.  We all have respect for senior officers but the real test of any officer is that he should not be above examination and scrutiny.  The same applies, of course, to politicians, Ministers of State and Deputies.  I am asking the Minister to consider the implications and the innuendos of this drawing of the line.  As I have said, each garda has a certain authority vested in him by law once he leaves Templemore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all concerned with the rights of all citizens who are guaranteed under the Constitution to have their fundamental rights upheld and vindicated, and the Garda are charged with discharging that <Col N="1987" /> role.  We are concerned with the majority of the citizens from the point of view of their well-being and welfare.  In this complaints procedure does the Minister envisage that it would include complaints by citizens other than those who would be taken to Garda stations and subjected to questioning?  We often hear complaints relating to the fact that prosecutions were not taken against people, particularly for offences against old and infirm people in their homes, elderly shopkeepers.  Complaints have been made but action has not been taken by the Garda.</P>
    <P>I am aware of cases in which prosecutions were not taken &mdash; I have been given this knowledge by a very responsible authority &mdash; although there was evidence of identification against those concerned. The vast majority of people are anxious to be able to trust the Garda but if they find that action is not taken on genuine complaints which affect the citizens who are supposed to be protected by this Bill there must be serious concern.  Can the protection of this complaints procedure be extended to all citizens, particularly to older people who may not be protected adequately?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reassured to hear that.  It is vitally important in the interests of both the force and the citizens that any citizen will be able to make a complaint for examination.  My final point refers to the understandable frustration of the Garda when in many cases they brought prosecutions and secured convictions and sentences to see that these sentences are not served.  The Garda go though painstaking investigations to bring cases to court.  They get all the evidence and eventually secure convictions.  It is regrettable that in some cases the Judiciary are not consistent in their sentencing.  That is a matter of public record.  However, when criminals are sentenced how many of them actually are sent to serve their sentences?  How many of them have those sentences <Col N="1988" /> reduced or are released?  We are concerned about complaints against the Garda but we must understand why the Garda are frustrated when people have been convicted but are released because of lack of adequate accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment put down by Deputy Woods and do so in the hope that it will expedite finality in respect of the discussion which has taken place over an extended period and which has had such an effect on the community.  I hope the discussion here on what I regard as a <Col N="1989" /> break on the machine will not be interpreted as the main purpose of it.</P>
      <P>Every speaker prefaces his remarks by saying that the need exists in the time and world we live in for protection of people in the street so that they can live their lives in relative peace and harmony. That is being eroded with each day that goes by.  At every meeting we, as public representatives, attend we are implored and beseeched by people for God's sake to do something.</P>
      <P>Previous Governments were aware of the need for this legislation.  We on this side are not doing justice to our spokesman who has given so much time and effort to an examination of this legislation in appearing to hold up its implementation. If it is not implemented the people whom we represent will continue to live in anxiety and their lack of faith in us will increase.</P>
      <P>One word of warning I would express refers to the complaints tribunal.  We talk about the freedom of people.  We are concerned that no act, deed or omission by a member of the Garda should have a detrimental effect on the citizen.  We must also accept and ensure that no act or deed by us will react on the freedom of the Garda.  I hope time will prove me wrong but I fear the concentration which has been given to the complaints tribunal and the alleged need for protection is being accepted by the Garda as the refined acceptance by us of a lobby in this and other countries which alleges police brutality.  We do not accept it in so many words but because of the reservations expressed by speaker after speaker it can be accepted by any reasonable member of the Garda as acceptance by us that they have been guilty <i>en bloc</i> of all the charges made against them.  As a result of that we will get poor value for the tremendous investment of taxpayers' money in the Garda Síochána.  All worthwhile progress and all greatness is achieved where there is employment of imagination, adventure, initiative and industry.  Without that we have something which is useless and insipid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we told any employee, be they doctor, bus conductor, lawyer, dentist or <Col N="1990" /> teacher that our faith in them was such that we must monitor, record and photograph everything they do in the vital area of their dealing with the person whom we call the patient, would they interpret that as an indication of our faith in them? Do we expect that will encourage them to use the elements necessary if we are to have progress and get value for money?  It should go out from this House that we are discussing this on the assumption that the need for its employment will be rare and that we do not want it to be interpreted by 99 per cent of the Garda as any lack of faith, confidence or trust in them.</P>
    <P>Any legislature can make all the laws they like.  What use are they if the spirit of the legislation is not implemented? We live in a free society.  There are no mechanisms here by which we can insist that any member of the Garda does what he or his association would regard as improper.  If there is I should like someone to explain it.  We heard Deputy Shatter last week questioning the right of the spokesman for the Garda Sergeants and Insepectors Association to make any comment.  I do not know what formula Deputy Shatter has or what kind of State he envisages that we could force on any body of men or women terms and conditions which would put their profession and livelihood at risk.  Rather do I fear &mdash; this is why I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment &mdash; that every hour we spend on this legislation, especially that which obliges us to refer to the omissions and appalling inadequacies of some members of the Garda &mdash; the incidence is no greater than in any other profession &mdash; will be construed by some as our not having faith in the Garda.  One could argue that the nature of the work in other professions is more vital to life.</P>
    <P>I do not know how we are going to assure them that we have faith in them and that they are the best Garda force in any free society.  I do not envy those states which adopt a different attitude to their police force, where they work to <i>diktats</i> and must accept them or opt out. That is not the tradition in the Garda Síochána, nor is it the tradition of Governments here towards the Garda.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1991" /> We gaily assume that the 11,000 men and women of the Garda will be happy to dance to any tune which we play in this House irrespective of the embarrassment or risk at which it puts them.  However, that impression has gone out from the House and is being interpreted by the Garda as our acceptance of what some people refer to day in and day out as police brutality.  One would imagine that every member of the Garda was a sadist, someone who took pleasure in occasioning pain to a citizen.  We all know that is not the position and it is necessary that there should be balance in any debate here.</P>
    <P>Everybody should ponder the psychological reaction of every member of the Garda to all the words that are being spoken here.  Let us be honest and admit that we seem to be accepting that this great protection for our citizens against the Garda is required when everybody knows that the real protection a citizen wants is against his fellow man who interferes with his freedom to go about his daily business, as is his right in a free society.  In my constituency last night every second person I met was telling me about something that had happened which was injurious to his person or property and about which nothing seems to be done.  What is the point in talking about anything if we are going to make it appear to the Garda on whom we depend so much, that we do not have the necessary faith or confidence in them?</P>
    <P>I said here last week &mdash; and I was misinterpreted &mdash; that I was happy to leave the Civil Service because I realised I would never get into trouble for what I did not do and that it did not suit my nature.  I do not think it suits the nature of most people.  As a result of this legislation I hope we are not going to have a Garda force which can legitimately interpret what we have done here as an exercise which encourages them in the belief that they will never get into trouble or be brought before a complaints tribunal for what they have not done.  If that is going to be the interpretation of the Garda force to what we are doing, we are all the <Col N="1992" /> poorer and the legislation to which we have given so much time and have looked at so painstakingly will not be successful.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Woods for applying himself to this matter in a manner that has excelled any other spokesman.  I accept that the Minister also realises the need for this legislation.  The Minister is correct in his approach and so is Deputy Woods.  Let us guard against having as a result what happened in ancient Greek tragedy: an apparent conflict of two rights leading to a situation where the product is going to be much less attractive then we had hoped for and dispelling the optimism which we all had about legislation so urgently needed but which will be called into question because of the eternal emphasis on what I said earlier in regard to the brake on the machine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between the amendment now before the House as a result of Committee Stage is an improvement on the Minister's amendment and can be broken into three or four areas. In this amendment we are talking about investigating members of all ranks of the Garda Síochána.  We are also retaining the phrase &ldquo;by or under the direction of an independent Complaints Commission&rdquo;. On the regulations, we are adding the phrase &ldquo;providing for adequate safeguards under section 7&rdquo;.  The section which seems to be unsatisfactory to the Minister which was in his own amendment covered by &ldquo;regulations having been made&rdquo; is incorporated in the phrase &ldquo;approved by the Oireachtas and made by the Minister&rdquo;.  That seems to be a slight improvement.  In relation to the regulations &ldquo;approved by the Oireachtas and made by the Minister&rdquo; providing for adequate safeguards, I presume they relate to detainees and in that respect it is an important improvement on the previous amendment because an input in the regulations will obviously be made by members of the Garda who will naturally be safeguarding the interests of their members.  They are perfectly right to do that, and in the same way we should try to safeguard as far as possible those people who are likely to be detained and <Col N="1993" /> questioned.  If we can have regulations which provide for adequate safeguards under section 7 than we will have added further protection for the Garda.</P>

      <Col N="1994" /> Surveys of housing conditions, the assessment of the adequacy of the supply of housing and of the prospective future demand for housing, and the adoption of a building programme having regard to housing needs are matters for each housing authority.

      <P>It is the statutory duty of a housing authority to assess the housing needs in their functional area having regard to the capital available.  Capital is allocated on the basis of claims from local authorities in respect of their existing commitments as at 1 January of each year and in respect of new works which it is hoped to commence during the year.  A review of the capital position of all local authorities is being undertaken by my Department at the moment and the position of Galway County Council will be considered in conjunction with other local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The taking in charge of roads is a matter for the local authority in accordance with section 2 of the Local Government Act, 1953, and I have no function in the matter.  A block grant is paid annually by my Department to road authorities towards the improvement and maintenance of public roads in their areas.  The selection of priorities in this respect would be a matter for the road <Col N="1997" /> authority.  The block grant for Dublin County Council in the current year is £786,000.</P>
      <P>I understand from Dublin County Council that the completion of Grange Abbey estate and its roads has been the subject of protracted legal proceedings against the developer, who is in receivership, and that agreement has finally been reached between the developer's legal representatives and the local authority to convey all the residual lands in the Grange Abbey estate to the county council.  Pending finalisation of the necessary legal and technical details involved in the conveyancing of the lands, the agreement gives the county council a right of entry and I have been informed that the county council are proceeding with all the necessary arrangements to move in and commence remedial works on roads, sanitary services and open spaces as soon as possible.</P>

Will the Minister indicate if he is prepared to favourably consider transferring responsibility for these waterways to the local authority in the event of the local authority making a formal request, which I understand they are prepared to do?</P>

      <P>I would be prepared to consider any representation made to me on the basis of such a local consideration. The Deputy mentioned the year 1860 but my information is that it was 1856 when the Drainage Act was enacted.  I must tell the Deputy that I have no information in my Department about the Galway Mills Trustees.  I have made inquiries of Galway Corporation and I understand that the functions of the Galway Mills Trustees were set out under that Drainage Act, 1856, 5 and 6 Vict., C. 89, an amending Act for most of the minor channels concerned.  I have given the Deputy an undertaking that I will consider any proposals put to me.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware <Col N="2007" /> a wide range of housing considerations have taken place since I took office.  A whole plethora of housing initiatives were considered including ones under which local authorities would have the choice as to how they house those on their housing lists.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed to hear the Minister say that he would not favour joint ownership.  Is the Minister aware that many people who have SDA loans, through no fault of their own but as a result of redundancies and changes in their circumstances, are unable to meet loan repayments?  Many local authorities are faced with having to make a decision to either take over the houses and permit those people in as tenants or allow the arrears to mount up.  Is it not a better idea when people are unable to meet their repayments that there should be a system to help them bearing in mind that it is not possible to extend the term of the mortgage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>What method is the Minister suggesting?  Local authorities have two options, to permit the owner to continue with arrears &mdash; that would result in an impossible position &mdash; or take over the house which they are entitled to do under the terms of the mortgage.</P>

I believe that while charges are being withheld in certain cases, mainly in the larger urban centres &mdash; and that this is being encouraged and promoted by certain interests &mdash; there is wide and increasing public recognition and acceptance that the charges are necessary and reasonable.  People who do not pay the charges which are legally due are, of course, sponging off others in this respect as well as undermining local service standards and employment.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In making the order I gave full and careful consideration to the evidence presented at the public local inquiry and the report of the person who held the inquiry, including evidence in relation to the effect of the proposal on farmers.

In these circumstances would the Minister not have considered it appropriate that the changes in the extraction method as sought by the farmers would have been suitable?  Would he not agree also that the proposals put forward by the farmers were adequate and would have allowed the scheme to proceed along the lines which the council intended and that as a result of his failure to make any provision for the farmers' objections this scheme could be held up for several years more?</P>

      <P>Since last January, the number of temporary employees involved has been reduced from 314 to 159, mainly by assimilation into the corporation's normal workforce.  I have recently made a further allocation of £100,000 to the corporation, bringing to £1.7 million the grant assistance to the local authority this year towards the cost of employing the men concerned.  The additional allocation has been made on the basis that the corporation will retain the workers in employment, continue during 1985 with the policy of assimilating them into the permanent workforce, and assume full <Col N="2024" /> responsibility for the satisfactory resolution of the problem by the end of 1985, making appropriate provision in their estimates for that year.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice Bill, 1983 &mdash; Seanad Amendments: Report (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Seanad Amendment 1.</P>
    <P>In page 3, between lines 11 and 12, the following inserted:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) An order shall not be made under subsection (1) in respect of any of the following sections namely, sections 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 15, 16, 18 and 19 until provisions relating to the investigation and adjudication of complaints by the public against members of the Garda Síochána not above the rank of chief superintendent have been enacted by the Oireachtas and have come into operation and until regulations under section 7 have been made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment made by Committee of the whole Dáil to Seanad Amendment 1:</P>
    <P>In the third line all words after &ldquo;investigation&rdquo; deleted and the following substituted therefor:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;of complaints from the public against members of the Garda Síochána not above the rank of chief superintendent and the adjudication by a body other than the Garda Síochána of such complaints have been enacted by the Oireachtas and have come into operation and until regulations under section 7 have been made&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2051" /> Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;have been enacted by the Oireachtas for the investigation and adjudication of complaints from the public against members of the Garda Síochána by or under the direction of an independent Complaints Commission, and until regulations providing for adequate safeguards under section 7, have been approved by the Oireachtas and made by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Woods.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I was commenting on the differences between the amendments put down by Deputy Woods and the amendment passed by the House, having been moved by the Minister.  There were differences in three or four areas.  Deputy Woods has suggested that all ranks of Garda Síochána should be investigated up to and including that of the Commissioner whereas at the moment it is limited to ranks up to that of chief superintendent. At the moment the provision is that the investigation should be carried out by or under the direction of an independent complaints tribunal.  The Minister is in favour of a body other than the Garda Síochána and the amendment proposes that regulations providing for adequate safeguards under section 7 be approved. The suggestion is that these regulations be approved by the Oireachtas and made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are slight differences because the Minister's amendment earlier provided merely that the regulations be made.  In relation to the first of these amendments proposing that all ranks should be subject to the independent complaints tribunal the Minister gave some reasons why he thought it would not be desirable to have it applied above the rank of chief superintendent.  Perhaps <Col N="2052" /> the Minister envisaged that it would be proper to have a representative of the Commissioner on that body because he is the chief disciplinary officer and therefore it would not be right that he should be investigated, or any member above the rank of chief superintentent.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister is saying that the Garda would be investigated and therefore it is not appropriate that those above the rank of chief superintendent should be within the ambit of this complaints procedure.  If that were not so it seems to me that we should have a totally independent complaints commission.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the Minister's comments the last day.  He gave some indications as to what he was thinking about and what he had in mind when discussing a complaints procedure.  He gave a number of examples which I do not propose to discuss in any depth.  For example, he suggested that a seven man board should be acceptable to the House if there was a chief executive on it.  The Minister's examples are significant.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate in the past year comments have been made in the newspapers and by members of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and others in relation to that board.  If that is the kind of board envisaged it would not seem to me to be an independent board and I would be concerned that that is what we might end up with and that pressures will be applied in the future to have a board with members of the Garda on it.  It is stated in the official report, Volume 353, No. 7, columns 13 to 15, that the Minister referred to a seven man board with a chief executive officer.  He said that investigations should be carried out by Garda officers in the normal course of events under the supervision of the board and that the board should be able to give investigating officers such directions as would appear necessary in relation to each individual investigation.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed satisfaction at the amendment of Deputy Woods that such investigations should be under the control of the board.  That does not appeal to me.  Even though the board <Col N="2053" /> would be set up and have representatives of the Commissioner it would be up to the Garda to make the investigation.  That would not be satisfactory, given their history to data.  He concedes that there would be occasions when it would be in the public interest for people other than members of the Garda Síochána to investigate a case.  He said that he could envisage a situation, and hoped the House would accept it, where the chief executive officer would have the power on the direction of the board to investigate a complaint or cause it to be investigated by appointing an appropriate person to do so.  He also suggested that the chief executive officer or the board could investigate a complaint and discuss minor complaints which, with the consent of the complainant need not go through a long rigmarole if it could be informally sorted out.  He differentiated between criminal charges and those leading to disciplinary procedures within the Garda.  He maintained that it was proper to have a representative of the Commissioner on that board.  He acknowledged Deputy Taylor's appeals procedure.</P>
    <P>If that is what is in the Minister's mind it is a long way from an independent complaints tribunal.  There would be a lot of trouble ahead for us if we were to accept such a tribunal.  This amendment is vital, even at this stage of the Bill, to make it clear that we have not conceded that it should be a less than independent complaints tribunal after all that was said about the protection necessary for detainees and for the Garda.  In the last few weeks the Garda have commented publicly on their legitimate concerns.  All these matters must be taken into consideration. The Minister said we were talking about the Commissioner, a couple of Deputy Commissioners and six or seven Assistant Commissioners.  If his suggestion was carried through there would be a difficulty if there was Garda involvement in the adjudicating process.  The Commissioner is the chief disciplinary officer of the force.  The Minister thinks it would be inappropriate to investigate those senior ranks.  I do not think he means that because they are of senior <Col N="2054" /> rank they cannot be investigated by the board.  He suggested that it was a matter for the Government to investigate complaints against senior members of the Garda.  I do not know if that would be satisfactory, given the history of allegations of political interference made in this House and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Recent statements have caused the Garda to worry about the direction in which this Bill and the amendments are carrying them.  That is a legitimate worry and there is good reason for expressing it.</P>
    <P>The occasions on which it is in the public interest to have investigations carried out by people who are not members of the Garda Síochána are not rare.  That is the problem.  This would be the norm rather than the exception.  That is why I do not think the provision is a good one. Judging by the comments made by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, the articles published in <i>The Irish Times</i> some months ago about the format of the complaints tribunal and the comments made by the Minister they would seem to indicate that that is what is proposed. It is a disappointment to the Members of the House and for those who have taken an interest in the debate and also for those who have appealed for an independent tribunal.  I hope we do not lose track of an independent complaints tribunal. There will be a lot of pressure brought to bear on the Minister and on us all to have a strong Garda involvement in any complaints procedure that will come about in the future.  With the Bill slotted away somewhere it will be hard to resist that.  I hope that is not the reason the Minister did not bring in the complaints procedure before the Bill was passed.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the last issue of the <i>Garda Review</i> to that matter.  In the October issue of the <i>Garda News</i> it states:</P>
    <P>What is now important is to ensure that the Regulations to be introduced allow the Bill to work effectively and do not militate against the interests or welfare of the members concerned. <Col N="2055" /> The same goes for the new complaints system.</P>
    <P>It refers also to negotiations going on between the Garda conciliation and arbitration body and the Department of Justice.  It states that the problem is that:</P>
    <P>Even if agreement on a new system can be obtained ... as a result of its subsequent passage through the Oireachtas as a Bill, the eventual outcome might well be quite different to what the gardaí had peviously agreed to... key amendments might also be incorporated into the complaints Bill.  If this were to be the case it would place the gardaí in a most invidious position...</P>
    <P>The Minister is now faced with the unenviable task of balancing the legitimate rights both of the gardaí and the legislature with regard to both of these important matters.  In so doing he has the close and constant ear of the legislators. He may not therefore be aware of the strength of feeling that is building up on these issues within the Garda Síochána ...</P>
    <P>The same restraint cannot be expected on the complaints Bill.  This is a matter of immediate vital interest to each and every member of the force and it is encumbent upon their representatives to ensure that any new system does not unduly militate against those interests.</P>
    <P>That puts the onus on us to ensure that it does not militate either against detainees or people in custody or detention. The approach which the representatives of the Garda body and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors have taken during the last few weeks has been very progressive, mature and responsible. It is in their best interests and they have been perfectly right.</P>
    <P>Sergeant Michael Murray, a representative of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, said a couple of weeks ago that they did not want the sections of the Bill to come into law until facilities were available to the Garda to <Col N="2056" /> carry them out properly and until facilities were there to protect their members from any accusations or abuses which might occur because of not having proper technology and facilities at their disposal. The same member was quoted in last night's <i>Evening Herald</i> as saying that it is time that Garda management did their job properly.  Although the paper mentioned a broadside against Commissioner Wren, I do not think any accusation was levelled against him.  Sergeant Murray mentioned the management and the Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner and chief superintendents.  He said that the gardaí on the street were suffering because of the failure of top management to face up to their responsibilities.  Where did this responsible response and awakening come from?  I think the response came from very small beginnings in this House and the Garda see themselves in a very awkward position now because they could be the scapegoats as a result of the manner in which this is being tackled. Obviously they have given deep thought to what has been happening and other Members and I, who had been accused in the early part of this campaign, now seem to be vindicated because we showed balance and tried to get the thing right.</P>
    <P>From the comments the Minister made last week, I wonder if he really does want an independent complaints tribunal because it has been discussed with the Garda associations by the Department of Justice.  The Garda are talking about a very heavy involvement and say they must participate in any complaints tribunal. They say it will be resisted and they talk about the strength of feeling and that the same restraint cannot be expected in the complaints Bill.  When the complaints Bill is isolated, will we be able to protect and safeguard the honest citizen?  That is what I am concerned about and the wording in the amendment providing for adequate safeguards is important and necessary phraseology to incorporate in the Bill and I hope it will be taken in the spirit in which it is proffered.</P>
    <P>I will resist the temptation to go into any depth on the individual examples which the Minister gave.  I will reserve it <Col N="2057" /> until the complaints Bill comes before the House but I will make a brief comment on some of them.  In the example he gave that investigations should be carried out by Garda officers in the normal course of events, it is the normal course of events which have given rise to complaints. Going about one's business in the normal way is an everyday occurence and that is what Garda activity is all about.  Perhaps we will have time to go into that in more depth so that we can come up with a better balance.</P>
    <P>Will the body be laying down further regulations in regard to investigations to be carried out?  In other words, if there is a body other than the Garda Síochána instructing members of the Garda Síochána to carry out an investigation, are they going to lay down regulations, instructions or guidance for the Garda to carry out those investigations?  How much credence can the public give to those instructions and how can one ensure they are followed?  The body is weakened by being set up in that way and it will not work.  I think it was Deputy O'Dea who said it would fail and I agree with him.  I know the Minister was only throwing out suggestions but because of the close attention we have paid to the passage of this Bill over the last few months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but because of the close attention we have paid, the number of times that the Minister talked about the complaints tribunal mentioned in the amendment over the past year and because of the negotiations going on and confirmed in the <i>Garda News</i> which have been mentioned publicly by representatives of the Garda, we know that this will be the format.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had to trust the Minister's promises about the complaints tribunal and, for that reason, it is a little unfair that we could not be entrusted with the same amount of information and guidelines which the Garda have been entrusted with.  As in the case of the Bill we will <Col N="2058" /> get them secondhand or even older.  They warn us they are going to have another crack at it to ensure that the same thing does not happen with regard to the complaints tribunal as happened in the Bill, that there will not be an opportunity for amendments because they were unhappy with the amendments made in the Bill.  Of course we reserve the right to discuss them in here and they do not deny us that right.  With regard to discipline within the force, the Commissioner can always receive the report of the independent body and if he wishes to carry out any disciplinary measures he can do so based on the report.  That is not a solid enough reason to have a representative of the Garda Síochána on the tribunal. It is significant that the Garda Síochána themselves have now become aware of the implications for them of passing through this legislation without looking at other things, for example, at the management of the Garda Síochána and the internal structures of the force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the complaints procedure.  It is significant that the Garda have suddenly become worried about the implications the tribunal may have for their members in respect of their careers and even their freedom because in certain instances if there are criminal implications the matter can be passed to the DPP.  It is very important that the other structures should be right in the first instance.  Only then can we talk about balance.  They are highlighting in a way we failed to do the need for proper research before new measures such as the complaints procedure are introduced. There is the following comment in the <i>Garda News</i> I wish to quote:</P>
      <P>It is in the interests of all concerned to ensure that the greatest possible degree of consultation and agreement is obtained prior to the publication of any proposed new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> A statement like that did not come from that publication when the Bill was introduced but now they are worried about the complaints tribunal and they have thrown out that warning.  They are quite right but it is a pity they did not do this when the Bill was introduced.  The <i>Garda News</i> also stated:</P>
    <P>This is a key moment in the history of the Garda Síochána and the criminal justice system in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The key moment has passed but this is a key moment for the Garda Síochána. There is also a warning to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The amendment put down by Deputy Woods talks about regulations providing for adequate safeguards.  May I comment on that?  The publication from which I quoted states that the Minister will need tact, diplomacy and courage to bring this chapter in modern Irish history to a reasonable conclusion.  We did not have that kind of encouragement when we were discussing the Bill but I am glad <Col N="2060" /> that the Garda have awakened to that fact.  However, it applies not only to the management of the Garda Síochána but also the Department of Justice.  The Garda force is under the aegis of the Department of Justice as are the prisons. Until those two institutions are sorted out satisfactorily and until the management structures work effectively, the Garda should be very wary of undertaking the responsibility they will have to undertake under this Bill.  The penny has dropped and they have approached this matter in a responsible way.  From small beginnings we have gone this far and I am glad of that.  We have succeeded in highlighting the major problems after a very shaky beginning because we never addressed the causes of crime when discussing the Bill.  Now the Garda are wondering what they have let themselves in for.  Their attitude is that if they are to be responsible for people in custody and if they are going to be subject to complaints and even to the criminal law they had better make sure everyone is doing their job, that they have proper structures, training, facilities, technology and procedures and that people in a position of authority will also be in a position of responsibility. The amendment in the name of Deputy Woods provides that members of the Garda Síochána of all ranks should be responsible to the complaints tribunal. Why should the Garda take the rap?  Why should the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors take the rap?  Why should a sergeant in charge of a Garda station be exposed to this measure?  Look at who is saying all of this &mdash; the person who is not supposed to be on their side.  I will be very pleased if the Garda Síochána pursue this line.  If the representatives pursue this line and insist that management manage, in order to protect them further they must ensure also something that we never look at and that we sweep under the carpet all the time.  They must ensure that the prison system is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, I will mention it once.  They should also be aware of the prisoners.  If they are not controlled they will be back on the streets and the pressure is on the Garda again who will be moving targets for them.  The prisons run entirely on the goodwill of the prisoners at the moment.  The structures are in a state of collapse.  The structure and organisation of the Garda have not changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Garda have any sense at all they will delay, as they said they would, until they consider their position carefully and realise that they could be the fall guys as a result of the passing of this legislation.  I think they are beginning to realise that.  It is not their fault. <Col N="2062" /> The fault lies in the way this legislation was brought into this House and it is only fair that they should be warned about it. We will do everything in our power to help and protect them from becoming fall guys or scapegoats of this inadequate legislation which was passed through without one look at the causes of crime.</P>
    <P>However, I am gratified that the Minister said that there is no question of the amendment excluding the right of the House to extend this procedure to any rank in the Garda Síochána.  Therefore, it is open for discussion, but unfortunately we will always come up against this unfortunate Whip which should be used more sparingly in cases such as this; then we might get better legislation.  I appeal that we have a totally independent complaints tribunal and that the thinking of the Minister should include other people's opinions.  Let us throw this out to the public, the experts, the researchers, the penologists and the criminologists and try to get this right.  Let us look around the world if necessary, as the Minister remarked has been done.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for us to provide safeguards bearing in mind the battle of words and the persuasion that will take place in the next few months between the Department, the Minister, the Garda, ourselves and the public.  Those safeguards must be incorporated into whatever the complaints procedures are, this from the point of view of the innocent party complaining.  In other words, I do not want to see the Bill weighted on the side of the Garda because that would make this whole exercise futile.  The fight that has taken place here and in the Seanad to have these amendments incorporated in the Bill which was resisted for eight months in this House and was finally conceded in the other House would be rendered futile also.  For reasons I will not go into now it is here before us, it is important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The amendment is before us, not the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the amendment which was accepted and not <Col N="2063" /> accepted previously.  There is a small safeguard about which I have not heard the Minister speak.  I hope he has taken into consideration the fact that we received these only this morning just before the debate.  He was not happy the last time about the wording of Deputy Woods's amendment in relation to the regulations and now he has incorporated both the phrases &ldquo;approved by the Oireachtas&rdquo; and &ldquo;made by the Minister&rdquo;. Therefore, it will not be just approved by the Oireachtas and lie there.  The Minister could accept that and I do not see any objection to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I compliment Deputy Woods on the tremendous detail he has gone into in this Bill and the unselfish way he has tackled it and the way even at this stage he can squeeze another measure of protection for everybody into this amendment by putting in the phrase &ldquo;providing for adequate safeguards&rdquo;.  I hope they will be accepted by the Minister.  I disagree with the phrase &ldquo;by or under the direction of an independent commission&rdquo; because I believe that gives the right to the commission to allow the Garda to investigate complaints.  Deputy Ger Connolly's impassioned plea for independence is ignored.  I am very sorry to see old stalwarts like Deputies David Andrews, De Rossa and Barnes cannot win and that we cannot make it totally independent.  I suspect that all along the intention has been not to have an independent complaints tribunal.  All during the year I noted the change in phraseology. First there was an independent complaints tribunal; then it developed into a strongly independent complaints tribunal, and I was glad to see the crack on the last day where the Minister gave nine examples, and with the help of Deputy Taylor I was able to add another which the Minister accepted, that is an appeals procedure.  He gave nine examples of what was in his mind.  Although he is a man of great intellectual ability, he was able to trot out these nine or ten examples one after the other.  When you string them together you find that they are not in isolation but they hold well <Col N="2064" /> together, as if someone had given great thought to the working out of the type of complaints tribunal that was in his mind and that we would see incorporated in the Bill in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised us that he would get it into the House as quickly as he could, but even though we were promised it all of last year, my advice now is to take it easy, do not push it now, let us think about it.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors have said that they do not want it now, hold on, do not let us have this section until we get other things right.  I am saying the same. Let us think about this.  I am not in any hurry and I do not think that the country is in any hurry to get these sections in. The Assistant Commissioner, John Paul McMahon, seems to think there is a drop in the number of drug related crimes. There is other evidence around of a drop in the crime rate and we should not rush into this.  Let us take this a little easy and get it right.</P>
    <P>I agree totally with the statement issued in recent weeks by Garda representatives, particularly the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.  Their statement was very cautious and gave the impression that they might well be the scapegoats for all of this.  If these sections are approved, and the complaints tribunal is approved and pushed through the House &mdash; the Whip is on and as a result it will go through &mdash; I am sure that it will not be to their benefit.  It is important for us to get this right now because if it will not be to their benefit it will not be to the benefit of the public.  The amendment, in essence, incorporates the amendment that was accepted on the last occasion. It tightens it up and provides another safeguard.  I recommend that the Minister accept it.</P>

      <P>It may seem to some Members who are not involved in the debate that we are flogging a dead horse.  In fact, it may seem to some of us who are deeply involved in it that we are flogging a dead horse.  Certainly, it is very near the post but we will have to flog it a little longer.  I am no great advocate of <Col N="2065" /> longwinded debates but the effect the long debate has had on the character of the Bill has shown the usefulness of Members getting involved and having a long debate.  Of course, it would not have been possible without the willingness of the Minister to listen to the debate. Having said that, I must state that I am sticking rigidly to my attitude to the Bill which is that it is unnecessary.  As the debate goes on I am more and more confirmed in that view.  A report in this morning's issue of <i>The Irish Press</i> confirms me even stronger in that view. In that issue the secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, Mr. Murray, commenting on Monday night's series of ramming incidents when a number of gardaí were brutally attacked by individuals in cars said when referring to the top management in the Garda:</P>
      <P>They have no plans for dealing with the crime wave and do not seem to have an idea in their heads how it should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>There was no co-ordinated plan for dealing with crime throughout the country but especially in the city areas, and no indication that the Commissioner, his assistants and the other top management people in headquarters were going to produce any such plan.</P>
      <P>Gardaí are using the same methods and the same antiquated systems of dealing with crime that have been used for decades, he said.</P>
      <P>Garda management has the responsibility for tackling these present day problems and it is time they started doing the job they are paid to do, Mr. Murray added.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an indication of the type of thinking among Garda representative bodies in relation to crime and yet we have been told time and again in this House that the reason crime is so bad is that we do not have laws strong enough to deal with it. I have just given a clear indication from a man who has many long years of Garda <Col N="2066" /> experience that a large portion of the problem is the management and planning within the Garda structure.</P>
    <P>There have been demands, and Deputy Tunney referred to them, in virtually every urban constituency &mdash; I do not know what the position is in rural constituencies but Garda crime statistics indicate that rural constituencies have fairly low levels of crime &mdash; to do something about crime.  To translate that into legislation that proposes to bring in detention and the other proposals in the Bill is a very simplistic approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that we cannot have a general debate on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that and I do not propose to go over all the Bill but I want to paint a picture.  What we are talking about today, and what we referred to on Committee Stage of this amendment, are safeguards for persons in custody.  The amendment is being introduced on the basis that the provisions of the Bill are so far-reaching that there is a need to ensure the safety of those who may be brought into custody. I will take that a little further and say that it is also necessary in order to protect the integrity of the Garda whose job it will be to implement the provisions of the Bill.  I understand the urgings of Deputy Skelly that the tribunal should not be rushed but it should be kept in mind that the need for the tribunal, or an independent complaints commission, or regulations concerning persons in custody or the surveillance of those in custody, pre-dated the existence of the Bill.  That is shown graphically in an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 28 October 1984 by Fintan O'Toole, a journalist with that newspaper, who went to the trouble of interviewing the three people who made up the Ó Briain Committee which came into existence not as a result of demands to deal with crime levels but as a result of demands for an investigation into allegations of misconduct by gardaí.  Dealing with safeguards for people in Garda custody that report states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2067" /> Mr. Justice Barra Ó Briain, who chaired the committee, said that he stood over the report and that he regarded the recommendation that there should be a &ldquo;custodial guardian&rdquo; to oversee the treatment of all arrested persons as the only effective safeguard.</P>
    <P>Ex-Commissioner Malone told <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> that &ldquo;a police force is ineffective without the support and esteem of the public and the recommendations we made were made with that in mind&rdquo;.  He knew from 45 years of police work that the force was of a high calibre generally, but that &ldquo;a force is only part of the society from which it is drawn and it will reflect all the attributes of that society, good and bad.  I do not believe that the society which the force reflects is a healthy society.</P>
    <P>Clearly he was implying that if the society is not a healthy one the Garda force cannot in all respects be regarded as healthy either.  That article continued:</P>
    <P>Increasing crime rates put pressure on individual gardaí to secure convictions and there was a temptation to resort to improper methods, the former Garda Commissioner noted. &ldquo;It was to prevent that sort of thing from happening that we made the recommendations that we did&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That report pre-dated the Criminal Justice Bill which we are talking about amending today.  Obviously there is a clear need for safeguards for people held in custody.  Every Member who has contributed to this debate has been at pains to contend that those safeguards are as important for the Garda themselves as for persons in detention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney spoke about people outside the House and of Garda brutality. The implication was that that was going overboard.  I would put this to Deputy Tunney for consideration: if he were informed that a man, an individual had attacked a young girl eight months pregnant, kicking her in the stomach, would he regard that as a brutal attack?  I have <Col N="2068" /> no doubt but that he would agree that it does constitute a brutal attack.  I have already explained to the House that that is a complaint I received in relation to a member of the Garda Síochána who attacked a private citizen in front of witnesses which complaint is at present being investigated.  That was a brutal attack; there is no other way of describing it. Therefore, we must not wear rose-tinted glasses when discussing the Garda.  Certainly a fairly large percentage of the Garda force are decent men and women who go about their task to the best of their ability, but it is a brutalising profession. They come into contact with all sorts of brutality in the course of their work which is bound to have an effect on elements within the force.  It would be foolish for us to assume that merely because an individual passed some kind of test entering the Garda force, during the 17 or 18 weeks training or whatever it is, that automatically for the remainder of their working lives they will be paragons of virtue and will not need to be controlled, disciplined or have imposed on them various methods of checking out their conduct or behaviour.</P>
    <P>In regard to this Bill and the amendments, I might point out that individual gardaí themselves, new recruits and longstanding members of the force interviewed about two weeks ago in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> saw gross inefficiencies and mismanagement within the force and were concerned about where the force was headed.</P>
    <P>As people involved in the introduction and passage of legislation in this House we must be concerned about the total reality outside, not merely with the demands that something be done.  We must interpret those demands and look searchingly at what means are available to us to deal with crime.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the neighbourhood watch and the fact that it appears to have been successful, to some degree at any rate, in the Finglas area, a development we wholeheartedly supported. We have also wholeheartedly supported the provisions of the Bill which enabled community work to form part of <Col N="2069" /> a sentence on offenders as a means of dealing with relatively minor offences. These are positive, progressive developments. To go overboard on the view that a tightening up of the law, of itself, in any severe way constitutes an answer would be to make a mistake and should be resisted at all costs.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister available to him information as to what extent the existing complaints procedure operated by the Garda themselves has been used by the public at large?  What level of complaints are received by the Garda and to what extent are such complaints pursued?  Furthermore, what is the outcome of such complaints?  It would be useful to have such information in deciding on what we should do in the future.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise the absolute necessity to ensure that any complaints procedure or tribunal ultimately passed by this house be seen by the public to be fully independent, both in their investigation of complaints and in their adjudication of them.  I happened to see a television programme last evening on Channel 4 concerning the complaints procedure in the United Kingdom, where there is in existence a lay complaints procedure. But apparently the police in the United Kingdom themselves investigate complaints.  There were a number of people interviewed in the course of that programme who deal with complaints, for example, citizens advice bureau spokespersons, representatives of the Council for Civil Liberties in the United Kingdom and so on, who indicated quite clearly that, even though there was in existence a lay complaints board, because the police themselves investigated such complaints there was no real credibility with regard to their effectiveness and that the people who lodged complaints were not convinced that their complaints would be adequately investigated or dealt with.  That was simply because the police themselves investigate such complaints although ultimately they would not have the final say in whether or not there would be an outcome.  Therefore it is fairly clear from experience in the United Kingdom, and indeed here, that it is essential that <Col N="2070" /> there be established an independent investigation or complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Woods's amendment seeks, it is also essential that the regulations to be introduced by the Minister under section 7 provide adequate safeguards. We are being asked to pass an amendment of this Bill without having seen such regulations.  The Minister should consider very carefully and deeply the implications of allowing the provisions of this Bill to be implemented &mdash; even with the complaints procedure and even with the regulations to be introduced under section 7 &mdash; unless he also introduces the regulations proposed in section 27 providing for electronic recording of questioning and so on.  In the interests of persons held in detention, in the interests of the Garda themselves, the provisions of the detention section should not be implemented without there having been fully implemented also the provisions of section 27.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been before the House for some time and has caused and evoked much comment and unease.  I believe there is an absolute necessity, indeed an onus on us as legislators to ensure that there are adequate laws to protect our citizens.  Furthermore, there should be a clear and proper system under which people who commit crimes of all types are both apprehended and ultimately brought to justice.  We have a duty to protect our people.  We have a similar duty to protect the guardians of our people under the civil law, the Garda Síochána.  We have all been proud of our Garda force.  We recognise the difficult conditions and constraints within which they work.  Recently two serious incidents in different parts of the country aroused, first, consternation and, second, unease and unrest among citizens and within the Garda force itself.  For those reasons this proposed amendment is of vital, primary importance in ensuring that both our people and police force have balanced protection within the confines of our law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see much balance or logic in <Col N="2071" /> Deputy Skelly's approach to the provisions of this Bill.  He has castigated the Minister, ridiculed the Bill&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, Deputy Skelly appeared to be totally in support of Deputy Woods's amendment.  We all have a duty to promote community and patriotic responsibility. As leaders of our people and elected legislators we have a duty to ensure that the root causes and the symptoms of crime and violence are diminished. However we must be logical and practical.  We must realise that, human nature being what it is, there is a necessity for law and order.  We as legislators are charged with the responsibility of providing adequate legislation.  The Government of the day in particular and the Minister for Justice in this instance must recognise that the evolution and development of human nature creates difficulties and we must ensure that our laws are updated to protect our people.  Deputy Skelly has failed to recognise these facts. As I said, he is totally in support of the amendment.  He spoke about the terrible Whip, which he tried to use as an excuse to hide behind, because he cannot give his support in a practical way.  If he is sincere in what he says, he has a duty to vote for this amendment.  Otherwise what he has said will be construed as both erroneous and hypocritical.</P>

      <P>The Bill affects all citizens from 12 years of age and upwards. This is a very varied group and their <Col N="2072" /> composition, intelligence and abilities are as varied as the people themselves.  It is natural that some of these people when in Garda custody would react with a natural fear and perhaps create an impression of guilt through their natural reaction, but we must protect these people.  Mentally and physically handicapped people might find themselves in difficulty.  They might not be able to speak for themselves or to communicate their problems and we must protect these people too.  We must also protect police officers who interrogate, investigate or deal with these people.  That is why this amendment is so important.</P>
      <P>The importance of protecting our police force and ensuring that they are efficient, independent and professional in their approach is of vital importance not alone to the force but to the people.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the independent complaints commission will be totally independent of the Garda Síochána to ensure the protection of the force, that it will be totally independent of the Minister of the day to ensure at no time will it be accused of being political or otherwise.  For the professional implementation of the law and to ensure that there is a balance of protection for the police force and for the people, I appeal to the Minister to accept this very important amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated earlier in the proceedings that the complaints commission was to be the subject of a separate measure to be debated in full before the Oireachtas.  That being so, I would have thought that the House would have been better served in reserving a large measure of the contributions until we knew exactly what the specific measures to be proposed would be.  To talk about an independent commission leaves open a myriad of interpretations. Frankly, in my view, it is impossible to say whether the commission would be independent until we know exactly the composition of the complaints commission. It could happen that the members of the complaints commission hearing a case would appear to be independent but <Col N="2073" /> there could be some unseen connection with a member of the Garda Síochána one of the members could be the Garda Commissioner's cousin.  Would that be an independent commission?  It is impossible to say if the commission is independent until we know exactly how it is made up.</P>
      <P>Has consideration been given to the number of likely complaints to be made to this commission?  Will there be five, ten, 100 or even more complaints each year?  Will the commission be in regular session or will it be called into session as and when required?  I reckon that the number of actual cases referred to it would be very few and there would not be regular and constant sittings.  I may be wrong, but I hope I am right.  The idea of having a new permanent structure set up with executive officers, administrative officers, administrative officers and an additional board with Civil Service staffs would be a quite an unnecessary additional expense on the already hard pressed taxpayers.  We have enough, and many would say more than enough, boards, executive officers, administrative officers and all the panoply that goes with them.  In my view there are enough existing staff who could be used when required at least in the initial stages to deal with matters that would be put to the complaints commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view is that a commission made up of two or three members would be perfectly adequate.  A possible composition of such a tribunal might be a district justice or a retired district justice of the District Court and a judge or retired judge of the Circuit Court together with an ombudsman.  At present we have the Ombudsman, but there is no reason why there should not be a further ombudsman attached to the main Ombudsman's office who would be seconded when required to the Garda complaints commission.  I can see no great objection, but I can see an advantage to having a senior Garda officer seconded to that commission, not as a member &mdash; I would object to that &mdash; but as an assessor to assist those conducting the inquiry with inside detailed knowledge of the workings of the Garda Síochána.  That could only add to the <Col N="2074" /> benefit and efficiency of the complaints commission and that would not derogate from the independence of the commission. The officer concerned would not have voting rights nor would he participate in the actual decision making, but he would assist in the inquiries the tribunal would have to make.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in all three amendments the word &ldquo;adjudication&rdquo; is used.  That connotes certain things.  It connotes that the tribunal will have the role of a court that would hear evidence and make judicial findings.  That would mean that there would have to be witnesses called for the complainant, that there would be witnesses, if required, for the respondent, the garda against whom the complaint was made, and that a judicial decision would have to be made.  We are given no indication as yet.  Presumably that will come in the course of the next Bill to be before the House on the subject. I am sure that will also involve a prolonged debate.  Will the commission deal with such matters as, for instance, the awarding of damages to an aggrieved person, a person who has suffered at the hands of gardaí while being detained? Will the commission merely prepare findings as to what happened?  Will they have a punitive role where the Garda are concerned?  Will they be empowered to impose punishments &mdash; suspensions, dismissals and so on &mdash; against members of the Garda?  These are some of the questions that the House will need answers to.  They are matters that will have to be debated when we are aware of what the proposals are.</P>
    <P>There will have to be investigations.  I would not consider it proper that the tribunal should be involved in inquiries and investigations.  They should exercise only judicial functions by way of determining the facts but there will have to be a team of investigators who will conduct inquiries, interview witnesses and so on but the question is who should be the appropriate people to conduct those inquiries?  Should they be members of the Garda and, if so, would that position <Col N="2075" /> affect the independent nature of the proceedings? These will be investigators and inquirers rather than those who will be reaching decisions.  If justice is to be seen to be done, these investigators must be entirely independent of the Garda force. There are already an adequate number of people well qualified for that purpose within the ranks of the Civil Service.  One thinks of the Department of Social Welfare and of the Revenue Commissioners who have adequate teams of people well trained in the field of investigations.  I would urge that the services of the appropriate officials in the State service should be used for these duties instead of our setting up a whole new structure which is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>As Deputy De Rossa has said, this is the last hurdle in a long debate.  As he has said, we may be flogging a dead horse.  One hopes that it is not a Trojan horse in the sense that at the outset the Bill was regarded by many as a gift.  Let us hope that the Bill will not be our downfall.</P>
      <P>The amendment is designed to cope with what might be abuses or excesses, as distinct from the psychological pressures brought on by detention.  We must never lose sight of the fact that this is what the whole focus of our debate is about. Therefore, it is extremely important that we pay attention to that part of the amendment which proposes the provision of adequate safeguards.  I shall not repeat what has been said by other Members but I would merely draw attention, in the context of adequate safeguards, to the need for adequate personnel.  I am talking about those safeguards that would not only ensure protection for both the Garda and the public but which would ensure also the effective and efficient working of decisions and the defining of management. One of the areas I would have in mind in this respect would be the need for ban-ghardaí at Garda stations throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fear that has been expressed throughout this debate is that in bringing <Col N="2076" /> in the independent tribunal and the safeguards after the event, the House will not be under undue pressure to vote perhaps for regulations that they would not regard as adequate as those we are asking for now.  I trust that the Minister will respond to the fears that have been expressed on all sides of the House in regard to the tribunal being totally independent in terms of investigative powers.  In saying that, I join with Deputy De Rossa in expressing the hope that the tribunal will be debated here as a matter of right and that it will be introduced without even the detention section of the Criminal Justice Bill.  I see this as something that is long overdue.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that there are the greatest safeguards possible.  We must be constantly vigilant lest there be any erosion of civil rights, regardless of any pressure that might come from outside for an easy solution to problems that are much more complex and fundamental than one Act can cope with.</P>
    <P>I described Members of the House as leaders of our people.  There have been times when I wished I could have felt adequate in that role.  As leaders of our people I do not think we should ever assume the role of eroding civil rights or putting at risk the most vulnerable sections of our people.  Particularly in regard to this Bill we legislators should remember that very often by sowing the wind we reap the whirlwind and that legislation which we introduce because we think it is addressed to sections of our society whom we do not greatly worry about may produce a backlash against us. Therefore, we carry great responsibility.</P>
    <P>The debate has been on many issues, particularly on the role of the Garda. What I hope we will get at from this constructive debate are the real causes of crime, of our social ills.  I hope that as we monitor this Bill we will find in a short time that we can repeal the contentious and unacceptable parts of it.  I hope that the real causes of crime will be taken seriously by leaders of society so that something more wide-ranging and radical <Col N="2077" /> will be done to cope with it rather than the introduction of this Bill.</P>

    <Title>Irish Shipping Limited: Statement by Minister for Communications.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have been informed of the decision of Irish Shipping Limited to petition the High Court today to appoint a liquidator to the company on the grounds that they are unable to pay their debts, including both contingent and prospective liabilities.</P>
      <P>In late September I received a report from the Chairman and Board of Irish Shipping Limited on the financial positon of the company.  That report, which was given detailed consideration by the Government, showed that there has been a grave deterioration in the company's position since the enactment of the Irish Shipping Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1984.  I explained to the House on 11 April the background to Irish Shipping's very difficult financial problems and stated that the Government had decided to accede to the board's request for limited financial support by way of Exchequer guarantees of borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated at the time that the company required an Exchequer guarantee of $12.5 million towards the cost of purchasing two vessels, the <i>Slaney Venture</i> and the <i>Celtic Venture</i> as part of an arrangement with foreign shipowners to reduce to tolerable levels their extremely <Col N="2078" /> onerous financial commitments in respect of chartered-in vessels.  That guarantee has been given since by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In addition, the company was informed in February 1984, that the Minister for Finance would be prepared to guarantee additional borrowings of £12.253 million to meet the company's projected total cash deficit of £4.063 million in 1984 and £8.190 million in 1985.  The Minister for Finance has since provided the necessary guarantees for the borrowing by the company of £4.063 million for 1984.</P>
    <P>The latest report from Irish Shipping Limited indicated that the company would now require £20.675 million to keep it going until the end of 1985, which with the sum of £4.063 million already guaranteed by the Minister for Finance brought the company's total projected cash requirements for the years 1984 and 1985 up to £24.738 million.  The position, therefore, was that the company required £12.485 million more than its original forecast.  This was mainly due to the continuing recession in the deep-sea freight market, compounded by the decline in the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> the US dollar during the current year and the increase in US interest rates which occurred over the past six months.</P>
    <P>The report also showed that, on the basis of advice from reputable international shipbrokers obtained by the chairman, on the likely trend of freight rates over the period, Irish Shipping would require almost £108 million in order to keep going until the end of 1989. Taking account of current interest rates, a further £36.5 million approximately would be required to service ISL's funding needs for the period.  Thus the total cost of keeping the company going for the next five years would amount to £144.5 million.  Furthermore, even if the Exchequer met this enormous bill, the company would still have debts of £59 million at the end of 1989, and there is, at present, little reason to think that they would be in a position to service them from their own resources.  This is in stark contrast with the earlier expectation of the board <Col N="2079" /> of Irish Shipping Limited that the deep-sea freight market would have recovered sufficiently by 1986 to enable the company to resume viable operations.</P>
    <P>The present financial position of Irish Shipping Limited is such that the company are unable to service any more borrowings. They are in fact insolvent without further financial support.  Consequently, the entire sum of £144.5 million which would be required in order to keep the company in operation in the period up to the end of 1989 would have had to be met by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>What are the reasons for the appalling financial situation of ISL?  First, there has been a dramatic collapse of the world deep-sea tramp shipping market.  The tramp market has always been subject to cyclical slumps, but the extent of the market decline during the past three years has been catastrophic and unprecedented, due primarily to the world economic recession and to the growing excess of shipping supply over demand.  The market situation since 1982 has been one of worldwide losses by shipowners, resulting in bankruptcies in many cases.</P>
    <P>Second, and even more important, the problems of Irish Shipping Limited were aggravated by the fact that during the period September 1979 to July 1981 the company entered into nine long term speculative charter agreements with companies in Hong Kong and Japan for foreign owned, foreign flagged and foreign crewed vessels amounting to 393,000 tons deadweight, a decision which I have already described as disastrous.  Even if the activities of the company had been confined to the operation of its wholly-owned fleet of deep-sea vessels, then numbering four, the collapse of the freight market would have posed serious problems for Irish Shipping Limited. With the limited exposure involved in the smaller fleet, however, the company would have been in a position to ride out the recession without insurmountable losses as it had done on many other occasions in the past.  As a result of the agreements entered into in respect of these additional ships, Irish Shipping Limited <Col N="2080" /> were left, when the market collapsed, with nine chartered-in vessels, foreign flagged, foreign crewed, and foreign owned, earning only a fraction of the cost to the company under the charter agreements.</P>
    <P>The financial problems of Irish Shipping Limited have been compounded by the fact that their partners in a trading consortium, Celtic Bulk Carriers, Cardiff shipowners Reardon Smith Line Ltd., had themselves run into financial difficulties and were not in a position to meet their share of the joint commitments entered into with Irish Shipping Limited under the Celtic Bulk Carriers pooling agreement.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what I said in Dáil Éireann last April &mdash; the charter agreements were entered into on behalf of Irish Shipping Limited without the knowledge or consent of either the then Minister for Transport or the then Minister for Finance and have led to the destruction of what was, up to then, a viable and successful State enterprise with a very proud record of financial success in an industry that has always been marked by sharp fluctuations in trading conditions.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year when Irish Shipping Limited were optimistic about an upturn in the world freight markets, the Government decided that the company should get the limited support then sought to keep it in operation.  But on the basis of the company's own projections the financial commitment that would now be required from the Government and from the Exchequer to maintain it in operation is enormous and unsustainable.  There are no grounds on which the Government could justify spending £144.5 million on Irish Shipping and still leaving debts of £59 million over the next five years with no guarantee that the company could operate on a viable basis thereafter.</P>
    <P>The nation faces, as this House is aware, very serious financial and economic problems.  The Government's determination to overcome these problems and the way we intend to do it are made clear in the national plan <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P>Any agreement by the Government to <Col N="2081" /> make the sums I have quoted available to Irish Shipping to enable it to meet liabilities entered into without the knowledge or approval of the Government would be a complete abdication of expenditure control.</P>
    <P>The Government have therefore decided that they cannot go further than the decision of February 1984.  The Government will, of course, discharge the State's responsibilities in respect of those of the company's liabilities which are guaranteed by the Minister for Finance. These liabilities can be met while respecting the levels of public expenditure envisaged in the national plan <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P>According to the latest estimate from Irish Shipping Ltd., based on a statement of affairs at 31 August 1984, there may be assets of approximately £23 million available to meet the estimated total liabilities of £117 million, of which £39.5 million are guaranteed.  It will be a matter for the liquidator to dispose of the assets of the company to best advantage and to settle with unsecured creditors.  The position in relation to the <i>Irish Spruce</i> requires separate consideration.</P>
    <P>The Government have considered the position of Irish Continental Line.  The position is that ICL is owned by Oceanbank Developments Limited in which Irish Shipping Ltd., hold a 75 per cent shareholding &mdash; the balance is held by AIB.  While the disposal of the Irish Shipping Limited shareholding in Oceanbank is a matter for the liquidator, I see no reason why Irish Continental Line, which has traded profitably in the past, should not do so in the future.</P>
    <P>The Government have given careful consideration to the question of a strategic fleet.  This concept was last reviewed in 1963 when the strategic tonnage requirements were fixed at 155,000 tons deadweight.  There are now substantially more vessels on the Irish register and, of course, we now also have the State-owned B&amp;I Company.  The Government are satisfied that the winding-up of Irish Shipping is not a cause for concern in terms of our current strategic needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2082" /> The Government particularly regret the loss of jobs which the employees of Irish Shipping will now suffer.  Over the years those employees have served Irish Shipping well and they and their families are the victims of these developments. This is one of the most unfortunate and tragic aspects of the liquidation of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>The Government have given very detailed consideration to the financial problems of Irish Shipping Ltd.  I am sorry that we could not find justification for the massive expenditure which would now be required to keep the company in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the saddest days since I came into this House in 1973. One cannot be sentimental in cases like this but it is pardonable to think about the origins of this company.  When some of us were teenagers and Seán Lemass was in battle trying to get supplies for this country, he established a company which the Minister for Communications has come in here today to kill.  That is why I say it is a sad day for this House and for the enterprise which was got underway in the most difficult of circumstances when supplies were at a minimum and when we had very few friends in a world at war.</P>
      <P>We were all proud of that company's growth and success in the market place. For 50 years up to 1982 every year that company made a profit.  It carried our flag, the symbol of our State, into all the trading ports of the world and carried that flag with pride.  We were, perhaps a little complacently, proud of what it had achieved.</P>
      <P>The company was conceived and born in dangerous times.  No one can say with certainty that at present we do not need a company like Irish Shipping.  No one can say that peace is assured or what tomorrow will bring.  Every thinking person at present is dedicating himself or herself to a philosophy of peace mainly because they are afraid that war will come.  This is the time the Government have chosen to kill one of the semi-State bodies which was the pride of the country.  We may need it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2083" /> The reputation of the company was high in shipping circles.  Those employed in it can tell you that there was no trouble in getting credit in any of the ports or harbours which our ships visited.  The Minister comes in now and tells us that he is killing off the company and he thinks he is giving it a decent burial.  We will have something to say about that before this debate concludes.</P>
    <P>I have had representations from the unions involved in this company over the last six months and they were worried. One should never underestimate the combined wisdom of working men whose livelihood depends on a company or corporation. I want to know whether the Minister even thought of them when he was making his demand for the appointment of a liquidator today in the courts or when he came into the House and said it was <i>kaputt</i> for the company.  Admittedly some of the ships under the aegis of Irish Shipping are not crewed by Irishmen. However, there are still a substantial number of members of the Seamen's Union and the FWUI who are employed by the company and whose livelihood is at stake as a result of the action of the Minister and the Government.  This is little short of national sabotage.  Without making any rash commitments in any way or pinning our faith in any kind of rash future financial commitment, Fianna Fáil will reverse this decision when they return to office, and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>There is more in this than merely the sloughing off of responsibility for certain debts.  A great deal has to do with the credit and the credit-worthiness of this country.  Again and again in this House Ministers for Finance and Taoisigh from various parties have stated that our credit-worthiness was something of which we could be proud.  This kind of action can only damage that credit-worthiness and indicate that there are times when the Government walks away from something to which they have been fully committed in the past.  The exercise of democracy would have required that some opportunity be given to the House <Col N="2084" /> to debate this serious problem and that we would not have a furtive rushing in at 5 p.m. to deal with an important topic like this.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I tried to get a promise from the Taoiseach that there would be a debate in the House on this matter before a decision which could not be reversed was taken.  I did not succeed in getting that &mdash; I know you are bound by Standing Orders &mdash; and that is another legitimate cause for complaint.  It shows a certain disrespect and lack of confidence in this House to put forward suggestions with regard to the maintenance of this company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did they not wait for the report of the all-party committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be referring to that later.  Under the heading of democracy I also want to call the attention of the House to the fact that there was a committee appointed to deal with semi-State bodies which come under the control of this House.  The Minister did not wait to find out what the committee's suggestions were even though they had studied the problem over a long period, had heard witnesses and had paid consultants to advise them.  Surely it would have been commonsense to await the result of this investment of energy, brains and money in this committee before a decision was taken?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the chartering of the nine vessels.  This was a disastrous, corporate judgment, there is no doubt about that.  I do not know what would have happened if that decision had not been taken when it was taken.  I should like to know how much of the responsibility for the financial situation can be attributed to the partnership of Reardon Smith in Celtic Bulk Carriers.</P>
      <P>In his speech on the Irish Shipping Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1984, the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faced, therefore, with an increasingly critical financial situation, Irish Shipping Limited recently entered into negotiations with the foreign owners of the nine chartered-in vessels with a <Col N="2085" /> view to seeking some reduction in the financial burdens of the long term charters. I am glad to be able to say that as a result of the negotiations, significant concessions have been obtained from the owners concerned.</P>
    <P>From that day to this, the House has not been told what those concessions were. According to the tone of his speech, those concessions seem to be something that would have put Irish Shipping in a proper position <i>vis-à-vis</i> those nine chartered vessels.</P>
    <P>For obvious commercial reasons, the details cannot be disclosed but I can say that they mean very substantial cash savings to Irish Shipping in the period up to 31 December 1985.</P>
    <P>The <i>Slaney Venture,</i> which was a Panamex vessel and the <i>Celtic Venture,</i> a &ldquo;handisize&rdquo; vessel, were the two ships which were negotiated on at that time. Would the Minister tell the House the precise details of the repurchase of those ships?  What were the concessions and how much money was saved to the company by that deal?  The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>When things get back to normality, however, the company's intention is that Irish crews will be employed on the vessels.</P>
    <P>What kind of information is this House getting when we can be talking about the re-employment of Irish crews early in 1984 and killing the company without decent burial before the end of 1984?</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>Following the negotiations with the foreign shipowners the Board of Irish Shipping Limited submitted a report to me in relation to the company's overall financial situation and, having taken account of the substantial concessions secured from the shipowners, have requested limited support from the Government by way of Exchequer guarantees of borrowings.  As already indicated, the company requires an Exchequer guarantee of $12.5 million, or about £10.7 million at current exchange rates, towards the cost of <Col N="2086" /> purchasing the two vessels.  In addition, the company estimates that it will need further guaranteed borrowings of slightly more than £12 million to meet their projected cash deficit in the period up to the end of 1985.</P>
    <P>If that was the best judgment that could be given to the Minister of what would take the company up to the end of 1985, what happened before the end of 1984? The Minister said:</P>
    <P>A recovery of the shipping market in the meantime would, of course, reduce the size of the projected cash deficit.</P>
    <P>In the same speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited has an enviable record of profitable operation in the past in one of the world's most competitive market places.  The company is now facing the most serious challenge in its history and the Government believe that it should be given the limited Exchequer support it is now seeking.</P>
    <P>Where there is a will there is a way and I contend that certain slimming operations are necessary in Irish Shipping arising mainly from their disastrous chartering operation.  The Minister said that he thought the company should be given the limited Exchequer support it is now seeking.  If the Minister and the Government wanted to find a way to sustain this company, even in a slimmed down version, they could have done it.  I am charging them with not making the effort to do so and not facing up to their responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister did not emphasise the importance of the fleet from a strategic point of view.  I said that one does not know how soon we might be in the kind of situation we were in before. Are we going to be left unclothed in the shipping sense, are we going to be on our own and at the mercy of other powers? This House knows the implications of that, when you are totally at the mercy of somebody else with regard to supplies.</P>
    <P>I should like a full debate, with the full power of this House and with all the expertise developed in the subcommittee <Col N="2087" /> brought to bear on this problem before any final decision is taken.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Government have therefore decided that they cannot go further than the decision of February 1984. The Government will, of course, discharge the State's responsibilities in respect of those of the company's liabilities which are guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I should like an expansion of that statement. Does it mean that the Government are walking away from other debts incurred by Irish Shipping, a company that is known throughout the world as the Government's shipping company?  Are they taking away from the company an opportunity of ever dealing with that matter themselves?  Are they taking from the directors the power to have any impact in the future on clearing debts and discharging them honourably?  Are the Government saying that all the debt for which they are responsible is the sum of $12½ million and £4 million mentioned in the Minister's speech earlier this year?</P>
    <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil, out of whose philosophy this company and similar companies sprung, on behalf of Fianna Fáil who sustained this company when it needed sustenance at the beginning and who were proud of the development of the company in the profit-making period of 15 years, I wish to state we are totally opposed to what the Government have done.  I appeal to the Chair and to the House to provide an opportunity for a full debate.  I am moving the suspension of Standing Orders in accordance with Standing Order No. 139 so that the House may have that opportunity.</P>

      <P>In relation to the last remarks of Deputy Wilson regarding Standing Order 139, I got a message over the telephone around 5 p.m. this afternoon that it was proposed to move the suspension of Standing Orders under Standing Order 139.  Until now I have not been told the purpose for which it was proposed to suspend Standing Orders.  I <Col N="2088" /> gather it is for the purpose of having debate other than statements under Standing Order 38.  Standing Order 139 reads:</P>
      <P>Any Standing Order or Orders of the Dáil may be suspended or modified in effect for the day's sitting, and for a particular purpose, upon motion made after notice.</P>
      <P>After notice means after notice given under Standing Order 28, which is four days' notice.  I have not got that notice.</P>

      <P>We are moving the suspension of Standing Orders from this side of the House to enable us to discuss the statement of the Minister for Communications, and in particular the liquidation of Irish Shipping.  I wish to point out very briefly that this is one of our major shipping companies, that the amount of money we are talking about is between £24 million and £144 million and that it is a matter of the most serious, far-reaching economic consequences.  It is to make a mockery, a farce and a laughing stock of the procedures of this House if a matter of this momentous and historic proportions is to be dealt with by way of statement and counter-statement.  I am urging the Chair very strongly in the best interests of parliamentary procedures and parliamentary democracy to accept this very reasonable proposal from this side of the House.  Because of this catastrophic announcement, I ask that Standing Orders be suspended as a matter of extreme urgency in order to debate this matter and see whether any way can be found to reverse this proposal to liquidate one of the most important economic and commercial institutions of this State.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that this cannot be debated because it is such a tremendous shock to everybody. There have been rumours about this for some time but I do not think that anyone thought that a Government would liquidate a State Company of such immense prestige and importance as Irish Shipping Limited.  The whole House should debate it because nothing of this nature has ever happened previously.  Apart from its affects on Irish Shipping, what will be its effect on the credibility of every State company, and which State company is going to be next?  This is going to be a weapon used by this Government in other State companies.  It will undermine the whole confidence of financial institutions in the borrowing of other State companies in either the short term of the long term.  It will have a tremendous effect on both the public sector and the private sector and it will shake the confidence and the morale of the nation generally as well as the workers in other State companies.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech has given only four lines to the effect on 1,300 workers in Irish Shipping Limited.  It is all on questions of protection of money etc. and he has given four lines to what effect it will have on the workers and how sad it is going to be.  He has given us no idea of what he is going to do with them or what provision he is going to make for them.  Surely the Labour Party will not stand by this statement of the Minister in this case.  All of these things should be debated at length in this House.  This has been worrying and stirring the minds of many people who have been discussing and thinking about it for months.  I do not think that anyone really expected that the Government would come up with this shock announcement today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited have given pride and confidence to our country.  We <Col N="2091" /> recognised that they would be there in time of emergency.  Anyone who remembers the last war will know the difficulties we have as an island nation in time of war in having supplies brought in or out, and there was recognition that this was one of the primary functions of Irish Shipping Limited.  That is why they were allowed to go around tramping to keep going because we wanted to maintain the shipping to have it available in time of emergency.  They were highly successful and made profits.  The year before last was the first time they made a loss in 15 years.  I do not think that the Minister has counted up the profits made by this company over that length of time against only two years' losses as well as the third year.</P>
    <P>All of the Minister's statement is based on projections and he puts this frightening figure of £144 million in front of us, but if you consider his speech you will see that £108 million of that is a projection on the basis of advice from reputable international shipbrokers, whoever they may be.  They gave an estimate on the likely trend in freight rates to 1989, over the next five years. On the basis of these reputable international shipbrokers' projections of freight rates to 1989 the Minister says that the State will have to pay £108 million. That is £108 million out of the £144 million figure which he gave.  The £36.5 million is the funding required for Irish Shipping Limited for that period of five years.  Therefore, the decision has been made by the Government on the basis of projections of reputable international shipbrokers who probably would be delighted to see Irish Shipping Limited out of their way in the competitive freight market which exists at the moment.  On the basis of those projections he liquidates this State company and puts 1,300 people out of a job without giving any indication of what he is going to do with them.</P>
    <P>This company have stood by every Government directive.  For instance, they were directed by the Government three or four years ago to buy a bulk carrier <Col N="2092" /> from Verolme Dockyard to keep the shipyard in business.  They did so although they did not require it, and of course that is not put down to their credit now.  The things they have done for this country and for the State and the foreign currency which they have earned are not taken into account by the Minister.  It is a question of the Minister evading his responsibilty in this.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been saying that they knew nothing about these charter agreements by Irish Shipping Limited, the Minister was not informed at any stage, the Minister did not know a thing about it.  That is amazing, because Ministers can know every little fiddle-faddle, everything that goes on in the semi-State companies under their Departments if they want to.  If it is CIE, the ESB or anything else they know almost everything that happens on a day-to-day basis, but in this case they did not know a thing.  They are telling us now about these decisions made by Irish Shipping Limited which were a disaster and have led to great problems.</P>
    <P>I refer again particularly to the workforce and the effect which this decision will have on them.  If a debate and full discussion by the House is allowed on this, I hope that decision will be reversed. I hope that Deputies will take a very serious view and a closer look at what this £144 million means and not be frightened by a non-existent figure being thrown before them.  It is merely a projection. I hope that following such a debate the Minister's decision will be reversed.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Woods).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I had explained that I did not intervene earlier in the debate today because I wanted to listen to points made by various Deputies in this House and to be in a position to reply to any question raised.  First of all, I want to make some remarks about points made by Deputy Woods and then proceed to contributions by other Deputies and subsequently give my view of the amendment put down by Deputy Woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods suggested that I had <Col N="2095" /> a particular strategy in putting this Bill through and that I was insisting in putting it through before the complaints procedure Bill was published and before the regulations came before the House.  This is not so.  I had no such intention.  The heads of the complaints Bill were approved by the Government last April.  The Bill is in its fifth draft and consultations with Garda associations are in their final stages.  The reality of legislation is that it takes a long time, especially when the subject is fairly complex and is likely to give rise to a lengthy debate.  It is a matter of coincidence that the complaints Bill is now almost ready just at the time when the Criminal Justice Bill is about to pass through this House on its way back to the Seanad again.  The regulations are also at preliminary draft.  There was no such strategy along the lines Deputy Woods suggested.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the two memoranda issued initially with the Bill I should like to state that I made the point previously that this was not an afterthought on the part of the Government. The decision taken was that a complaints procedure involving a very strong independent element would be introduced. This proposal was put before Government with proposals on the Criminal Justice Bill and there is no question whatever of an afterthought.  However, the advice was that it would not be proper to put into an explanatory memorandum something which was not in the text of the Bill.  I had to devise another mechanism of communicating to Deputies and Senators what the intent of the Government was on the complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>I have been asked whether the complaints procedure would involve complaints above the rank of chief superintendent.  As I said on Committee Stage, I am not ruling that out.  I am giving an indication the line along which I am thinking but it is helpful to have the views of Deputies before the Government take final decisions on the final draft of the complaints procedure Bill which comes before them.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go over the ground I <Col N="2096" /> covered last week but a number of specific points were raised.  For example, Deputy O'Kennedy asked what would fall within the ambit of the complaints procedure, would it be simply complaints of physical abuse or could a person complain about gardaí omitting to do their duty.  As I explained to the Deputy, it would fall within its remit as I envisage it that any act or omission would be appropriate for the complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>I should like to correct another impression which may have been deduced from what Deputy Woods said, that I have any objection to an independent body to adjudicate or investigate complaints. There is no withdrawing from the commitment I have given to the kind of complaints body I have been talking about but I am objecting to the use of the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in the text of the amendment for the same reasons that I objected to it when the same formula of words was proposed by the Deputy on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly made the point that he was worried about gardaí being consulted beforehand and that they might unduly influence the shape of the complaints legislation.  Gardaí, like all public servants, have a right to be consulted about any legislation that may specifically affect their conditions of service.  It is good management-staff relations to do this.  However, there is another factor to which I should like to draw the attention of the House.  As a legislature, and as a Government &mdash; like previous Governments &mdash; we have forbidden the Garda Síochána to be members of trade unions.  I suggest to the House that while it is good staff-management relations to consult with employees in any work situation, when it is a decision of the Government not to allow the Garda Síochána to unionise, then there is an obligation on us to have detailed consultations about matters which affect their pay or their conditions of work.  This will affect their conditions of work.  That is not to say that the Garda have any veto over what is going to be in the complaints Bill.  Consultation is proper and has been indulged in and some consultation will still take place but <Col N="2097" /> in the final analysis the Government will propose detailed legislation for the House and it will be a matter for the House to dispose of the proposals.  There is no question of a Garda veto of any sort.  Most of the other points raised were dealt with on Committee Stage last week.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment proposed by Deputy Woods, I should like to state that it is exactly the same as the amendment defeated last week in a Committee of the House with two additions about regulations.  The first of these, the requirement that the regulations should provide for &ldquo;adequate safeguards&rdquo;, is open to the same objection as I made to the reference earlier in the amendment, to the use of the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in relation to the complaints commission, that is, that it could lead to argument later on as to whether the commission were independent, with the possibility that the detention provisions of the Bill could be successfully challenged.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; is an even less precise word than &ldquo;independent&rdquo; so that the scope for argument about the adequacy of this or that provision of the regulations is greater.  In whose interests are the safeguards?  Those of the person in custody, against ill-treatment obviously?  Or of the Garda against unfounded allegations, or, more likely, of both?  It would be necessary to spell this out.  The safeguards could be adequate in relation to the detained person but not so in relation to the Garda.</P>
    <P>Who is to judge &ldquo;adequacy&rdquo;. Adequacy can be a fairly subjective judgment. I might think it was adequate but Deputy Woods, or other Deputies, might have a different view of what an adequate safequard was.  I interpret the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; as satisfying this House, and the other House, a majority in each House voting on the safeguards and by their vote saying that they were adequate.  That would be the situation in any event because the safeguards have to be brought through the House and voted on.  Why include a word in an amendment which is subject to ambiguous interpretation and bring about a situation where we would be in agreement here, and in <Col N="2098" /> the other House, about the adequacy of the safeguards but a test could be made in a court to establish whether what we had decided was adequate was objectively adequate?  There is a difficulty, as there was in the draft of the amendment last week, about the use of the word.</P>
    <P>The second addition, the reference to the regulations being made by the Minister as well as being approved by the Oireachtas, brings that portion of the amendment into line with the amendment passed in Committee.  There is no net gain there.  Incidentally, the present, and the previous amendment, moved by the Deputy are defective in speaking of the regulations under section 7 being approved by the Oireachtas.  The reference should be to the draft of the regulations being approved by each House of the Oireachtas.  As the House is aware the President is not involved in the approval of regulations or, more precisely, using the terms of section 7 (5), in a resolution approving the draft having been passed by each House.  It is much simpler to say, as the Seanad amendment does, &ldquo;until regulations under section 7 have been made&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not being critical of the Deputy's drafting.  I appreciate the difficulty of trying to draft a technical amendment and having it absolutely correct with the resources available to an Opposition spokesman.  However, there are technical flaws in the amendment, even if we had agreed on everything else which would make it impossible for me to accept it.  I am not relying on technical drafting points, though they cannot be ignored or brushed aside.  The essential fact is that the amendment now before the House contains the same elements which made it unacceptable in Committee. It pre-empts the decision of the Oireachtas when dealing with the complaints Bill as to whether the ranks above chief superintendent are to be included. The word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; could, as I have said, cause serious difficulties.  I want to make it clear that there is no doubt that the complaints board will, in fact, be independent in the exercise of their functions.  I am committed to that. <Col N="2099" /> Indeed I think all sides are agreed on that.  As a matter of fact the Bill will contain an express provision to that effect, that it will be independent in the exercise of its functions.  The same goes for adequate safeguards.  I do not think it is necessary to go into the further detail. We shall have this debate again on the complaints Bill.  In the meantime, when it comes to the Government taking final decisions with regard to the text, they will have the advantage of considering the various views put forward in this House on the kind of body that will be likely to find general acceptance.</P>
    <P>I should like to revert to first base and remind the House of what we are at here. What we are saying is that there are certain sections of the Bill which we consider to be controversial, that there are certain sections of the Bill which we consider should not be implemented until there is an independent complaints procedure established and until there are adequate safeguards, by means of regulations, accepted by both Houses.  That is what we are talking about.  We should not move away from first base because that is the purpose of the amendment.  That purpose is more than adequately fulfilled by the amendment which came from the Seanad and certainly has been strengthened by the amendment by all sides here on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I said, in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Saturday, 27 October 1984 &mdash; referred to here on a number of occasions:</P>
    <P>I would submit that, when the Bill is in operation together with the new complaints procedure and the statutory regulations for the treatment of persons in custody, we will have a system of criminal law and procedure that will for the first time not only give the police adequate powers to investigate serious crime &mdash; questioning, forensic testing and so on &mdash; but also provide firm guarantees that they will be fully accountable for the welfare of persons in custody.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2100" /> This is the last opportunity I shall have of speaking on this Stage of the Bill because it is Deputy Woods's amendment and he will conclude.  I should like to thank everybody who has contributed to this debate.  Like all Stages of the debate on this Bill, I have found this to be particularly helpful.  As I have stressed, I am not just sitting down waiting for the Bill to pass through.  I am listening to the points being made.  I will bring the views of the House on particular points to the Government when they are taking final decisions on the drafting of the complaints Bill which is now almost ready.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputy Woods for having been so helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his remarks and for his constructive attitude to the Bill on all its Stages through this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to understand that our concern is that in the first instance, we should strengthen his hand, that we should indicate very clearly that we feel strongly about these measures. As spokesman for the principal Opposition party I have the responsibility of that task.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's movement in terms of the amendment of Committee of the whole Dáil to Seanad amendment No. 1 which, as the Minister said, will provide a body for adjudication other than the Garda Síochána.  We have clearly set out our views about that.  The Minister has them on record and there is no need to labour the point or to go over them any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor said that the House would be better to leave the issue to the time when the Minister puts proposals before us concerning the complaints commission or procedure, whatever format is to be followed.  The fact that we do not have those proposals before us is the reason we have been and are attempting to set out in this amendment to highlight <Col N="2101" /> the principles, particularly that of independence. We want the Minister to go to the drafting stage, to his negotiations, with the principle of independence firmly in his mind, in the knowledge that, as far as this House is concerned, that is the principle the House wants included in the complaints procedure, in the interests both of the Garda Síochána and of those persons who will be detained in custody under the provisions of this Bill or any other provisions.</P>
    <P>There is a certain weakness which occurred to me &mdash; which was mentioned by some Members on Report Stage &mdash; in that approach because further debate will be confined to the complaints procedure and the safeguards, moving away from the context of the new powers proposed. We shall then end up in this House talking about complaints, our discussions centring on complaints.  I think the Minister recognises that, as far as Members are concerned, we want to see better law, we want to see a better system and we want to help him produce such a system.  The mechanism available to us for doing so is the toing and froing here in this House, with the Opposition endeavouring to tease out what is the position.  If we cannot get amendments accepted, then at least we must endeavour to extract commitments or promises from the Minister.</P>
    <P>In that respect the Minister has made his promises clear here on Report.  For instance, he has reiterated the fact that he is not ruling out the inclusion of members of the Garda Síochána above the rank of Chief Superintendent.  He has said also that he has no objection to an independent body, that his objection is to the use of the word itself.  I dealt with that when I spoke earlier this afternoon, making it clear that we were not just talking about independence from the Garda Síochána, that the body should be seen to be independent or free from outside interference whether that be on the part of the Minister, his Department, politicians or anybody else.  We made that point clear to the Minister.  In relation to the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; the Minister went on to say that he would <Col N="2102" /> foresee the body being &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in the exercise of its functions.  I welcome that statement of the Minister as representing his view and verbal commitment to the House.  On Committee Stage I suggested it was possible &mdash; if the Minister was not happy with having the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; inserted before the word &ldquo;commission&rdquo;&mdash; then to have it read: a complaints commission &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in the exercise of its functions, going a step further.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister about the use of the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.  I shall not go into that now.  We discussed it sufficiently on Committee Stage.  Its meaning is clear.  The Minister said also there could be question marks about the usage of the words &ldquo;adequate safeguards&rdquo;. Probably they represent the best words I can think of here to express what Members want.  The Minister gave his definition of them by saying that they would represent safeguards which would satisfy both Houses and which would eventually end up in the Bill.  I would be inclined to agree with him that that would be their interpretation; that is the reason I included those words.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister goes on to say that as long as he brings back the regulations, placing them before us, we will be able to discuss them and decide on their adequacy or otherwise.  Whether those words are included or not will have an effect on whether an amendment can be brought in on Report Stage.  The Minister will understand that he cannot reintroduce his earlier amendment.  Therefore I am happy that while the Minister may regard the word as unnecessary, nevertheless it was adequate for the purpose we intended.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's verbal assurances given in this House.  We feel very strongly about this question.  We want to see established a truly independent procedures commission.  We want it to deal with all members of the Garda Síochána.  We want it to deal with investigations and adjudication.</P>
    <P>In a draft complaints commission I circulated earlier I outlined the way in which we would foresee this happening.  I think <Col N="2103" /> the Minister is fairly well at one with us in that, even though there may be variations in detail.  Basically we are thinking along similar lines at least in relation to the way in which such a commission would operate, and the fact that there would be informal as well as major complaints etc.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I thank the Minister for his remarks and for his approach to this Bill which has been debated in a very healthy way.  Members have expressed their feelings about this Bill and the Minister has been made aware of them.  I <Col N="2104" /> trust that the Garda will appreciate our approach in giving them these new powers.  We appreciate that the Minister will have his own problems in relation to the resources and requirements for the implementation of these powers but as far as we are concerned it is a question of introducing these powers for a period of four years on a trial basis.  We hope the agreed complaints procedure will make our legal system and its application better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving the motion I will take 15 minutes only, but some speaker on our side will take half an hour. I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government as the owners of Irish Shipping to take whatever action may be necessary immediately to reverse the decision to liquidate the company.</P>
      <P>I want to point out first of all that Irish Shipping is a State company.  Speaking from memory, the entire shareholding of the company is the property of the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government and the people.  It seems to me that even though the Government acted precipitously in rushing down to the courts this afternoon to have a liquidator appointed, it is still possible for the Government, or the Minister for Finance as the principal shareholder if not the sole shareholder of the company, to take whatever action is necessary to have that decision set aside and to enable the company to proceed.</P>
      <P>At least the decision should be set aside until the Oireachtas Committee, established to investigate the affairs of State companies, and who are now investigating the affairs of Irish Shipping, have had an opportunity to conclude their deliberations and report to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find it extraordinary that in a major matter of this sort, probably one of the most far-reaching economic decisions taken by any government for a long time, this indecent haste should have been engaged in.  Why was it necessary to rush down to the courts this afternoon, presumably after the normal court sitting time, and to move to have a liquidator appointed?  That furtive action by the Government brings this whole process into disrepute, in our view.  We are not dealing here with the closure of a dance-hall. <Col N="2109" /> We are dealing with a major State company of international significance and importance.  We are dealing with many millions of taxpayers' money.  Yet this Government decide to deal with it in that way.</P>
    <P>My colleagues on this side will elaborate on different aspects of this.  I will just outline in a general way our case and the factors which seem to us to be of significance.  First of all, I would advert to the strategic importance of Irish Shipping Limited.  Deputy Wilson indicated earlier the manner and the time at which it was brought into being.  It is not an exaggeration to say that this company was formed to save the nation.  During the war we would have suffered perhaps actual starvation, certainly deprivation and want, had it not been for the action of a gallant few sailors who manned Irish Shipping vessels to bring us desperately needed food and other supplies during the war years.  Arising from the gallant efforts of the men in those little ships &mdash; I am probably one of the few people in the House who remember them &mdash; Fianna Fáil at the time, and this decision was supported by subsequent Governments, decided that never again would we be put in that position.</P>
    <P>It was decided that if possible we would have available to us a strategic minimum of shipping to protect our best interests in times of war and emergency.  That is what Irish Shipping is all about.  It is not just another commercial venture.  It was established to meet a strategic economic need, a safety valve, a precaution, a safeguard for the future against the hazards that some new war might bring.</P>
    <P>There is also the contribution Irish Shipping makes to the Irish economy. In an economy such as ours, so much dependent on foreign trade both import and export, it is vital to have our own shipping line if for no other reason than to enable us to give a standard, a measurement to which other shipping and transport companies would have to adhere.  The significance of Irish Shipping in our economic life could not be overestimated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2110" /> There is also the question of employment. Irish Shipping offered good careers to many young Irish people who for the first time were able to take up careers as seamen in the service of their own merchant navy.  There has been considerable domestic employment.  As Deputy Wilson pointed out today, our ships sailing around the world, doing good efficient business, brought commercial credit to the country.  Of course we would all feel a certain emotional pride in having our own successful shipping line, but this company, because it is good and efficient and commercially successful, brought benefits to our commercial reputation as a nation.  No matter what aspect of the picture you look at, economic, strategic and security matters, Irish Shipping was a vital part of the economy of the nation. There is also the aspect of our credibility, international standing and credit-worthiness. The most damning part of the Minister's statement was when he said:</P>
    <P>The Government have therefore decided they cannot go further than the decision of February, 1984.  The Government will, of course, discharge the State's responsibility in respect of those of the company's liabilities which are guaranteed by the Minister for Finance. These liabilities can be met while respecting the levels of public expenditure envisaged in the national plan <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P>His speech made it clear that as far as all other creditors of the company are concerned they will have to take their place in the queue.  The Government will not accept responsibility for discharging those liabilities in full.  That is the sort of thing which is unworthy of a shyster company director, to distinguish between liabilities specifically guaranteed by the Minister for Finance and other liabilities. They are all liabilities of this company.</P>
    <P>This is a state company.  Nobody would ever have any impression other than that the State was ultimately responsible and liable for every debt incurred by Irish Shipping.  That is why we have State companies. They command the credit-worthiness of the Government and have the full <Col N="2111" /> backing of the Exchequer behind them.  It is a shyster operation and a discreditable operation to try to say that the Government will only be responsible for discharging those liabilities which the Minister for Finance guaranteed.  Perhaps that is not the most important aspect but it is one of them: what this precipitate, furtive action by the Government will do to the credit-worthiness of this nation.  A State company must honour its obligations in full and the Government must stand behind all our State companies and be prepared to honour all their liabilities in full.  That is what the public and financial institutions here and abroad have been led to expect.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter to which I draw the attention of the House is the responsibility of the Minister for Communications.  We can all go back over the history of the company and point to its years of profitability and then to the mistakes which were made.  I distinctly remember when we, as a Fianna Fáil Government, in the interests of the national economy insisted on Irish Shipping building a ship in Verolme, all the prudent executives of Irish Shipping did not hesitate to go public and berate the Government of the day for doing that. They knew so much about shipping and international markets, how dare any Government interfere with their commercial maritime decisions.  We know now how marvellous their commercial maritime decisions were.  That is what we were told at the time and that is what the commentators took up in their columns and financial pages.  We had the audacity to overrule them on a matter of national importance of that kind.  We were right.</P>
    <P>Leaving the history of the company aside, how could the Minister for Communications come in here, put legislation before the House and make certain statements which led everyone to believe that, difficult though the decision was and hard though it was for the hard-pressed Exchequer to find the money to provide the guarantees necessary at that time, at least we were solving the problem and putting Irish Shipping on the right road. <Col N="2112" /> That is what the Minister told the House, implied and inferred to the House earlier this year.  If he was right then, why was it necessary for him to come in today and engage in this furtive act of national sabotage and, without any debate or due consideration of the issues or giving the Oireachtas committee time to conclude their investigations, wind up, or as Deputy Wilson said, kill this important national commercial institution?</P>
    <P>I deplore the action of the Government. They are, as someone called them, a national undertaker Government.  In the minds of most people this is probably the final straw.  Will they leave us with nothing?  Will they wind up everything, close down everything and disband everything? As someone said, by the time this Government leave office they will have to turn around and say: &ldquo;Will the last Irish citizen to leave the country please turn out the lights&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;regrets the developments that have led to the insolvency of Irish Shipping Ltd., but endorses the decision of the Government not to provide financial aid on the scale that would have been required to avoid the liquidation of the company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I share with all Members a sense that we have arrived at a very sad moment in our history but I must recall to the House the contents of the statement made by the Minister for Communications a short time ago which set out the reasons and the factors which led us to this point. Deputy Haughey in moving the motion may regret that he used such intemperate language and should have characterised this action as being one of a &ldquo;shyster company director&rdquo;.  For the Leader of the Opposition to say that on a matter as serious as this is something that should give us cause to pause more than a little.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>He knows perfectly well that is not the case.  He spoke of precipitate furtive action.  Let us take those words.  &ldquo;Precipitate&rdquo;: This action cannot be described by any stretch of the imagination as precipitate.  Towards the end of 1983 the Government closely examined the financial position of Irish Shipping and informed the company at that time that no further funds could be made available to the company on the basis of the Government's judgment of what the future trading and financial position of the company would be.</P>
      <P>In February, as the Minister pointed out earlier, the company, having reviewed their position, looked again at the action that might be taken in order to relieve or reduce the very onerous burden of a number of commitments into which they had entered.  Following full consideration, the Government informed the company in February last that I, as Minister for Finance, would guarantee additional borrowings of £12.25 million to meet the company's projected cash deficit to the end of 1985 and that I would also provide an Exchequer guarantee of $12.5 million towards the cost of purchasing two vessels, the <i>Slaney Venture</i> and the <i>Celtic Venture</i>.  The company proposed to purchase those two vessels as part of the arrangements which in their view were going to bring about a substantial improvement in their situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then the financial situation of the company has deteriorated and it now appears, as the Minister for Communications said earlier on, that the total cash deficit of the company between now and the end of 1985 would, on present trends and on the present judgment of how the market is likely to perform, be some £12.5 million greater than was forecast. That has been the subject of a further intensive review by the Government over the last number of weeks, during <Col N="2114" /> the course of which we took account of a report provided to the Minister for Communications by the chairman of the company. I cannot see how that procedure, which goes back over a year, can in any way be described as precipitate.  The action that we have taken is anything but precipitate; it has been very carefully considered.  Deputy Haughey used the word &ldquo;furtive&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I used it advisedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing furtive about this.  It is an action which could not but become a matter for public comment and debate in this House and I cannot see how Deputy Haughey can use the word &ldquo;furtive&rdquo; about this.  The Minister for Communications has explained at some length and in some detail to the House all the circumstances that led to the position that we have today.  There is nothing furtive about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey and Deputy Wilson asked why, if the problems seem to have been solved this year, do we have this difficulty now?  That is a fair question. The action which the Government took early on this year, which I have just recalled, was taken on the basis of what was then considered to be a reliable or the best available projection of what was likely to happen in the shipping market and to the finances of the company over the period in question.  It included a certain view of what was likely to happen to shipping rates.  That view has not been borne out and the company's financial position has deteriorated for that and other reasons to the point where their cash deficit to the end of 1985 would now be some £12.5 million greater than it was expected to be in February of this year. That obviously calls for substantial reconsideration of the position of the company. It also calls for substantial reconsideration by the Government of their intentions as to the future financing of the company.  The action, therefore, was neither precipitate nor furtive and it was justified by the development of the market and the change in the company's financial position in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2115" /> Deputy Haughey and Deputy Wilson also raised the question of credit-worthiness. The terms in which they have done so seem to be rash and unjustified.  The Government are saying clearly in this connection that they will live up to the penny to every guarantee they have given under the terms of legislation passed by this House, the State Guarantees Act.  If there are creditors to whom that guarantee has been given, the Government will fulfill and live up to that guarantee.</P>
    <P>The rest is a matter with the Deputies opposite believe should be taken up by the Government.  I wonder if those Deputies would care to reflect on what would happen if the Government were to take that view and consider themselves legally liable for every debt of any kind incurred by a commercial State body.  What would be the point of having commercial State bodies if that were the case?  What would be the point of going to the trouble of incorporating a new body to carry out a particular business?  There would be no point in it, the Minister in question or his Department might as well run the operation.  Semi-State companies &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;are set up under a legal statute that sets out clearly the liability of the company.  The State Guarantees Act provides for the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowings by those companies and it means exactly what it says.  It guarantees those borrowings which qualify under the terms of the Act and, in the event of a default or an inability of the company that holds the guarantee to make the payments on the loan, the Exchequer will provide the necessary resources.</P>

      <P>I should like to debate that with the Deputy but we have other fish to fry.  The answer to his remark has been given many times over the last few weeks. Our credit-worthiness has improved because lenders to sovereign borrowers clearly see that the Government are committed to financial policies that will restore the solidity of the Exchequer and will guarantee that we continue to have the ability to repay.  That is part and parcel of the overall financial strategy being followed by the Government and it is something which the Deputies opposite cannot wipe out by the kind of intemperate language they have been using here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Communications said earlier on, a large part of the problem suffered by Irish Shipping arose from a number of charter contracts which they undertook between 1979-82 relating to nine vessels.  Those contracts provided for the payment by Irish Shipping of charter rates which very quickly became rates substantially in excess of those which Irish Shipping could get on the market for the provision of their services. The revenue the company was getting <Col N="2117" /> from these ships was nowhere near adequate even to cover the charter costs it had to meet even before dealing with the ordinary day-to-day costs of running and crewing the ships.  That was the main part of the problem that brought Irish Shipping into the financial difficulties it is experiencing now.</P>
    <P>An attempt was made, partially successful, to change and to modify to some degree the weight of those charter commitments but in the end it proved not enough.  As the Minister for Communications said earlier this evening, there is little reason to believe at this point that changes in the market situation over the period up to 1989 would be enough to get the company out of that situation, to get it out of that ferocious problem it has been meeting since those charters came on line.  In that situation the company would not be able to meet its commitments over the period.  It could not continue trading and there would be little prospect of the company being able to get back into a solvent or a profit-generating position in that period.</P>
    <P>As has been said by the Minister for Communications, the cost of carrying on with the operations of the company over that period would amount to about £145 million, £108 million deficit on the financial side and a further obligation of £36½ million as the financing costs of providing that money, whether it was done directly by the company itself or by the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I am amazed to hear the Minister for Finance say that there is a new financial doctrine being expounded from this side of the House when it is he who has come here with a new financial doctrine.  That doctrine says that from now on the State will pay what they have technically and legally committed themselves to pay, no more and no less.  I wonder if the Minister has thought deeply of the disastrous implications of that type of precipitous decision?  Is the Minister now saying to the commerical banks and to others that local authorities are not credit-worthy?  Is he saying to national and international bankers that every State company, whether it has a letter of comfort or not, is not credit-worthy? That is what he should have said before he gave the letters of comfort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister and I do not expect him to interrupt me.  The same members of this Government came to this House a few months ago with a Bill for Irish Steel providing for £99 million.  What was the excuse given to the taxpayers at that time?  The view of the Minister then was that the money must be paid by the Government.  However, four months later they come here with a different financial doctrine: they tell us that Irish Shipping is committed to paying X amount of money but the State will not pay it; the State is committed to a certain amount but they will pay only the amount they are caught for at this stage.  Their attitude is that they will pay only that amount and to hell with the rest of the creditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision is disastrous.  The first step on the road to sorting out the problems of Irish Shipping was to appoint a <Col N="2119" /> receiver, not a liquidator.  A receiver would strengthen the board and the hand of the new chairman of Irish Shipping. I am not going into the history of the disastrous deals which all of us know about.  In case any Member wants me to do that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a Deputy here, a member of one of the Government parties, who does not believe the Minister for Transport despite what he said when he introduced a Bill in 1983.  Part of the disastrous deals was done in 1979 and part of 1980.  The Minister put it on the record of the House and also this evening that it was done without the knowledge and consent of the Department officials, the Minister of the day and the Minister for Finance.  Incidentally, the Minister for Finance, not the Minister for Transport, is the statutory Minister responsible for Irish Shipping even though the Minister for Transport deals with the company for administrative purposes.  Deputy Taylor is trying to bring in a red herring into this business, trying to hold the Labour Party together.  I sat with those members on the committee dealing with semi-State bodies and I know their feelings on this matter.  The facts are there, admitted by the chairman, members of the board and executives of Irish Shipping at the meeting of the committee dealing with semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1980, as Minister for Transport, I had meetings with the chairman and chief executive of Irish Shipping and when I asked them to honour their commitments given in the period 1977 to 1980 to build two ships at Verolme dockyard they were not interested.  Their answer was they had too many ships.  Nobody in the two Departments responsible knew about the situation and neither did I nor my predecessor. The present Minister has confirmed this and Deputy Taylor should not try to drag in any red herrings. Eventually Irish Shipping agreed to build at Verolme dockyard on the understanding that the Government would subsidise <Col N="2120" /> the difference between what was the then international tanker price for a Panamax carrier of 65,000 to 70,000 tonnes dead-weight. That is what they got to preserve the commerciality of Irish Shipping and I admire them for it.  Everyone would have to admire their track record up to this disastrous period when they made bad judgments and bad decisions.  With hindsight we can all make good decisions.</P>
    <P>What I questioned at the meetings of the committee dealing with semi-State bodies and what I question in this House is the basis for those disastrous decisions. What were the projections then?  The Minister flitted down to the Four Courts this afternoon to get this company into liquidation.  Is there any reason for any Member of this House, for the taxpayers or for the employees of Irish Shipping to believe that the projections now presented to the Minister are any more valid than when the disastrous decisions which were made on the first day?</P>
    <P>We were arriving at a very critical stage of investigations in the committee dealing with semi-State bodies in relation to getting to the heart of the problem when those negotiations were being carried out.  We had written to the chairman to appear before the committee yesterday. We had sent the questions we wanted answered, questions that every Member of this House and the public is entitled to get but which we may never get now because the Government rushed out and put the company into liquidation.  They should have appointed a receiver who would do the job we wanted him to do. If I am correct in my interpretation of what the chairman is saying, it would strengthen his hand in renegotiating those deals because, to say the least, they were dubious when they were drawn up. When I questioned the cargo manager, who I believe did the negotiation in this, at the semi-State bodies committee I asked him what was the basis for making such a major decision without the knowledge of the Government or the Minister of the day.  He said it was based on an English consultant's report that said that in 1979 they were based on coal, lumber <Col N="2121" /> and steel for long haul traffic.  I ask anybody who knows anything about business if the steel industry was not in the greatest crisis, and not alone in the EC where there was over 30 million tonnes of overcapacity, why would anybody want to buy ships to draw steel when no steel was to be bought anywhere?  Lumber is the mainstay of the building and construction industry which was already in a serious decline not alone in America, one of the biggest customers for it, but all round the world.  Who would want to buy ships to draw lumber?  Coal I accept.  We were in the 1979 oil crisis and coal was the in thing for every international Government to get into and thus get away from oil.  Why make such a major commitment for the taxpayers and the Government of the day by entering into such a huge deal as was done here?  There are unanswered questions which we were about to reach in the investigation carried out by the semi-State bodies committee and we have now been deprived of that opportunity.</P>
    <P>At the meeting yesterday when I read the letter from the Chairman I said to my fellow-members, some of whom are here, that that was the end of the line as far as we were concerned.  The decision had been made over our heads and we will never get the opportunity.  The members wrote to the Minister yesterday and asked him to make no precipitate decision until he had an input from our committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from the day they came in and on how to run our business properly and how to run the business of the State properly.  I and my colleagues on that semi-State bodies committee gave hours and days trying to get to the root of the problem that created this disastrous situation in Irish Shipping.  I said yesterday evening, and I hope that the Members are men enough to stand up to it, that if that happened we should resign <i>en bloc</i> and forget about the semi-State bodies committee for all time because they are <Col N="2122" /> being treated as a joke and a football by the Minister, by the media and by this Government.  It is only a talking shop.  If that is what it is going to be I have no intention, good bad or indifferent, of wasting my time any more about it.  We put all our energies and commitment into that, we sat long hours and we were ready to present a report, but crucial questions remain unanswered and hang in mid-air. The Minister side-stepped and ran away down to the courts.  Instead of putting in a receiver you would first of all do an assessment as to who really is going to lose money with the action the Government has taken.  Have they done this assessment?  The two people in Japan or Hong Kong or wherever they are now resident who sold the pup to the Irish taxpayers are probably laughing the whole way to the bank.  How do we know that it is not international bankers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not, but I know that any board sitting can make a request for a receiver to be appointed as has happened 700 times in the High Court in the last 12 months, and then somebody comes in with the red herring of why could you not appoint a receiver.  A board of any <Col N="2123" /> company can pass an extraordinary resolution to ask the High Court to put in a receiver.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can worry about his own people and the day he walks through that barrier up there he is no longer a member of the Labour Party if he is going to allow a Government to take that precipitate action.  Let us find out the problems and the answers, and if at the end of the day there is no alternative then let us come in and debate it before he goes behind anybody's back.</P>
      <P>It is a joke.  We have the Order Paper of legislation coming from this Government, and what do they do?  They introduce legislation into this House to stop the fly-by-night fellows who run away, who will not meet their commitments, who leave Deputies carrying the can, who will not pay their workers.  That is on the Order Paper of this House.  The Government themselves are the biggest culprits. How can anybody respect the law when the Government are sermonising and preaching that the fly-by-nights are to be hauled in under legislation, and then the Government tonight run off to the Four Courts, get an order, get a liquidator appointed and leave somebody whoever that may be, carrying the can for the sake of £70 million or £80 million?  I do not know who they are.  If there is not a huge credibility gap for the Taoiseach, the Government, every Minister and everyone who supports them at this moment, then I am a Dutchman.  Certainly there is a big credibility gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the possible repercussions. Suppose it is not the two men who pulled the fast one, who sold a great pup. Suppose it happens to be a consortium of international bankers who decide that Ireland is no longer creditworthy, despite what the Minister for Finance said tonight.  Suppose those people decide tomorrow morning when this huge rock hits them on the back of the neck that Ireland is no longer creditworthy.  Where <Col N="2124" /> then are you going with your book-keeping? This precipitate decision could do untold damage to the economic development of this country if the international bankers decide that this is a real flit job by fly-by-nights who did not honour their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Irish State has always honoured its responsibilities.  We could well be on the brink of being a banana republic. There is ethics in international business. We sat yesterday evening at a committee meeting and were met with a huge debt because of two fellows who flitted by night.  They left with approximately £140,000 to £150,000 debts.  A man from a company called Realt Paper Limited said that business ethics exist, you stick by your good name; the best thing you have in business is your good name and you always honour your commitments. Those people, five altogether, in a small company have worked day and night to make sure that their commitments are honoured.  They are asking the Government to make sure that they are not sold out when the Government sells out everybody down the line here this evening. They could have taken the intermediate step and did not do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said here this evening that our credit rating is excellent all over the world.  I ask whatever Minister wants to tell this House if the Stationery Office in this country belonging to the Government and going by them under credit rating will get no credit from Brazil for the supply of stationery and paper. That evidence was given to us in the semi-State bodies committee yesterday evening.  If that is true it is very serious, and I want to know the answer before the end of this debate.  That will give an idea of the sort of double talk we get from Ministers in this House trying to brainwash the Irish people.  I saw the handlers here today and I remarked to a colleague of mine this morning that big things would be happening today, the handlers were around, they were getting the story ready for dissemination.  I was right.  They were here today and they had a big job to do.</P>
    <P>We may never know what caused the <Col N="2125" /> real problems of Irish Shipping Limited or the damage that could be done to our credit rating.  If they moved our credit rating up 0.5 per cent we could be talking about £300 million a year extra on our national debt and repayments.  That is the sort of figure involved here.  That is the sort of serious decision we have taken. I want the Government in this debate tonight to tell us what the report of the board of Irish Shipping Limited was and what their recommendations were.  Did they recommend liquidation or receivership? What did the board recommend? Are we sure that the people who sold Irish Shipping down the river have been flushed out?  Has the responsibility been pinned on to those who made the disastrous mistakes or is it more than a disastrous mistake?  The responsibility lies with somebody and the view as far as the Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies are concerned is that person has not been flushed out.  A liquidator has now been appointed and we may never know the identity of that person.  The Government's attitude, and how they have done their business in regard to this, has been disgraceful.</P>
    <P>The House passed legislation giving authority to the Government to guarantee Irish Shipping up to £75 million. Any person doing business with Irish Shipping, bankers, creditors and others, were entitled to believe that when the Oireachtas voted that legislation through the risk they were taking in regard to Irish Shipping would at least be covered up to that amount.  Up to tonight nobody had any doubt, internationally or nationally, that the Government always paid their bills.  This is the first and historic milestone in the history of the State when the Government are not going to pay their bills.  If it was the intention of the Government to pay their bills in full I suggest that the appointment of a receiver was the right way to go about it.  At least he would have had the opportunity to go with the chairman of Irish Shipping to Hong Kong and explain to the people there that the shipping business had not lifted as everybody had expected.  I have no doubt that the business people of <Col N="2126" /> Hong Kong, Japan and so on, would see the reality of the position and we could have Irish Shipping going on about their merry way having renegotiated their position.</P>
    <P>A very important question raised by Deputy Wilson this evening needs to be answered.  Did the Government carry out a renegotiation?  If so, will the Government explain the results of the renegotiations? The Government paid Irish Shipping &mdash; I presume it was approved by the Minister &mdash; enough money to buy two ships for $42 million.  The Government said at the time that this was crucial to the ongoing financial position of Irish Shipping.  One of the ships is a panamax carrier, not a 65,000 to 75,000 tonne ship as built in Verolme dockyard and recently finished, the contract having been placed when I was in Government for £23.5 million. The ships were built at a time when international shipping was on the floor with ships tied up all over the world.  With shipping in such a difficulty the Government, through Irish Shipping, bought a panamax carrier for $24 million &mdash; that figure was given to me by an official at a meeting of the Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping berated the Government, and the Minister responsible, in 1980 and 1981, for making them buy a ship.  We gave them the commercial rate for the ship and subsidised the difference at Verolme dockyard.  However, at a time when ships can be got for half nothing they paid $24 million for one ship and approximately $80 million for another.</P>
    <P>The Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies wanted to know the international value of those ships and what part that played in the renegotiations.  I am convinced, as many Members of the committee were, that somebody sold us not alone one pup but a second one because those figures were totally inflated in relation to the market price of ships on the international market at that time.  We should get answers to those questions but, apparently, we will not get them because henceforth we will be told that the liquidator will sort out this and that.  In the meantime the Irish taxpayer who will have to <Col N="2127" /> foot the bill will not be told.  We were elected to this House to be responsible to taxpayers for taxpayers' money.  How can any Government say that they are doing the job they were elected to do? The Government took office on a great wave of honesty, openness and integrity but we saw the flit by night in regard to the food subsidies and now we see it again.  The Government are shielding behind the smokescreen of a liquidator. They are not prepared to give the representatives of the taxpayers the facts in relation to this.  Receivership would have got us that but a decision was made to go for liquidation.</P>
    <P>We want the full story from the Government in regard to the damage that may be done.  Do they know what bankers are involved in this liquidation?  Who are the creditors?  What about the kick in the teeth for the staff of Irish Shipping who for 15 years in succession produced a profit?  It is ironic that today the so-called reforming Government produce a Bill to protect employees, and rightly so, from what has been happening in the last 18 months with businesses closing overnight and people flitting away leaving no money, not even holiday pay, for workers. On the same day that the Government are asking us to consider that, they throw the employees of Irish Shipping to the wolves.</P>
    <P>I suspect, having read the Minister's statement, that he has in mind that B &amp; I would buy Irish Continental Lines from Oceanbank.  That is a bit of a web but the Minister should clarify that position. How can the liquidator know the strategic position in regard to ships that are available to this country in the case of an emergency?  We could have such an emergency at any time.  How can the liquidator say that we have sufficient ships to deal with an emergency?  Where are they?  Are we talking about a few ferry vessels that Irish Continental Lines operate?  Are we talking about a few ferry vessel that B &amp; I operate?  Are we talking about people who have ships registered here under a flag of convenience?  The Minister must remember that he does <Col N="2128" /> not have any say over the assets of Irish Shipping once the liquidator is appointed.  If those ships are purchased by international people where is our strategic position?  I am anxious to know if the Minister wants B &amp; I to buy Irish Continental Lines.  I am anxious to know where the international ships he says will replace our strategic fleet that we have had from the forties through to the eighties will come from.  The Minister will be remembered as the man who sank the strategic vessels of this country unless he elaborates on his earlier statement.  The approach to the problem has been disgraceful.</P>
    <P>The problem in Irish Shipping is no different from that being faced by many businesses but the people who run those concerns are not doing what the Government are doing.  Those people have integrity and ethics and believe that their word is their bond.  They are not running away. They are facing up to major problems like those facing Irish Shipping today. Where there is a will there is a way. Management is about solving problems and negotiating a way out of problems. The Government ran away from this. They could have given Irish Shipping the strength to renegotiate their way out of their problems and to protect and preserve the good name and integrity of Ireland.  If they had any integrity as Irish people they would never let it be said that the Irish Government reneged on paying their debts anywhere in the world. If any members of the Government were in business they would realise that the day they do not pay their debts is the day they should pack up and go.  The message to the Government is that their time has come to go.  They have discredited the nation and dragged our credibility into the mud.  They are not fit to run a sweet-shop on a corner not to mention the economic affairs of the country.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government took the message and went.  If the Labour Party go along with this, all I can say is that we are then into a strange day in Irish politics, when the very thing that should constitute the corner stone of any Labour philosophy, or any social philosophy, the <Col N="2129" /> semi-state sector, is to be totally dismantled. I am always for good business management.  I am not for showing the white feather, throwing in the towel when problems arise.  I have faced problems in business in my time.  I contend that this problem was not insurmountable, somebody having been given the right tools and instruments to do the job, showing the light at the end of the tunnel to the management of Irish Shipping Limited.  If there are people there who are personally responsible for this, they should not be in employment today; they should be gone, they should be gone totally out of business and should never have been kept. The board of directors of Irish Shipping Limited abused the trust that the Minister of the day and successive Ministers and Governments placed in them in getting involved in deals like these without telling the Minister and the Government of the day.  Politics do not enter into this, good, bad or indifferent, because that is what a board of directors are appointed to do.</P>
    <P>The interesting question I would pose that has never been fully answered is this: how many of these disastrous decisions were taken and how many commitments entered into without the board of Irish Shipping Limited knowing?  That is the answer I want but it has never been given. If the answer is in the affirmative then the people who abused the trust that the board of directors of Irish Shipping Limited placed in them should not be kept either for one hour.  They would not last for one hour in the private sector and there is no reason that they should last one hour in Irish Shipping Limited either. They have destroyed the future of all of their fellow employees.  They have destroyed a good operation built up through blood, sweat and tears, a company that constituted the flagship of the semi-State sector.  The people responsible for that should not be in a job today. It is up to this Government to ensure that they are no longer there.</P>
    <P>I have to condemn the Government decision.  I say to them: rethink that decision as it was precipitate.  They could have done a good job through the appointment of a receiver, ascertaining <Col N="2130" /> how they could renegotiate themselves out of these problems.  I have no doubt, had I the opportunity of talking to the chairman, I would find that was what he had in mind, that what he wanted was strength in his elbow to allow him an opportunity to deal with the position in the Middle East, sorting out their problems and going about their business again.</P>

      <P>I do not dispute a lot of what Deputy Reynolds has said from the opposite side of this House.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies, I was amazed that yesterday, when we were discussing the likely outcome of our report following two meetings with the directors of this company, a question could be asked in this House as to whether there was truth in the rumour that the company was going to be liquidated.

      <P>I am not now speaking authoritatively from any deliberations of that Joint Committee because we did not arrive at any final conclusions.  But, having assessed the available evidence <Col N="2131" /> given us, having invited Mr. Belton to come back, speak to the committee and answer what we regarded as pertinent questions, having been told by that gentleman that he could not do so because of possible legal implications, we are very concerned about what has been happening within this company.</P>
      <P>I suggest it is about time that all of this was examined more stringently by this House and by the Joint Committee.  I contend there is here nothing less than a haemorrhage of taxpayers' money, in a position, as was outlined by the Minister in his announcement of this evening, in which a decision was taken to enter into long-term chartering arrangements at a time when everybody &mdash; I am not here speaking merely about people in the shipping business &mdash; every intelligent 15 year old who would be familiar with current affairs, would know that the whole question of shipping, and transhipping in particular, worldwide, was in a state of flux. There is an EC document available to the people within the shipping industry here &mdash; certainly they were no mean performers up to a few years ago and must have known what their business was about &mdash; indicating that the whole world is in oversupply in the context of shipping and leasing shipping arrangements except Japan and South Korea.  It defies all human understanding how so-called competent people and experts in this area could enter into absolutely lunatic, mad arrangements for long term leasing of ships at such a time.  It begs the question: who was responsible for this?  Where are they now?  Are some of them outside this jurisdiction?  Can some of them be brought back to answer before this jurisdiction for their actions?  I am asking what were the arrangements between the people who conducted the negotiations on behalf of this company and the two gentlemen about whom we are speaking in the Far East, were there any commission arrangements in regard to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall come back to Deputy Reynolds's question &mdash; and I should say I am not a spokesman on behalf of the Government &mdash; when he asked: what was the position <Col N="2132" /> in relation to the $42 million paid in return for the two ships?  I should like to pose this question: did those $42 million relate exclusively to the sale of those two ships, or did they also cover a portion of the expenditure related to deferred payment arrangements?  Somebody must be brought before this House, this Government, and made to answer for that.  I suspect that if this kind of black-guardism took place in other countries, not democracies, the people responsible would be executed or jailed for the rest of their natural lives.  It is an absolute disgrace that we have here, the second time within a matter of months, a semi-State body &mdash; and to be fair to this company, I should say they were a successful operation but successful in an artificial and cosmetic way.  The first question any decent company asks itself in a profit-making situation is: what is the quality of the profits?  We understand that some of the money coming was from the sale of ships and not from actual business. Therefore this should have been obvious to anybody keeping a close eye on the situation, or else somebody was fooling the Department and the Minister as the representative of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>A much more stringent watch will have to be kept on the operations of semi-State bodies.  That is not to suggest in any way, or to cast a reflection on the remainder of our semi-State bodies but here we are in a position in which, twice in a number of months, in companies investigated by the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, which I have the honour to chair, we discover there has been a vast outpouring of money in lunatic ventures without any reference to the situation, or without any consultation with the Government or Minister ultimately answerable to the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>If I may revert to the situation emerging at the Joint Committee, I think &mdash; and nobody will ever put a muzzle on me in this House no matter on which side I stand &mdash; it was precipitate, though there may be very good reasons &mdash; to appoint a liquidator.  It would have been much more advantageous to put in a receiver. <Col N="2133" /> The advantages of having done that would be that the question of the company's serious financial position would be put beyond doubt subsequently, by their being placed in a position to obtain substantial concessions from their unsecured creditors, thereby hopefully securing the future of the company.  The Joint Committee would also have been aware of the concern that such action could create significant problems for the company in the market place.  If there had been a receiver appointed, at least he or she could have been allocated the duty of endeavouring to bring back that company into a viable position.  At the end of a given period, if manifestly it was seen that that could not be done, the Government side would have been on much more solid ground than that on which they find themselves at present.</P>
    <P>It is very tragic that 1,300 people are being put out of their jobs a few weeks before Christmas.  I am sure the Government are privy to the best brains in the country but I do not know if they considered the possibility of holding on to the company because when we weigh the potential losses against the advantages, it might have been better to have held on to the company for a given number of years.  It might have cost us so many millions of pounds but we could have sold off some of the subsidiary interests of this company and we could have taken into account the net loss to the State in terms of revenue from taxation, social welfare, PAYE and PRSI.  I again question the wisdom of that approach.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Minister to bring before this House the people who negotiated the charter arrangements and the conditions under which those charter arrangements were entered into.  If we do not get that information and accountability from the people concerned we will be betraying the Irish taxpayer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the decision announced in the House today as highhanded. I consider it evidence of panic on the Minister's part.  I have to join my <Col N="2134" /> colleagues in accusing the Minister of downright discourtesy to the committee of which many of us are members.  This committee spent many months dealing with this issue.  This move calls into question the point in having a committee system.  We should scrap the committee system unless the Government are prepared to work it.  It will not work without Government support.</P>
      <P>If the Minister had given us two more weeks to finish our inquiries we could have handed him a report which would have got us out of this difficulty and stopped us becoming the laughing stock of the financial community in every banking boardroom all over the world tonight. The Minister took this decision without reference to the committee, without consulting this committee, knowing full well that we were about to report.  Yet he chose to ignore the committee.  We must reconsider whether this committee will continue.  Those of us who are members of it must reconsider whether to remain on it because it is just a facade.  I ask the Minister, as a minimum, to apologise to the committee.</P>
      <P>The cost of closing Irish Shipping could be as high as £50 million, if not £100 million.  The Minister first should have attempted to renegotiate the long-term charter agreements with the company's foreign creditors before taking this drastic and final step.  In this way the company could have been kept alive without a loss to the State at this stage.  This was the answer many of us on the committee were pushing hard, and I would like to believe that is the answer the committee would have come up with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know if the Minister got on an aeroplane to Hong Kong, sat down with the bankers and said that he represented a sovereign Irish Government. Did he say that we do not want to renege on our debts or to stick them for £60 million, but would they please sit down and renegotiate?  Did he consider a Government to Government approach? Did the Taoiseach consider that one of his trips abroad should have been to Hong Kong to talk about the solvency of the Irish nation?  That is what is at stake here, <Col N="2135" /> not just one company.  Did the Minister get on an aeroplane and say to these people that we had been paying them $15,000 a day for nine ships but that if we liquidate this company they will have their ships back and all they will get for them on the international market is $6,000 a day?  What would the man in Hong Kong have said?  Of course he would have seen sense.  He would have said that if we were going to liquidate the company he would settle for what he could get after liquidation, which would be about $6,000 a day.</P>
    <P>The Minister might reply that he sent the board, the executives or the chartering staff to do that &mdash; and he may have done that &mdash; but you do not send the people who made the mess to get you out of the mess because they are part of the problem.  This Minister should have taken an aeroplane to Hong Kong to renegotiate these charters.  Would not any sensible person in the world, facing a loss of £60 million by a decision announced in this House, take the correct course of action and agree to take £10 million and settle for what they could get?  The people in Hong Kong would have done that if the Minister had taken an aeroplane to Hong Kong to sort out this problem.  I accuse the Minister of gross incompetence in not taking that course of action.  This is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>The Minister's failure to put together this high level negotiating team to have these charters renegotiated and his failure to await the report of a committee of this House &mdash; not a committee of consultants or outside advisers &mdash; is a case of bad judgment.  In my view, and I do not make this comment lightly because I do not believe in this type of political talk, this is a case of bad judgment where the Minister should consider his continued presence in an Irish Cabinet.</P>
    <P>I was acting as chairman of the committee inquiring into this semi-State body.  That is why I am particularly angry to come in here at 5 o' clock and be faced with this decision without any prior consultation.  I want to support what Deputy Prendergast said.  I do not want <Col N="2136" /> to go into acres of detail or a plethora of statistics, but I want to tell the House, in support of what Deputy Prendergast said, that an inquiry into the affairs of this company is needed, not just a quiet liquidation and somebody signing a cheque.  This was a case of gross and total mismanagement and should be investigated. I suggest that tomorrow the Minister might announce a tribunal of three or four top accountants to report within a month telling us exactly what went on in that company.  I have acres of files and buckets of information and I can direct these experts to a lot of very useful information, as could most of the members of my committee.  All the facts are there. What went on is a national disgrace and a simple liquidation and forgetting about it is not enough.  I join Deputy Prendergast in calling for an official inquiry and I suggest a tribunal of three financial experts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>And a reversal of the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am not happy with these figures, not by a long shot. Something stinks here.  This is only the tip of the iceberg.  We have not yet begun to approach what is going on in this company. Let me give an example.  Today the Minister said that £39.5 million was guaranteed by the State.  I have a different sum.  I am sorry the Minister is not here.  In 1982 this House passed an Act guaranteeing £20 million of the debts of this company.  In 1984 we increased their borrowing from £15 million to £45 million and we allowed them another £26 million. The Minister coyly says that the position in relation to the <i>Irish Spruce</i> requires special consideration.  I will bet my life it requires special consideration.  I want to know about the <i>Irish Spruce</i>.  It is shown clearly here that there is a possible debt in regard to the <i>Irish Spruce</i> which is off balance sheet financing of a possible indebtedness of £30 million.  Let us do our sums.  There was £20 million in 1982, £26 million in 1984 and £30 million off the balance sheet for the <i>Irish Spruce</i>.  I make that a total of £76 million but the <Col N="2137" /> Minister says coyly that the figure is £39.5 million.  I am far from satisfied about those figures.  I maintain that the State is in for £76 million because of pulling this plug today.  There is a total contradiction in the figures and I wish to know precisely what the difference is?</P>
      <P>There was an answer to this problem and that answer was renegotiation, in other words, the Minister doing his job as Minister.  I think he would have succeeded in that regard because he would have been dealing with hardheaded business people in the shipping business, people who might be described almost as the toughest political sharks in any business in the world.  If they had been given to understand that the Minister meant business about liquidation, they would have renegotiated.  However, supposing the worst happened and there was a failure to have renegotiation, would it not have been correct to put in a receiver who could renegotiate, do some deals on the assets, try to bring down the State's debts and to turn the company around. Instead, the Minister panicked.  He did not wait for the committee of which I am chairman to report and now we have this very regrettable action.</P>
      <P>The Minister speaks gently about the State paying the guaranteed amount.  The company's liabilities amount to £117 million and their assets are estimated at £23 million.  That gives a £94 million deficit. If that is adjusted for a figure of £16 million as explained in the text, one arrives at a defaulting figure of £78 million. Therefore, the Minister is telling us that the State owes £78 million abroad and is not prepared to pay it.  The State owes a total of £8 billion abroad of which some £2 billion is the responsibility of State companies.  That is why my committee should be listened to.  We are trying to come to grips with that situation.  For the first time in the history of the State we are saying that we are not prepared to pay our debts abroad although there was a way out in this case.  This raises a question that must be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be more action in the semi-State companies.  There must be an overall study of them and some radical <Col N="2138" /> answers provided to their problems.  A debt of £2 billion out of a total State debt of £8 billion is frightening.  However, the answer is not merely to liquidate all those companies and to tell the people abroad that we cannot pay them.  Because it has the muscle, the State can always renegotiate. How many times do the Department of Finance renegotiate their debts and how many times do they get away with it?</P>
    <P>What we are dealing with here is a can of worms.  There are a lot of unanswered questions.  An inquiry is called for.  If we take the Minister's figure of £39 million as the State cost of closing this company, though I say the figure is £78 million, if we take the £20 million loss on the <i>Irish Spruce</i> and if we buy out the charters for, say, £95 million, we could close the company and pay all the debts for about £140 million.  Instead of taking that option and perhaps even renegotiating to bring about a decrease in that figure to perhaps £70 million or £80 million, the Government are defaulting on £78 million out of an international debt of £8 billion.</P>
    <P>There are changes needed in the semi-State companies.  Devlin must go and I say without apology to anyone that we must consider privatisation.  Had I been listened to many years ago on that subject we might not find it necessary to be debating this motion this evening.  I see nothing wrong with using private money in State ventures.</P>
    <P>This is a sad day.  I am calling for an inquiry into the affairs of this company. In a business that is cyclical one should not enter into long term charter agreements. Even the board of the company agree on that.  Why, then, did the company not sign short term charters instead of locking us into ten year ones and bringing disgrace on the country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is indeed a sad occasion.  We are talking about the death of a semi-State company who have served the State well for more than 40 years.  The Government examined the <Col N="2139" /> matter very carefully and had to come to a decision based on the facts before them.</P>
      <P>The first point I wish to make is one of a number of points of principle that need to be emphasised, that is, the enormity of the financial difficulties facing Irish Shipping Limited.  If the Government were to continue to support the company between now and 1989 the cost to the Exchequer, to the Irish taxpayer, would be £144.5 million.  At that stage there would remain on the books of the company a debt of £59 million, making a total exposure in excess of £200 million. I submit that that level of debt is not sustainable, that no Government in their right mind could sustain it.  It is too heavy for the taxpayer to bear.  Of itself that justifies the Government decision.</P>
      <P>The second point is that the primary cause of the disaster was the action by the company in entering into nine long term speculative charter agreements with companies in Hong Kong and Japan during the period September 1979 to July 1981.  They did this without the knowledge or consent either of the Minister for Transport, who is the Minister responsible for the company, or of the Minister for Finance.  To my knowledge the board of directors of the company apparently did not give their approval for these chartering commitments.</P>
      <P>It is amazing that the board of directors were not informed of the commitments the company were entering into.  That is a matter that will have to be examined fully by the liquidator.  It raises a number of questions in relation to semi-State bodies and the role of their directors.  It is their responsibility to sanction major policy issues and decisions.  It appears that in this case the proper procedure that would apply to any limited company was not adhered to.  This is not acceptable. It is somewhat frightening but it should be a salutary lesson and reminder to directors of semi-State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the Government, of course, the experience is bad.  It must be understood that semi-State bodies cannot operate outside the parameters of the State.  In other words, the responsible Minister &mdash;<Col N="2140" /> always in financial matters the Minister for Finance &mdash; must be <i>au fait</i> with and consent to major policy decisions.  Otherwise, State policy in any area, in this case shipping, could be subverted and of course that is not tolerable.  It is the ultimate responsibility of the Minister to oversee policies in his area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>If semi-State companies were to carry on their own policies without fully informing the Ministers responsible, of course budgetary policy would be impossible to implement.  That also is not tolerable under our system of democracy. On both counts Irish Shipping failed: they failed to inform the Ministers responsible and they failed to have full regard to the requirements of budgetary policy and the overall borrowing policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that, despite the renegotiation of the charter contract, in the circumstances of the market this renegotiation did not justify any other decision than the one taken.  I should like to make it clear that the Government were prepared to give limited financial support to the company in accordance with the renegotiation package.  It was too heavy a burden to bear in the circumstances of the market, and the figures the Minister gave with regard to the financial exposure of the State and the taxpayers indicate the enormity of the problem facing the company, a problem that properly could not be sustained by the Government.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping is a limited company and the debts which are guaranteed by the State will be paid by the State.  The State does not have responsibility for the partly secured or unsecured creditors of the company.  The company operated in the private enterprise sector and the State guaranteed certain moneys.  The State is not burdened with the unsecured and the partly secured creditors in the direct sense.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer <Col N="2141" /> to the comments of Deputy Wilson, the main Opposition spokesman.  He said:</P>
      <P>Without making any rash commitment in any way .... Fianna Fáil will reverse the decision when they return to office, and the sooner the better.</P>
      <P>That statement saddens me.  It was given in the Deputy's flamboyant, gesticulating manner.  It reveals once more the reason why the country is in its present state of financial difficulty.  That statement simply reiterates the irresponsible attitude of Fianna Fáil when it comes to the nation's finances.  I doubt very much if the taxpayers want to bear a financial exposure in excess of £200 million during the next five years.  It is irresponsible to make that statement in view of the facts and the information available.  It does little for the credit of the party or for the system of democracy in which we survive.  In funny terms, Deputy Wilson said:</P>
      <P>Without making any rash commitment in any way or pinning our faith in any kind of any rash future commitment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That is a false statement.  It means, &ldquo;We will do something but we will not do something if we have to do something&rdquo;. Of course that is impossible in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We take rational clear decisions and not in the terms of Deputy Wilson's statement.  He spoke about the credit worthiness of the country.  He repeatedly said:</P>
      <P>In this House Ministers for Finance from various parties have stated that our credit-worthiness is something of which we could be proud.  This action can only damage that credit-worthiness and indicates that there are times when the Government walks away from something to which they have been fully committed in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to him and to Fianna Fáil that the sense of realism of this Government <Col N="2142" /> will add substantially to the credit-worthiness of the Government on international monetary markets and will redound to the credit of the nation.  Of course Fianna Fáil can afford these things on the backs of the taxpayers.  We are not prepared to do that.  We have adopted a rational and responsible approach on behalf of the people whom we represent and on whose behalf we govern.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson acknowledges that this was a result of a disastrous error of judgment. I am glad he does because it was and it has led to the downfall of a company which had been prosperous.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to slim down the company and allow it to proceed because the financial exposure is far too great for that. It is not an option which the Government would adopt.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked: &ldquo;Are we going to be left unclothed in the shipping sense&rdquo;.  No, we will not.  We have shipping. We have the B&amp;I company.  There are more ships owned within the State than when the strategic question arose leading to the establishment of Irish Shipping. There are changed circumstances. The country is in a strategically sound position in relation to shipping.  In case of emergency we would be able to move effectively to ensure that the shipping needs of the country would be fully secured and that we would be able to control the volume of shipping necessary for the security of the economy and of our people.</P>
    <P>The Government acted responsibly. Fianna Fáil's position is unacceptable, untenable and downright irresponsible. It is a reflection of the lack of concern which they have always shown for the taxpayer and people.  We have taken a harsh decision and a difficult one but it was one which was responsible and in the long term interest of the people.</P>

      <P>The Government's decision must be one of the saddest, if not the saddest, to come before us.  The reasons for setting up Irish Shipping, the maintenance of it, the support given to it, the need for it as a shipping and strategic exercise for the country and as a way to support the people in the event of hostilities which might occur, have already been outlined by some of our speakers.  There is a lot of nostalgia attached to this.  Irrespective of the colouring Government speakers may put on this decision, they will forever be remembered by the people as the Government who put an end to Irish Shipping.</P>
      <P>Our credibility abroad not only in the field of shipping but generally will come into question as a result of the Government's action.  The Government had opportunities available to them which would have enabled them to avoid this decision.  The Government decided to ride rough shod over the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies and their report and recommendations. I understand their report was to be presented to the House within two weeks.  How can the Government countenance their action in the face of the fact that a committee set up with all-party agreement and which was much lauded by the Government was about to present its report?  In one fell swoop they have undermined the activities of all committees set up to deal with various matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the request made that a full inquiry ought to have been held into the activities of Irish Shipping before this decision was taken.  Government speakers have indicated that the people will thank them and compliment them for saving them, as it was put, from a further loss of money.  If the Government believe that they are more naive than even I believed.  Their credibility was much lauded by the national handlers with the assistance of the media, but how much credibility is there now in the Government after their short term in office? Today's decision must be the worst decision taken by them.  This Government are abrogating their responsibility to the nation while they propound the idea that <Col N="2145" /> they are in support of the nation and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>We were issued some weeks ago with a massive document, <i>Comprehensive Public Expenditure Programmes 1984</i>.  In it I read about the deficit of Irish Shipping for the year to 31 March 1984.  It amounted to £34 million, over twice the loss for the previous year.  It had been expected that the company would make a substantial loss but not one as big as that reported.  The loss reflects the savings of the company, repayable and non-payable, accruing in 1983-84 as a result of negotiations with the owners of vessels on charter.  The loss also reflects a provision of £9.5 million in respect of foreseeable losses on year end charter hire commitments.  The report stated that the survival of Irish Shipping was at stake. How do the Government square what they did today with their own publication?</P>
    <P>In his statement today the Minister twice mentioned this famous &mdash; other people might label it differently&mdash;<i>Building on Reality</i>.  Nevertheless, in that document, there is not one reference to Irish Shipping.  It is time the Government realised that they should not go any further with their public relations exercise to try to convince Members of the House and the public that their plan has something to offer.  The Government should not have the gall to mention <i>Building on Reality</i> when they are presiding over the demise of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>What is the answer to the problem?  In view of all the information available, why was there not a renegotiation?  Why was the company liquidated?  Why did they not send in a receiver, which was done in other companies, in an effort to keep them going?  It should be a priority of the Government to keep an Irish shipping company, not necessarily the present company but one set up on the same lines as this company was set up in 1941 and which performed effectively on our behalf until very recently.  The solvency and credibility of the nation will suffer irreparable damage by the Government's action.</P>
    <P>There are already 220,000 people <Col N="2146" /> unemployed.  What are the Government going to offer them and to the young people I see in the Gallery when they leave school?  What programmes, encouragement and incentive are there for them?  The Government preside daily over the closure of firms.  Unemployment is our biggest problem and the famous plan tells us that by the end of 1987 the same number will be out of work as at present.  That is negative thinking by the Government, which is reflected by events day after day and week after week.</P>
    <P>With the closure of Irish Shipping there will be about 800 jobs directly affected in supporting industries.  It is a litany of failure and if that is what the Government calls building on reality, God help our future workforce.  The sooner we have a change of Government the better and as we say in Irish &ldquo;Más maith is mithid&rdquo;. The Government should do the honourable thing: resign and give Fianna Fáil some years to steer the ship of State on a course of developing the economy in order to restore confidence, to create incentives and, above all, to give credible leadership which is sadly lacking at present.</P>

      <P>Irish Shipping is not at stake tonight.  Irish Shipping Limited have been declared insolvent for very good reasons to which I will address myself in a few moments.  Let us not confuse, as the Deputy opposite tried to do until he ran out of time, the two issues. <Col N="2147" /> In 1941, when Seán Lemass was Minister for Supplies, he established Irish Shipping and there was virtually no Irish tonnage in registered ownership available to the State of Éire as it was then in time of war.  It was agreed at the end of the war that the strategic tonnage which was required to keep this country alive with basic necessities was 200,000 dead weight tons of shipping having regard to the speed and turn around time of the vessels available after the war.</P>
      <P>That figure was reviewed in 1963 and the estimate of what we needed in terms of shipping capacity in strategic terms was measured as 120,000 dead weight tons.  Today there are 60 Irish vessels registered in the ownership of Irish companies plying in and out of Ireland with a gross dead weight tonnage of 180,000 tons.  Let me nail the first debating lie in the House tonight by the Opposition Deputies.  Irish Shipping is not at stake. Our strategic requirements are not at stake.  We are debating the issue of the insolvency of Irish Shipping Limited. That word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; is not there for decoration. There is no requirement that obliges us to stick the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; on to the end of a company.  What does the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; mean and, by extension, what do the words &ldquo;limited liability companies&rdquo; mean?  In this instance, it means it is not an open pit.  It means that the Irish taxpayers, whom we represent, will not forever have to bail out companies who fail because of disastrous decisions.</P>
      <P>The strategic requirements of this country are guaranteed and B &amp; I, which is in State ownership, have six vessels servicing this island which can more than adequately cover our immediate strategic requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make four basic points as to why the Government took this very difficult decision, which was not taken lightly but with heavy hearts. People's jobs will be at risk as a consequence of this decision.  The first reason is that the Government who have the honour to be in office at the will of the people were not prepared to throw away approximately £155 million on an enterprise which, having spent money which we do not have, the company would still be in debt to the tune of £59 million with no apparent prospect of earning the revenue to service the debt and with assets of approximately between £20 million and £30 million.  One cannot be more precise than that.  We were not prepared to do that but Fianna Fáil should indicate if they are prepared to do it.</P>
      <P>The second reason we were not prepared to do it was that the decisions which brought about this sorry state of affairs, the liabilities incurred in speculative overseas ventures, were undertaken without the express approval, knowledge or understanding of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Transport and now the Minister for Communications.  No sanction was sought or obtained.  What does that actually mean?  It means that people went into the money market and borrowed money on foot of a perceived credit the Irish Government would underwrite without the express approval, permission or consent of the people who would ultimately have to pick up the tab. That means all of us who work in this building and all the people in the Gallery. We are talking about £155 million on which we will get no return.  It was done in the name of all of us but without our knowledge or approval.  Nobody underwrites that kind of decision.  That was the second reason we reluctantly took this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My third point is that this has not been taken lightly or suddenly.  On the first day <Col N="2149" /> I had the honour to become a member of the Cabinet, the matter of Irish Shipping was on the agenda in the form of a confidential memo.  For the past 12 months we have been aware of and concerned about this problem, as have many people in Irish Shipping.  The Minister was quoted by Deputy Wilson as having come to this House earlier with the Bill dealing with Irish Shipping.  We have made money available.  We thought there might be an upturn in shipping rates and we put up money in an attempt to avert what we did not want to happen; but we have, reluctantly, come to the decision it would be good money after bad.  We have explored, painfully and extensively, all the possible less difficult options.  There is no soft option in this case unless Fianna Fáil want to tell us where they will get £155 million.</P>
    <P>We are an independent sovereign State and we have a reputation throughout the world.  We have an obligation as a democracy to our citizens and to our creditors. We need to borrow money abroad and our people who are abroad, whether business people, ordinary tourists or members of State companies, need to have a credit-worthiness that does not immediately raise questions as to whether the name of Ireland can be trusted.  I want to say clearly, and I know the Minister for Communications will affirm what he said in his statement earlier today in this House, that the State, exercising its sovereign functions and on behalf of the people, will meet in full and to the last penny every liability for which we are directly accountable and to which we have given our assent.</P>

However, it is tragic for the people who work in this enterprise, and particularly for those who were not parties to this decision and who will be the victims. They will be without jobs and we must see how they can find new work in the context of the policies of the Government. I have confined my speech to ten minutes in the interest of ensuring a full debate.  I hope the House will accept the points I have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my thanks to the Minister for Labour for the gentlemanly way he has facilitated me and also to the Minister for Communciations for the manner in which he has facilitated me.</P>
      <P>What is absolutely deplorable about the way this matter has been dealt with is that we suddenly come to this situation tonight where the Irish Government solemnly pulls the plug on an Irish State company and leaves unpaid enormous debts owed by that company.  In that respect they have damaged appallingly the credibility of the country and its credit-worthiness. The grounds on which it was done is that the company is hopelessly insolvent and that the State should not be expected to pick up the debts of £145 million plus £59 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree Irish Shipping is hopelessly insolvent, but so are CIE, NET, Irish Steel and many more State companies I could name.  All of them are hopelessly insolvent and all of them are incurring enormous losses.  Are they now, or more importantly their bankers, to expect that the Government will decide to pull the <Col N="2151" /> plug on them?  We should remember this is not the first time the Government have reneged on their commercial obligations. They did it 12 months ago in October 1983 when they reneged on the obligations of Chipboard Products Limited in Scarriff.  To this day the unsecured creditors remain unpaid.  Some of them are in my constituency: they are very small people who are owed £500 or £1,000 they can ill-afford to do without.  They are unpaid because they were innocent enough to deal with the Irish State through one of the State companies; but the Minister for Finance, who got a debenture signed five days before he put in a liquidator, has been paid in full.  The Bank of Ireland has also been paid in full.</P>
    <P>This is the second time in 12 months that the Government have reneged in a way that would bring down the wrath of the Labour Party and many others on private directors if they acted in a similar way.  We are told by the Minister for Communications that there are assets of approximately £23 million available to meet estimated total liabilities of £117 million of which £39.5 million are guaranteed. They should liquidate to dispose of the assets of the company to the best advantage and settle with unsecured creditors. What possible chance have unsecured creditors of getting one single cent? The assets described as £23 million do not even cover the secured creditors or anything like it, but of course there will not be assets of £23 million because this is not an ordinary liquidation.  This is a liquidation of a shipping company who have their assets spread all over the world.  I do not know where Irish Shipping ships are tonight, but wherever they are I can guarantee the House that at this hour now, 8.40 p.m. Irish time, every one of those has an admiralty writ nailed to its mast.  Whoever happens to be owed money in that country has taken proceedings and has had each of those ships arrested by the admiralty authorities of the country in which she happens to be lying at present.  Nobody outside of that country and the creditors of that country <Col N="2152" /> will get anything.  The liquidator in Ireland gets nothing because this liquidator does not exercise jurisdiction outside our own jurisdiction and very probably none of those ships is within our jurisdiction tonight.  I believe most of them are trading in the Pacific between Japan and the west coast of the US and they are in the process of being arrested there now. Those not in port will be arrested as soon as they dock.  What is to happen to the crews of those ships?  They will be told to get off by the admiralty marshal and they can make their own way home from Yokohama or wherever they happen to find themselves.  What do the Government care about that kind of situation? No more than they care about the unsecured creditors of this company or the unsecured creditors of Chipboard in Scarriff.</P>
    <P>Is this not the greatest example we have ever seen of uncommercial people dabbling in commerce with the most appalling consequences for this nation, not just financial consequences for the company and the taxpayer in the short term but appalling long term consequences? What are the bankers of these other insolvent State boards doing tonight?  Are they not on the telephone saying that they will not accept letters of comfort any more, that they will not accept assurances from officials or Ministers, that they want no guarantees in writing from the Minister for Finance and if they do not get them they are going to close the company down?  In the case of Irish Shipping Limited it is only the written guarantees of the Minister for Finance that are being honoured and everything else that is being dishonoured, and Ireland's name and honour are being dishonoured.</P>
    <P>What would commercial people in this situation have done?  They would have gone out a year or 18 months ago as soon as it was known that these charter parties were a disaster and they would have negotiated out of them to the best possible extent.  They would have explained to the people concerned that Irish Shipping Limited were insolvent and that the question of liquidating them would have <Col N="2153" /> to be taken into consideration.  Commercial people being what they are, those who were entitled to these enormous bonanzas at the expense of the Irish taxpayer, would have done what they would have done with a normal commercial company.  They would have cut their losses and they would have enabled the bankrupt shipping company to cut its losses also and avoid damaging the name, credibility and credit-worthiness of Ireland.</P>
    <P>What would sensible men of business who know how to deal with these things have done originally if they had to charter nine ships between 1979 and 1981?  God only knows why they had to do it, but if they had to do it what would a normal, properly run shipping line do?  They would form a separate company for each single ship that they chartered.  That is the practice universally throughout the world.  How many of the most enormous companies would be gone insolvent and in liquidation today were it not for the fact that each of their charter parties was with a separate company and when one of the charters went wrong it did not bring down the whole lot?  What did our marvellous men, who are not men of enterprise but can still spend hundreds of millions of pounds of the Irish taxpayers' money, do?  They signed all the charter parties in the name of a semi-State body because it is easier to do it and up to then no Irish Government had ever reneged on its commercial obligations.  Now every one of those charters goes down and brings down the whole lot.  If separate companies had been formed for each of them Irish Shipping Limited would still be solvent and in existence, the 1,300 people would still be in employment and we would not be in this dreadful situation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the loss of a company, the most serious thing is now that no banker can be sure, after this having happened twice in two years, once in a small national company and secondly in a large international company, that the Irish Government in future will ever respect their operations.  Since it became clear 12 to 18 months ago that this was the situation, it could have been negotiated <Col N="2154" /> and the damage to the good name of this country could have been avoided.  That is what the Minister for Communications, the Minister for Finance and the Government stand indicated on tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the House and the country are becoming accustomed to the introduction of emergency legislation by this Government to deal with their little problems, and the country is getting used to the number of liquidations and closures that have taken place in this economy since the Government took office.  When we consider that some 700 businesses were liquidated last year and the same number to date this year, people might be bludgeoned into expecting that it is quite normal for a Government to take the action that this Government took.  However, we must place this liquidation in perspective.  For the first time by a deliberate decision of Government a major semi-State operation, working satisfactorily in the Irish economic interest since 1941, has been put to the wall. When one of the Ministers of State this evening referred to the death of this company, Irish Shipping Limited, he could have said that it was the shortest death notice ever to come about in the bereavement columns for any kind of business &mdash; eight short words condemned this company to the ashes of liquidation for all time.  Who would have thought that a day would ever come for a maritime country that they would pull the plug on what can only be termed a lifeline for the economic survival of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2155" /> There has always been a policy of commercial freedom in shipping in this country. Ships of every nation were free to trade in and out of the ports of Ireland. That freedom was based on the sure policy that seaborne trade plays a dominant role in Irish economic affairs.  We are not landlocked.  There must be two sea journeys before our exports reach the mainland of Europe, those exports depending on seaborne traffic to get to their destination.  What are we saying to some of those exporters, people dependent on sea routes for the £12 billion worth of exports that had to be carried last year, most of them by seaborne traffic, to their destination?  The answer that the Government have to that necessity for Irish economic life is that they are not interested in maintaining its continuation.</P>
    <P>This company were set up in 1941 when there was then a wartime need for a national shipping facility to be made available.  I ask the Government and the Minister if there is any greater stability in the world of politics in 1984 than there was 43 years ago.  I put it to them that there is a greater strategic need for Irish Shipping Limited to be kept alive today than at any time in the last 43 years. The mandate that was there to provide 155,000 dead weight tonnes was the minimum. It was stated in the Acts that set up this company, the Acts from 1947 to 1959, that 155,000 tonnes was the minimum dead weight requirement to keep a strategic sea traffic fleet available for our commercial interest to survive.  They were mostly engaged in deep sea voyages and time-charter business.  That point is being missed this evening.  I am saying to the Minister that there is no substitute tonnage available to cater for the dead weight required for deep sea voyages.</P>
    <P>Almost all of the money Irish Shipping earned was made in hard currencies, mostly in dollars.  It is not true to say, therefore, that the exchange rate for the dollar has had as big a bearing on the need for this liquidation as the Minister would like to convince people.  They made their money on the time-charter <Col N="2156" /> business in the dollar currency and for that reason there was no need to pull the plug at this time.</P>
    <P>The annual profit made by Irish Shipping Limited in the five years 1974 to 1979 was £1.988 million and in 1978-79 the company profit before tax was £3.027 million.  If the company in hard trading terms, and difficult recessionary times, was capable of accumulating that kind of profit margin over a long number of years there was no reason why it could not have been restructured in modern terms to continue to make money in the national interest over the next number of years. Irish Shipping has shares in other businesses, but they were not referred to by the Minister.  The company has minority shareholdings in stevedoring, offshore servicing and coastal shipping and I should like to know what will happen to those interests.  Is the Minister saying that the liquidator is to pull the plug on all those interests thereby creating a bigger dilemma downstream than the Minister referred to this evening?</P>
    <P>In all his statement the Minister devoted only two lines to the fate of the 950 people who will be dispossessed of their jobs because of this action.  It is not just a question of 950 people because we have to take their families into consideration. We can take that as resulting in 5,000 people being disadvantaged because of this move.  They are not just ordinary labouring class people but highly skilled technicians, people who hold international certificates in shipping who will be exported now on the emigrant ship, probably in one of their own carriers, to the benefit of other economies. Irish Shipping had probably the most advanced training scheme for its personnel of any shipping operation in Europe. We have been told that there is no hope whatever of taking up the slack for these highly skilled people.  Did the Minister consider it worth his while to offer these people some alternative prospects of getting some satisfaction from the disastrous and dastardly blow he has struck them this evening?</P>
    <P>The economic strategy of the Government as outlined in the national plan is <Col N="2157" /> now clearly viable.  We know now what the reality is: the reality is to auction off pieces of beloved Ireland in small lots and the auctioneering started today.  The Minister will make a very bad auctioneer if he is going to sell out Irish interests in the fashion he adopted this evening.  Is this the way the Government propose to balance the books next year?  Is it their intention to sell off our interests and create as much liquid cash as possible so that they can balance their books and meet their targets in the plan?  That is not what the Irish people expected from <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P>The Minister said that the State will not be liable for all the money due by the company, only those guaranteed by the famous letters of comfort.  I must put it to the Minister that it is common knowledge in the streets that when the memorandum to shut down Irish Shipping went to the Department of Finance the officials there advised against it.  I challenge the Minister to tell the House if following his private memorandum to the Department of Finance the advice was against it on the basis that this would harm our international credit rating.  The position is that the Government are acting against the advice of their own strategists in the Department of Finance who knew well that this action would have a detrimental effect not just on our credit abroad but on our credibility in the world of economics.</P>
    <P>It is now coming home to a lot of us why Deputy Cluskey left the Government.  It was not the Dublin Gas deal that sent him out.  He knew what was being planned down the road for all these companies and all the liquidations and emergency legislation that would have to be put through the House to accommodate the monetarist policies of the Fine Gael Party.  Are we to see in the near future a succession of emergency legislation and liquidations to accommodate the Minister?  What about Irish Steel and NET?  I presume Údarás na Gaeltachta is next because that is rumoured around the corridors of power.  I presume B&amp;I will get short shrift before too long. What about Aer Lingus, a company that is up to its neck in debt?  There was a <Col N="2158" /> public relations compaign in Buswells Hotel recently when we were told that they would have to borrow over the next ten years to get new planes in the region of £500 million.  How are they going to get that money?  They will have to borrow it on the world market.  The way they can do that now will not be with a letter of comfort but by a direct cash grant from the Government.  There is not a financial agency in the world that would give a semi-State company so much money when they see the treatment the Government are dishing out to this one for the sake of a few miserable paltry pounds.</P>
    <P>Will the Government close down the ESB generating stations?  That company has borrowed £1 billion and a lot of it is unsecured and not covered by letters of comfort.  I suppose that in due course when the heat runs out of the Government they will put through the usual legislation and put them into liquidation.  Is it not extraordinary what the Labour Party can do?  Is it not extraordinary the amount of punishment they can take. They are really the political punchbag of the Coalition.  There has not been a word concerning the fate of the workers from the Labour Party, the group who were sent in here as the pseudo-socialists to protect the living standards and the interests of the workforce.  However, they are sitting meekly by and have the cheek to come here to try to defend what can only be regarded as an ultra right wing Tory monetarist attitude to the financial gearing and structuring of a semi-State company.</P>
    <P>We must consider the cost in unemployment and pay-related benefits to the 950 people being thrown on to the dole queue.  What will be the loss of personal taxation to the Revenue?  When those things are put into perspective it will not be too much short of the money necessary to keep the company alive.  I should like to take the Minister to task about some of the points raised in his speech.  It is obvious that it was a hastily compiled document, an eight page notice of death to a semi-State company.  Some of the assumptions in it remind one of the false and dubious assumptions that exist in the <Col N="2159" /> national plan we put to rest recently.  The Minister told us that there may be assets of £23 million while the estimated total liability was £117 million.  That is some statement from the Minister pulling the plug on 1,000 people.  The Minister's speech is full of estimates and no positive figures.  One would have thought that when a decision of this magnitude was being taken it would be possible to set down for the House precisely the figured involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister also told us that it is hoped that Irish Continental Line will be able to continue to give a service.  Let us see the impact that will have if there is no guarantee or commitment.  Remember the liquidator has the right to sell off the 75 per cent share in Irish Continental Line Limited.  If he does that, if that share is picked up by somebody who wishes to close down that service &mdash; affecting the services from Rosslare and Belfast &mdash; we will end up in a position in which there will be literally no tourist traffic of any significance coming into this economy in the next ten years.  There is no guarantee given in this, except the hope expressed that it will be able to remain profitable. Of course, in that kind of terminology, we can take it that, if it is not found to be profitable, it will be the next to go.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about a strategic fleet being available to deal with what we regard as necessary to service our exports.  The Minister for Labour comes into the House and tells us about the 60 ships registered in Ireland with a certain amount of tonnage.  I want the Minister to know that, of the 60 ships registered in this country, 90 per cent are under 3,000 tonnes dead-weight.  They are the kinds of ships that he says are capable of international sea voyages on the high seas around the world, capable of carrying the £12 billion worth of exports from this country.  What kind of capacity at all does he think he has?  Then he says he regrets the loss of jobs and talks about current strategic needs.  I will tell him what are the current strategic needs.  The needs of this country are the same as they were in <Col N="2160" /> 1941 when this company was first established. If anything, perhaps they are greater because we must maintain a presence to keep our share of the economic market of the world.</P>
    <P>I labelled this Coalition Government in the course of the national plan debate here as the national undertakers.  All I can say is that we see them in action again here this evening.  They have put in the grave diggers to dig the grave for Mother Ireland; the auction is on, we condemn it and we are not going to allow it on behalf of the electorate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If this Government are described as the undertakers and grave diggers, perhaps we might consider that the Fianna Fáil Government, who were instrumental in bringing about the situation in 1980, were those who injected the lethal dose because the precipitate action quite clearly that put Irish Shipping Limited in their present situation was triggered off by disastrous commitment to take on nine ships from Hong Kong brokers &mdash; ships that would employ not Irish but foreign crews, that would give Irish taxpayers a commitment into the future through an Irish company, to pay out £145 million over that period. Deputy Reynolds who was the Minister at the time, and his colleague, Deputy Flynn, waxed loud and lyrical here on this subject but it was they and the Government of which they were members who presided over that contract&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which triggered off that situation.  Deputy Reynolds came in here and said that he did not know that the board of Irish Shipping Limited were taking this step.  As a fellow Member of this House, of course I accept his word but perhaps he should have known; after all, he was the then Minister.  He could call in any member of that board, go into Irish Shipping Limited, or send his numerous officials in there to check out what was what and ascertain exactly what was going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To those of us who are backbenchers, <Col N="2161" /> who are not familiar with the detailed workings of Ministers, their staff, handlers and so on we are at somewhat of a disadvantage.  This happening is a debacle; nobody can deny that.  But we, as backbenchers on both sides of the House, require that if some lesson is to be learned from the position obtaining, we must find out what went on there.  It must come out with no cover-up at any level, whether it be Deputy Reynolds, as Minister, his predecessor, or his successor, if such be the case, and I do not mind whoever or all it may be; or the civil servants in that Department at any level, or the officials, directors, chairmen or whoever of Irish Shipping Limited, any of them.  Let us have it all out and see what went on there.</P>
    <P>I find the whole situation rather mystifying. There is a cloud, a haze surrounding it.  By no means have we had it all out yet.  I am certain of that, if of nothing else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We know it has been suggested that there was one member of the board of Irish Shipping Limited who went in head first into this transaction.  I do not know whether that is right but, if it is, surely the position is that the board of Irish Shipping Limited had to approve of that, otherwise they would not be bound by it.  Or is it the situation that they gave authority to one single man to undertake commitments of this nature without the prior or subsequent authority of the board?  That would seem to be incredible but let us have it out, what was it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it the position that the board of Irish Shipping Limited have unlimited authority without reference to the representatives of the taxpayers?  Had the Ministers of the day and this House unlimited authority to undertake any commitment without the authority of the Minister?  Is <Col N="2162" /> that the position?  I do not know but, if so, let us have it out.  Is it not the position that any Government, at the time that Deputy Reynolds was Minister, or that of his predecessors or successors; is there nothing that they could bring onto the Statute Book that would ensure that any commitment over and above a certain amount would be subjected to the prior authority of the Minister and of the Government?  Would that not be written into the Act, making it <i>ultra vires</i> that commitments over a certain amount required prior authority?  For example, in the banking system, there is a hierarchical situation.  One can go into one's bank manager and he can grant one an overdraft up to X£s; that is his authority. But if he wants approval for a higher amount then he must telephone upstairs. There is a sensible, basic arrangement obtaining.</P>
    <P>What is going on in this situation?  Is there unlimited power vested in these boards to undertake any commitment to any extent whatever?  Irish Shipping Limited was a very fine company, did magnificent work and I pay them a tribute over many years for having done so for this country.  They did the task allotted to them of running ships and operating them.  There was little or no problem with the company until they changed from being a shipping company and set off into the realm of speculation, speculation of fluctuating shipping rates.  That was the situation that triggered this off.  I want to know who was involved in that.  Were they board members, civil servants or whoever?  If it was a civil servant situation, then I would say the Minister of the day was responsible for those civil servants because that is the system we operate.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly there have been problems with the company for quite some time.  We are now in a liquidation situation. Was that not apparent earlier this year?  What of the £4 million extra poured down the drain earlier this year?  What is the explanation of that?</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds suggested that liquidation was inappropriate.  He posed the question: why was a receiver not put into this company instead?  As I understand <Col N="2163" /> the position, the only person or company who can put a receiver into a company is the holder of a debenture, that it is a debenture who puts in a receiver.  Therefore the question must be posed: was there a debenture over the assets of Irish Shipping Limited?  Can somebody tell us that?  Did the Minister take the debenture when funds were secured to this company? Where is that debenture?  Was it taken and, if it was not taken, why not? Why was it that, when taxpayers' money was provided for this company, the normal commercial practice of taking a debenture to secure it was not engaged in?</P>
    <P>We are now in a most appalling situation in which the country is faced with taking a decision as to what should now be done, faced with continuing debts amounting to some £145 million which in effect would be drawn off the Irish taxpayer in the four of five years ahead, to be siphoned off for the Hong Kong shipbrokers who quite clearly knew a great deal more about the market prospects than did the advisers at the disposal of Irish Shipping Limited.  Is that what is to be done?  Are we to raise £145 million of taxpayers' money to be siphoned off to Hong Kong?  Or is it the situation that those £145 million could be put to better use providing employment here on ships that would be manned by Irish people on other ventures?  Remember that the Government must be expected not just to liquidate Irish Shipping Limited, full stop.  There is £145 million which will be saved if that goes through.  That £145 million must be seen to be redirected towards the creation of Irish employment on Irish ships and in Irish industries that will be of lasting and permanent productive benefit for this country.  I want to know what that strategy will mean.  There is no reason why this country may not and will not in the future have a shipping company.  That must be done and that can still be now, and I will be looking to see what proposals come forward in this respect.</P>
    <P>One wonders what the reaction would have been if the French had been faced <Col N="2164" /> with the situation of siphoning off £150 million.  Would they have been reluctant about taking steps to secure their own national interests?  The Germans, hard nosed business people, how would they have reacted?  How would the Italians or the Dutch have reacted?  Our problem is that over the years we have been the gentlemen of Europe.  We kept all the rules.  We never transgressed any import/export regulations laid down by the EC.  The French, no problem; the British, no problem; the Germans, no problem; but not us.  We were the gentlemen and we suffered for it.  That is one of the reasons why we have the second highest unemployment rate in Europe and why our rate of inflation is so high. We kept the rules while the other countries did not.  We entered into a bargain with these countries and we were the gentlemen.</P>
    <P>Maybe this will show that more than one can play that game.  We are going to show them that Irish interests and jobs are paramount.  Let us proceed on that basis and not just say that this story ends with the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited.  This country will have shipping in the future, and the sooner we get this organised in a proper manner the sooner we will have those ships going again, and I am optimistic that they will go again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just heard from Deputy Taylor an amazing exposition of right wing Tory philosophy.  I was astounded to hear this type of monetarist <Col N="2166" /> view expressed by a Labour Party member which is at variance with the principle of State intervention to lift our economy, to provide essential services and to ensure that there is the fullest employment possible in the country.</P>
      <P>In the thirties and forties Fianna Fáil were backed by a decent Labour Party and we established State-sponsored bodies like Bord na Móna, Irish Shipping Limited and Aer Lingus.  To ensure success in a commercially orientated State-sponsored body we gave them a degree of commercial freedom.  As Minister for Transport and Power I presided over the affairs of Irish Shipping Limited in the seventies when they were making a big profit.  They were able to make that profit because I and previous Fianna Fáil Governments gave them this commercial freedom.  Time after time during that period we heard nothing but compliments from all sides of this House about how successfully this company was operating. It is essential that State-sponsored bodies when trading abroad have a certain degree of commercial freedom.  Now that the wheel has turned and the company has run into trading difficulties, there is a loud scream from people like Deputy Taylor who do not acknowledge that this commercial freedom has enabled these companies to operate successfully abroad.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping Limited was established in 1941 but only ran into financial problems in the last two years.  I want the Government to acknowledge that these State-sponsored bodies operated successfully abroad because of this commercial freedom and because we had confidence in them.  In the decent days of the Labour Party, which I would like to see again, Fianna Fáil Governments were supported by the Labour Party when we were establishing these State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the crudest possible legal mechanism has been adopted to deal with an admittedly difficult financial position, that is, the liquidation of this company. That procedure is adopted only by businessmen of doubtful character.  It is not the attitude that should be adopted by a <Col N="2167" /> responsible Government who depend on their reputation for their creditworthiness and respect abroad.  That is not the way for a Government to do business. For many years the Irish Government had a very good reputation and their creditworthiness was beyond reproach.  The successful operation of our State-sponsored bodies trading abroad helped to build this reputation.  Many of our State-sponsored bodies raised most of their current expenditure and a large share of their capital on the open market without any letter of comfort or without any Exchequer guarantees.</P>
    <P>When the Government start to take this type of action against one State-sponsored body it puts every other State company in serious jeopardy as far as their creditworthiness is concerned.  We have dealt drastically with one company with a skilled workforce of about 1,000.  These people have acquired their skills under excellent training schemes run by the company in conjunction with the trade union movement.  This Government are liquidating this company and as a result the people with these skills will leave this country.  Let there be no mistake about it, our present high emigration is something we cannot afford.  This is being totally clouded and ignored by the Government in so far as various documentation is concerned, especially in the recent document we have been discussing.  Most of these skills will have to go abroad.  Taking the numbers on a three to one ratio we are talking about 1,000 people losing their jobs but about 3,000 to 4,000 being affected when we think of the families involved.  The workers have acquired skills and training by reason of having been employed by this progressive company but they will have to leave the country quickly to seek work elsewhere because of the inevitable commitments they have as a result of the kinds of jobs they have had down through the years.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other State companies with a far higher labour force than the one we are talking about and who rely on a high creditworthiness abroad.  I refer to Aer Lingus, for instance.  That <Col N="2168" /> company employ 5,000 people.  They are financed largely in regard to their commercial operations abroad on the basis of Exchequer backed guarantees but largely by reason of the goodwill they have generated as a viable and commercially successful enterprise.  Those jobs, too, are in jeopardy now.  Do the Government appreciate what is involved?  One can apply this argument also to the B &amp; I, a company who are almost entirely dependent on their earnings from commercial dealings abroad.  Again, they are a company who do not run every other day to the Department of Finance seeking an Exchequer backed guarantee or a letter of comfort.  They carry out their commercial practice day after day and this involves the confidence of lending institutions, merchant banks, insurance companies and so on.  All of this is being ignored.</P>
    <P>In that respect also, NET are another major employer, as also are the ESB, who have always borrowed substantially outside the Exchequer umbrella.  Bord na Móna, too, have borrowed in that manner.  The Government must not have been aware of what they were doing when invoking the liquidation process in this case.  They did not do so recently in regard to another case.  If there were some legal reason for their not being able to appoint a receiver in this case we would have facilitated the passage of legislation for the appointment of some person to manage the firm, someone who would try to trim it and make a go of it and who would at least have honoured the financial commitments that were entered into.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Government brought in legislation dealing with the PMPA in exactly that manner.  They appointed an administrator who is carrying out in a way that is reasonably viable a large part of the business that existed there.  We helped in this house to ensure that the legislation went through as rapidly as possible because we realised that a matter of urgent national importance was involved.  It would have been disastrous for the whole insurance business to have put the PMPA into liquidation.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Government to <Col N="2169" /> realise the enormity of the damage they are doing to the whole future of our economy, to the future of the creditworthiness that has been built up in the name of Ireland and particularly in regard to the State companies who are engaging in exporting commercial business abroad. The whole image of the banana Republic which is engendered by this sort of action can extend to Irish private firms.  The whole country will bear some stigma because of this action.</P>
    <P>I wish Irish Shipping Limited and the Government luck in regard to the recapture of the vessels.  The company's boats are all over the world but to bring them back is another matter.  By their action the Government are bringing in all sorts of people such as those alleging to be creditors and so on.  Instead of proceeding in the way of administration or receivership the Government have used the crude instrument of liquidation.</P>
    <P>Only six months ago the Minister for Communications brought a Bill to the House for the purpose of enabling a further extension of State guarantee in respect of further loans to be entered into by Irish Shipping for the purchase of more boats and for other matters also.  At that time there was not a word about anything of this kind taking place.  The Government then expressed confidence in regard to the future of the company.  There was an acknowledgement of difficulties but, according to the Minister, these difficulties were to be resolved by way of a further injection of State guaranteed funds.</P>
    <P>The Government have been in office for two years.  During that time the problem of Irish Shipping Limited could have been tackled but instead we now have this panic decision.  The matter will now be dragged through the courts with all the damage that will entail, not only to the company involved but to other semi-State bodies and to private firms also.</P>
    <P>It is shameful that the Government should do such damage to the good name of Ireland, damage that will have massive repercussions.  The Government have lost all their feeling for what is necessary for the country.  More than anything else <Col N="2170" /> they have lost any feeling for the national interest.  Apart from the economic and commercial matters to which I have referred, it is essential in a world that is as difficult today, if not more so, than was the case in 1938-39, that we have a basic strategic fleet tonnage available. The present world scene is reminiscent of the world scene of the thirties, but a Fianna Fáil Government at that time realised the importance of having a basic strategic fleet.  That issue of national security is the one, more than all others, that we should appreciate.  The abandonment of that concept is the full indictment of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party must realise that being linked with people in Fine Gael who can make decisions of this kind has done enormous damage to the whole philosophy of that party to which Deputy Taylor and Deputy O'Sullivan belong. That is reflected already in the total withdrawal of support from the party by ordinary decent Labour Party supporters. Labour are no longer true to their roots but Fine Gael are being true to their monetarist policies.  They are behaving in the shadow of the British Prime Minister. They are behaving in the monetarist manner so beloved by the first Cumann na nGaedheal Government which a combination of Fianna Fáil and Labour ousted from public life in 1932.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The tone of my comments will be somewhat different from those I have just heard, as will the volume.  The original decision to undertake these charters is effectively inexplicable. The rates at which they were undertaken, the rates which we agreed to pay for them, at that time were at levels which were very high indeed, though slightly below the rates paid at that time for charters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must have been readily understandable to those concerned that in undertaking these charters for such long periods, when charter rates were approaching or at their peak, that an enormous risk was being taken.  The drop in the trans-shipping index between 1980 and 1982 precipitated this crisis.  It is not significantly <Col N="2171" /> different in its magnitude from the drop that occurred between 1969 and 1971 or in 1975.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there was ample warning that in chartering at these rates there was every likelihood that the position of the company would be put at risk.  It is impossible to understand how that decision could have been taken.  The action taken at that time was not known to the Government.  I say this in fairness to the Deputies opposite who during that period and almost right up to the day when the last charter was undertaken were in Government, but on the evidence available to us, despite four meetings in 1980 and seven in 1981 when Deputies opposite were in power in the latter part of the year, the chartering was being undertaken; and despite the meetings that took place between Ministers and civil servants on the one side and the board or senior management on the other, there is no record of any reference to these charters in the accounts of these meetings.</P>
    <P>It is right that the House should know that, and although the inexplicable decisions which caused the disaster were taken when Fianna Fáil were in office, as far as we can establish they were taken without the Government's knowledge.  I would not wish to state otherwise, despite the tone the debate may have taken up to now.  A very disturbing connection is that the board's minutes do not contain any reference to any board decision on the matter.  The fact that decisions involving a State company's liabilities which were in excess of £100 million could be made by an executive or executives without board approval raises most serious issues going beyond this instance. In the future we must manage our affairs having regard to the fact that such a thing could have happened without endorsement by the board or the knowledge of the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>This Government inherited the situation and earlier this year after Irish Shipping had undertaken renegotiations of some of these contracts we decided to enter into fresh Government guarantees <Col N="2172" /> which added £25 million to the State guarantees then applicable.  I believe that this decision was justified at the time by the importance of Irish Shipping and of trying to maintain it if there was a reasonable chance that it would survive, and because of the advice available to us at the time on the prospects of the company.</P>
    <P>Obviously, other views can be held. Some people would criticise us for not having acted then.  Hindsight makes such conclusions very easy.  At the time the decision seemed reasonable and justified on the basis of what we knew at that time.</P>
    <P>It is evident to everybody, including the Members opposite, that a repetition of that decision on an enormously larger scale, multiplied many times in terms of liabilities, would clearly not be justified and could not be justified in the light of what has happened since and of the advice now available to us in regard to future prospects.  It is very difficult to see how anybody seriously could suggest that we should pledge the credit of the State to the tune of £150 million on the basis of the projections for the future which we now have.  Even if that were done, at the end of it we would still have a debt-ridden company.  The total involved in amounts that would have to be pledged in guarantees and in the debts the company would have at the end would be £200 million.</P>
    <P>We have obligations to the taxpayers and obligations of public responsibility. There is a limit to the manner to which any Government can or should act in such a way as to commit the community to sums of this magnitude for objectives which are dubious and highly improbable of achievement.</P>
    <P>The advice on which these figures were based are in figures obtained by the chairman of Irish Shipping from a leading London broking firm.  It assumes an 8 per cent annual growth in revenue.  Of course that estimate could be pessimistic.  We are operating in an area in which there are wide fluctuations in rates.  If, for example, the Gulf were closed for a long period or if a world boom emerged out of nowhere it is possible that the rates would increase to a greater extent, but they would need to increase by something <Col N="2173" /> like two and a half times their present level even to break even, never mind making an essential profit.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Government would be expected to or would be justified in gambling sums like £200 million on such hypothetical eventualities as the Gulf being closed or a world boom suddenly emerging from nowhere.</P>
    <P>On the other side, that forecast could be optimistic.  I will cite two authorities on this subject.  Lloyds Shipping in July 1984 said that, despite the decline in lay-up levels of dry cargo vessels, freight rates and the high level of new ordering seem to suggest that the market is still in the doldrums and is likely to remain there for some time.</P>
    <P>If anything, that view would suggest that the advice given to us of an 8 per cent annual increase could be optimistic rather than pessimistic.  Lambert Brothers Shipping, quoted by Lloyds on 1 October 1984, warned of a renewed slump for shipping as the world economy slows down.  They advise ship owners to plan on the assumption that economic storms are brewing just below the horizon.</P>
    <P>There are authoritative views which move in the other direction, which suggest that even the advice given to us as to what the rates might be on which the assessment could be made may prove to be over optimistic.  In that situation, with so little prospect of any eventuality arising that could make this company viable, the Government must take a Government's responsibility and act.  I am sure the Members opposite would do the same if they were in Government. Whatever they may say now, I doubt very much if they would act with the irresponsibility they now claim for themselves.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the strategic fleet about which Deputy Lenihan was speaking somewhat loudly when I entered the Chamber.  I was involved in setting the target for the strategic fleet.  I was acting on a committee at the invitation of the then Taoiseach, Seán Lemass.</P>

      <P>I was advising on transport for the second economic programme.  At that time there was a target of 200,000 tons dried cargo tonnage. We inquired where that came from but no one could remember.  If I remember correctly, the file was lost.  It was suggested that we should try to estimate it ourselves.  I suggested that we should take a reasonably extreme hypothesis that the northern hemisphere was wiped out by a nuclear war leaving only Ireland with everything being imported from the southern hemisphere.  On that basis it was established that the appropriate size of the dry cargo fleet with ships of the efficiency and speed then available would be 155,000 tons.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that we are leaving ourselves without any capacity in this area is unjustified.  On the figures given to me it would appear that without the Irish Shipping fleet, but including the <i>Irish Spruce,</i> 72,000 tonnes, which is not part of the Irish Shipping fleet for technical reasons which I will not go into, the total tonnage available, exclusive of ferries and tankers, is 160,000 tonnes.  We now appear to have a total tonnage which is fractionally higher than the amount thought to be necessary over 20 years ago with less efficient ships and of a slower speed on the assumption that the entire northern hemisphere was wiped out and we alone survived.  The suggestion made by Deputies opposite that we have to keep Irish Shipping alive for strategic reasons cannot carry much weight in the light of those facts of which I have personal knowledge.</P>

      <P>Deputy Prendergast asked whether a receiver might not have been appointed and suggested he might have been able to handle this matter in a more advantageous manner.  The position is that a receiver can be appointed in law only by some person or company which has a charge on the assets of the concern in question.  We have no charge on the assets of Irish Shipping nor has any Irish bank or other institution.  That option was not open to us either directly or by way of inviting some other institution to act in a manner which would lead to the appointment of a receiver.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach spoke about the strategic fleet.  He said that it would be 160,000 tonnes deadweight including the <i>Irish Spruce</i>.  The <i>Irish Spruce</i> is 71,927 tonnes and the rest of the fleet is made up of very small boats.

      <P>The Taoiseach's speech was more a series of musings than a contribution to the debate or a justification of the decision to liquidate Irish Shipping. There are a few questions I want to ask the Minister.  I would be pleased if he would reply to them.  If Irish Shipping disposed of their assets at the value mentioned in the Minister's speech and if the amount guaranteed by the Government is paid by them what debts will remain? How much debt is the Minister walking away from?  It is important we know that.</P>
      <P>We have already said that this action on the part of the Government could do immense damage to the country.  It could do immense damage in the commercial world.  I made out the figure to be £54.5 million.  Deputy Brennan when speaking mentioned £78 million.  The Minister should let us know the figure.  This company is a State company in the full sense of that word.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister spoke about the position of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> and the Taoiseach has just referred to it.  It seems to be in some kind of never-never land. What is special about the <i>Irish Spruce.</i> What is the legal position of the <i>Irish Spruce</i>?  Is it owned by Irish Shipping or why does it deserve special mention in the Minister's speech?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought when the Taoiseach came in he would explain to the House the avenues which had been explored by the Government and the Minister in order to avoid a liquidation.  For example, was any study made of what the position would be if the company succeeded in disposing of <Col N="2177" /> the elaborate and misconceived chartering operation?  This is where the complaint which I and other speakers made is highly relevant.  Why did the Government not wait for the committee to report?  This committee had studied the case of Irish Shipping and had listened to the directors and chairman.  It had paid consultants to work hard on this matter. Why was all that thrown to the wind? Why did they not wait a few weeks when the report would have been available to them?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the value of the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> the dollar and said it was relevant to what happened.  Surely if Irish Shipping transported from the US it was paid in dollars.  Surely it was not all one way.  How could the weakness of the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> the dollar have such a deleterious effect?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this dramatic collapse.  That is a pathetic bleat.  It was not a dramatic collapse.  People knew that the chartering operation would cause trouble.  This was known to the Minister a few months ago.  When the Taoiseach was speaking he very quietly moved from the position which the Minister had in this House four months ago to the position he has today.  He did not explain how the note of quiet optimism which the Minister had four months ago became a mandate for the liquidation of this company. That deserves an explanation to the House.  Perhaps that is building on reality &mdash; liquidation into reality.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party and the workforce deserve the attention of the House.  I had a submission from the FWUI and I called the attention of the Labour members of the Government to what they said, that their workers had put so much into this company which was now being allowed to go down the chute.  It is hard for members of this union, who have contributed so much over the period of their employment with Irish Shipping, to see the company spiral downwards.  When they were putting that submission together &mdash; one would think that the Labour Party members would listen to that submission &mdash; they did not think that the death of the company was imminent and would be <Col N="2178" /> brought about by a Minister in a Government which they support.</P>
    <P>The union in their submission talked not merely about the operation of Irish Shipping but also of other allied businesses. They spoke about ship building and the effect of that on workers.  Indeed, Fianna Fáil in Government, were fully aware of that when commissioning the <i>Irish Spruce</i> and were criticised for it. They also talked about the repairing of ships and the importance of that industry in employment.  They also mentioned other spin-offs.</P>
    <P>A number of people mentioned that a receiver could have been sent in and that in a very short time he would have had the benefits of the conclusions which the all party committee would have reached. Deputy Mervyn Taylor said, in a hair splitting exercise, that it would not be possible to do that.  You need not call him a receiver, call him an administrator but do not indulge in this kind of precipitate action.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to something that is becoming apparent day after day, the attack on State companies.  If one were to look for defenders of State companies one would look to the party of James Connolly.  However, they seem to be letting those who are criticising the companies away with all kinds of attacks, a philosophy which is derived directly from a neighbouring country and from a Tory Government which attacked quangos and semi-State companies and wants to privatise across the line.  That is their entitlement in their own country, but why should we have to follow that philosophy in regard to semi-State companies, one or two of which were set up in the twenties and the vast majority in the thirties and forties by the late, lamented Seán Lemass?  Why should we go on a quango hunt just because it is popular to do so in a neighbouring country?  I am asking the Labour Party to consider their position. If they have any shreds of their own philosophy left they will not vote for the liquidation of this company on the basis that no one can have trust in a State company to develop a business and to <Col N="2179" /> make a profit.  If they do so, they are putting a nail in their own coffin.</P>
    <P>Not too long ago there was an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> which said that when Moneypoint was commissioned the amount of money which Irish Shipping could earn by carrying coal to Moneypoint would again put them in the black on their books.  What has happened to that consideration?  Will other ships be carrying the coal to Moneypoint?  Will we have any kind of a fleet to deal with that situation when the time comes?  The <i>Irish Spruce</i> is in never never land, but perhaps it can be used for that purpose.  Our original thinking in regard to that was related to the development at Moneypoint.  I should like the Minister to let us know if the ESB will have to rely on foreign vessels when the time comes.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another aspect of the debate and the speeches which were made from the Government side of the House.  Time and time again they have trotted out the figure of £145 million. Watch the papers tomorrow and you will find that that is what the handlers are going to concentrate on.  Frighten the people with the large figure.  However, the House should not forget that this figure covers a five year period, and unless my judgment is wrong, this Government will not be responsible for part of that period.  If you divide £145 by five you will see what they are talking about.  They are talking about £29 million per annum, but you must realise that the Minister when speaking today brought his head handlers to condition that people to accepting this scandalous decision by the Government.</P>
    <P>I always had a regard for the Labour Party's origins and I thought they would come down hard and fast and object to this kind of thing.  I thought they would not condone depriving workers of their livelihood in 24 hours without warning. Our ocean going fleet is being taken from us.  As Deputy Lenihan said, God knows what kind of people will pounce now on our ships and God knows who will be taking down the flag wherever our ships come in to harbour.  Will we have to <Col N="2180" /> depend on our neighbours for ships after this to bring goods to our shores?  Maybe the UK Government will let us into NATO, make us part of a large cosy family, deprive us of all freedom of movement and of all transport with which we could control ourselves in any eventuality. I am afraid that is the kind of situation into which we have been pushed by this precipitate and unreasoned attitude of the Government.  If they had put their cards on the table, if it had been debated and if we had been defeated on a vote there might be some justification for their <i>modus operandi</i> but there is nothing to be said for their actions.  Yesterday there were rumours but the Taoiseach sat there dumbly and the Minister also gave no indication that this bombshell was going to be launched.</P>
    <P>I make a final appeal to the party of James Connolly to vote with us against this liquidation, which is only the thin end of the wedge.  Every other State enterprise will also be under attack and indeed many are under attack already. Why did the Labour Party not insist that this operation should have been slimmed down?  We should pay the bills for the chartering mistake, but let us have an efficient if smaller fleet so that we can be in charge of our own destiny in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one main point I should like to have clarified by the Minister when he replies, namely, the claim that has been made by the Government and by Fianna Fáil that nothing was known of the charters in which Irish Shipping was involved.  I have been reading the 15th report, dated 3 March 1981, of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies which concerned Irish Shipping. That report had an appendix which was a submission from Irish Shipping Limited.  In that it was specifically stated that Celtic Bulk Carriers now operate as time charterers of other people's ships, thus adding to the pool of ships available.</P>
      <P>The committee's own report which was agreed by them, and presumably subsequently by the Dáil, also states on page 27, under the heading &ldquo;International Shipping Service&rdquo;:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2181" /> Irish Shipping also charters-in ships to contribute additional tonnage to the pool, depending on the demands of the market.  The latest annual report lists eight such ships on charter to the company.</P>
    <P>Are those eight ships included in the nine which the Government are talking about and which have caused this disaster?  How is it that nobody knew about them?  The claim is being made now that the Minister of the day did not know anything about them, and presumably by extension the Opposition did not know anything about them.  This is particularly odd because at the time the members of the committee were the following: Deputies Barry Desmond, Jim Fitzsimons, William Kinneally, Liam Lawlor, William O'Brien, Austin Deasy and Michael Herbert. Some of those Deputies are now Ministers in this Government.  Are we talking about the same ships that were reported on in December 1980?  The report is dated March 1981 and it states clearly that Celtic Bulk Carriers were involved in the chartering of ships and that eight ships were chartered by Irish Shipping.  If they are the same ships, why are the Government and the principal Opposition Party now claiming that they knew nothing about this business in which Irish Shipping was involved?  It appears to me there is something of a witch hunt going on.  It appears an attempt is being made to put the blame for the disaster in Irish Shipping on someone down along the line, on the head of some unfortunate junior manager, and that various people at the top in Irish Shipping and in Government are trying to wash their hands of this disaster.</P>
    <P>The entire handling of this matter has been in itself a disaster.  A very strong case has been made here tonight that renegotiation by the Government of the charters involved could have brought about a different result.  From reading a number of articles recently on the issue it appears that what the Government may <Col N="2182" /> be trying to do is to get out from under the debts and form a new company.  If that is so they should let us in on the secret, but if it is not the case they should make a commitment that a new Irish shipping company will be established to protect the strategic interests of this country.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputies for having this urgent debate, which I welcome. It may well be that the Deputies opposite would have been better prepared if they had more time and perhaps their contributions could have been more relevant.</P>
      <P>Before the Government came to the decision they weighed up very carefully every possible factor that could be thought of as part of the whole problem. Having analysed those problems, any reasonable person in looking at the figures would say there was really little choice.  I regret very much that in the main the tone of the contributions from the Opposition benches has been party political.  They have sought to make an issue of the question of the creditworthiness of this State.  If that were in question their attitude would be highly irresponsible and inimical to the national interest. Fortunately that is not an issue and is not in question.  I regret very much that we have an Opposition who see themselves as an alternative Government but who have such scant regard for the national interest as to raise questions and to drum up fears about the creditworthiness of this State.</P>

I make that clear to put the debate in perspective.  There has been a recklessly political contribution from the Opposition which I regret.

      <P>What Deputy Mac Giolla has to say usually has attached to it a certain credibility, but in this case he is wrong.  It is not 1,300 employees.  The entire Irish Shipping group employ about 854 people of whom 380 are in Irish Shipping Limited.  I can give more details in the breakdown.

      <P>I hope that it might be possible for the provisional liquidator to save some of those jobs in some respects.  Not all of those people are directly employed on the ships and there are other aspects of this, so I hope that as many of those 380 jobs as possible can be saved.  In relation to the jobs in the subsidiary companies, it is unlikely that any of those jobs will be threatened.  The probability is that those jobs will be kept. It is important that that point be gone into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the number of ships involved and which ships, there are 12 <Col N="2185" /> ships at the moment in the Irish Shipping fleet.  Seven of those are chartered-in ships, all foreign crewed and foreign owned ships.  There are five other ships, the <i>Celtic Venture</i> and the <i>Slaney Venture,</i> the other two charter ships of the nine of which we are speaking, were purchased as part of the renegotiated deal entered into at the beginning of this year. They are also foreign crewed.  The <i>Irish Cedar</i> and <i>Irish Rowan</i> are wholly owned by Irish Shipping and fully Irish crewed. The <i>Irish Spruce</i> is in a special category and also fully crewed by Irishmen.  The situation of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> is special. Deputies opposite will know that arrangements were made whereby this ship would be built in Cork at a cost greatly in excess of what it could be built for elsewhere at the time, and because of that it was agreed that the Exchequer through the funding of the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Vote of my Department between the would bear three-quarters of the leasing cost of the <i>Irish Spruce</i>.  However, the <i>Irish Spruce</i> does not belong to Irish Shipping, it blongs to the leasing company. That is why it is in a special category and remains to be considered further, as I said in my speech in the Dáil at 5 o'clock this evening.</P>
    <P>I thought that in my statement at 5 p.m. today I made as clear as possible what the financial position is.  Let me recall the figures given in my statement then.  As we understand it, the total liability of Irish Shipping stands at £117 million of which £39 million is guaranteed.  Of course, there are assets the value of which is not in judgment at this stage and will be realised only when the liquidator does whatever he sees fit to do, so we cannot be absolutely certain about the value of the assets.  That will become more manifest in time.  Of its nature it is an estimate. That is the overall position. Deputy Wilson is a teacher.  I do not think he teaches mathematics but I am sure he can do that sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to answer points raised by Deputies opposite in the debate that they requested.  The fact is that if there had not been a move a different type of liquidation might have taken place.  The decision was necessary because it was intimated to me that 20 November was the latest date by which <Col N="2188" /> the board required a decision.  I hope that makes that position clear.</P>
      <P>The question of renegotiation was raised by a number of Members as if no renegotiation had already taken place. Renegotiation started in an informal way a few days before Christmas last year and in a more formal manner in the first few days of this year.  As a result of those discussions, on 31 January last the board came to me with a proposed package. Among other things that package was based on certain assumptions.  It assumed what was considered to be a modest recovery in tramp shipping rates of 35 per cent per annum for two years.  It assumed no great deterioration in the exchange rates between the punt and the dollar. It assumed no great increase in interest rates.  On the basis of those assumptions it was suggested that Irish Shipping could manage with a guarantee of £4.063 million for this year against losses and for the next year with a guarantee of £8.19 million.  In addition there was the guarantee against the purchase of two ships, the <i>Slaney Venture</i> and the <i>Celtic Venture</i> of $12.5 million.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it clear, in response to points raised by Deputy Wilson, that the problems of the exchange rate and interest rates are only a small part of the overall position but they did add detrimentally to the picture. While what Deputy Wilson said may be true, and a lot of the receipts received by Irish Shipping were in US dollars, the fact is that most of the repayments are in US dollars.  Those repayments are a great deal larger with the result that the fluctuation in exchange rates between the punt and the dollar had some effect but I do not wish to over-state it.  The main problem was tramp shipping rates.  The 35 per cent increase in tramp shipping rates which was given as a conservative estimate never materialised with the result that the situation was worse than expected.  That is how the deterioration occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the report in front of us there is a <Col N="2189" /> projection based on the very best international shipbroking advice we can get that tramp shipping rates over each of the next five years are hardly likely to grow from a very low level by more than 8 per cent per annum.  There is a view that even that projection of 8 per cent is on the optimistic side but it must be said that it may be pessimistic.  Deputies will appreciate that given that scenario the sheer magnitude of the figures facing us were such that no Government, Minister or board appointed by him, could authorise the undertaking of these commitments. It would be incomprehensible to load that type of liability on to the backs of an already hard pressed taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I was asked today what the effect of a 1 per cent fluctuation would be.  The fact is that for every 1 per cent deviation one would get a £200,000 difference, an insignificant amount per annum.  In other words, plus 10 per cent would be £2 million less and minus 10 per cent would mean a £2 million greater debt.  We would have needed a much greater annual increase in tramp shipping rates to give this company any hope of being viable in the future.</P>
    <P>I regret, as I am sure all Members do, the events that climaxed today.  It is a sad day and particularly so for those workers in Irish Shipping who may be without jobs or whose jobs are at least under very serious threat.</P>

I should like to make it clear that the Government are very committed to State enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The improvement of the approach road to the crossing was identified as essential before automation could be proceeded with.  The necessary works were completed by Galway County Council in March 1984.</P>
      <P>The automation of Gurrane level crossing requires an order by the Minister for Communications under section 22 of the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1971.  On 1 August 1984 I agreed in principle to the making of the necessary order.  Under the legislation the costs of automating the crossing fall to be borne by CIE and Galway County Council in equal shares.  The carrying out of the work on the level crossing is a matter for CIE and as soon as the board are in a position to proceed with the work involved it will be possible for me to make the necessary order.  I have asked CIE to ensure that in conjunction with the county council the automation of Gurrane level crossing is carried out as an immediate priority.</P>

Following further inquiries it was ascertained that she had eight credited contributions in the governing contribution period and she was thus entitled to the maximum rate of £37.25 weekly.  All arrears due were paid on 19 October, 1984.  Weekly payments at this rate will continue to be made as they <Col N="2029" /> become due.  Her entitlement to pay-related benefit with flat-rate unemployment benefit cannot be decided until her reckonable earnings during the relevant income tax period are known.

For the most part claimants are required to attend once each week only to sign the unemployed register and collect their payments.  Each claimant is allotted <Col N="2044" /> a specified signing time but it appears that some claimants arrive at the employment exchange before the official opening time and queue outside.  There is no need for this and queuing could be avoided if claimants attended at their designated signing times.</P>
