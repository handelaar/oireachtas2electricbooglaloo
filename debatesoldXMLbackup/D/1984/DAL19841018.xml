      <P>Yesterday, during the course of a number of rather abusive personal remarks by the Taoiseach in regard to my good self, he spoke about my having a figment of the imagination in regard to an invitation being issued to the Army to participate in the November Armistice Day memorial service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It has arisen out of something said yesterday by the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair understands from the newspapers that there is correspondence going on between the Whips and would it not be better to leave the matter to the Whips?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is correspondence going on.  However, yesterday the Taoiseach accused me of having a figment of the imagination in regard to an invitation being extended to the Army to take part in the Remembrance Day service next month.  I want to ask him if, when he was making these remarks, he was aware of press reports &mdash; one in particular in <i>The Irish Press</i> on 2 October &mdash; which indicated quite clearly that the British Legion spokesman, Colonel Brian Clarke, said that he had rung the office of the Adjutant-General to verbally extend an invitation to attend on the same scale as last year.  The invitation, he said, would be confirmed in written form later. I want to ask the Taoiseach if that is a fact and, if so, if he is now prepared to withdraw his rather offensive remarks about my having figments of the imagination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not make any offensive or abusive remarks.  No invitation has been received in respect of this matter.  There have been some informal consultations with the Adjutant General in relation to the matter but no invitation has been received.  I would not have told the House that that was the case if it were not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach then saying that Colonel Clarke is not accurate when he says that he rang the Adjutant-General's office to verbally extend the invitation to attend on the same scale as last year?  This is a statement which has been published in a reputable newspaper and has not been denied by anybody.  If <Col N="2807" /> it is true, then I suggest that the invitation was extended to the Army to participate and that the Taoiseach has misled the House on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>One final question. Would the Taoiseach indicate if he states that an invitation as such has not been extended, exactly what was the nature of the consultations to which he has referred?  Could they be regarded as constituting an invitation, or what was the nature of these consultations?</P>

    <Title>National Economic and Social Plan: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Tánaiste on Wednesday, 10 October 1984:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the policies set out in the National Economic and Social Plan &mdash;<i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No.  1:</P>
    <P>(1) To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;deplores the failure of the Government's National Economic Plan to provide a strategy for reducing the overall level of unemployment; condemns the continued refusal of the Government to establish tax equity, and particularly its failure to ensure an adequate return from the business, farming and self employed sectors; expresses serious concern at the additional cutbacks proposed in the public service; regrets the failure of the Government to take into account the principles expressed in the recently published Irish Congress of Trade <Col N="2811" /> Unions document, <i>Confronting the Jobs Crisis;</i> and believes that the plan is basically a restatement of unsuccessful social and economic policies pursued by previous governments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Tomás Mac Giolla).</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said last night, I welcome this opportunity to debate the much heralded plan entitled <i>Building on Reality.</i> Like any plan parts of it look well on paper.  However, taking into account the circumstances in which this plan was conceived and born, it must be said that the sole objective of the plan is to keep Fine Gael and Labour united in Government for the foreseeable future.  This aim is very evident on every page, but very little thought was given to the economy.</P>
      <P>We remember the days before the plan was published when the food subsidies and land tax controversies were raging. Every Deputy and every citizen was getting ready for an election.  There were wide divisions between Labour and Fine Gael.  The partners wedded two years ago in what was described as the safest wedding were at loggerheads.  Two weeks ago a political divorce was in the air. When poverty comes in the door love goes out the window.  When there is a danger of my seat going I am not too anxious to be in Coalition.</P>
      <P>Labour wanted food subsidies re-introduced and threatened to vote against any further tampering with them.  Labour Deputies and supporters wanted a land tax imposed on farmers.  Fine Gael Deputies melted under the heat applied by the IFA on the land tax issue, agreed to oppose it and signed their names to that effect on IFA paper.  Neither the Minister of State Deputy D'Arcy, Deputy Avril Doyle, nor Deputy Ivan Yates would vote for a land tax under any circumstances. In a joint statement on official IFA paper all three of them told the farmers of Wexford and of Ireland that they would risk their political future in the farmers' interest and vote against any land tax proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2812" /> Food subsidies will be reduced still further according to the plan, a further kick in the teeth for Labour Party ideology. From my contacts with those who were former Labour Party supporters I understand that was the last straw.  Will the 25 Fine Gael Deputies who are already committed to opposing a land tax vote against it?  Will the three Wexford Deputies honour the commitment they gave to County Wexford?  They must be aware that their credibility is at stake.  If they vote with the Government today for a land tax that will be the most blatant example of white featherism ever witnessed in the political history of Wexford.</P>
    <P>Those are two simple examples of the atmosphere that existed before the plan was presented.  A sudden calm hit the water the minute the plan was launched. The plan was grasped as if it were a gift from heaven.  Members of the Coalition who the day before were threatening fire and brimstone were on their knees thanking the knight in shining armour who had saved them from electrical devastation. All that glitters is not gold and to be honest, as somebody said recently, the best part of the plan is the quality of the paper it is written on.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the biggest single industry in this nation employing half of the nation's workforce.  As such one would have expected that the plan would have dealt proportionately with the subject. The opening remarks on agriculture at page 138 remind us that the Land Commission have been abolished.  The plan reads:</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to abolish the Land Commission has already been announced.  The precise arrangements to give effect to that decision are under consideration and it is intended that implementing legislation will be placed before the Oireachtas by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>This was announced as if it were a desirable move.  It is opposed by every farm organisation and every rural organisation. The Irish Land Commission had its shortcomings, but there is still an enormous demand for such an agency to <Col N="2813" /> ensure that small farmers can have viable units.  About 100,000 farmers have units of 40 acres or less and it is evident that they have not got viable holdings.  Their only possibility of becoming viable is with the help of the Irish Land Commission. They cannot compete with the bigger farmer or the speculator who can get money to purchase land far more easily than the small farmer can.  Therefore the big farmer can get bigger, the speculator will have a field day and the small farmer will be eliminated.  It gives an opportunity to the big farmer to become a rancher, and to the doctor, or the solicitor, or the architect, or any other professional person to take up farming as a hobby.</P>
    <P>The numbers leaving agriculture each year are frightening.  Those people will find themselves on the dole queue, increasing the already unacceptable figure. Surely it must make sense to have more viable holdings.  One farm family can live on 400 acres, but so could four farm families, or five, quite comfortably with massive benefit to the State.  There would be three fewer on the dole and three times more production.  It is a scandalous decision to abolish an agency which is beneficial to the nation.</P>
    <P>There are no fresh ideas for agriculture in the plan.  One would have expected some initiative from the Government.  I must admit TB and brucellosis eradication get attention and that is desirable. The plan suggests that moves will be made to provide increased compensation; but the farmers will pay for it through extra levies, so there are no gifts there to agriculture from the Government.</P>
    <P>We have reached the era of quotas for our controlled production.  Sugar beet production has been limited since the founding of the industry, but this year particularly growers may not supply over 17 tonnes per acre even though the yield is 23 tonnes per acre.  What happens to the extra six tonnes per acre which in normal circumstances would represent the profit?  I have heard farmers say that they will at their own risk feed sugar beet to cattle even though the feed situation is already overloaded with a lessening in <Col N="2814" /> demands for feed because of the super-levy and the bumper grain harvest.</P>
    <P>The most undesirable milk levy has caused untold damage to confidence in the farming industry.  Farmers are confused, not knowing the exact position in relation to milk production.  The super-levy should have been vetoed in the first instance as promised in this House by the Taoiseach and subsequently by the Minister for Agriculture.  The repercussions of this levy will be for years to come. Those who caused the butter mountain should be penalised &mdash; the British, the Germans and the Dutch.  All three are allowed to import the butter mountain without a whisper from our own Government yet they agree to penalisation of our farmers.  Many times in this House and throughout the country, the Minister for Agriculture promised us that he was going to take seriously the import of cereal substitutes and particularly the imports of 80,000 tons of butter from New Zealand to Britain.  It is time that the Government stood up to their counterparts.  Obviously they have taken their inferiority complex with them.  The mistake made in the estimation of our milk output for 1983 is the greatest political cock-up in modern times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, this is the point. In the first instance it was Bailieborough, then the officials.  I think the Minister is trying to stick with the officials at this stage even though he must accept that it is his problem.  Because of his cock-up the Minister for Agriculture can no longer be trusted in Europe.  How could one trust a man who presents inaccurate figures at the negotiating table?  Oddly and coincidentally enough, on return from one of his negotiating trips the <Col N="2815" /> Minister had the gall to tell us that the Italians were notorious for presenting inaccurate figures.  His action has damaged our credibility and any attempt that this country would make in the future at negotiating will be looked upon with suspicion.  Deputy Deasy, Minister for Agriculture, must now ease the burden he has placed on the shoulders of this nation and he must consider the future prospects of our country.  He must do the honourable thing and resign.  If he has not the decency to do this the Taoiseach must call for his resignation.</P>
      <P>I am most disappointed that no effort is indicated in the plan to meet the new situation of limited production.  I have said that sugar beet and milk are limited already.  It seems now that beef and cereals will be affected by the quota on milk but they too will be subject to quotas if allowed in the not too distant future, according to eminent agriculturists.</P>
      <P>There are many problems in the cattle industry at farm level.  Many farms lack an identifiable system.  Farmer have not set performance targets for themselves for this enterprise on their farms.  There is a lack of quality in winter feed.  County Wexford has about 25 per cent in silage and I believe that in the rest of the country it is far less than that.  Very tight margins for borrowings are necessary for the systems, and it is well known that cattle income cannot support heavy investments. What then are the alternative farm enterprises?  Why was this aspect not explored in the plan, which spans three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sheep have not succeeded in even getting a mention in the plan, yet it seems that sheep hold out the best hope for farmers.  In 1983 the EC was 73 per cent self-sufficient in sheepmeat and at present rates of expansion it can be fully self-sufficient by 1990.  This gives us a golden opportunity to build up our sheep flocks to ensure that by 1990, when a quota will be imposed, we will be in a strong negotiating position.  Great Britain have set the example in this field, having over the past ten years increased their sheep flocks by 34 per cent and <Col N="2816" /> last year they increased their exports to France by 39 per cent, whereas our exports to France dropped by 9 per cent and there is a substantial fall off in sheep numbers in this country.  Encouragement must be given to this industry particularly under the heading of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The introduction of the off-farm income when accessing sheep farmers' means has had disastrous effects on the sheep industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desperate, but it is typical of the tactics of this Government, killing golden geese by the minute. Because of our ineptness at the negotiating table we have failed to attract the many aids that are there for the sheep industry.  Believe it or not, Britain takes 94 per cent of all European aid.  Sheep slaughtering is one area where much is promised and nothing delivered.</P>
      <P>The devastation of sheep flocks by uncontrolled dogs is absolutely scandalous. People who own dogs should keep them under control.  The carelessness of those who live in towns and who do not care where their dogs are deserves the full rigour of the law.  The law is not half strong enough in this matter.  This question must be taken seriously.  It represents a tremendous loss to the nation; yet the law is there to some degree to protect but it is not enforced. There are many caring, loving dog owners but there are also those who do not give a damn where their dogs are. Those people should be taken to a scene where marauding dogs have killed sheep. That is the most unpleasant sight that I have had the displeasure to witness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why this country should import in excess of £400 million worth of vegetables that we ourselves can grow.  There is no indication of the <Col N="2817" /> Government's intention to do anything about this problem.  They are too preoccupied with staying together whatever the cost.  Not alone can we become self-sufficient in vegetables, we could become exporters of vegetables.  The setting up of the potato co-operative was a start, but such enterprises must be funded to begin with to show support, to generate confidence and to lead the way.  Such projects could become self-financing.  On the other hand, 225,000 people are unemployed and the plan contains very little to suggest that this number will drop. Indeed, the plan suggests that when the plan period ends the number of unemployed will be greater than it is today. Many of the unemployed are anxious to work and they have sizeable gardens. Particularly in rural areas, surely some encouragement should be given to these people to rectify the imbalance.</P>
    <P>Land tax was vehemently opposed by Mr. Joe Rea of the IFA.  It has been included in the plan to ensure that Labour stay in Government.  The Labour Party will claim a victory; indeed, Deputy Prendergast indicated last night that the Labour Party had many victories including this one.  The figure mentioned in the plan is £10 per acre or such figure as will yield double the amount that the present system of taxation yields.  Therefore, there is no guarantee that it will be £10. It may be £15 or £20.  As I said, Mr. Joe Rea opposed this vehemently.  Now that it has been included in the plan I have not heard a squeak out of him.  Will the land tax ever be introduced?  What base will be used?  What base will guarantee its constitutionality?  I put that question to Dr. Tom Walsh, a former director of ACOT and a most eminent agricultural scientist, and he told me that it was possible to find a base but it would take two years to train personnel in soil analysis and at least five years to carry out a national survey.  Dr. Walsh was thinking in terms of seven years, and yet the Government mentioned 1986 in the plan.</P>
    <P>It is possible that with this confidence trick the Government will make everybody happy.  The Labour Party supporters <Col N="2818" /> are happy because the proposal is contained in the plan and Fine Gael farmers are happy because they know it will never be implemented.  The plan is riddled with contradictions.  It would take me a long time to deal with all the contradictions in it, but the most obvious one was where the Minister for Health had an input.  He told us that he was going to insist on preventative medicine, particularly in regard to abuses of alcohol.  On the other hand the plan proposes to lengthen the pub opening hours and reduce the price of spirits.  With regard to tourism I must stress how dependent Rosslare is on that industry.  However, we have been told that moneys for coastal erosion work will not be paid out for the duration of the plan.  I have mentioned it often enough here for the Government to be aware that Rosslare needs money for coastal erosion work.  If that money is not made available for such work Rosslare will cease to exist as a tourist resort.</P>

      <P>I should like to start my contribution by outlining the background against which this document was prepared.  I shall proceed then to describe, in some detail, the thinking behind chapter 4 which is the direct responsibility of my Department and conclude by addressing myself to some of the comments of Deputy Byrne. Deputy Byrne, and the other Fianna Fáil Members present, will recall that since 1977 with the publication of the first formal document during the time when Deputy Wilson, who is in the Chamber, was a member of the Fianna Fáil administration, the House has seen a succession of documents, attempts at introducing some form of planning or economic management within our economy.  I challenge Deputy Byrne, who was not a Member at that time, to go back over the documents produced in the period of that Fianna Fáil administration and look at the basis on which assumptions were made, the basis on which projections were made and the reality that followed from them. Having looked at that exercise based on the Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1977&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask Deputies on the other side of the House to look at the basis of the figures on which this policy proposal for a three year plan was conducted and give us concrete examples of where they do not believe the assumptions and figures are realistic. We should attempt to begin to agree on what is the basis from which the country can now begin to make an economic recovery. I suggest that two things are clear. The first is that there is a critical and real need to get control over our overall financial and fiscal policies in terms of our economic requirements from a tax point of view and from the point of view <Col N="2821" /> of the borrowings the country has accumulated over a number of years and, indeed, through a number of administrations. I am sure all Members recognise that.  If we do not do that international monetary agencies of one type or another will impose control upon our economy. Every responsible economist, from the Left and the Right in idealogical terms, have argued that some re-establishment of control in this area is essential.  I wonder if Fianna Fáil share that view.</P>
      <P>The second reality is that in social terms the biggest problem socially facing us is the scourge of unemployment and the absolute priority of taking measures to ensure that unemployment ceases to rise, as has been our experience in recent years, and then is turned round.  We must have viable, sustainable and wealth producing jobs created in our society in a way that they in turn can support and generate other work.  That second reality is implicit in the document, and I invite Fianna Fáil Members to participate in a real debate on those issues.</P>
      <P>In his contribution Deputy Byrne described the plan as some type of patched-up document for political purposes between the two parties.  The document represents two different political points of view.  It is clearly the product of a Coalition Government, but I must point out to the Deputy that the differences that exist between the Labour Party and Fine Gael are not differences of personality but differences of policy approach.</P>
      <P>It behoves all Members to concentrate on what are policy differences rather than personality differences, because the conflict of political personalities will not do anything to resolve the problems that have confronted our economy in the last five or six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems are not unique to our economy.  If one looks at any of the economies of other member states, such as Greece or Spain, which is due to become a member in the next year or so, or countries like Belgium and the Netherlands which have different economic histories, one will see that there are similarities in the nature of the problems that confront them.  It is essential for <Col N="2822" /> political debate, and for democratic politicians with a responsible mandate, to base whatever political difference, dialogue and debate there should be here on a perception on what are facts and realities.</P>
    <P>The document contains a number of specific proposals which have been costed.  The are set out in some detail in a manner that is unique from previous documents.  In the making of those decisions choices were clearly involved, and the costs attached to those decisions are accumulated in the final chapter of the document.  I suggest that this is a far more honest and explicit approach to the difficult task of economic planning and development than that of any other Government.  I invite the Opposition to respond on the basis that it is such an approach.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour will effectively be responsible for implementing chapter 4 of the document.  The thinking behind it is as follows: all the economic projections for this and other European economies suggest that even if we were to have a dramatic relaunch of the European economy and a dramatic reduction in the level of unemployment within the EEC as a whole and even if we were to reduce unemployment by 50 per cent in the EEC over the next three years, there would still be 7,000,000 European citizens out of a job at the end of that period. I do not believe individual countries can attempt to solve the problem on their own, certainly not economies like ours which are totally open economies. Unemployment as a phenomenon has exploded in all the member states and everyone is aware of that.  We must pursue vigorous, positive economic policies to create sustainable, economically viable jobs.</P>
    <P>In the pursuit of such an objective we are not entitled to turn to the unemployed and particularly certain categories of them and say that until such time as we are 100 per cent successful in that pursuit there is nothing we can do for them. The social employment scheme is not a substitute for the creation of viable and economically based employment.  It is a <Col N="2823" /> parallel action designed to harness the clear desire of the vast majority of those who are on unemployment assistance to obtain work.  It is an attempt to ensure that such people maintain an active role in our society and are not forced into the ghetto of unemployment which has become a reality for so many people.</P>
    <P>I have said before in the House that our society is very much centred around work and the work ethic, so much so that the formal fundamental preliminary social exchange we have with each other is to ask somebody what is their name, where do they live and what do they do.  If a person cannot answer the third question they are in some respects cast into the position of nearly being a non-person.</P>
    <P>This country is the twenty-fifth richest one in the world.  It must be possible to find an answer to that last question.  It might not be a perfect or complete answer but it would be in excess of the one which is currently the fate of 214,000 people, 84,000 of whom have been answering &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; to that last question for over 15 months and in some cases for longer.</P>
    <P>This scheme is not a substitute for the formal and orthodox economic activity which the Government must pursue in the commercial State sector and the private sector.  It is a form of parallel action and solidarity with those who are the long term unemployed.  The details of the scheme are such that the principle of part-time work which could consist of a week on and a week off or a variation of whatever rota would be best suited for the work in question will apply.  That flexibility will be in the regulations which will be available to the voluntary organisations and the public authorities who care to utilise it.  The wages and contribution towards the cost of supervision materials will be paid for by the Exchequer.  The projects will be submitted for consideration to the Department of Labour by the public sector and voluntary organisations. The important point I want to underline on the record of the House is <Col N="2824" /> that these projects must fulfil the following criteria: they must be non-profit orientated, respond to clearly identified community needs and they must not be in substitution for existing employment. These conditions will be vigorously applied by me so that existing employees will not lose their jobs or have their hours of work reduced because employers avail themselves of this scheme.</P>
    <P>I have had extensive consultation with the local authorities and trade union movement on this point.  There are fears within the trade union movement about the potential displacement effect this scheme, if badly implemented, could have on certain areas of employment.  I underline the assurance which is explicit in paragraph 4.12 in this regard.  It is my earnest hope that the take-up in the scheme will be fast, immediate and successful and that it will not be, to quote the phrase attributed to Deputy O'Malley, &ldquo;schemes of make work&rdquo; involving topping nettles in a graveyard.  Nettles have a habit of growing again and the futility of that exercise is apparent to all.  They will be schemes which will enhance the overall wealth of the community in whatever shape or form the voluntary organisations or public sector bodies propose.</P>
    <P>We have, running through five counties, two of which Deputy O'Rourke represents, a facility which is now approximately 250 years old.  It had a commercial life in economic terms of approximately 30 years before the railways displaced it.  I refer to the Royal Canal.  It has been closed for a long time but, if reopened and restored, it would provide a net addition to the tourism infrastructure of that part of Ireland with direct benefit for all the towns along the route and with a multiplier effect on the Shannon and Grand Canal in the southern part of Leinster.  There is no reason why it should remain closed other than that the community does not have the resources or that the political decision is not made to reopen it.  I offer this as an example which could be taken on board by five counties in question in conjunction with the Board of Works into whose legal ownership the canals will be <Col N="2825" /> transferred on foot of legislation to come before the House in the next few months.</P>
    <P>If and when the Royal Canal is reopened &mdash; it is only one of many similar type examples &mdash; it will provide additional wealth in terms of resources for the community.  It will provide opportunities for continuous economically based employment in this tourism area for many people.  Deputy O'Rourke will recognise that if we utilise this scheme to achieve that objective over whatever length of time it may take, it will provide positive employment for those who participate in it and, at the end of the day, there will be an additional asset restored to the life of the economy.  That is just one example of the way the scheme could be utilised.  I am confident that my proposal will be taken up by the local authorities involved.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some points made by Deputy Byrne particularly in relation to the growing of vegetables.  In chapter 4 we deal with the enterprise allowance scheme.  This scheme was designed to enable those who are unemployed and who wish to go into business on their own to do so.  There is nothing to prevent the people Deputy Byrne referred to, who are living in rural areas and are unemployed, from converting their present position under the social welfare code into the enterprise allowance scheme and come forward with proposals, utilising the long gardens he referred to, to develop a market garden industry in consultation with the National Manpower Service, ACOT and the other State agencies.  So the facilities are there as outlined in chapter 4 to assist precisely the kinds of ventures the Deputy was referring to.  He referred also to a number of other matters but time prevents me from replying to them.</P>
    <P>The two parties in Government with their two political traditions, their separate political ideologies based on policy rather than personality differences, have got together and produced a plan based on reality, on facts and figures, and have attempted honestly to bring forward a series of proposals that will enable all of our people to move forward in the next <Col N="2826" /> three years.  As could be said of any document this one, too, could be better but we are talking of a document produced by 15 human beings and their assistants, people with all the limitations to which we are all subjected.  I would not go so far as to describe the document in the way in which Deputy Flynn, as a backbencher on this side of the House, described the Fianna Fáil manifesto when he said it was the most important document to be published in Ireland since the publication of the Bible.  I would go so far as to say that the assumptions on the part of the Government and on the part of those who assisted them are printed clearly. The decisions we have taken are there for people to study and to respond to.  I call on Members of the House to recognise the constraints and the realities and to realise that the plan offers the best possible prospect the country has for moving out of the crisis which everybody knows exists but which can be, in the first place, ameliorated and, secondly, turned around if the overall proposals in the document, <i>Building On Reality,</i> are implemented with the support of all Members of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate and I intend making education the main thrust of my contribution.  However, while the Minister for Labour is still in the House I should like to take up a couple of points he made and which are of great relevance to me.  One relates to the Royal Canal.  I welcome the positive commitment from the Department of the Environment to funding two amenity schemes on the canal.  These have been commenced and there is an input from Westmeath County Council of which I am a member, but I am taking this opportunity of making a case for further funding for the scheme.  The council will be putting forward another scheme so as to bring about more improvements in this area.  I will respond to the spirit of generosity indicated by the Minister and say that we welcome this scheme very much and hope it will fit into the overall framework of the social fabric of employment <Col N="2827" /> as mentioned by the Minister in the context of paragraph 4.  I will convey to the county council the Minister's expression of goodwill for the scheme but we will be looking for more money in that respect.</P>
      <P>Another matter which relates to the Department of the Environment but which has a bearing on education arises out of paragraph 4.10 of the document. This is in relation to employment schemes, whether of a social development nature, of long term employment or of the COMTEC principle or whatever. The paragraph reads:</P>
      <P>A feature of the future arrangements will be the use by the manpower authorities, whenever possible, of existing facilities especially those of the educational system.  The operational aspect of ensuring the full use of eduational resources are being actively considered by the manpower agencies and will shortly be approved by the Ministers for Labour and Education...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I wish to make is that in this context there will be a need for much increased guidance counselling within the second level system.  I am not making this point in any sense of acrimony but having regard to reality.  The document which was prepared by the Youth Employment Agency and which embodied the features of the social contract for the unemployed, stresses that every school leaver who had been unemployed for a certain length of time after leaving school would be entitled to employment of a certain kind. In that document also great stress was laid on the need for constant liaison between the Department of Labour and the manpower guidance counselling agencies within second level schools. Therefore, there is obviously a need for increased guidance counselling within second level schools.  There is no such provision in the document in the chapter devoted to education.  There is recognition that there should be increased guidance counselling in disadvantaged areas but there is such a need overall.  If the <Col N="2828" /> imaginative proposals are to have success, there will have to be appropriate corresponding resources in the educational establishments in order to match the reaching out from one area of life, employment, to the other area, education. I thank the Minister for remaining to listen to me on those two points.</P>
    <P>I come now to the main thrust of my contribution as spokesperson for my party.  The Minister for Labour has urged us all to face up to reality.  However, we are hindered by one very strong factor, that is that the whole plan has been presented by the national handlers of the Government as being a panacea for all ills.  We are told the good parts while the bad parts are in the small print.  The good parts are in the main document.  The patching job will suffice for this week or next but the matter will be entirely different when there is a realisation of what is meant by cutbacks, by the various decreases in expenditure.  I would be prepared to swallow the unpalatable and to accept the plan as a document for debate but that is not the way it is put forward. I wish particularly to explode the myth that there has not been or will not be cutbacks in the education sector.  That myth was planted and is now being fostered and cultivated to a great extent. There is an enormous financial credibility gap between the Minister's rhetoric and the reality of the classroom.</P>
    <P>I have a plethora of figures which have been carefully costed and since the previous Minister expressed the desire that we speak about figures when debating this plan, I shall do so.  However, the figures I have here are not spelled out in the main document, the one with the grey cover.  Perhaps grey is an appropriate colour for its cover.  The plan envisages only a 1 per cent increase in educational expenditure in 1985.  This is at a time when inflation will be of the order of 7 per cent to 8 per cent.  The reality will be higher third level fees in excess of the rate of inflation, higher school transport charges, higher fees for trainee teachers, the retention of prefabricated classrooms, and complete lack of provision for an increase in any category of teacher <Col N="2829" /> in the year 1985.  I am not making this up; this is contained in this booklet but one must delve deep to find it.  It must be remembered that all of this is taking place at a time when the number of young people entering classrooms will be constantly rising.</P>
    <P>It is said also that the planned increase in capital investment in all education sectors for 1983 to 1987 is just under 28 per cent whereas the expected inflation rate over the same period &mdash; if we accept the authors' estimates &mdash; will be approximately 35 per cent.  Therefore, in real terms, capital investment in education, and I stress capital investment, will decrease by 7 per cent between the years 1983 and 1987.  We are told in the booklet that the volume increase in capital investment in third-level education will be of the order of 44 per cent.  If we are to accept the overall decline in capital investment in all sectors of education of 7 per cent, it follows that there will be a very real capital cutbacks at primary and secondary levels.  We are already aware that capital expenditure on the modernisation of national schools, particularly the phasing out of late nineteenth century schools, is running 50 per cent behind the 1981 level.</P>
    <P>Yet the Minister for Education told this House on 24 May last that 80,000 more places would be needed at second level by 1990.  Is she now saying that none of those will be provided until 1987?  Even if the proposed increase in the volume of capital investment in third-level education were to take place I believe it would be totally inadequate.  We are told in chapter 5 that details of these capital projects can be found in chapter 7.  But, when one turns to chapter 7 one sees the full list of the desired, proposed third-level building programme.  If one reads on one is told that all of these desirable projects such as the colleges at Kevin Street, Blanchardstown and Tallaght are to be subject to further examination of the need for each project and the availability of finance.  That is contained in paragraph 7.85 under the heading of education in chapter 7.  The Government cannot have it both ways.  They <Col N="2830" /> cannot ask us to look at it, cost it, talk about it while at the same time maintaining that it is a realistic document if they then continue to say: yes, those projects are within the 44 per cent total increase but they might not happen.  Quite clearly the Minister has stated that they might not happen.  If they do not take place that makes nonsense of the 44 per cent.  I might quote directly from that paragraph, 7.85 under Education as follows:</P>
    <P>Among the major projects which have been proposed are new accommodation for the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Engineering School for UCD, the TCD Clinical Sciences facilities in conjunction with the new Dental Hospital at St. James's, the second phase of the building programme for NIHE Dublin and phase three of the National Colleges of Art and Design. New Regional Technical Colleges in Tallaght, Dun Laoghaire and Blanchardstown, and the commencement of planning of new colleges in Thurles and Castlebar have also been proposed.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that they will be built, but they will not be built.  They have been costed but it is said that they will be considered at a later date, or that they might be withdrawn.  That is not building on reality.  It is very foolish talk.  If we are to be expected to take the plan seriously it would have been better had the Government said: we wish we could build those but we will be unable to do so; perhaps we will build them one at a time, or we will make plans for their building perhaps one each year.  But they should not put in writing that they will be built and then continue to say that that will be dependent on further finance, the manpower needs or needs of the area.  Of course they will be so dependent, but why not say that in the first instance?  Why say that as an addendum?</P>
    <P>I received a copy of the speech of the Minister for Education to the House last evening, the penultimate sentence of which read:</P>
    <P>It is this Government's firm intention, in the Taoiseach's words, to dust off the JCBs to help them do just that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2831" /> I find it difficult to express what I felt on reading those remarks &mdash; puerile, silly, trite remarks.  If we are to be dependent on the capital investment, given by one hand and taken away by the other, in this booklet, then the JCBs will remain inoperative.</P>
    <P>On 24 May last the Minister for Education told this House that the number of students entering third-level education was likely to increase from 47,000 in 1982/83 to 67,000 by the year 1990.  She said that even if all the projects subject to further examinations were completed it would still fall far short of accommodating the extra 20,000 students.  That is the capital programme proposed, with its tied-up JCBs and figures which do not constitute or represent figures on investigation on turning to a separate chapter of the plan.</P>
    <P>I want now to talk about current spending in the classroom world of today.  I want to make reference to two matters which have been brought to my attention, amongst others, but which it will be seen give the lie to the rhetoric I want to explode and which is doing real harm to the integrity of the educational system. At primary school level the Minister has often repeated her statement about priority funding, which I have welcomed on many occasions.  But when one scrutinises the figures contained in this plan one sees that the Government's commitment does not stand up to such scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I have had a letter sent to me by the principal of an average Dublin city national school which maintains that from 1 July 1983 to 30 June 1984 the difference between the actual grant, plus a handsome parish contribution leaves the real cost per pupil at £18.02.  This is in a school of 652 pupils, which amounts to a shortfall of nearly £12,000 per annum, that is having taken into account the Government grant and the parish commitment.  This means that the board of management of that school must raise £1,000 a month to run that school, and that in a community very hard-pressed, experiencing great difficulty with increased service and transport charges, <Col N="2832" /> food subsidies having been removed, increased clothing costs and so on.  The principal of that school ends with this plea:</P>
    <P>Please give priority to primary school education; it deserves it.  Lobby the Minister for Education and any others who may be in a position to remedy this neglect.</P>
    <P>That letter was accompanied by a full statement of account showing the amount of grant per pupil, the expenditure per pupil, a very straightforward balance sheet.  It illustrates that they are carrying a deficit for the year 1982/83, another hang-up from a previous Coalition budget.  It shows a modest expenditure on heat and lighting, insurance, cleaning, teaching aids, maintenance, miscellaneous items and miscellaneous damages. Yet that board of management find themselves £12,000 in debt annually.  I am not blaming the Minister for that, but why is she pretending that all is well and rosy in the world of education?  Why not come clean and say: yes, there are enormous difficulties, primary schools are under-financed.  I just cannot take the spreading of this smokescreen of tranquillity that all is well when it is not.</P>
    <P>With regard to second-level education I have had another letter sent to me by the principal of a prominent boys' school in the midlands.  I do not want to give the names of either of those two principals, but both letters are available to any Deputy who may wish to scrutinise them. I would fear retribution, because I have noticed that the Minister is terribly touchy when anybody writes to the Press or the Department when there will be then perhaps ten letters back to the newspapers explaining through apologias to beat the band.  I do not want any school in respect of which I put forward a case to be harmed.  This latest letter to which I am referring is one which was sent to the parents of all the pupils attending that school in the midlands, which school lost a teacher last year through natural wastage.  They have now been informed by the Department of Education &mdash;<Col N="2833" /> despite pleadings, visits, journeys backwards and forwards &mdash; that any new teacher must be ex-quota, that the Department will not pay the salary.  The school cannot pay the salary, which means that subject choice must be curtailed immediately.  The principal contends that this is a direct result of and here I quote:</P>
    <P>...the recent cutbacks in education by the Government in the person of Mrs. Gemma Hussey, the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>This is a practical example of what is at present happening in many second-level schools throughout the country.  Teachers may leave, through marriage, moving residence, leaving the country or perhaps, unfortunately, through death.  For some reason or other these teachers are not being replaced.  There was meant to be a quota committee established to investigate cases like these which I know has broken down.  I heard Brother Declan Duffy, of fame, sent a telegram last Christmas along with the ASTI representative on that committee saying that they would not participate in that committee any longer, that it was a sham.  I contend that pretty words and deft publicity handling can create these types of educational mirages.  But it is my job to illustrate that they are untrue, which will be clearly seen when related to the practical running of any classrooms.  I have costed my earlier figures on capital and current expenditure and I have tangible proof to show that what I am saying about the underfunding of first and second level is a harsh reality.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt anybody in the House today and I do not expect Deputy Barry to interrupt me, especially as she is a teacher.  I welcome the commitment in the plan to raise third level funding from 1984-85.  However the maintenance grant and the income eligibility levels have not risen since 1981 and the £1,000 maintenance cost of third level operating since then should be raised to <Col N="2834" /> £1,800 if real income levels are taken into account.  Any financial improvements promised at third level would need to be enormous because of the Government's clear neglect of third level needs over the past two years.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the European Social Fund financing to second and third level colleges.  I welcome it, any expansion in funding to education at any level should be welcomed, but it has not been accompanied by funding for administrative purposes of these schemes.  Hence we have the current difficulties in the RTCs around the country, including Sligo, Athlone and Tralee.  The number of students in the Regional College, Athlone, has risen from 150 to 850.  That is a welcome participation in the scheme and has given the kiss of life to the regional colleges in the area.  However, the scheme has ground to a halt because the administrative officers are meant to cope with the disbursing of funds to 850 pupils, and with the documentation that involves, in the same way as they did earlier for 150 pupils.  They cannot possibly do so and I urge the Minister to sort out this mess.  There are pupils in college areas who have commitments to landladies and commitments to study because the Government told them that they were getting a grant.  Because of the embargo on the public service those grants are not now being paid.  I am not saying this in any acrimonious manner, but it must be dealt with urgently.  A plan must be clear, it must be costed and realistic, but this plan does not measure up to that criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the plan has been received with very mixed feelings.  There are optimists and pessimists, but there are also realists.  I do not share the enthusiasm with which this plan has been welcomed by some of my colleagues.  I have very grave reservations about the plan and what it will achieve. I was amused to hear Fianna Fáil Deputies levelling the charge that the plan was cobbled together for political purposes to keep the Coalition in office as if an attempt to keep a Government <Col N="2835" /> going was a serious crime.  It is also difficult to accept that charge coming from the Fianna Fáil benches when we have seen them in the past making all sorts of deals with The Workers' Party, with Deputy Gregory and with anyone else who was prepared to enter into a deal.</P>
      <P>During the weeks immediately preceding publication of the plan there was considerable speculation about a general election.  I do not think anyone in the House would have welcomed an election; the electorate would not have welcomed it either because we had three over a period of 18 months.  That type of instability, particularly set against the background of Northern Ireland, is extremely dangerous.  Indeed, the Members of Fianna Fáil were pleased that this plan had taken the pressures off the need for a general election.  One half of Fianna Fáil were afraid that in a general election Deputy Haughey would win and the other half were afraid he would lose. Therefore, I find it very difficult to accept the sort of nonsense that has emanated from those benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said I had grave reservations about the plan which are based on a number of matters.  The plan is based on two assumptions, one external and one internal. The external one is that the dollar will behave more favourably against the Irish pound and that there will be an upsurge in the American economy.  I am not an economist but I read articles on the subject and I try to keep myself informed of what is happening.  To many people who are better qualified to know it appears to be a very optimistic assumption, because while we have our difficulties here regarding the budget deficit, the American economy undoubtedly have difficulties also in regard to budget deficits.  As we know, the presidential election in America is coming to an end. I read yesterday that the national economy in America is slowing down.  Most people assume that the present incumbent will be re-elected.  I believe that most people regard him as being favourably disposed towards big business and <Col N="2836" /> that big businesses are favourably disposed towards him.  I do not think there is any reason to suppose that there was a deliberate pull back by big business in America to try to slow down the growth in the economy to damage the President in the campaign.  I believe as soon as the campaign is over that one of the first things the incoming President will do is to face up to the reality of the American budget deficit.  That will not fall into line with the assumption in the plan.  That is an external matter over which this or any European Government would have very little influence.  If it happens we will not be the only country to suffer.</P>
    <P>However, there is also an assumption in the plan which is purely internal.  The only way that I see the Government seeking to finance whatever money is required is by a rigid clampdown on the public service.  There seems to be an assumption that this can be easily done.  A very successful orchestrated campaign has been carried out, not least by members of the Government, against the public service and there is a general view abroad that public servants are fellows in pinstriped suits, carrying rolled umbrellas, sauntering into the office for coffee at 10.30 every morning and earning £30,000 or £35,000 per year.  It is unfortunate that this view has been fostered in the minds of the people because it is totally untrue. The public service is comprised of a very large number of people who by any standards are not well paid and whose conditions of employment leave much to be desired.  Under the assumptions of this plan there will have to be a very rigid approach towards the whole public service in order to make the plan work.</P>
    <P>I spoke a little while ago about the atmosphere around the House, in the country as a whole and in the media immediately preceding the publication of the plan.  It was one of speculation about a general election, crisis in the Coalition, major splits &mdash; the usual stuff the media engage in to describe political realities at times.  That eased very considerably on the publication of the plan; but I wonder if there is not in between the pages of this plan, particularly in regard to the last <Col N="2837" /> assumption I described, a delayed action bomb as far as the Coalition are concerned.</P>
    <P>I will pose one scenario and I should be glad if the Government when replying would dispel any fears I and others might have regarding this possible scenario.  A claim by a section of the public service may go to arbitration.  As we know, the arbitrator was re-appointed only after a delay of two months and this gave rise to speculation that perhaps the Government were considering abandoning the scheme or setting it aside.  There was some speculation in trade union circles during the long delay.  The independent arbitrator operates under a scheme which has been functioning successfully since 1924, with some updating.  Let us suppose that a claim goes to the arbitrator and he makes an award which the Government decide is outside their interpretation of what should be paid to any section of the public service and which would in their opinion breach the assumptions on which the plan exists.  What happens at that point?  I understand that the only way an award by an arbitrator can be set aside is by a resolution of Dáil Éireann.  Could we possibly be facing some time in the new year a situation where a claim is served, the arbitrator views it independently and objectively, makes an award which the Government will not honour and a resolution is placed before this House which all Members of the Government parties at least would be expected to support in order to dismantle the whole arbitration machinery for the public service which has been operating successfully for so many years?  That would cause grave difficulties for a Coalition Government with Labour Party participation. During the reply to the debate or earlier perhaps some member of the Government would ease my mind on that point and in so doing ease the minds of tens of thousands of people employed in the public service.</P>
    <P>On the question of employment, it is regrettable, to say the least, that the public service sector and the potential for employment creation by that sector were not utilised by this Government plan.  I <Col N="2838" /> am not speaking on ideological grounds but on the basis of our experience over the years.  We can rely on the public sector to provide employment but the private sector, irrespective of the assistance they get, have not provided and will not provide employment.  Following the defeat of the Coalition Government in 1977 Jack Lynch was returned as Taoiseach with a majority of 20.  The first budget he brought in gave massive grant support to the private sector and he said to them &ldquo;Now go out and create jobs&rdquo;.  Having put the money in their back pockets, the leading spokesmen for the private sector said it was not their business to create jobs but rather to create profit.  That is a matter of public record.  The ladies and gentlemen of the press reported it in their newspapers.  It was said officially on behalf of the private sector.  Is there any reason to believe that they have changed their position?  None.</P>
    <P>The question of farmer taxation has become a rather confusing area because I am getting different figures.  Paragraph 6.17 of the plan states:</P>
    <P>The new arrangements will be designed to increase the yield from farm taxation in 1986 to about twice the level produced by the present system.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that farmers will pay approximately £32 million this year in income tax.  If the tax is going to be twice that, that would amount to £64 million, based on the current year.  Professor Brendan Walsh, who has never been a wild man as far as economics are concerned, has stated that the farmers would not pay any increase under this scheme, but possibly less.  There might be some confusion which it is essential to clear up. The Taoiseach mentioned a double figure and £60 million to £65 million.  Others have mentioned the same figure.  If the estimate is right&mdash;and it need not necessarily be&mdash;farmers will pay more than £32 million.  We do not know yet.  In the natural progression of tax, it is reasonable to assume that they would be paying £60 <Col N="2839" /> million to £65 million in the year 1985-87. I read again the statement in the explanatory document:</P>
    <P>...and to yield double the amount paid by farmers under the present income tax system.</P>
    <P>I would like the matter clarified, so would the farmers and certainly the PAYE workers.  Does that mean that farmers in the year 1986-87 will be paying approximately £130 million between land tax and income tax?  Or does it mean that they will be paying double what they are paying now and that it all remains static as far as their contribution is concerned between now and the introduction of the land tax in 1986?  The answers to these questions could influence the approach of many people to the plan, and I sincerely hope that the Government will avail of the opportunity this evening to answer these questions.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I have grave reservations with regard to the plan.  I do not believe that it should be necessary for any of us to wait three years to know whether our fears are justified.  Some of the fears which I have mentioned, particularly regarding public service pay and its possible repercussions, will have to be countered within the middle of next year. Some of the other aspects of the plan which have not been upfronted up to now will become clear.  I shall wait and see how the plan develops, and I am sure many of my colleagues will do the same.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this plan. It is a continuation of the Coalition's approach to previous economic and budgetary issues.  It is vague, it is based on unquantified and sometimes unquantifiable assumptions of future trends.  It generally puts forward as solid, attainable targets, figures or scenarios which are subject to international pressures, both economic and political, which are totally outside the capacity of the Government to influence.  When you take any individual part of the plan, Government members are prepared to admit that that is true.  However, these assumptions are <Col N="2840" /> fundamental to the plan as put forward. If these targets are not attained and the strictures which are otherwise in the plan are maintained, the plan will fall even more heavily on the middle income and the poorer sections of the community and will create even greater unemployment. That is why these elements which have been debated over the last few days here are so important.</P>
      <P>The plan is based on shaky foundations. These are the volatile dollar and sterling exchange rates.  It is subject to the dry rot of expected public service union resistance to an income freeze.  I do not think anybody believes the Government will be able to implement the income freeze which it has in mind for the public service.  However, if those figures drift then, of course, that affects the rest of the plan.</P>
      <P>This <i>Building on Reality</i> is subject to the corrosion of increasing unemployment and the ineffectiveness of the measures being proposed to counter that.  It is subject to the rising damp of callous, cynical and indiscriminate public spending cuts in essential and needy service sectors.  These are beginning to become very clear to all those involved, and over the next few months they will become still clearer.  It is also subject to the shifting sands of uncertainty, the investment disincentive, the entrepreneurial suffocation and the leaky cauldron of much needed capital fleeing the State, while Fine Gael contribute to this uncertainty by making damaging but relatively meaningless concessions in an effort to paper over the cracks in the Coalition and appease the highly vocal left of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a national plan.  It is not even a plan for a national plan.  The Coalition clearly have a target or objective and they have set this out in detail.  I think that this is all they have &mdash; a target towards which they hope to meander by some miracle, and through the subjugation of dreams, aspirations and lives of the plain people of Ireland.  There are within the framework of this so-called plan many unrealistic components.  But for me the <Col N="2841" /> principal problem is the totally unacceptable unemployment targets in this plan. It is really only a plan to hoodwink the Labour Party into docile acquiescence.  It is a Coalition compromise designed to avoid an early election.  On the basis of its unemployment targets, from the outset it is unacceptable to me.</P>
    <P>Only those who are over 40 years of age have experienced the growth, the self-reliance, the confidence, the hopes and the achievements that were associated with a sustained period of growth under Fianna Fáil.  It is a sobering thought that only those over 40 years of age have seen such a sustained period of growth. The sixties was the decade of economic and social planning under Fianna Fáil.  It was the era of Seán Lemass.  Fianna Fáil gave the leadership, took the calculated risks, invested in the people and in the country and brought Ireland to the level of a modern European State.  It was good for the businessman and the entrepreneur. It was good for the poor.  It was good for those seeking employment and it brought about the end of massive emigration. Few commentators at that time had a good word to say for Seán Lemass. It was only in retrospect that the achievements of that era were recognised.  It was a period of hope and national self-confidence which resulted in new initiatives for economic development.  Our industries, although protected, began to flourish.  New exports were created and agriculture developed more than it had done in the previous 50 years.  We began to look outwards towards the European Community for new opportunities for development.</P>
    <P>Since 1973 the country has been subjected to three Fine Gael led Coalition Governments.  Each of these has been characterised by compromise and uncertainty, by a lack of confidence and an over-emphasis on stultifying &ldquo;reality&rdquo;.  As a direct result they have been accompanied by falling investment and rising unemployment.  Few seem to realise that for six-and-a-half of the last 11 years we have been governed by Fine Gael led Coalitions.  They have sapped the energy <Col N="2842" /> of our economy, humiliated and depressed the forces of enterprise, destroyed the vision of a future for our youth and shattered the confidence of the ordinary working people.</P>
    <P>The Coalition's new plan, characteristically entitled <i>Building on Reality</i> once again follows the mindless policies of puritanical rectitude pursued by the financial controllers of the present Coalition in imitation of their economic idols across the water.  This is not the stuff of James Connolly or Jim Larkin.  It is not the stuff of a Seán Lemass, a Jack Lynch, or a Charlie Haughey.  This plan embodies the right wing conservative reality that is today's Coalition of Garret FitzGerald and Dick Spring.  It is a forthright recipe for emigration, unemployment, poverty and reduced living standards.  It is a clear shift to the right by the Government. Let those who support this catastrophic Coalition be clear that this plan would subject the country to three further years of Coalition misery and uncertainty.</P>
    <P>In their document <i>Building on Reality</i> the Government ask the people to face what they consider to be the &ldquo;realities&rdquo;. The Coalition programme for the next three years involves:&mdash; higher unemployment; a lower standard of living for everyone and especially for widows, old age pensioners and the unemployed; a continuation of the Coalition's penal taxes both direct and indirect; a whole series of new impositions on families such as taxing children's allowances, the removal of remaining food subsidies, and taxing social welfare benefits; and major cut backs in health and social welfare, and the denial of third level education to the average middle income family through considerably increased fees and other costs.</P>
    <P>How can any concerned Member of the House vote in favour of a so-called plan which so blatantly accepts the <i>status quo</i> of high unemployment, high taxation and falling living standards?  These are the three principal areas to be tackled by any plan that is put before the House. The plan should be judged by how it sets out to deal with these three major problems.  Can we offer hope to the <Col N="2843" /> unemployed and the job seeker?  Can we raise the economy from the doldrums? How do we go about this task?  Could we not have been offered a framework and a programme to face and overcome our difficulties and set new targets?</P>
    <P>This is where the Coalition's plan fails. It aims to go nowhere.  Like a car in neutral gear it can only go downhill.  If everything is smooth and there are no cross winds perhaps the car can roll along for a while, but that is not what we need in these economic times.  We have to fight to go forward, and sometimes we have to fight to stand still.  This document is not fighting to go forward.</P>
    <P>There is no point in just sitting there and waiting for things to improve.  You have got to go out and make them happen.  This Government are suffering from a severe case of inertia.  This inertia is quite obviously due to this desire to hold on to Government at all costs, to cover over the cracks and keep the Coalition partners together.  But look at the cost to Ireland's manhood and the development of our potential.</P>
    <P>This plan proposes the most right wing and defeatist policies ever put forward by any Government in the history of the State.  Our whole reason for being an independent State was to be able to provide for our children as Britain never did for us.  Our criticism of the administration in Northern Ireland was that emigration and the dole queue were used to suppress the Nationalist population.  This unimaginative plan will have a similar effect here.  It even spells it out in case we miss the message &mdash; more unemployment, rising emigration and lower standards of living.  If we pass this plan we will have massive unemployment and depression on both sides of the Border.  We utterly reject these timid and defeatist proposals. We believe that the electorate would also reject them if given an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>There is an alternative to the Coalition's approach.  We could produce a plan based on courage and vision and tempered with reality.  We could examine our resources, build on our strengths and <Col N="2844" /> aim to achieve more of our potential.  The greatest problem with the Coalition is that because of their siege mentality they are failing to grasp the enormity of their failure.  Recovery can only come from rapid investment and the employment of people in the utilisation of our resources. There are more than sufficient national resources in Ireland to provide a programme of sustained growth for the 5,000,000 people who inhabit the island, but we need a capital programme of productive investment to create worthwhile employment which will use the resources and give a reasonable return on the capital invested.</P>
    <P>There is no shortage of work to be done and there is sufficient unused capital available to stimulate a recovery.  Banks are ringing people and asking them to invest.  They cannot afford to invest because the Government will not stand behind them and will give them no encouragement to invest.</P>
    <P>Many of the unemployed are from the construction industry &mdash; tradesmen, craftsmen, architects, engineers, technicians, salesmen, furniture manufacturers and many others.  There is no doubt in the mind of anyone who travels through Dublin city and its environs, or through our other cities, that there is much building and construction work to be done. Furthermore, there is money in the banks and other lending institutions, which is not being borrowed and cannot be borrowed for this purpose because the Coalition Government's policies have undermined the building industry and prevented it from being used as a vehicle for investment.</P>
    <P>The resources are available but are not being utilised.  The cost of these mistakes is evident at the labour exchanges and in the suffering experienced in the homes of decent people.  It was Fianna Fáil's roads and building programme in 1980 which saved the construction industry from being entirely wiped out.  There are still enough viable projects which could be started in Dublin city and county to provide full time employment for most of the workers in the construction industry.  But it needs <Col N="2845" /> the will of the Government to support such development, and that will is not there.</P>
    <P>It is well known that every £1 spent in the construction industry has a seven fold multiplier effect in the economy with consequent job creation.  What stimulus has been given to the public and private sectors of this industry?  There is little here to encourage this sector.  We have seen the emigration of the major companies, Cement Roadstone, Smurfits, the Rohan Group and McInerneys.  These are native Irish industries who have transferred their interests in growth overseas because they find the climate more hospitable, and their labours more rewarding.  They have voted with their feet, with their assets and abilities against this Coalition Government.  These are investment led companies who could not hope to expand using only their cash flow, and they found the tax regime here too onerous for investment.  It is all about resource development and we have the resources.</P>
    <P>The Government's plan is to hold back the economic investment that is much needed, to reduce foreign borrowing and when it is paid off to gradually allow the economy to develop.  Note the repeated stressing of the prospect of jobs in the nineties by the Ministers, Deputy Boland and Deputy Bruton.  It is a bit like a housewife deciding not to feed the children until the house mortgage is cleared. I want to point out to those two Ministers and their fellow Cabinet members that this is only 1984 and we are not prepared to wait until the nineties for jobs for our young people.  We provided them with an education.</P>
    <P>We do not accept emigration and the increasing brain drain as a solution for the eighties.  They cannot wait around until the 1990s for employment.  Economic commentators and Coalition Ministers say little that is good about 1979, but it was the first year since the Famine when emigration was reversed.  This Coalition plan proposes a return to massive emigration during the remainder of this decade.  That is not an acceptable solution to us.  We must look beyond <Col N="2846" /> these sad realities to find new horizons. That is the challenge of our age.</P>
    <P>There is no time in this debate to deal in detail with all the proposals and illusions in this document.  One proposal to which I must refer is the plan to tax children's allowances.  Deputy Desmond, Minister for Social Welfare, said in his contribution yesterday that he will introduce the new child benefit system on a neutral cost basis.  There will be no extra cost to the State.  He will just take the money required from the middle income group by removing entirely the £100 tax allowance per child and by taxing the children's allowance.  At the same time the plan will exclude over 80 per cent of farming families from income tax.  When you put the pieces of the plan together you will see what the impact will be.  As a result the middle income families will not only see their children's allowance taxed but the increased child benefit will not compensate for this loss, and cannot compensate under the Minister's proposals, and they will be much worse off. This is so because in this country there are too few rich people, and when the Minister talks about taking from the rich he means clawing back children's allowances from middle income families excluding farming families.  I do not know if Members realise what he is talking about.  The Minister is out of touch with reality and so is his plan in this respect.</P>
    <P>There is nothing but disappointment in this plan for justice.  The Minister has accepted a reduction of 600 in the approved Garda strength of 12,000 and a limitation on Garda overtime.  There are no plans or resources to tackle drugs or to provide a budget for community policing. The capital programme to provide for jails and detention centres remains severely cut back for the next three years. The Minister for Justice has failed to get support at the Cabinet for the obvious emergency in crime, lawlessness and vandalism. This is the reality.  He did not even get an agreed priority for resources to tackle this urgent problem area.</P>
    <P>This plan must be rejected.  For the unemployed it offers no hope until the nineties, and we have plenty of emphasis <Col N="2847" /> on that from our Ministers.  They are putting it on even now.  I thought they might wait until next week or the week after until they get all the Deputies to come in here to vote for the plan.  Then when they have voted for it they will say to them: &ldquo;That is what you voted for.  Is it not written down in the plan?  How can you vote against that when it comes to a vote in the House on different issues? How can you vote against food subsidy cutbacks when the cutback on food subsidies is here in the plan?  You voted for the plan&rdquo;.  When you say that there will be no employment for young people until the nineties, what about the panic that sets in at that stage?  For the unemployed this plan offers no hope until the nineties. For our bright and educated young people it proposes emigration.  That is what is between the lines in this plan. For the poor it proposes even greater poverty, and that is clear in this plan. For middle income families it proposes reduced living standards.  For investors it offers no incentives to invest.</P>
    <P>This plan does not deserve discussion in this House.  It were better that this plan were never born, because there must be a better way.  This plan should have been aborted before it came to the House because of its proposal to allow unemployment to rise and to leave the young people of Ireland without hope and without any prospect for the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the plan before the House.  Deputy O'Rourke in her contribution suggested that we are presenting and selling this plan as a panacea for all our ills.  That is not the reality. We on the Government benches realise that this plan has its good points and its hard points.  It is based on reality, the reality of a Fianna Fáil administration who created those ills which we must try to cure, but it is hard to cure ills when Deputy O'Rourke has to agree that this is an imaginative plan and Deputy Woods a few minutes later suggests clearly and unequivocally that this is an unimaginative plan.  He goes on further to say that it does not deserve discussion.  I began to <Col N="2848" /> wonder at that point why he was discussing it himself.  There is not much credibility in that.  However, in my contribution I would like to deal with the reality we are facing, and I agree that this plan is very well founded on reality.</P>
      <P>Before the end of this decade it will be apparent that the period 1981-84 was a crucial time in the reassessment and reformulation of Irish industrial policy.  By then we will see clearly how as an emerging industrial nation we had reached the end of the first stage of development, and how it had become urgent that we should seek new directions, new policies and a new dynamic which should set us on the path for economic prosperity into the nineties and beyond.</P>
      <P>In retrospect now we can see how industrial and taxation policy formulated in the fifties had such a profound effect on the decades that followed.  A small agricultural nation without any known natural resources except its land, which was and continues to be under-developed, opened its doors to international industry by providing generous grant aid and generous taxation incentives.  There is no question but that it was the right policy for a small nation which did not have the resources or the skilled personnel to undertake on its own the task of industrialisation which would improve the living standards of its people.</P>
      <P>We should not underestimate the achievements of what might loosely be called our first phase of industrial development. Over the past 20 years gross national product <i>per capita</i> of population has trebled.  During the seventies we had an increase in population for the first time this century.  Also in the seventies Ireland opened its trade to the industrial nations of western Europe while at the same time increasing manufacturing employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has not been a total success story, however, and by the late seventies it was apparent that as the world economy headed into recession for the second time we would have to look again at our strategy for industrial and social development. In spite of the gains there were serious causes for concern.  The income <Col N="2849" /><i>per capita</i> gap between Ireland and the industrial nations of the West had seriously widened.  The economy had become increasingly dependent on foreign-owned corporations for industrial jobs.  The prospect of prolonged world recession left Ireland in a vulnerable position. Ireland's net trade balance had deteriorated rather than improved. While acting as a successful factory floor for foreign-owned industry we had failed to supply our own industrial requirements and we had not made use of the opportunities for Irish suppliers created by foreign-owned manufacturing companies. The cost of State aid to industry had risen rapidly to the point where a most urgent assessment of cost benefit analysis was needed.</P>
    <P>The momentum for change began with the publication of the Telesis report sponsored by the National Economic and Social Council.  While confirming the value of previous achievements, it had harsh things to say about Irish indigenous industry, the value of certain forms of incentives in the overall strategy for Industrial development and in some respects, the role played by some of our State agencies.  The real value of the report lies in the fact that it stimulated renewed debate on industrial strategy.  Its publication coincided with the coming to office of this Government &mdash; a Government who have consistently shown their enthusiasm and determination to bring forward new policies suitable for the times in which we live and the will to follow through towards full implementation of those policies.</P>
    <P>In 1984 alone we have seen the publication of the report of the national planning board, the Government's White Paper on Industrial Policy and now the national plan.  There is no question but that the course ahead has been radically revised and it is a tribute to the Government that such a significant change of direction could be comprehensively expressed and planned in such a short time.  It is not change for its own sake; nor is the national plan simply a response to the immediate problems of recession and unemployment.  It is a considered and <Col N="2850" /> reasoned response to the achievements and failures of the past 30 years; It is an endorsement of the best advice obtainable, but more than anything it is a recognition of the combined effects of the technological revolution and the demographic structure of our population.</P>
    <P>In this sense the national plan is far more than a three-year programme.  It outlines the social and economic philosophies which will chart the course of this country's economic and social development for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>There are two over-riding factors which dominate this new thinking and philosophy.  First our capacity and self-confidence has grown immeasurably in the past 30 years.  We must now build on the reality of that self-confidence.  Second the national plan recognised that the primary motivating forces from now on must derive from our own people, our own resources, our own creativity and determination to succeed.  There is a clear perception of the need to translate this new national self-confidence into motivation at individual level.</P>
    <P>The common element is a new emphasis on our ability to achieve things for ourselves whether at national, regional, community and individual level.  While never refusing or hindering external investment which will help us to achieve our national economic aims, we have to displace the old notion that all we can do is provide a convenient and cheap factory floor for the foreign owned industry that will provide a modest pay roll and little else.</P>
    <P>A new outlook and new ideas are not enough, however to bring about immediate change.  We must look at the realities we face.  We are not selling the plan as a panacea for all our ills.  We recognise our ills.  In 1984 we simply do not have the resources to finance the kind of changes which we know are necessary.  Fully one-third of our income taxes are used to service our national debt.  The appalling neglect and mismanagement of previous administrations are now being felt throughout the country.  Falling employment, cutbacks in services, declines in <Col N="2851" /> real incomes, unacceptable levels of taxation are the stark realities of 1984, and that is why the Government deserve the support of every Member of this House in rectifying the financial affairs of the nation; a necessary precondition to freeing the resources of our people to generate adequate standards of living in the next and future generations.</P>
    <P>Far from being despondent at our present situation, the national plan recognises the medium and long term potential for unprecedented development of this country's resources.</P>
    <P>Our priority now is to create a vigorous industrial sector which is controlled, managed and developed by our own people.  A statement of intention, however, is not enough.  The reality on which we must build is an economy where Irish owned industry has not in the past 20 years created the same level of sustainable employment as foreign owned industries.</P>
    <P>Our industrial policy recognises the weaknesses of such an approach and is guided by a realistic approach to the situation. We must face up to the problem of restructuring our traditional industrial base.  Old obsolete industries must be gradually phased out so as to make way for new industries, new technology and new methods of production.  We must develop our natural resources with a determination and single-mindness which has not previously been evident.  We must make greater efforts toward import substitution.</P>
    <P>As a small nation with an open economy we must increase our foreign currency earnings in a way that will enable us to retain the benefits of foreign companies. Our present apparently high level of exports disguises the continual outlfow of profits and highlights the inadequacy of reliance on foreign industry.</P>
    <P>Our overall goal is not, however, simply the provision of any jobs, but rather the creation of sustainable and high earning jobs, with an emphasis on the quality of employment in terms of overall contribution to wealth creation and a concentration on achieving and <Col N="2852" /> maintaining a competitive advantage in the goods and services we produce.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the Government cannot do people's business for them. The State can, however, do a great deal to enable companies and individuals to better manage their affairs.  The State can create the infrastructural change for industrial development, and the increased provisions in the plan for road building and the development of Dublin Airport are to be welcomed.  The Government, and the State, can exercise control over the public sector and public services to ensure that the costs of public utilities are not a disincentive to industry.</P>
    <P>The Government's resolve in this crucial area is now acknowledged by all sectors and the plan reaffirms this principle. The State can create the fiscal conditions for enterprise to flourish and, again, the plan recognises the advantages of reducing taxation and sets out to do so wherever possible in spite of severe financial constraints.  The State can provide real assistance through its agencies, in product and market evaluation and, again, the plan recognises the compelling advantages of a centralised and concerted effort to sell our produce.</P>
    <P>The State can, through tax based and other direct financial measures, create the conditions whereby creativity and product development are encouraged. The plan builds on existing realities which favour manufacturing enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Government can by selective taxation and financial measures ensure that finance will be available to young entrepreneurs with sound business ideas.  Such people exist here.  We can build on that reality by fostering and encouraging their creative talents.  The financial incentives in the 1984 Finance Act, and further measures to be introduced including the National Development Corporation, will go a long way towards achieving these objectives.</P>
    <P>In agriculture, the realities upon which this Government are building point to difficult decisions in the years ahead.  The dairying sector, regarded as the flagship of Irish agriculture, is in reality uncompetitive. It suffers from several problems. <Col N="2853" /> The general problem in Irish agriculture is low land mobility.  Only 3 per cent of agricultural land changes hands each year, and most of that by inheritance.  We have failed to establish consistency of production or to establish specialist premium brand products on world markets. We are the lowest spenders in the EC on animal foodstuffs and housing, yet our unit costs of production are higher than those of our trading partners and our profits, consequently, are lower.  Production is seasonal and incapable of taking advantage of our advanced processing facilities.</P>
    <P>The beef industry presents even greater difficulties.  It is cyclical and seasonal and incomes have not been cushioned to the same extent as in the dairy industry by intervention.  In the dairying sector the Dutch and the Danes produce three times more per labour unit than we do.  Our milk yields and fat content are the lowest in Europe and the number of cows per labour unit is almost half that of Denmark, the Netherlands and UK.</P>
    <P>These are the realities.  Almost 45 per cent of our net exports are based on agricultural produce and profitability in this sector is essential to the overall economic health of the nation.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is the Government's commitment to self-help more apparent than in the area of housing.  The introduction of non-repayable grants of £5,000 for local authority tenants, the proposals for joint venture housing, the retention of existing grants and mortgage subsidies, the extension of the incentives for the provision of rented accommodation, the Government's proposals in relation to bridging finance and conveyancing costs, are all evidence of the Government's commitment not just to construction generally but to motivating people to build their own financial security.</P>
    <P>The national plan opens up ways in which people can become involved directly in areas of economic activity and productive enterprise, whether it be through home ownership, greater industrial democracy, the expansion of the scheme encouraging people to set up <Col N="2854" /> their own business, or the increased taxation incentives for people to invest in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The plan recognises the reality of our growing young population but it recognises also that with the correct structural changes in education, training, taxation and financial measures, this young population can create the wealth which will transform this country into a modern industrial nation.  The plan has a vision of a population which is engaged in highly skilled rewarding enterprise which in turn will support the level of services which are necessary to lead a decent dignified life.</P>
    <P>It is a vision of a society based on pluralist principles which does not pursue material gains for its own sake.  It is a society which has the capacity to care adequately for the sick, the aged and the disadvantaged and which views the elimination of poverty and deprivation as essential to establishing a just and stable society.</P>
    <P>In the face of the enormity of our problems the dismissive attitude of the Opposition is regrettable.  Surely they can see that politics and democracy is severely discredited by the way in which the front bench opposite operate.  We have enough problems such as poverty, unemployment and the dangerous cynicism that continues to threaten democracy.  It is our duty to protect democracy and show it is capable of bringing about change.</P>
    <P>This is a plan which deals with reality in all areas of our economic and social life.  It is a plan which will succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate over the last week has exposed this document as an unrealistic plan.  <i>Building on Reality</i> as a plan has been exposed as a fraud.  It is not building on reality but on lunacy. People are very disappointed at the contents of the document.  We now have a document after two years of Coalition Government.  We wonder how the country was governed for the last two years without any form of planning or any long term projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years ago we brought out a document <i>The Way Forward.</i> It was a well <Col N="2855" /> worked out document with realistic figures and options for the future.  The Coalition partners were so eagerly anxious to bring us down that they voted against that document and precipitated a general election.</P>
    <P>For the last two years the level of unemployment has increased dramatically. When we left office in 1982, 168,000 people were unemployed.  Of that 31,000 were under the age of 25 years.  This was unacceptable.  We produced <i>The Way Forward</i> to counteract the increase in unemployment levels and bring foward policies which would create long term employment.  At the end of September, over 211,528 people were unemployed; 66,154 of those were under 25 years of age.  That is a monument to the inaction of the Government over this period.</P>
    <P>Where in the document do the Government put forward a solution to this major problem?  In 1982 during a debate on a motion of no confidence in our Government the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Desmond, was concerned about the level of unemployment. In Volume 338 (No. 4) of the Official Report of 3 November 1982 at column 674 the Deputy said:</P>
    <P>I stress that youth unemployment now constitutes a major fact of Irish life.  Indeed it may well constitute our greatest single political challenge.  At least 31,000 persons under the age of 25 are now out of work.</P>
    <P>Two years later that level has increased to 66,154 people.  That Deputy is now responsible for health and social welfare, and I presume he made some contribution to this document.  No concern has been expressed for the unemployed or for those who left school this year or will leave school next year.  The Minister and the Government have decided that employment may be available in 1990, according to Deputy Bruton, who is now advocating &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass.&rdquo; What is to happen in the intervening years?  The unemployment level is bound to increase because investment is <Col N="2856" /> discouraged due to lack of Government involvement.</P>
    <P>Many important areas have been omitted from the document.  No mention has been made of the decentralisation of Government Departments, a policy instituted under Fianna Fáil which we will continue on our return to office.  There is a strong case to be made for transferring staff to rural areas.  The same applies to semi-state organisations.</P>
    <P>There is no proposal in the plan to take on the food processing industry as a major area of growth which would create much needed employment.  There is no plan for an import substitution programme which we were strongly involved in while in Government.  I as Minister of State at the Departments of Posts and Telegraphs and Transport instituted an important import substitution programme in those Departments.  That has been terminated by the Government. I doubt if they have any interest in bringing forward such a programme, a programme which could provide much-needed employment in that area.</P>
    <P>Neither is there any scheme for voluntary early retirement, a scheme that would create employment in the public service and local authorities.  There are people who would be anxious to retire early provided the retirement was voluntary and that there was an incentive for them to leave their jobs at that stage.</P>
    <P>We regard as inequitable the proposals in relation to land tax.  They do not represent a sound scientific method of assessment of adjusted acreage.  In the words of one Labour Senator, it is a question of the tap being turned on.  The £10 per acre for each adjusted acre on holdings of between 20 and 80 acres will be only the thin edge of the wedge for the farming community.  I trust that the IFA will continue to oppose the implementation of this form of taxation.  It is a direct return to the rating system, and that was totally unacceptable.  The present position in regard to taxation is that everyone who has a taxable income should be taxed. That is a fair system, but there are a number of anomalies in so far as the proposed land tax system is concerned. <Col N="2857" /> First, there will be the question of determining the adjusted acreage, a task for which we understand now the Land Commission who were abolished a short while ago are to be reconstituted to undertake.</P>
    <P>There is no encouragement for farmers to improve their land in the next two years, because any improvement brought about by way of drainage or farm modernisation would mean that their acreage would be adjusted accordingly for the purpose of taxation.  The initial tax of £10 per adjusted acre seems relatively small but we are all aware that, as with the rates question, there is no guarantee that that levy will not be increased on a yearly basis.  The tax will create very serious problems because, for instance, a man with 60 adjusted acres and who is unmarried will be liable for £600 land tax in 1986 whereas a farmer on an adjoining holding of similar acreage but with a large family will be liable for a similar amount of taxation.</P>
    <P>The tax that is proposed will not take account of debts a farmer may have in respect of borrowing over the years.  I appeal to the Government to drop this proposal.  In particular I appeal to those Fine Gael TDs who, prior to the publication of the plan, were so quick to oppose the tax, to vote against the plan this evening. In that way they will be backing up the statements they made in opposition to the proposal.  But if they vote for the plan their integrity will be in question.</P>
    <P>The so-called plan spells disaster for our telecommunications service.  There is a requirement outlined on page 148 of the document which spells the death knell for progress in Telecom Eireann, who were established on 1 January last.  They are now expected to become a tax-collecting agency for the Government.  If the contribution from the board of £50 million is the pillar of this plan, we can be confident that the plan will collapse, and the Government too.</P>
    <P>In 1984 Telecom Eireann are to contribute £44 million to Government by way of loan capital repayments.  They are expected also, according to the budget, to contribute £50 million in order to balance the books of the Department of Finance. <Col N="2858" /> This level of contribution places an impossible burden on this young company who, according to their chairman, Mr. Smurfit, will lose between £30 million and £50 million this year.  It is stated in the plan that Telecom Éireann will be required to pay their way on a commercial basis, including remuneration on both debt and equity capital, and that in the short term this will involve the company being required to make the following contributions to the Exchequer: £50 million in 1985, £60 million in 1986 and £70 million in 1987.  To achieve this performance, Telecom Eireann would have to increase charges by 25 per cent, a step that would mean diminishing returns, which would place an impossible burden on the consumer, both commercial and domestic and which would bring about a reduced demand for services. Our telephone charges are among the highest in Europe.  The burden that the Government propose to place on the company would damage our industrial progress and development and would decrease the demand for new telephone installations.  Would increased external borrowing by the company to finance State expenditure be acceptable to the Government who allegedly are against foreign borrowing?  In 1984 Telecom Eireann must borrow £160 million above and beyond Government requirements for their capital programme.  The board will require £120 million in 1985 in respect of capital requirements, a further £120 million in 1986 and £100 million in 1987. The Government proposals would increase the board's borrowings to an impossible level and would place the company in bankruptcy.  Is that what the Government require of Telecom Eireann, a company who have only begun and who will make progress if they are not stifled at this stage?</P>
    <P>We are told that another option would be that of involuntary redundancies. What about the guarantees enshrined in the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1982?  With our present high level of unemployment and the need for completion of our telecommunications programme, this is not an acceptable <Col N="2859" /> option, and this party will oppose any measure which puts in jeopardy the security of the employees of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>In the interest of clarification for the Government and in particular the Minister for Communications, Telecom Éireann are not subsidised by the State and will not require a subsidy in the future provided the Government do not proceed with the demands as outlined in this document. I wish to clarify also that in the likely event of Telecom Éireann making a healthy profit by 1987, then and not until then can the State expect a return on its investment.  I agree with the principle that when any State body are in a profit-making situation and when their funds are not required for re-investment, the State should receive direct support from them.  That is a reasonable approach and one that has been followed in other State companies, but at this stage the demands by the State on Telecom Éireann are totally premature and would place the board in a very serious financial position. They would jeopardise the whole future of the company.</P>
    <P>In a recent RTE interview the Minister stated that I was misinformed regarding Government proposals and that provision for what is being proposed was made in the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1982.  That is not so, and I challenge the Minister to state where exactly in the Act the amounts oulined in the plan are provided for.  If the Minister has in mind subsection (5) of section 110, the provision is that the Minister may stipulate, in consultation with either company and with the consent of the Minister for Finance, financial targets including payments of dividends in respect of shares of the company to be achieved by the company.  There has been no consultation with Telecom Éireann in relation to their possible charges as outlined in this document. I appeal to the Minister for Communications and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Nealon, to allow the company to succeed, to remove this charge from <Col N="2860" /> them, because I have no doubt but that it would place Telecom Éireann in such a situation that it would have a detrimental effect on its staff and services.  There has been no consultation with the company. I appeal to the Government to initiate discussions with the board of Telecom Éireann in order to arrive at a solution of the difficult situation that has arisen. If this Government are to be dependent on Telecom Éireann to balance their books then building on reality amounts to building on quicksands, because that body is not in a position to assist in that way.</P>
    <P>In the Act there is no mention whatever of the establishment of an independent local broadcasting authority to legalise the present total unsatisfactory situation.  There have been regular statements emanating from the Minister for Communications and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Nealon, for the past two years accompanied by total inaction in this area.  As a matter of urgency I appeal to them both to bring this House a Bill to establish an independent local broadcasting authority to provide licences for legitimate applicants and a full service. Viewed from the point of view of job creation alone it is essential that there be provision for independent local radio.</P>
    <P>The proposal to broadcast excerpts of speeches from this House is to be welcomed. It should highlight for the general public the manner in which the Dáil has been misled on many occasions by both the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  Indeed I might say that in March 1984 the present Taoiseach gave a commitment that a Bill to license independent local radio would be brought before the House before the summer recess.  That did not happen.  It has been promised for this current session. It is unlikely that the Government will honour that commitment since they have broken others given in the past.</P>
    <P>The proposal of RTE to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to broadcast live excerpts of Dáil debates is a welcome one.  We believe they will expose this Government for what they are, render the Dáil more relevant to the <Col N="2861" /> electorate, when they will be given an opportunity of hearing such live excerpts of debates in special programmes.  That is an essential development at this juncture. There is no proposal at present to televise Dáil debates because I believe it would be very difficult technically to adapt this Chamber for the purposes of television. But there is no doubt that it will be forthcoming some time in the future even if it means that there be a new Chamber built here.  I hope these proposals will be implemented by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the near future.</P>
    <P>This plan has been a major disappointment to the country, certainly to my constituents for whom there is no hope held out under this plan.  The only hope under this plan is of massive emigration, which is already taking place throughout the country when, for the first time since the fifties, young people are leaving the country seeking jobs in London, New York and elsewhere.  Yet this Government, who have the capacity to provide the jobs here, are standing idly by.</P>
    <P>I say: Let us have a vote on this issue this evening, let us bring this Government down, let us go to the country, have a general election, let the people decide, when a new Government will have the ideas, the capacity and ability to bring forward policies for job creation here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this plan.  I would welcome any long-term strategy that would remove the guesswork from budgets, giving people the confidence to invest whether that be in a house, by way of mortgage, in a business or whatever.  It is very important that we have the broad parameters of macro-economic Government policy laid down so that our people have the confidence and stability to enable them to operate effectively, meaning that people can see some light at the end of the tunnel, in terms of the drop in living standards over the last four years, thus raising national morale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a number of points in regard to the plan, and should like my comments viewed in the context of this plan being seen &mdash; while I support it &mdash;<Col N="2862" /> as a minimum framework for action.  I support everything in the plan, but more can and should be done in terms of specific details and in some policy areas.</P>
    <P>What is needed in any such plan is not an economic versus a social consensus vehicle.  Nor do we need something giving signposts over the next three years as to what will be international and domestic growth and inflation rates.  What is needed is the foot being put down on the accelerator of the vehicle in regard to the developmental engine of the economy. We must state that the likely projections for growth over the next three years will be, say, give or take, X per cent or 2 per cent.  We intend in the plan to raise it to 3 per cent or 4 per cent.  It is most important that there be a definite section devoted to development areas.  If I were to express any subdued criticism of the plan it would be that such is absent therefrom.  I do understand that this is dealt with in some little way in the jobs section, but there is taking place a dangerous development, not alone in the mind of the public but in the political mind as well, which is the separation of two concepts, one being jobs and the other business.  The attitude seems to be that these are totally separate. It is being said to business people: &ldquo;It does not matter what profit you make, rather what is important is how many people you employ.&rdquo; Such dialogue, rhetoric, policies or action are unsoundly based.  Businesses without profit at the bottom line constitute white elephants.  I contend that businesses with safe jobs begin to stagnate.  We must balance our thinking and policies in terms of business development as well as job creation.  It is most important that that separation in the public and political minds does not go much further.</P>
    <P>Unlike many economic commentators who have spoken about the plan, who have said what is wrong with it and so on and its assumptions, I should like to say what I feel should have been included therein.  It must be viewed in a non-ideological way in the sense of seeing the country as &ldquo;Ireland Incorporated&rdquo;, that we are a boat in a large ocean, that instead of being vulnerable, exposed to <Col N="2863" /> recessionary winds and every storm that blows &mdash; in terms of an oil crisis or whatever &mdash; we must realise that we are operating in a game in respect of which the ground rules are free trade and beat them at their own game.  If we view the plan in terms of the country being &ldquo;Ireland Incorporated&rdquo;, using that vehicle for development, that will constitute the best premise for this or any future plan.</P>
    <P>One might go one step further, look at &ldquo;Ireland Incorporated&rdquo; as a business and how one would run it as a business.  First of all one would assess its market potential. There was carried out recently an interesting survey in terms of our trade statistics for the year 1983, when instead of talking about millions of pounds, figures and percentages, one talked in simple terms.  If one examines what Ireland sells to the United Kingdom, or to any of our neighbours, per head of population, it will be seen that, in 1983, we sold to the United Kingdom £46 per head of population in exports, to the Dutch £29 per head of population in exports and to the West Germans £11 per head of population in exports.  To give the House an example of what I am talking about I might say that one extra £1 sold to the West Germans <i>per capita</i> would be the equivalent of £62 million in exports.  If we sold to West Germany, in terms of exports, as we do to the Dutch, then we would sell £1,116 million more, which would completely eliminate our balance of trade deficit.  That must be our goal. That is where the potential lies.  What is wrong that we are not doing so?</P>
    <P>If one is to examine a recent report on international industrial competitiveness for 1984 undertaken by the European Management Forum, based on 284 criteria &mdash; inflation, industrial efficiency, after-sales service, punctuality, everything &mdash; it will be seen that we rate sixteenth out of 22.  That is a weakness for which there are many reasons.  Certainly one weakness is management in this country.  I have said so before and shall repeat: an improvement of management capacity and efficiency here would do more for the country than would a major <Col N="2864" /> oil discovery.  What was outlined in the first report of the Committee on Public Expenditure, which I chair, was that what we need is a three-year &ldquo;in-company&rdquo; plan for small and large companies under which management efficiency would be scrutinised, with a market plan being drawn up, being brought to fruition, pooling the State agencies of the IMI, the IPA and AnCO, in a &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; approach.</P>
    <P>In the marketing area we need to establish a sales agency service in our markets, have those who will sell the toothpaste, the cigarettes and everything else we produce, paid by the State, perhaps receiving a 5 per cent commission, rendering the exercise self-financing, thereby putting a marketing presence on the ground which cannot be afforded by small manufacturing firms.  There is needed also a network of warehousing facilities, the necessary marketing information and analyses in the areas of product development in order to establish what people will be buying in say, 18 months time.  The difference between sales and marketing is selling what you have and what people want. This is an area that needs vast improvement.</P>
    <P>The plan specifies that 20,000 to 25,000 jobs will be created in the service sector. Today the Joint Committee on Small Businesses launched a report on the largest private sector which is the retail and distribution sector.  We will not create these jobs unless we bring in certain stimuli. A job tax credit system needs to be introduced, not tax relief for its own sake but employment related tax relief.  For every extra employee taken on the business should get a credit against its VAT net bill, against employers' PRSI contribution or its corporation tax bill.  Stock relief or 10 per cent capital allowances for doing up premises would give the cash flow and profitability to take on extra people.</P>
    <P>We also need to deal effectively with the black economy, smugglers and casual traders who are undermining legitimate business and jobs.  To give an example in the area of tourism, I know the owner of a riding school who put an advertisement in a German equestrian magazine and, <Col N="2865" /> for the last two years, he has been fully booked out with German tourists.  That is the type of agressive marketing I am talking about, to extract the maximum, and you can do the same with selling other Irish good and services.  We must build on the minimum framework of the plan and there must be a positive attitude. We all should realise that we have a role to play.  It does not mean we should make some people wealthier, we must remember that we live or die by exports. What we earn abroad will pay for our social welfare service and give us all higher incomes.  Wealth should be distributed properly.</P>
    <P>This is not a budget but the Government should not neglect the whole area of tax reform.  The time is now opportune to do this based on simplicity, equity and incentive.  The commission have produced their report and the plan has laid out the maximum tax levels required. I should like to see some internal rearrangements to remove anomalies, not to bring in less tax but to make the position simpler and more incentive based. I should like to see the VAT structure revised and to see retailers exempted. The rate should be raised at the wholesale level.  This would exempt everybody from paperwork and this is carried out very successfully in Belgium.</P>
    <P>There is a particular anomaly in this year's Finance Act.  If a farmer dies intestate there is a major problem because the proceeds of the estate go to his wife and sons.  When that has to be signed over to a son there is a huge tax bill to be met.  That area should be reviewed. In the area of the self-employed, there are 97,000 certificates with county registrars and county sheriffs at present for tax collection.  There could have been more.  We questioned Revenue Commissioners' staff at a meeting of our committee and I am afraid the tax enforcement system is breaking down. We need to look to a form of self assessment. People should be able to compute their own tax returns and submit a check with them.  They do this in Canada and in America and, if they are wrong, woe betide them.  Some 5 per cent or 10 per <Col N="2866" /> cent of returns are checked every year which releases staff to look after people who are outside the tax net.</P>
    <P>A land tax is acceptable in so far as it is not double taxation.  However, there is an anomaly.  It is a notional system and there are people who own over 80 acres owing £100,000.  They do not have a taxable income.  I also know a widow who sets her land, 50 acres, for which she receives £2,000 per annum.  Under any tax free allowance system she would not have to pay the amount which she will be forced to pay under the land tax.  I hope the system will be maintained although there should be a hardship clause for a small percentage of cases.</P>
    <P>The PAYE burden is crippling and intolerable.  You may get £50 million from farmers but, in relation to the £2½ billion which is received from the PAYE workers, it is a drop in the ocean.  The Government should introduce tax credits instead of tax-free allowances because they are progressive and there should also be provision for people travelling to work whose net income is yet again affected.  They should be allowed travelling expenses as part of their tax-free allowance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction of excise duties on whiskey but I should like to see it applied to television sets and hi-fi equipment.  It is alleged that 30,000 sets are smuggled into this country and, if excise duties were reduced by 25 per cent, it would stop the trade overnight.  The loss to the Exchequer is enormous.  In relation to employers' PRSI it is a tax on employment.  I am not saying it should be passed on to the employee but the proposals of the Commission on Taxation for a 5 per cent social security tax should be taken up.  It would stop the unregistered employment system.  I am suggesting a package of tax reforms, not less tax, but removing the anomalies and making it more equitable.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, The Workers' Party and Fianna Fáil are the first to criticise Fine Gael for being Thatcherite, monetarist, savage and uncaring.  We have had to stand over harsh medicine but we can also take credit for introducing social <Col N="2867" /> reform.  The inter-linking of social welfare and a minimum increase of 25 per cent are to be welcomed.  We also need equalisation of treatment for women in social welfare benefits.  It is very unfair that women making the same PRSI contributions are not entitled to the same benefits.  It is now intended to resolve this but there are still anomalies.  The rate of unemployment assistance is too low relative to the overall social welfare system and there is real hardship.  I also cannot understand why people on pensions get free fuel but those on unemployment assistance do not.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this.  Widows under 66 years of age are as deserving as widows over 66 for fringe benefits and they should get free fuel.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new £5,000 grant in the area of housing.  It makes good economic sense.  I also welcome the commitment to build 9,000 local authority houses.  However, we should not lose sight of the standard of accommodation in which some elderly people are housed.  Many people invested in county council cottages and they have no water or sanitary services. If our housing policy is to be progressive we need to take into account standards of accommodation of people in private houses who cannot afford to repair them.</P>
    <P>In the area of education, I welcome the 10 per cent increase in student grants which comes into force next year and will be indexed thereafter.  I also welcome the 5 per cent extra on construction in the educational sector and remedial guidance. However, there needs to be a fundamental review in the education curriculum system.  In most other countries they have a 50 per cent continual assessment versus 100 per cent examinations. This needs to be reviewed.  There is a particular problem with regard to very small farmers in relation to higher education grants because these people have never been assessed for tax and cannot get a grant.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new harbour authority for County Wexford and the infrastructural expenditure commitment.  I hope we will now get the development to make <Col N="2868" /> this, which is already the third largest and fastest growing port, into the most effective.  Shipping operators want to use it and we should encourage them to do so.  I also welcome hospital development for County Wexford in the overall national plan for hospitals to the tune of £177 million.  I should like to see the question of an RTC for County Wexford being reviewed.  I welcome the plan although I am not complacent about it. It is not sufficient just to implement it, worthy though that may be.  We must see it as a minimum framework on which we can build so that we can have the type of social and economic progress we so badly need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this debate. It is hard to understand how the title <i>Building on Reality</i> was arrived at.  The one clear observation available from the document is that the Government have failed to grasp the reality of the economic chaos.  We have the highest unemployment figures in our history and an escalating national debt.  The plan has failed to illustrate this and to create opportunities so that these difficulties can be tackled.</P>
      <P>This so-called plan acknowledges that there is persistent imbalance in the public finances, and it states that &ldquo;this has made a major contribution to imbalance in the economy as a whole&rdquo;.  This is patently obvious to every citizen and is mainly due to the Government's failure to grapple with the economic situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are cutbacks in every sector, and this has led to the virtual stagnation of our economy.  Every citizen has been affected in some way or other by these horrible cutbacks.  In August we had the £56 million mini-budget which axed food subsidies by 50 per cent.  This callous, cold, impassive announcement was made after a Cabinet meeting by a civil servant. The Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, the Leader of the Government and the elected leader of the country, decided to turn his back on the people and flew out of this island into the oblivion of a sunny holiday in France.  He ran from the wrath of the people and left the Labour <Col N="2869" /> Party, the real tail of this Coalition dog, to carry the empty can of heartless impositions on an innocent people who expected the big stage-managed Taoiseach at least to show human leadership. Instead he showed a complete lack of political leadership which necessitated the sudden exit of desperation.</P>
    <P>There are now two distinct groups of poor people in this country.  Firstly, there are the people at the bottom of the ladder who are unemployed and in a hopeless situation.  There are the people on disability, on old age pensions or on widows' pensions.  There are the people living in the council houses with big families who see no light at the end of the tunnel. All these people have been the innocent victims of these savage food cuts.  But now there are the &ldquo;New Poor&rdquo;.  These are the people in the middle income group, the people who pay for everything. The father is working in a permanent job if his company can sustain the economic pressure and the high taxation being imposed by this Government.  This man is paying abnormally high levels of direct taxation in PAYE and PRSI.  He has a house mortgage and may have other financial commitments also.  He believes in making a contribution to the country through being self-sufficient and providing facilities for himself and his family, thus releasing the State from its duties to him and his family.  He has a wife and school-going family and must pay for absolutely everything.  He is also a high contributor through indirect taxation and gets absolutely nothing by way of assistance from the State.  He pays school transport charges and school fees in regional technical colleges or university as his family members cannot qualify for any grant or aid, due to his income stratum. This family situation is one of total frustration and is typical of many families right across the country.  For this family their only joy from life is survival in all its aspects, and they live from day to day.</P>
    <P>Right down at the bottom of these two groups of people are a third group, people who are on the breadline as a result of the discontinuation of social welfare, unemployment assistance, the <Col N="2870" /> discontinuation or reduction of old age pension or the total discontinuation of disability by heartless, uncompassionate officers aided and abetted by a heartless. inhuman Minister for Health.  The Minister seems to have given a directive that anybody on disability should be called before a medical examiner and rejected instantly.  There is no account taken of the person or the dependence of his or her family on their income, whether it be assistance, disability or whatever.</P>
    <P>There is total chaos in the health services and hospitals are completely overcrowded, wards are being shut down and in some instances entire hospital units are being closed.  There is a shortage of qualified nurses to look after patients and old and infirm people who are in constant need of care and attention are being shunted home as if they were goods in a railway station.  We have the crazy situation in the Galway Regional Hospital where a new maternity wing has been built and fully equipped and the Minister will not sanction the necessary finance to staff this vitally needed medical asset in the western region.</P>
    <P>What hope has the plan for all these people and what opportunity does it create for them?  Absolutely none.  This Coalition Government, the supposed Government of all the talents, put nothing on the table prior to the last general election but promised that they would create the economic recovery that was needed to stimulate growth and industrial development.  The record of this Government is a dismal plethora of silly mistakes since they first entered office.  Earlier this year we had the discovery of the £500 million &ldquo;black hole&rdquo; in our economy. This was as a direct result of the Government's underestimating our balance of payments to the tune of £500 million.  The reaction of the Taoiseach on that occasion was that he was delighted at this discovery, which was an admission of total mismanagement of our nation's affairs.  The Government totally failed to read accurately the financial affairs of the nation.</P>
    <P>Of course this could be expected of the Taoiseach who, as a member of another <Col N="2871" /> Coalition Cabinet from 1973 to 1977, forced that Government into a position that our current budget deficit escalated out of all proportion, from £5 million under Fianna Fáil in 1972 to over £200 million under the Coalition in 1976-77. Further our accumulated foreign debt ballooned from £126 million in 1972 to over £1,000 million pounds in 1976-77, and today with the same common economic depressor involved, namely the Taoiseach, our accumulated foreign debt is in the region of £2 billion.</P>
    <P>Recently we were made an international laughing stock by the failure of the Minister for Agriculture to have proper information and figures during his negotiations on the milk super-levy last spring.  Just as a civil servant announced the food subsidy cuts in August, again the Department of Agriculture officials are being blamed by the Minister.  The fact remains that these figures were confirmed accurately on the fifteenth day of the month on which the negotiations took place and the Minister failed to avail of the confirmed figure and negotiated on figures which were spurious and dubious, similar to the projections and figures in this plan.  Irish agriculture and our national economy will be £60 million less well off as a result of the inefficient, ineffective negotiations by our so-called Minister for Agriculture.  Where were the handlers on these occasions?  Probably arranging an overseas trip for someone who could be relied on to project an image of blue whiteness, which is being eroded daily by inept performance from this Coalition Cabinet.</P>
    <P>It is sad that such blatant errors should be repeated by this Government and by key personnel within the Government. Of course the Minister for Finance cannot be exempt from blame either and, particularly in view of his European experience, he should have been in a position to ensure the finality and the accuracy of the figures available to the Minister for Agriculture.  He is further to blame as the person responsible for the financial affairs of our country and his failure to ensure that the Comptroller <Col N="2872" /> and Auditor General's office has sufficient staff, despite the fact that there have been several requests for same, shows the Minister for Finance's total disregard for public expenditure.  It is very serious that a very senior Government officer has been curtailed in his appraisal of State expenditure and that the taxpayer is being denied the necessary confirmation that value for money is being given for every pound of hard earned taxpayers' money which is being spent by this Government.  This is totally unjust, unfair, and discriminatory and needs an immediate remedy through the provision of adequate staff for one of our most efficient and respected officers.</P>
    <P>We welcome the capital investment in roads and transport services contained in this plan.  We have been pioneering this in the past and we are delighted this Government have picked up some of our ideas.</P>
    <P>The Government again have failed to create any move in our economy.  Last night the Minister for Finance stated:</P>
    <P>The Government's plan has two central objectives &mdash; first, to increase employment, and especially sustainable employment, and second to halt the rise in taxation, both direct and indirect.</P>
    <P>Our national job creating agency, the Industrial Development Authority, will be starved of finance under this plan.  The IDA are internationally recognised as an outstanding Irish organisation capable of creating jobs and competing professionally in all aspects of industrial promotion with their many competitors throughout the world.  The plan states emphatically that IDA expenditure for the provision of land and buildings will be financed entirely from the proceeds of the disposal of IDA owned land and buildings.  Where is the employment generating opportunity being created here, and where is the sustainable employment that this Minister talks about?  What hope have towns or areas where there is no industrial base already or where there has been in the past and it has been sold to an existing company which in the interim, as a result <Col N="2873" /> of this Government's pressure may have gone into liquidation and may have been disposed of as part of the liquidator's assets in meeting the commitments of the company, thus leaving a town without any industrial base?  What hope have these towns or areas of getting any industrial base or facilities during the life of this negative Coalition?</P>
    <P>No later than yesterday the Minister for Finance admitted for the record of this House that we have the highest level of indirect taxation in the EC countries. This plan does nothing to ease this burden.  VAT is the main source of indirect taxation in this country and the report of the Commission on Taxation recommended in early summer that there should be a single VAT rate in the country. The Minister himself has repeated this several times in this House and outside it.  After two years in Government it is now long past the time when this Government should have moved in that direction and ensured that at least from January 1985 a single VAT rate would be available to the business sector of our conmmunity who collect the VAT and to the consumer sector of our community who pay the VAT.</P>
    <P>The Minister also has admitted, for the record of this House, that Ireland has the second highest level of personal taxation in the EC countries.  This clearly illustrates, I am sure, my earlier remarks about the new poor in our country.</P>
    <P>Much ado has been made by the handlers, through the media, of the farm tax situation.  This is to appease the Labour Party and the PAYE workers on whom the Government will be depending for votes in the next general election.  There is total confusion within the agricultural sector and indeed by professional people <i>vis-à-vis</i> the farm taxation system being proposed, as it is both vague and unclear. The plan states that the level of farm taxation will be expected to yield twice as much in future years.  It is estimated that there will be £10 per adjusted acre as a yardstick for collection.  Firstly, how will the adjusted acre be arrived at and what guarantee have farmers that this will remain at £10?  It is my belief that, if <Col N="2874" /> farm taxation is to yield twice as much to this Exchequer, then it will be the small farmers in the 20 to 60 adjusted acre bracket who will make the major contribution. I would like the Minister to clarify in particular the situation whether the farm taxation imposition will have an exclusion base of 20 adjusted acres for all farmers.</P>
    <P>This plan fails to recognise the fact that farmers are the biggest indirect taxpayers in the country, and that agriculture, as the bedrock of our economy, needs to be stimulated in order to create jobs, both on and off the farm.  I believe that farmers, like every other sector of our community, must pay an equal share of tax; but on the imposition of any tax on any particular sector it must show complete equity.  This plan takes no account of a married man with a wife and family on the land <i>vis-à-vis</i> a single man on the land and therefore fails completely in equity.  I hope the Minister will clarify all this at the end of this debate and allay the fears of many people in agriculture that they may be forced out of this industry.</P>
    <P>We also have the situation in the accounts system where no allowance has been made for capital investment by farmers in necessary equipment, whether it be a tractor and farm machinery or a motor car and trailer or whatever.  This again is blatant discrimination towards agriculture and I expect that the Minister will remove this anomaly immediately.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to recognise the ability of the construction industry to lift our economy from its present doomed situation.  They have made pious promises regarding their investment in housing and infrastructure, but again it is not quantifiable.  Their initiative in a special subsidy of £5,000 per head for local authority tenants who wish to acquire or build their own houses is to be complimented.  However, this is going to exasperate an already overloaded local authority housing demand still further and the plan takes no account whatever of the necessity to provide a certain minimum amount of money each year for mortgage finance.  Already the Housing <Col N="2875" /> Finance Agency have failed to meet their target this year and many people who got loan sanction some months ago are now in serious difficulty on extended bridging finance.  Is this the pattern that is going to emerge throughout the life of this plan, or can the Minister or the Government clearly point to the amount of money that will be available to local authorities and finance agencies over the next few years?</P>
    <P>The financial cutbacks being imposed by the Government and their own capital programmes through the postponement of projects like the Derryfada briquette factory at Ballyforan are absolute financial lunacy.  An office block and a workshop have been built on a large tract of developed bog and progress has been completely halted.  One-hundred-and-fifty jobs permanently on the bog are going, and 150 more that could be created after the building of this factory will never be realised if this Government get their way.  Millions of pounds are being spent by this Government on professional fees through Government Departments to planners and consultants to design and redesign buildings which the Government have decided they are not going to proceed with.  Many of these, particularly in the prison services, were planned under Fianna Fáil.  We now have a situation where, rather than build a prison, the Minister for Justice is demanding that the internationally known forestry college at Kinnity, County Offaly, would be taken over as a detention centre.  This shows the Government's total lack of support for forestry and their particular trait of short term decisions for political expediency.</P>
    <P>This plan falls down completely on job creation.  At best it is patchy and scratchy. It juggles with new job terminology and tries to play computer games with unemployed people, school leavers and part time workers.  It proposes to create 10,000 part time, half week jobs in 1985. Would it not be better for both the economy and the people if a sufficient effort was made to create permanent jobs for half this number, and quit creating an <Col N="2876" /> image of effort for many when the end result is more job frustration?</P>
    <P>Prior to the last election this divided two-party Government promised that they would be totally committed to law and order.  Extra police were to be recruited, but this has not happened.  We now see the virtual breakdown of law and order and the total turn around by this Government on this key State area over the past year.  There have been cutbacks as regards manpower and the deployment of manpower, and several times the Minister for Justice has stated that gardaí would be recruited only on a natural wastage situation, that is, through illness, resignation or death.  In these days of such turbulence throughout our community, when old people and women fear for their lives in remote rural areas and in highly populated city areas, there should have been more recruitment to our police force.</P>
    <P>Our national Army are of credit to our country.  Their support for our own civil police force has been exemplary and their record in international peace keeping situations overseas has made us all proud of our great Army.  There is now a large volume of educated, intelligent young people unemployed throughout our country.  There was an opportunity here in this plan to create some pride in our country through an extension of our Army numbers and the discipline and the training that would be available even on a short-term basis to some of our young people should have been utilised through an extension of the regular Army, or, indeed, the FCA.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to recognise this situation but are prepared to allow our Army to take part in an anti-national controversial British Legion Remembrance Day ceremony.  This, despite the fact that the Taoiseach after last year's debacle on the same situation, gave a commitment that the Army would not participate this year and that a National Commemoration Day for all Irish soldiers who lost their lives, irrespective of the cause, would be set up.  I hope the Taoiseach will clarify this situation immediately and allay the fears of <Col N="2877" /> the majority of Irish people and save our Army from any further embarrassment.</P>
    <P>I believe that the main purpose of this plan is to bring two different parties of varying ideologies together again after their mid-summer disintegration.  The figures throughout the plan are not quantifiable and cannot stand the test of justifiable economic criteria.  Is it any wonder that six economists have left the Department of Finance totally frustrated by the Government's insistence on the inclusion of figures in this document that have not been acceptable to their key advisers? The Government Press Secretary, Mr. Prendergast, has done his utmost to fabricate this statement similar to the fabrication he did in the prison officers situation. He was at pains to name the seventh adviser who moved to the ESRI and, surely, if his other statement was correct he should have named all or none.</P>
    <P>It is my view that this plan lacks a straightforward coherent, streamlined, positive economic remedy for the problems facing this country at present and I believe that this Government will founder striving to hold politically together, while there are stark economic realities which they refuse to recognise.  This plan could be re-named &ldquo;Coalition Promotion &mdash; starve horse and you'll get grass&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. S. Treacy Mr. S. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This plan does not contain all that we in the Labour Party desire, especially in the vital area of employment and tax equity.  It does, however, contain very many features of a desirable nature which we have been advocating for a very long time.  There are many proposals in this plan which will give hope and confidence to many sectors in our society, especially the underprivileged.  I find it particularly gratifying to observe that many of the features in this plan are distinctly Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The imprint and the impact of the Labour Party is to be seen in many aspects of this plan.  I welcome the serious efforts to provide jobs by stimulating and aiding industrial recovery and by extending and improving the enterprise allowance scheme which has already put 3,500 <Col N="2878" /> people into productive work.  This laudable scheme will reduce unemployment by a further 11,000 over the next three years and will bring back dignity to thousands who had begun to lose hope.</P>
    <P>A new training and placement scheme for long-term unemployed will provide 2,500 jobs per annum, each for a six-month period.  I dearly wish that could be on a long-term basis.  A new scheme for social employment will provide part-time jobs for at least 10,000 long-term unemployed at a cost of £57 million. Employment growth in industry and private services will absorb some 35,000 workers over the next three years.</P>
    <P>Housing and the construction industry receives a welcome boost in this plan. Some £53 million is about to be invested in major road projects, resulting in thousands of extra jobs with local authorities while, at the same time, consolidating the jobs of the permanent staffs of local authorities who in recent times have experienced short-time working.  This is the first time since the abolition of car tax, and with it the abolition of the road tax, by Fianna Fáil in 1977 that something practical is being done to remedy the grave deterioration in our roads in recent years.  It is timely and welcome.  In the vital area of employment, I observe that an additional £50 million contingency provision is being made for projects not yet evaluated.  I look forward to the detailed proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>In this plan there has been a great breakthrough in the housing area. Already the introduction of a special grant of £5,000 for a local authority tenant buying or building a private house has caught the imagination of thousands of home seekers.  I believe we shall see a great moving out of corporation and council tenants to new homes of their choice, thereby making available thousands of local authority houses for those in need.  Waiting lists are bound to be reduced considerably and the long purgatory of waiting many years for a decent home will be shortened out of all proportion. This special grant of £5,000, plus the existing £1,000 grant and the £3,000 mortgage subsidy, is novel and generous <Col N="2879" /> and will be availed of gladly by thousands of families who up to now were locked into an environment from which there seemed to be no escape.  It is estimated that some 9,000 or 10,000 local authority houses will be made available each year for new tenants, and this is welcome news for the homeless.</P>
    <P>It is good to know that the serious problem for home seekers of meeting the high cost of legal fees and the extortionate rates of interest charged on bridging loans is at last being tackled.  We have the assurance in this plan that the Government will act to reduce the high cost of conveyancing and of bridging loans.  I should like to impress on my colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, the Minister for the Environment, the urgency and the importance of this problem.  This particular exploitation of the homeless has gone on for far too long.  Let us have action quickly in the matter.  All this activity, coupled with joint ventures in housing and tax incentives and so many other new proposals, will create an upsurge of activity in the housing and construction industry, thereby providing jobs for the large number of tradesmen and labourers who are idle at the present time.</P>
    <P>Despite these measures to provide jobs, they will do little to solve the overall problem of unemployment.  I find it most disconcerting to realise that after the expiration of three years we are likely to have as many unemployed as we have now.  That is an intolerable situation that we cannot and must not condone.  To do so would be to court social upheaval of a kind never before seen in this country. We must bend all our energy and resources to the provision of gainful and productive employment for all our people. That must be the cardinal aim and it must have top priority.  The effort must be sustained and unrelenting and it must be seen as such through every day, month and year of this plan.</P>
    <P>Central to the plan is the establishment of a national development corporation to give a new commercial and strategic thrust to public investment in industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2880" /> In the Labour Party we place our greatest hope and reliance on the speedy establishment of such a corporation as the real engine of activity in creating work for our people.  Without it we shall fail.  Clearly, private enterprise has failed miserably in the past to provide jobs and it will not do so now.  The State has a bounden duty and responsibility to intervene directly in this area.  Therefore, the speedy establishment of a national development corporation is the most effective way of doing it.  It was an integral part of the plan for government.  Nearly two years have elapsed but nothing has been done about it.  It must be done now and there must be no hedging about it.  Unemployment is the greatest cancer eating away at the body politic in this country and we ignore it at our peril.  The signs are there for all to see.</P>
    <P>Taxation is the other great disturbing and disuniting element in our society. From these benches we have consistently called for equity, fairness and social justice by extending the tax net to all sections who could and should pay tax. One section and one section alone has borne the main brunt of taxation &mdash; the PAYE sector.  In its present form the plan does little or nothing to redress this terrible wrong.  Stabilisation of present taxes on the PAYE sector is simply not good enough.  The crippling, crushing burden of taxation on all of us in the PAYE net must be lifted quickly.  The naked robbery of the hard-earned money of the working classes has simply got to stop.</P>
    <P>We had a statement from the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste recently that any additional taxation from new sources would be applied to give positive relief to the PAYE sector.  I want to know when we will get this long sought-for relief. How long must we wait?  That is a promise made by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste that must be fulfilled and fulfilled very soon.  They will not be permitted to forget it.</P>
    <P>The enormity of the injustice to the PAYE sector was highlighted by the facts and figures revealed in this House by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, last <Col N="2881" /> Tuesday when he revealed that the top 44,000 farmers in the country, including those with another trade or profession, paid an average income tax bill of £724 last year compared with an average levy of £1,875 on a PAYE worker.  The Minister also disclosed that the average tax bill for PAYE workers had increased by 600 per cent over the past ten years.  Between 1979 and 1983 the average tax take from a PAYE worker had risen from £915 to £1,875.  In the same five-year period, the average tax payment made by a self-employed person rose from £714 to £1,573 and for the top 20 per cent of farmers from £488 to £724.  These startling facts clearly illustrate the injustice and the urgent need for remedy.</P>
    <P>The partial withdrawal of the food subsidies without putting something adequate in their place was deeply resented by myself and my colleagues and we spoke out against it at the time. Thankfully our protests did not go unheeded and we now have the assurance that the low income family supplement scheme will be brought forward.  This will compensate to an appreciable extent the working classes for the reductions made. My primary concern with regard to this scheme is that it applies only to those at work, the employed as distinct from the unemployed.  The scheme should be extended to include at least the long-term social welfare beneficiaries, and I urge the Minister to consider this proposal seriously.</P>
    <P>One of the very worthwhile proposals in this plan is the child benefit scheme which will provide some £30 monthly for each qualified child in a relatively short time.  Here we have concrete evidence of a real attempt being made to redistribute the wealth of this nation from the rich to the poor.  This is a great breakthrough in social justice and child welfare and will prove to be a boon to all working class families.  I congratulate most heartily the Minister and the Government on introducing this unique and generous scheme which is widely acclaimed already.</P>
    <P>The provision in the plan for the introduction of a national income-related pension scheme is a joy to behold.  I have <Col N="2882" /> advocated and agitated for such a pension scheme for a number of years.  As an industrial worker, I realised that there were tens of thousands of workers for whom little or no provision was being made by way of a pension at the end of their working lives.  This type of callous indifference does not apply merely to small firms.  It applies to the larger firms and especially to the multi-nationals who show a callous disregard for the welfare of their workers when they have no further need of them.</P>
    <P>The self-employed are also included. Many of these cannot strike for their own pension needs and have no one to speak for them.  It is right that they should be included.  This pay-related pension scheme published in this document is to be admired and my concern now is as to when it will be implemented and that it be implemented as quickly as possible.  It has been talked about for a number of years by many Governments.  The time for talk is over.  It is now time for action in this area.</P>
    <P>I have strong reservations about certain aspects of this plan, especially the failure to plan effectively for job creation and provide generous relief for the PAYE sector.  Neither do I believe that the ban on employment in the public services should continue when so many thousands of young people, highly trained and educated, are desperately seeking jobs.  It is mystifying to me that some Ministers in the Government are desperately seeking to provide jobs &mdash; and in this area I would commend the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Labour &mdash; while other Ministers would seem to be hell bent on getting rid of existing jobs in the health services and education, Departments of State and State and semi-State bodies.  I find it difficult to understand this approach which is clearly at variance with the whole idea and ideal of job creation.  I appeal to this Government for a more consistent and humane approach, so that our young people may at last be permitted to apply their talents, their energies and their ingrained genius in the service of their own country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2883" /> I have grave reservations also about the public service pay policy contained in this document.  Let us not forget that the majority of workers here are, in fact, poorly paid &mdash; ordinary working class men and women in the local authorities, the health boards, Departments of Forestry, Defence, Education and so on and in the State and semi-State bodies.  My concern here is for the lowly paid workers. In any wage agreement, their standards should and must be safeguarded. It is therefore my ardent hope that the machinery which has been established in the area of conciliation and arbitration will have regard to these facts and ensure that justice is done and seen to be done to maintain decent standards and decent working conditions for the ordinary working class people engaged in the Government Departments and the State sector, and that any awards which are made in this regard by the arbitration board or the arbitrator will be honoured.</P>
    <P>The plan will do much to eliminate uncertainty.  It will create confidence, confidence that we can plan ahead in the knowledge that there will be no radical change in Government policy for at least three years ahead.  Intervening budgets, I understand, will not have any disrupting influence on the plan.  The important thing is that all sections of our people know where they stand in respect of this Government and what to expect from them over the next few years.  In the meantime my colleagues in the Labour Party and I will be striving to mould this plan to the varied and urgent needs of the people whom we have the honour to represent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The national plan, <i>Building On Reality,</i> is a sad reality.  The first objective of the plan, boldly stated in the summary on page 1, is to increase employment.  If we turn to page 26 of the document we see that the actual figures for unemployment will increase at the end of the period of the plan.  That is the sad reality, and it goes to show how completely unrealistic the document is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of nettles to be grasped by the Government if we want to increase employment.  There is no reference whatsoever to them in the plan. There are some appalling management <Col N="2887" /> practices in industry in Ireland today.  In many cases managers know their way around their favourite golf courses better than their way around the factory floors.  Industrial relations are in a pretty appalling state too.  Something must be done about work practices and management practices.  We have had avoidable stoppages with the cessation of production. The sooner something is done to implement some of the recommendations in various proposals for better industrial relations the better.  Unless something is done we will have to continue with the shameful level of unemployment which exists today.  But we are told that at the end of the period of the plan we will be in a worse position.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to agriculture is another sad reality.  On page 42 of the plan we are told:</P>
    <P>The Government believe that efforts to accelerate growth in agricultural output must concentrate on that segment of the farming population which has real development potential.</P>
    <P>A small number of farmers will be singled out for encouragement and development. There is another plan &mdash; the four year plan for agriculture.  At the rate plans are coming out these days, the Cabinet table must be in imminent danger of collapse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have another one here. On page 10 of the Four-Year Plan for Agriculture it is recommended that Government aid should be concentrated on 40,000 to 50,000 farmers.  It is unfortunate for the other 100,000 farmers that they will be discriminated against in the provision of Government services and in particular in the provision of advisory services.  I suggest that those are the farmers most in need of the services.  When we consider the shameful level of unemployment in industry, with nowhere for those farmers to go to find employment, <Col N="2888" /> it is incredible to think that the Government who are supposed to be building on reality, are leaving 100,000 farmers to their own devices.</P>
      <P>That did not start today.  The level of aid to farming in 1982 was £109 million. In 1983 that was cut to £85 million and it is continuing to be cut.  The real cutback in investment in agriculture is 42 per cent in the past two years.  A number of schemes were cut back completely, including the abrupt termination of the farm modernisation scheme on 9 February 1983.  It was reintroduced in January of this year in a scaled down model which will be of no benefit whatsoever to the farming community.  Western drainage schemes and western packages have long since dried up.  The lime subsidy and the AI subsidy have been shelved.</P>
      <P>We have had the most recent example of the neglect of agriculture in the pretty bizarre outcome of our application for a super-levy quota.  I do not need to spell out in any more detail the history of that. I ask the Minister at this stage in that sad episode to implement a national system for quota arrangements.  At this point 75 per cent of the national milk quota has been filled and, as everybody knows, in Ireland we do not produce much milk in the winter time.  The room for adjustment is becoming very acute and most farmers will not find it possible to adjust to the new situation.  I ask the Minister for Agriculture as a matter of extreme urgency to stop washing his hands of his responsibilities in this regard and to implement a national system.</P>
      <P>The whole problem about the development of agriculture is related to the attitude of the Department of Finance.  They have decided to turn off the tap and to give no further aid to agriculture.  There is an appendix in the Four-Year Plan for Agriculture on page 137 from the Office of the Minister for Agriculture to the chairman.  I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the work of this group has progressed to the stage where it might expect to complete its report in the near future.  It is important, therefore, that the group should be fully cognisant of the current <Col N="2889" /> budgetary situation and the serious difficulties in the way of providing substantial additional Exchequer funds for any purpose.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance are calling the tune and sadly the Minister for Agriculture has acquiesced in that.  The theory in the Department of Finance is that investment in agriculture is not paying its way.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Minister for Finance the findings in a recent study by ACOT published on 6 June 1984.  They said that farmers participating in the farm organisation scheme increased gross margins by more than one-third between 1976 and 1982 and, in marked contrast, the gross margins of farmers not participating in the scheme declined.  They went on to detail the very good return from money invested in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Under the plan taxation is to continue at its present punishing rate.  We are told it will not increase.  That is a fat lot of good to people suffering under one of the most severe tax systems in Europe.  It is a pity that some aspects of the reports of the Commission on Taxation were not implemented.  There has been no reform of the absolutely chaotic system of taxation we have.  We are to continue as we were with tax rates in excess of 70 per cent for people on relatively low incomes. In the part of the plan relating to public finances there is a similar attitude, the attitude adopted earlier this year when the Minister for Finance, having outlined in some detail the problems of the economy, proceeded to say that he would introduce a neutral budget, in other words, he was doing nothing about it.</P>
    <P>There is a similar attitude in this national plan.  The only gesture is that the actual amounts of deficit and Exchequer borrowings will be changed from actual amounts to percentages in the hope of confusing people.  I suggest that a greater effort should be made to rely on domestic sources of finance rather than foreign borrowing.  We all know the outrageous penalty we are paying for foreign borrowing in the wrong places, in the wrong <Col N="2890" /> currencies, particularly in the dollar currency. In 1983 alone, the exchange losses amounted to £810 million, and since then the dollar has become much stronger and will cost us infinitely more than that. Some people say we cannot do much about that, that it is outside our control. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in particular should have a look at small countries similar to our own, particularly Switzerland, where they have a small and very difficult terrain, no mineral resources and yet, possibly the best economy in the world.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation are the latest addition to the ever-growing herd of white elephants and this is just substituting for entrepreneurial thinking further bureaucratic bungling.  No doubt the whole matter will be tied up neatly with further red tape.  In conclusion let me say that unless the money earned by employees goes substantially into the workers' pockets rather than being looted by the greedy hands of the Revenue Commissioners we will not make any progress.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Walsh for allowing me some of his time to contribute to the discussion.  As time is against me I would be commenting only on specific points.</P>
      <P>On health, the present curtailment is dishonest.  I speak with particular reference to the Southern Health Board where, as a result of a decision by the Minister for Health, within the last week or ten days staffs have had to be reduced. Most of the temporary staff have been let go.  Many wards are to be closed throughout the Cork and Kerry region and the standard of service to the weaker sections of our community, particularly the underprivileged, is going to deteriorate to an all-time low and the result is that many people are going to die.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago the Government made a special capital allocation available to open the new general hospital in <Col N="2891" /> Tralee, which was done on a phased basis and it was to be fully operational by the end of October.  At the moment less than 50 per cent of the facilities within that hospital are being utilised with no intention of opening the remaining wards. Within the last week many of the staff there have been let go as a result of the cutbacks in health.  What about the special capital allocation?</P>
    <P>It is of great concern to me that no effort has been made in this document <i>Building on Reality</i> to face up to the serious unemployment problem.  No effort has been made to avail of worthwhile job opportunities for our well-educated young people.  I welcome the extension of the AnCO training scheme. Here there is potential to create further worthwhile employment.  Be that as it may, at the moment over 215,000 people are unemployed and the document accepts that this figure will still remain in December 1987.  How can we as politicians and legislators with such massive unemployment &mdash; and present indications are that it is a permanent problem &mdash; accept this situation?  We are not doing our duty in the eyes of the people, and the Government are not living up to their pre-election promises, especially the Labour Party whose slogan was &ldquo;We as a party cannot accept the prospect of a continuation of the unemployment position&rdquo;. What is the Labour view of this plan?  The first step to resolve the situation is the setting up of an all-party unemployment task force.  Reform the tax code and introduce incentives for employers to take on more staff because at the moment they are crippled with heavy taxation.</P>
    <P>Tourism is our greatest potential for job creation, and I am disappointed that no indication is given in the plan of a reduction in VAT.  Many of our leading hoteliers are finding it impossible to market on a competitive basis due to the high VAT rates and even in the last budget indications were given that this would be considered and possibly a reduction implemented before the end of the year.  Tourism is responsible for <Col N="2892" /> 76,000 people in employment, or 7 per cent of all employed in the Republic are depending on tourism.  In my contribution on this year's budget I made the point that tourism is the only export industry which is being penalised in every conceivable way.  There are special concessions for export manufacturers in the special income tax rates.  Exports are exempt from VAT, yet export tourism is subject to the 18 per cent and 23 per cent VAT levels.  With high labour costs and PRSI this is hindering growth and does not provide incentive.  The plan should have recognised this fact and given an indication of Government investment in tourism over the next three years.</P>
    <P>The Cork and Kerry region is the largest and the most viable of our eight regions and needs a commitment from the Government for a new ferry service into Cork.  The service there has existed for 60 years and its loss is a very big blow to the region.  In 1983 the ferry service was responsible for 100,000 visitors plus 20,000 cars.  This is business we cannot lose, hence the reason for securing an alternative ferry for the 1985 season.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of a non-repayable grant of £5,000 for a local authority tenant of three years' standing. What about extending the income limit of £8,000 for SDA loans to encourage young couples to build their own homes and, as a further incentive, increasing the £1,000 new house grant to £5,000?  This would help in a very big way to reduce the present local authority housing lists.</P>
    <P>Page 113 of the plan points out that the average weekly rent paid by all local authority tenants in 1983 was almost £7 for new lettings.  I know that in Kerry County Council it was on average £14 and upwards.  The Government have now indicated that all local authority housing rents, both fixed and under the differential rents scheme will be substantially increased.  I must point out that in 80 per cent of local authority houses unemployment is rampant and a further rent increase will only add to the present hardship of the people there.  According to the plan, repairs to local authority <Col N="2893" /> houses are to be phased out over a number of years.</P>
    <P>The plan also refers to local authority estates where vandalism is rampant.  The Department of the Environment should take the initiative here in setting up various committees such as we have in the country and get them to take an interest in the developing of the estates.  I recommend that such committees should qualify for special amenity grants which would encourage them to expand the excellent work they are doing.  I welcome also the establishment of the national youth policy committee.  I hope that in adopting a national youth policy all youth throughout the country will have an input which will be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I welcome the massive investment in roads promised in the plan and I hope that special attention will be given to tourist counties especially with regard to bridges and relief roads.</P>
    <P>Finally, I appeal to the Government to reconsider the problems facing youth especially with regard to job creation. They cannot afford to wait until the nineties as recommended by a leading member of the Government this morning.</P>
    <P>The building construction industry, in particular the public and private sectors where there is tremendous job potential, should get special consideration.  Tourism needs further consideration.  Health, housing and agriculture all call for further attention and the PAYE sector also need consideration.</P>

      <P>I have already conceded half of my time. I was to speak for 20 minutes, now it will be ten minutes.</P>
      <P>Planning the development of the country's national economy demands that we take cognisance of the following realities: our present position, the resources we have available for development, the constraints arising and, finally, the realistic prospects for growth and the policies necessary to achieve that growth.</P>
      <P>The Government believe that continued agricultural expansion requires, as a first priority, policies to achieve stability and certainty in the national economic environment, in particular to reduce the levels of inflation and interest rates which caused such havoc in the agricultural sector here in the late seventies and early eighties.  In fact, it resulted in a reduced volume of agricultural output to the extent of 4 per cent between 1978 and 1981.  In the same period farm incomes fell by more than 40 per cent in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year 1982 was one of recovery in farming.  Net agricultural output rose by over 6 per cent in volume terms.  After adjusting for farming expenses, family incomes grew by a quarter in nominal terms and, when allowance was made for <Col N="2895" /> inflation, there was a real increase in farm income of 5 per cent.  Agriculture continued its development in 1983, with further increases in real output and incomes. Total farm incomes increased by nearly 14 per cent in current values and real income per head rose by some 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>The outlook for the current year's performance is one of continued growth in farm output.  The volume of net agricultural output is expected to increase by around 5 per cent, largely as a result of increases in milk and cereal output.  With some reduction in the quantities of farm materials used and other expenses, <i>per capita</i> farm incomes can be expected to be maintained in real terms.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, there has been a considerable reversal in recent years of the downward trend in farm output and income as experienced in the late seventies and early eighties.  The volume of real agricultural output this year will be some 12 per cent higher than it was three years ago.  It is no coincidence that during this period the level of inflation will have been more than halved.  Since it is unrealistic to expect farmers to expand output in the face of a continuous decline in real returns, a stable economic environment is now recognised as essential if real development in agriculture is to be promoted. The continued reduction in inflation is, therefore, a critical element in the Government's plan to expand farm output and incomes.</P>
    <P>It is extremely vital that we have a competent advisory service and a very good educational system in agriculture if we are to achieve those aims.  ACOT have been doing an excellent job in that regard.  We have asked that body to concentrate their efforts on those farmers who can achieve better results through their intervention.</P>
    <P>The courses run by ACOT have been a tremendous success.  The quality and training of young farmers has never been better, and hence the long term outlook for agriculture is most encouraging.  The special courses ACOT have been running have attracted great attendances and work very well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2896" /> Underlying the realities faced by this plan it is recognised that the changes in EEC policy will affect the output pattern of Irish agriculture.  Developments in the milk sector highlight the need for maximising efficiency in production and marketing so that a competitive cost structure can be achieved.  Milk producers must plan their businesses carefully so that real incomes can be maintained.  This will mean intensifying operations by increasing yields and grassland productivity. Spare capacity created must be used for other enterprises.  The profit from well-run lamb systems will stimulate increased sheep production, and an increase in tillage crop production such as winter cereals as alternative or supplementary enterprises can also be expected.</P>
    <P>The main emphasis on increasing production must, however, be in the beef sector, and a major aim of Government policy under the plan is to encourage an increase in cattle numbers.  Because of the importance of the beef cow sector in expanding the breeding herd and cattle production, the Government are providing a substantial increase in the rate of grant for beef cows under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Three-quarters of all beef cow herds are located in these areas, and a sum of £11 million is being made available in the year commencing 1 January 1986 to increase the headage grants on beef cows from the present level of £32 to £70 per cow.  As in the case of the EEC suckler cow premium scheme, payment will be made on beef cows of meat producing breeds.  The aim of this substantial rise in the grant level is designed to stimulate increased beef production, and I am confident that farmers will respond positively.</P>
    <P>Substantially increased funds are also being provided for a fresh and vigorous attack on animal disease, particularly bovine TB.  Since the present arrangements for tackling the disease have not proved effective, the Government have decided that a radical change in these arrangements is necessary.  Thus the increased funds are being made available on certain conditions; the veterinary surgeon to carry out testing will have to be <Col N="2897" /> nominated by the Department; payment of reactor grants will be conditional on removal of the reactor animals within ten days from the date of notification; there will be tighter supervision of trading at marts, and a central epidemiological unit will be set up in my Department to back up and complement field investigations into such matters as disease flare-up and herd breakdown and to advise on preventive and other measures.</P>
    <P>For the year 1985 we are providing an extra £10.5 million for the bovine TB eradication programme.  Starting on 1 January 1986 we will be providing an additional £2 million for people who have experienced difficulty because of disease in their herd and who have had to destock. That money will be going specifically to help such people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>While the elimination of bovine disease will benefit the nation as a whole, the direct beneficiaries, the farmers, are being asked to make an additional contribution by way of the disease eradication levy.  This increase will apply for one year only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land policy is an area which in the past has not always been given the attention it deserved.  The Government recognise that an effective land policy is a crucial element in overall agricultural policy. The general objective is to ensure that Ireland's farmland is used to make the greatest possible contribution to national product and in this way maximise output and incomes and generate down-stream jobs in food processing and marketing. A major aim of Government land policy will be to ensure, so far as this is practicable, that the ownership or management of our agricultural land is in the hands of those best fitted to work it.  It is proposed to achieve this aim by measures designed to increase the rate of land mobility, including the promotion and encouragement of leasing as a land management practice, as well as mechanisms to encourage earlier farmer retirement and family succession.  I hope the Land Bill <Col N="2898" /> will pass all Stages during this session of the Dáil to help us promote that work.</P>
    <P>Long-term investment is crucial if we are to achieve higher levels of efficiency and productivity on our farms.  The main instrument available to the Government to encourage such investment is the system of capital aids operated under the EEC's structures policy.  It has been suggested that a deficiency in aid schemes in the past has been an over-emphasis on capitalisation of farm enterprises, often involving high levels of funding without having proper regard to the profitability of the investment involved.  The Government are firmly of the view that, if State resources are to be used efficiently and the best results obtained, investment programmes must be carefully planned and appraised and their success measured by the level of profitability returned.  Capital investments must only be undertaken in so far as they are appropriate to the farmer's circumstances and then only after their value has been critically assessed.</P>
    <P>The schemes under which the capital aids are provided are currently under review by the EEC Council of Ministers. Commission proposals for changing the schemes envisage a number of major modifications including the termination of the selective approach under the farm modernisation scheme whereby development farmers are given more favourable treatment.  Instead, it is envisaged that full-time farmers below a reference income level who work towards an improvement plan will qualify for investment aid.  This should allow greater flexibility in planning development.  In view of the importance of the aid schemes in funding on-farm investment and their wider implications for farm development in general, the Government propose, in the context of the adoption by the EEC Council of a new structural directive, to undertake a full-scale review of the present capital investment aid schemes. I hope that review will be completed by the end of November, certainly by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment briefly on the food processing industry which accounts <Col N="2899" /> for one-fifth of those employed in the manufacturing sector here and contributes approximately 25 per cent of total value added manufacturing here.  So far the processing industry has failed to exploit its full potential and it has not maximised the added value and employment content of primary agricultural output.  Much of our agricultural exports are still being treated as commodities and insufficient attention has been devoted to exploring the opportunities for added value.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that I am confident that the growth rate of 1½ per cent to 2 per cent in net output projected for the period of the plan will be achieved.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say if, arising from another aspect of the statement made by the Council to the Parliament, there will be strict budgetary control and control of agricultural expenditure during 1985?  Is he satisfied that sufficient resources will be provided to run existing agricultural services from our farmers' point of view and that there will be some product price increases in 1985?</P>

      <P>As regards the question of there being sufficient funds to satisfy farmers under the CAP, I am not sure that there will.  The resistance we are meeting over getting a correction in the figures for the milk super-levy is an indication of current thinking at Brussels level. It is only now beginning to dawn on some of the farming organisations in Europe that the deal won by the Irish Government for our farmers was extremely good.  Consequently, these other farming organisations are putting pressure on their Ministers for Agriculture to win for them a similar deal.</P>

      <P>It would not be realistic to expect that every demand from the Irish agricultural industry for additional funds under the CAP in the years to come would be met automatically.  Where those demands are justified for the development of what is our primary interest they will be taken seriously and we will get the response we deserve as a committed Member of the European Community. On the second point raised by the Deputy, I do not know what the position is.  The matter of produce price increases arises in March or April.  Perhaps the question should more appropriately be addressed to the Minister for Agriculture. Produce price increases are negotiated within the CAP.  The CAP is the agricultural policy of the EC and I have no reason to believe that the Community is any less determined to uphold that policy now than they have been in the past.</P>

      <P>There is a later question that I will be answering in relation to budgetary discipline.  Obviously, it is unrealistic to expect that we can have some sort of blank cheque system to deal with any policy we might wish to put forward.  There must be some discipline in the expenditure of the Community just as there must be discipline in the expenditure of finances in this economy and in each Department.  We will not have blank cheques that can be filled in for everything we would like in the future.</P>

      <P>The situation in the Lebanon continues to give cause for concern. The authority of the Government applies in only a small area and much of the territory of the state is occupied by foreign forces.  Violence continues to flare up &mdash; two particularly horrifying instances recently were the car bomb attack on the US Embassy building in Beirut and the massacre of 13 villagers at Sohmor on 20 September by members of the South Lebanon Army.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless a certain amount of slow and painstaking progress is being made towards improving the situation.  The Government of Prime Minister Karame are continuing their efforts to reconcile the interests of the various communities in the Lebanon and to establish a new basis for the sharing of power.  The Government are pursuing their aim of extending central authority beyond the immediate Beirut area to areas currently under the control of militias.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The occupation of South Lebanon by Israel, which began with the Israeli invasion in June 1982, continues and is causing a great deal of human suffering and <Col N="2911" /> economic disruption in the Lebanon.  The new Israeli Prime Minister has said, however, that one of his Government's main objectives is the early return of Israeli forces from the Lebanon and has made it clear that there is no longer a necessary link between Israeli withdrawal and withdrawal of Syrian forces.  This is a hopeful development but it would be foolish to under-estimate the obstacles which still lie ahead to achievement of a complete Israeli withdrawal.</P>
    <P>Government policy on the Lebanon is closely co-ordinated with our partners in the Ten.  We wish to see the achievement of an independent, sovereign country enjoying territorial integrity and will support efforts to that end.  Israel should withdraw its forces from the Lebanon in accordance with the call of the Security Council.  Other foreign forces whose presence is not authorised by the Government should also be withdrawn.  Ireland continues to contribute in a practical way to the achievement of peace and normality in the Lebanon through participation in UNIFIL.  UNIFIL's mandate was renewed for a further six months by the UN Security Council on 12 October.</P>

There have been efforts made at the United Nations to get resolutions passed which would facilitate the withdrawal of the United States as a unified force from Korea.  That has not yet happened because the two motions in question appeared to some members, including Ireland, to be contradictory. Even if they were passed it still would not give the authority to have the forces withdrawn from Korea because they operate under a Security Council Resolution and not under a General Assembly Resolution.

The point I was making &mdash; which I think the Deputy appreciates &mdash; is that no matter how many resolutions were passed by the General Assembly, it would not affect the actual position because the only way it can be changed is through a resolution passed by the Security Council.  That is the point.  It <Col N="2914" /> does not matter what would be the view of the General Assembly.  Unless the Security Council itself took up a position on it and reversed their Resolution No. 84 of 7 July 1950, then no amount of passing of resolutions in the General Assembly would affect the position.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if the Government will support proposals that the present <Col N="2915" /> Government of Kampuchea should be recognised by the United Nations as the legitimate Government of the country, and that the United Nations seat should be withdrawn from the previous Pol Pot regime in view of its record of genocide against its own people and that it clearly does not have the support of the majority of the Kampuchean people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>When this issue first came before the General Assembly in 1979, Ireland decided to abstain on the question of which of the two regimes, that of Heng Samrin or Pol Pot, should be seated as the representatives of Kampuchea at the United Nations.  In the Government's view, neither delegation could legitimately claim to represent Kampuchea &mdash; the former because it has been installed by military intervention by an outside power and continued to be supported by that power, the latter because of its barbaric record of genocide against its own people.  It was judged that neither deserved Ireland's support and that an abstention in these circumstances was the correct position to adopt.</P>
      <P>Since 1979, neither the circumstances nor the criteria which influenced the Government's decision have changed to a degree which would warrant an alteration in our position.  If the question of Kampuchea's credentials is raised during the current session of the General Assembly, Ireland intends to maintain her abstention on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Government's view that only a comprehensive political solution to the Kampuchean problem can resolve the question of which regime legitimately represents Kampuchea.  Such a solution should be based on the Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea which was held in New York on 17 July 1981 and on successive resolutions of the UN General Assembly on the situation in Kampuchea.  These resolutions which have the overwhelming support of the General Assembly, including Ireland, call for the total withdrawal of all foreign troops from Kampuchea, the right of the Kampuchean people to determine their <Col N="2916" /> own destiny free from outside interference, and the restoration and preservation of Kampuchea's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy that our regard for the Pol Pot regime is not high.  I must question the attitude of the Deputy, when he refers to the government that has been there for a number of years now, because this is a government that has been imposed by force, by outside force, on the Kampuchean people.  It is not an elected government and the Deputy should not give the impression that it is.</P>
      <P>The Deputy says that the government have been there for a number of years but this government were imposed by outside force on the Kampuchean people.  It is not an elected Government and he should not give the impression that it is. For that reason it is not deserving of recognition.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Minister is aware that but for the fact that the Pol Pot regime was ousted that they would massacre a further million people. Is he aware that the Kampuchean people would have been destroyed if they had not been ousted?  At this stage it must be seen that the Kampuchean people need some outside force to protect them from Pol Pot, the most heinous monster in history, probably even worse than Hitler.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy says about the previous regime in Kampuchea <Col N="2917" /> is correct but, if the new government which was imposed by military intervention from an outside country was as acceptable to the Kampuchean people as the Deputy infers, how has the civil war lasted so long?  There are other forces operating in Kampuchea which would be far more acceptable in Kampuchea than those imposed from outside.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he believes that representations made by officials of his Department on his behalf to the British authorities concerning a speech by the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Hurd, at a passing-out parade in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh were justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There were several positive elements in Mr. Hurd's speech of 3 October last notably on the principles and objectives he laid down for police behaviour and the relations between the police and the community.  Nevertheless, the statement that the police in Northern Ireland enjoy increasing support among the public at large is a matter for concern. It runs counter to the information of the Government about the relationship between the police and the minority community, information that is based on the views and experience of responsible leaders of the minority who have themselves courageously and repeatedly condemned the use of violence for political ends.  I believe the representations made on my behalf regarding that portion of the speech were justified but as I have pointed out there are many other parts of the speech which I found helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with the Taoiseach's statement that the representations made by the Department of Foreign Affairs on the Minister's behalf were, in the Taoiseach's words, &ldquo;over-hasty&rdquo;?  Will the Minister be making a protest to the British Embassy regarding the remarks by the British Prime Minister to the effect that democracy exists in Northern Ireland in the light of the statement made by him in Lahinch <Col N="2920" /> on 25 August last that the real substance of democracy does not exist in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the problem is that Irish politicians frequently look at things differently from British politicians regarding Northern Ireland and we have a different perception of what is going on there.  When I commented on Mr. Hurd's speech, a point I repeated the following day, I said that the reports I am getting from responsible leaders who are anti-Provisional IRA and anti-violence, do not give me the same assessment of the view of the minority of the RUC as Mr. Hurd said in his speech.  The same applies to many other statements by British politicians. As regards the point made by the Deputy, I think what the Taoiseach said was that he found many constructive parts in the speech but that he thought the view expressed concerning increasing support for the RUC was not correct.  I think he would possibly have preferred that my Department, under my instructions, should have brought up the matter with the British Government and that we should have stressed equally the positive part of the speech as I did two days later, as well as the part with which I found fault.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind repeating myself.  The Deputy must appreciate the difference between the two countries. Different emphasis is laid on different things.  When I heard the speech by the <Col N="2921" /> new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, I felt that what he was saying about increasing support among all sections of the community for the police force in the North was not correct because it did not match the reports I am getting almost daily from very responsible leaders who are themselves very anti-Provisional IRA and anti-violence.  They tell me that the sense of alienation by the minority in Northern Ireland from the security forces there is widening every day.  When I heard that I indicated to the British Government that we could not agree with that section of the speech.  I repeated that the following day, saying at the same time that I saw some positive things in what Mr. Hurd had to say.  I welcomed his new approach and said I appreciated the fact that he had on open mind about many things.  What the Taoiseach was saying in his broadcast on the Sunday of that week was that he would have liked me or my Department to stress the more positive elements which he definitely saw in Mr. Hurd's speech, but he also said he knew the point I was making.  Increasing minority support for the RUC was not the information coming from his sources either.  I do not think there was any great difference between the Taoiseach's position and mine.</P>

We fully agree with the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Mr. Hurd's interpretation of the situation is completely fallacious and that there is growing alienation.

      <P>As is stated in the national economic plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> the Government are committed to the established UN target of 0.7 per <Col N="2924" /> cent of GNP for official development assistance (ODA).  While the Government are committed to achieving this target within an appropriate time-frame and as economic circumstances permit, and had set themselves the ambitious objective of progressing towards it at an annual rate of 0.05 per cent of GNP, actual growth in Irish ODA since 1974 has averaged about 0.015 per cent of GNP per annum.  Despite the present climate of exceptional budgetary restraint, the Government will, during the period of the plan, maintain the rate of increase in ODA already achieved. This will involve a 47 per cent increase in total ODA from almost £34 million to £50 million.  The possibility of implementing the higher rate of increase previously envisaged will be reviewed in the light of future economic circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We had originally envisaged an increase of 0.05 per cent and we have had to cut that back to 0.015 per cent in the light of the economic situation prevailing.  An increase of 47 per cent over the period of the plan is significant.  I spent much of last week arguing for the OACP countries to be given something even slightly above the rate of inflation for the past five years but have not yet achieved that.  The very fact <Col N="2925" /> that we are committing ourselves in advance to an increase of 47 per cent over a three year period is very significant.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gregory is aware, from replies to his written questions which I gave last week, that I consider the practice of strip searching in Armagh prison to be degrading and that I take a very serious view of it.</P>
      <P>He is further aware that the matter has been raised with the British authorities on several occasions and that I keep it under close review.</P>
      <P>I would not consider it appropriate to give details of any further action I might take but the Deputy may rest assured that if there is any specific incident which he feels should be pursued I would be happy to give it my attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, as he has made repeated approaches to the British Government on behalf of women prisoners in Armagh prison, and as there has been no positive response from the British Government so far and as the strip searching of women, even women prisoners on remand, still continues unabated, without any reduction whatever, he should pursue this matter on behalf of <Col N="2927" /> these prisoners in the Court of Human Rights?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The major improvements in manufacturing activity in 1984 would seem to indicate a strong recovery in business confidence. Manufacturing output is expected to grow by 9 per cent in 1984 as compared with 7 per cent in 1983; manufacturing exports are expected to increase by 17 per cent as compared with 14 per cent in 1983; site visits this year by foreign industrialists are 30 per cent higher than in 1983; and there are indications that for the first time in five years employment in manufacturing will increase in 1985.</P>
      <P>The recently published Industrial Policy White Paper and <i>Building on Reality</i> provide a framework within which business can plan and implement with confidence their marketing and investment proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the indicators in a recent circular from the FUE would indicate that confidence is decreasing, the number of orders on the books are decreasing and that expected production figures are calculated also to decrease?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not have any information of that kind produced by the FUE and I would need more information about it.  However, the data I have quoted is definite and is based on information available and would tend to counteract the information contained in what the Deputy quoted.  However, individual sectors in industry will find themselves in difficult trading circumstances even during the early stages of recovery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The information I have quoted would indicate precisely that. There is another indication which I did not give the Deputy which tends to confirm what I am saying, and that is, that the number of small industry projects approved by the IDA in the first eight months of 1984 are significantly up, by about 100, on the number of similar projects approved in the same period in 1983. In most cases they are native Irish entrepreneurs rather than foreign investors and many of them are serving the home as well as the export market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the recent past some of our leading industrialists have made rather scathing attacks on the lack of incentives being provided by the Government towards increasing business confidence, in particular statements by Mr. O'Reilly, Mr. Smurfit and Mr. Doyle?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. P.V. Doyle in the tourism sector.  Is the Minister aware that these statements are being made by such people and does he intend to respond to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the statement by Mr. P.V. Doyle but I will take the Deputy's word for it and I will check it later.  However, I am aware of the statement made by Mr. O'Reilly which called for reflation of the economy. I replied to that, but not directly.  I issued a statement shortly afterwards which indicated the constraints that exist on this Government because of accumulated debt in the past.  There might have been a case in the seventies for us to have had a more prudent budgetary policy so that we could have done something in the eighties when the predicted growth in the labour force occurred.  We wasted the opportunity and the money in the seventies by not putting money aside and we cannot do it now.  As I said, I have replied indirectly to Dr. O'Reilly's views with which we do not agree.  He expressed other views, such as the need to promote <Col N="2930" /> marketing in more imaginative ways by Irish industry, which we support and we have incorporated some of his suggestions in our White Paper.</P>
      <P>Mr. Smurfit issued a statement that his earlier statement was not a criticism of the present Government but of successive Government policies and he said he welcomed what the present Government were doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that the only sectors of the economy that have progressed so far as exports are concerned are the high technological, pharmaceutical and electronic industries, and that every other sector has declined? Last year there was a reduction of 11,000 people in manufacturing industry.  Will the Minister confirm that this is the case and that his attitude towards business confidence is erroneous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not need to go by what I have said in this matter.  The ESRI in their September publication, which is already on the record of this House, indicated that the industrial recovery in Ireland was broadening considerably and they cited good export performances by the textile, knitwear and clothing industries.  They indicated quite clearly that the recovery in Ireland was not confined to the data processing industry, as the Deputy is trying to infer.  That is not my opinion, it is the opinion of the Economic and Social Research Institute and I would refer the Deputy to their report.</P>

      <P>The point raised by my colleague, Deputy Reynolds, is symptomatic of the kind of morass into which this Government have sunk in all their dealings.  Already there have been a number of major financial scandals that have seriously damaged the credibility of the Government and this whole question of the financing of Bord Telecom and the relationship of their finances to Central Fund financing requires very close investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the rather pathetic sight of the Minister for Finance, when introducing his budgetary measures and making his annual economic commentary on the state of the nation, being unable to tell the House of a serious financial drain from this country that has been estimated to be at least £500 million.  We have been put in an even more unreal situation with the production of the document we are now debating.  This is yet another analysis <Col N="2960" /> of a situation that basically only requires effective and positive government. Unfortunately this Government appear to be suffering from a paralysis of analyses, if I might put it like that.  We have another analysis on top of quite a few in the past two years but we have not had positive measures or decisions.</P>
    <P>This document which is called the national plan is a type of bromide or drug, designed to dull the senses of Labour Party and Fine Gael Deputies in order to maintain an artificial unity in this Dáil while the nation is growing angrier every day.  The people who have honourably supported the Labour Party and Fine Gael have a greater sense of the reality of the situation than the Labour Party and the Fine Gael parliamentarians who have sought to insulate themselves from the realities of life.  They have cobbled this document together in order to stay on for a few more months.  That is all this document is about.  It is not about the economic, social and political problems of the nation.  It is simply a document designed to produce an artificial unity in this House for the time being.  The philosophy behind it is, &ldquo;sufficient unto the day&rdquo;&mdash; no more and no less.</P>
    <P>The mood of anger among the people is not caused by the difficulties facing the Government.  The Irish people have always been fair in their assessment of matters of that kind.  If a Government are genuinely facing difficulties, the people understand.  The mood of anger among the people is caused because of the inability of the Government to face up to the problems and to make an honest effort to tackle them.  The Government have made cosmetic attempts to gloss over the problems as if they did not exist and their document contains downright fiction. This has happened also in other documents emanating from the Government.</P>
    <P>The main fiction in this document lies in the first sentence.  It states that the most serious problem is unemployment and that the first objective of the plan is to increase employment, but some pages later the unemployment figures are given in a separate table and they project a rise in unemployment in the three years from <Col N="2961" /> 1984 to 1987.  This lip service with regard to tackling the problems of unemployment is shown as a particularly callous kind of hypocrisy because on page 145 of the document <i>Building on Reality</i> table 7-2 sets out the public capital programme for 1984 to 1987.  There it is proposed to scale down the public capital programme so that by 1987 it will be 20 per cent below its present level and half the real level proposed by us in November 1982 for the 1983 public capital programme.  I ask the Taoiseach in his reply to indicate how there can be any attempt to achieve the main objective in his document which is to increase employment? How can one attempt to deal with the serious problem of unemployment facing the country if at the same time the public capital programme is being drastically cut? It is basic and elementary economics that capital investment in both the public and the private sectors is the key to job creation. There is no other way in which more jobs can be created.  One must have a public environment and a public policy which stimulate private investment and can run hand in hand with public capital investment so that the total of the two is sufficient to absorb as large a number of people as possible in gainful employment.</P>
    <P>An analysis of this kind leads only to a paralysis of government and it cannot be pretended that it will solve the unemployment problems unless, as a centre piece of that analysis, there is a positive proposal or a series of proposals to raise the level of public and private investment so as to ensure more employment.  It is a totally dishonest fabrication and sheer fiction to suggest that the unemployment problem can be met and at the same time the public capital programme be cut as drastically as this.  There is not a single line in this document which in any way suggests how the private sector should be stimulated towards private capital investment which is equally essential in order to achieve the objective of lowering the level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>As far as the private sector are concerned, there is nothing in the document to foster a revival of confidence in the <Col N="2962" /> economy.  That is the essential prerequisite, the <i>sine qua non</i> before any real progress can be made.  Confidence must be revived in the future of the economy so that the private investor, both at home and abroad, is stimulated to invest in it. There is nothing in this document which suggests how that should be fostered, nurtured and stimulated.  In fact, the drain of funds out of this country, which was discovered at a very late stage by the Minister for Finance, is an ongoing factor about which nothing is being done.</P>
    <P>I mention one industry where at present there is enormous scope for positive thinking and positive action &mdash; that is the construction industry.  At present in that industry there are 45,000 people unemployed.  There is scope for a unique investment partnership between the State, local authorities, financial institutions, trade unions and the private sector of the industry, which partnership has never been attempted before.  This would mobilise all the available skills of workers, tradesmen, management and professional people in the industry.  They can be mobilised by concerted and planned action and leadership on the part of the Government.  In all these areas there are skills and talents tragically unemployed and untapped.  This occurs right across the board &mdash; workers, the skilled, the professionals and management.  The institutions within the State can provide co-operation if leadership and concern are shown by the State in mobilising such talents.  The construction industry is one which presents very few balance of payments problems.  The import content is only of the order of 23 per cent, 77 per cent being composed of home raw materials.</P>
    <P>The whole question of job opportunities in the growing sector of high technology manufacturing industry and the expanding services sector is practically ignored in the document, although these are the areas which will undoubtedly provide the opportunities of the future for our skilled young workforce, such a unique feature of our sociological set-up at present.  Our one great strength is the large skilled young workforce because of <Col N="2963" /> the existing excellent training and educational facilities.  This is precisely the sort of young workforce which can be absorbed into the high technological and services industries which we in Fianna Fáil were encouraging through the agency of the IDA right through the late seventies. Yet, there are in this document no proposals for a far more intensified drive to provide this type of investment and to give the opportunities of the future to our young workforce.</P>
    <P>The export performance of the electronic and pharmaceutical industries established during the period I have mentioned under Fianna Fáil is one of the few things going for the Government, yet they are marking time with respect to these industries.  It is not enough to rely on the industries which we brought in between the years 1977 and 1981.  It is time this Government stopped their paralysis of analysis, got up off their behinds and got down to the business of bringing in people with the investment required for a massive increase in an area in which we have more than adequately proved ourselves.  It is an area of investment in which there are people willing to come and use this country as their base of operations in Western Europe, and particularly within the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The only thing stopping that type of investment, as I have heard from these people time and time again, is lack of confidence in a Government which are ideologically disunited and divided. Those who have the money for these investive purposes see no sense in coming into an investment climate created by a Government which lack a consciousness or an orientation with regard to investment policies.  Investors of that kind are not interested in Governments which stand still; they are interested in Governments which get up and go, make the necessary decisions and encourage and secure investment.</P>
    <P>External investment required for these industries has now practically ceased and I challenge the Minister for Industry to come in here and say otherwise.  The <Col N="2964" /> rising graph of investment from abroad into such industries located here has fallen drastically because there is an absence of confidence in the economy and an atmosphere which precludes investment here at present.  This type of investment will not recommence on the desired scale until this unreal Government, ideologically split from top to bottom, departs from the scene and enables a climate of investment confidence to be restored which will encourage such people to invest here.</P>
    <P>A further factor on which there has been a lamentable lack of decision making is the inability of the Government to introduce a rational and equitable tax system.  This is deterring investment here and also placing an unfair burden on many of our own people.  Yet the Government continue to sleep on the two reports of the Commission on Taxation where a number of practical proposals have been made and approved of in sideways comments by the Taoiseach and various Government Ministers.  So far in regard to their adoption and implementation those proposals have been ignored.</P>
    <P>Despite the serious matters which have led to a lack of confidence, a diminution of investment, a departure of funds from this country, serious matters which have prevented the Government from embarking on an equitable taxation system, despite those factors which require to be remedied almost immediately, this does not appear to deter the Government from moving off into another strange, mad land in which once again we see a reference in this document to the National Development Corporation. This corporation is peddled yet again for the umpteenth time.  It was born out of feverish pre-election activities to smooth over the ideological differences between the proposed two partners.</P>
    <P>It emerged at that early stage, and it has been mentioned in every analysis since.  It is included again over several pages in this analysis.  It has not yet seen the light of day.  I should like to hear the Taoiseach say when it will see the light of day, what form it will take, what positive contribution it will make, and whether it <Col N="2965" /> will be in any way a departure from the sort of bureaucratic quango which is an excuse for analysts rather than people who want to do positive good and take positive political decisions.  It has not yet seen the light of day, and the Fine Gael Party may prevent it from seeing the light of day.</P>
    <P>It is mentioned in this analysis, while basic industries which are of real importance in our community and of real importance to the future of the economy get very scanty and meagre mention.  I refer to the food industry, the fishing industry, tourism and forestry, four basic industries concerned with the development of our natural resources.  They are barely mentioned whereas in our document <i>The Way Forward</i> all those areas are dealt with in great depth and great detail.  I will give the House a few figures to bear out my point.</P>
    <P>On tourism there are four solid pages of detail in <i>The Way Forward.</i> In this document there is a little over a page of waffle.  I was glad to see an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> referring to it as such.  It is a string of cliches put together without any real effort to tackle an industry in which we have many natural advantages. With selective and positive incentives in the way of tax grants and loan aids we could immediately stimulate employment in tourism and create an atmosphere of expansion which would lead to a very positive enlargement of employment fairly quickly.  That is one of the merits of the tourism industry, apart from being an industry in which we have so many natural advantages.  It is an area in which fairly rapid employment can be created if the appropriate stimulation is given.</P>
    <P>There is no point in talking about a rate of expansion which is what Bord Fáilte talk about which is keeping level with the rate of inflation.  That is not enough.  There was a far bigger expansion of tourism in the world this year than ever before, and particularly in Europe. We got a smaller share of that cake and, relatively speaking, we did worse than any country in Europe in regard to the tourism business in the past six months. <Col N="2966" /> Make no mistake about it.  A small increase which is talked about by Bord Fáilte is relatively bad compared with the real export performance of every other country within the European Community and within western Europe generally this year.</P>
    <P>All we have in this document is a page of waffle without a single chart, a single statistic, or a single attempt to tackle the problem, apart from an attempt to boast about the increase in business this year which kept pace only with the fall in the value of money, no more and no less.  So much for a very important sector of our economy, tourism.</P>
    <P>Fisheries merited four-and-a-half pages in <i>The Way Forward.</i> We went into great detail in dealing with aquaculture and further developments of our marine resources outside the traditional fishing methods.  Fisheries merited four lines in this document before us.  Forestry merited another four or five lines.  In our document it got two and a half pages. The food industry was dismissed in a paragraph, probably the major industry with scope for improvement and expansion in the whole agri-industrial area. These are facts.</P>
    <P>One area in which we made very positive recommendations in <i>The Way Forward</i> was at page 50 where we made specific reference to import substitution. We made a specific proposal:</P>
    <P>Special units will be established in the Departments of Industry and Energy to help achieve a significant increase in the extent to which Irish firms avail of the extensive and growing opportunities for import substitution which exist in the manufacturing sector generally and the building supplies industry respectively.</P>
    <P>There is not a single reference to import substitution in this document.  We could establish units such as we suggested in <i>The Way Forward.</i> I know the problems with the EEC and there is no point in the Taoiseach parading them for me.  Administratively and in our own way by moral persuasion through units of this kind, we could achieve enormous progress in the <Col N="2967" /> way of import substitution which could be just as valuable as exports.  Yet there is not a line, not a word, about it in this document.</P>
    <P>There we have a number of basic areas where, by Government administrative action, something could be achieved. These are areas where decisions could be taken fairly quickly if the Government were serious about their business instead of suffering from the disease of paralysis through analysis.  We are seeing the paralysis of the political will caused by the structure of this Government, and by their basic inability to grasp situations, take them on board, go ahead and make the necessary decisions, implement policies and carry out proposals.</P>
    <P>The references to another major industry are pathetic.  I refer to the references to agriculture.</P>
    <P>Here we have some pages of waffle devoted to agriculture.  Fianna Fáil have seven very solid pages in <i>The Way Forward</i> devoted to planning for agriculture. I, as Minister for Agriculture, left this Government a legacy of a four year plan for agriculture fully drafted and ready, and all the Government had to do was to implement it.  They published it finally a few months ago and it is virtually ignored in the document here.  The central message of our four year plan for agriculture is that there must be an investment in agriculture and the most practical way to achieve investment is to raise cattle numbers, the numbers in the national herd, cattle stocks.  That is the basic barometer in regard to agriculture.  You can quote all sorts of other statistics in regard to agriculture, but fundamentally unless this question of cattle stocks is tackled there is no hope of this Government really getting to grips with our major industry.  It is well that the Taoiseach should know &mdash; probably he does not; he is not very hot on this area &mdash; that the question of cattle stocks is the most sensitive barometer of farmer confidence at the moment and at present the stocks are lower than at any time in the past 12 years, and the trend is downwards.  There <Col N="2968" /> is no evidence in this document that any thought is being given to any action to provide the investment funds to our farmers to buy the necessary cows and expand their herd to provide this basic dynamic so essential in building up agricultural output.</P>
    <P>Here the Taoiseach must bear a heavy load of responsibility, assuming as he does the mantle of credibility in regard to statistics.  Page 19 of his document contains a statistic which is totally fictitious. A table there, dealing with output and projection of output in the years 1980-83, states that agricultural output rose by 11 per cent and on the basis of that 11 per cent rise over the past three years there is to be a 10 per cent rise over the years 1984-87.  This is a fiction and a fraud.  If the Taoiseach refers to his Central Statistics Office he will see that the whole output projections made in that, both in regard to agricultural output and GNP, are totally fraudulent because he has chosen a base in regard to agriculture which is at variance with the base chosen by his own CSO.  He provides a base of 11 per cent in that document; in fact, according to the CSO, agricultural net output in the period 1980-83 increased by only 0.12 per cent.  That is an important and serious omission and mistake, that you have there a difference between a 0.12 per cent increase in output between 1980 and 1983 and an 11 per cent increase in output in 1983 according to the table in this document.  On the basis of that table there is a further 10 per cent in projected increase.  Where does the Taoiseach get this figure which makes nonsense out of all the projections in regard to gross national output in that chart?</P>
    <P>The real trouble is that the present Government, apart from the whole waffling nature of this document, their penchant for analysis rather than action and the complete paralysis of political will, have lost their way and they do not understand the role of Government.  The people in their instinctive way realise now that this Government, in office now for practically two years, are not governing and do not appear to understand what they should be doing in Government. <Col N="2969" /> They have long Government meetings, whether in Donnybrook or Merrion Street, in which chit-chat but not decisions are the order of the day.</P>
    <P>This Government must realise that what Government is about is making decisions and exercising the power necessary to implement decisions about nothing else.  Government certainly is not about indulgence in peripheral affairs like setting up committees.  We have had a number of Dáil committees set up.  I said when they were established that this was all very desirable in its own way but not really a serious contribution to tackling the nation's problems.  Of course, it sounded well, it read well, and the Government proceeded to indulge themselves in committee-making, setting up committees, engaging in the sort of chit-chat that goes on in committees.  Generally this Government are behaving like a delinquent debating society, and we have enough of those around the place.</P>
    <P>We do not want an Irish Government behaving like a delinquent debating society.  Certainly Government is not about a charade of Government presented as being something real by an expensive team of handlers who are designed purely and solely to lull the people into a state of complacency, do a Houdini operation and try to persuade the people that something is there that is not there, that there is a Government there when such is not the case.  We have arrived at the day when that has become a substitute for Government, a cosmetic covering, the emperor with no clothes, when all of what is there is a substitute for Government.  That is the day when this Government must depart.  That is why it is most appropriate that they depart now before the situation becomes worse &mdash; not for the Government because it is bad enough for them already, but from the point of view of the people.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk here about Dáil reform, the reform of democracy, the creation of a new climate of understanding by the people in our society about what Government is about, what the Dáil is about and so on.  We have had plenty of debates about that, but the <Col N="2970" /> single most important matter that needs to be resolved in this area is the revival of decision-making by an Irish Government. That is the most important reform and purpose of modern Irish democracy. With Fianna Fáil Governments in the past the emphasis was on decision-making. Government meetings were designed solely to make decisions.  Decisions brought into this House for debate and made once they were carried in this House used to be our style of Government and will be so again.  Above all, it was never so essential as at present to cut this Gordian knot of complacency, paralysis, chit-chat, analysing, producing White Papers and Green Papers and more documents and recommendations.</P>
    <P>We want to break through that log jam and have a Government around the Government table making decisions quickly, explaining to the people and, above all else, exercising the power to carry them out.  This Government are incapable of doing that for many reasons. They are incapable because of the personality problem of the Taoiseach. They are incapable because of the basic division between the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party.  They are incapable because fundamentally as a group of people nobody there is willing to take the Government by the scruff of the neck and say that we must carry out our business in the people's interests, instead of trying to view the parade of the business of Government through the rose-tinted spectacles of various points of view prepared, handled, orchestrated and organised by professional people who want to package our Government, like the packaging idea originally reached in the United States.  At that time there was the infamous book written by Theodore White on the packaging of a President. That President did not last too long because he met his problems.  As sure as night follows day the Government will meet their problems because packaging a Government in a form of tinsel wrapping is no answer at the end of the day. The Government are approaching the end of their day because finally the people have discovered for themselves the type <Col N="2971" /> of administration that has been inflicted upon them.  The sort of packaging and presentation without action and decisions that we have at present will not continue because we have an intelligent democracy here.  The people now realise what is behind the charade that has been inflicted upon them by, in particular, the Taoiseach, his handlers and the Government.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that the Government should contemplate their departure as quickly as possible because of their incapacity and inability to make decisions. Only a Government that will embark on the decision-making process will regenerate faith and belief in the nation's progress which is required to restore not only the confidence of our own people in the future, something that is lacking at present, but also the confidence of those friends and investors throughout the world, particularly the US and at home, who have money, ability and skills.  Those people would dearly wish to build a prosperous Ireland and help us in our efforts. We want to see all those people taking part in the rebuilding of our nation.  However, not alone do we have to restore the confidence of those who voted us here but we must restore the confidence of those who can play a positive role in further enhancing development here so as to provide the type of job creation we need for our young people in the future. It is only through the restoration of such confidence that we can build a prosperous nation that will be free from the incubus and the burden of the worst Government we have had since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>The time is nigh for a change.  There is no point in postponing the day.  The temporary postponment the Taoiseach may achieve by producing this fictitious document may gain a few weeks or a few months for him, but when the fall comes it will be greater.  The people outside have risen and are on the march.  They are fully sustained in the knowledge that there is an alternative Government available to take the place of the Coalition and take the necessary decisions in the national interest.  The risen people will <Col N="2972" /> speak all the louder if they are thwarted much longer by the Taoiseach's inaction, delay and decision to stick with office with ideologies and ideological friends with whom he does not have anything in common.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Labour Party that they should not be in power with people with whom they do not have anything in common.  The supporters of that party are saying that.  The supporters of the Labour Party, and Fianna Fáil supporters, will when the next election comes along ensure that Fine Gael are restored to their minority position in the Dáil.  The 55 per cent we achieved in the recent opinion polls will be discarded as part of history because we will be running well ahead with the combination of our supporters and the supporters of the Labour Party.  They will work together to eliminate this nefarious influence that has perpetrated itself on Irish public life in the form of an incompetent Taoiseach and an incompetent Fine Gael Party run by handlers and chancers with whom our supporters, supporters in the Labour Party and in the Fianna Fáil Party, will have nothing to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour as best I can to follow that knockabout turn.  At the outset of my speech, I want to make one emphatic point.  The national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> when endorsed by the Dáil tonight will no longer be merely a Government document &mdash; it will, by virtue of this endorsement, have become the property of the Irish people.  It will be their plan, the basis upon which they will be basing their decisions in relation to economic and social matters for the three years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my remarks this evening, I shall, for some minutes at least, be responding to criticisms by the Opposition, and responding to them in terms as blunt as those which have been used in Opposition criticisms of the plan.  I must do that in order to set the record straight. But that having been done, and the plan having been endorsed by this House of the Oireachtas, I hope that it will, like other plans at an earlier period, cease to <Col N="2973" /> be an issue of contention between the parties and become the common ground upon which all of us can build together during these three critical years, build a solid foundation for the future progress of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>Having said that I want, before dealing with points made by the Opposition, to highlight the principle aspects of what we will have achieved with <i>Building on Reality.</i> First, we now have firm Government decisions for economic and social policy over the next three years and the implementation of these decisions is already under way.  The certainty and stability essential for economic growth have been established with this plan and these decisions.</P>
    <P>On the economic front the rise in unemployment will be halted and reversed during the period of the plan.  The number of jobs, which has fallen over the past four years by something like 40,000 will increase rapidly in the years ahead. The PAYE burden has now stopped rising and we will prevent it rising further and seek to ease it even within the period of the plan.  Living standards are starting to improve and will continue to do so during these years after a period of four years during which they have fallen on average by something like 10 per cent. Public expenditure during these years will not rise in real terms.  This means that the whole of future growth will be available for increased investment and improved living standards in contrast with the last four years during which we had stagnation in output with the public sector taking an increased amount from that output.  The residue has not been sufficient either to maintain living standards or to maintain investment.  We have, unlike our predecessors in Government, taken the decisions which will ensure that expenditure is curbed. Deputy Lenihan's strictures on this point of decision-making in the closing part of his speech could scarcely be more inept. No previous Government decided, as we have done, on the detailed limits for current expenditure, Department by Department, and Vote by Vote, as well as the capital spending side for three <Col N="2974" /> years ahead.  The scale of the decisions we have taken, the detail of them, and the disciplines they will impose on the whole system of the public sector is something unique that has never previously been attempted.  Deputy Lenihan could scarcely have been wider of the mark in that respect.</P>
    <P>Moreover, public sector borrowing and the current budget deficit are being reduced during the period of the plan fast enough to halt the diversion of an ever-increasing share of our tax revenue into interest payments on a mounting public debt but the reduction will not be so fast as to damage the economy.</P>
    <P>I will conclude this brief summary by saying that the aims of the plan are modest &mdash; deliberately so &mdash; but they can and will be achieved.</P>
    <P>In contrast to the Government's coherent, imaginative and credible plan, the Opposition's approach to the debate has been internally inconsistent and negative. Its inherent absurdity can best be demonstrated by identifying one by one the assumptions underlying the attack on the plan by the Leader of the Opposition in his opening speech which I have read and analysed with care.  First, he thinks that interest rates are going to go on rising. He rejects the assumption underlying the plan that at some point next year they will begin to fall &mdash; Dáil Oficial Report of 10 October 1984, Volume 352, column 2169.  Second, he expects the Labour force to grow by more than we have assumed, even though we have based our figures on the latest demographic projections and, within these, upon the most optimistic assumption on emigration &mdash; column 2170 of the Official Report.  At column 2170 he claims that public service pay will rise by more than the amount we have allowed for &mdash; our decision on this, he alleges, &ldquo;damages the credibility of the entire exercise&rdquo;.  He argues that faster progress should be made in reducing the deficit and borrowing &mdash; our rate of progress is too slow.  In the next column he asserts that there should be a reduction in tax levels before 1987 &mdash; we are criticised for not having proposed and projected such a reduction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2975" /> At columns 2176 and 2177 he holds that we should not have substituted the farm tax for income tax; but if we had not done so we would have lost some £30 million in revenue.  The figure will approach £40 million by 1987.  At column 2170 he says in his view the cash limits for public spending are unrealistically low.  At column 2174 according to him, we should not have attempted to cut the cost of the health services.  In the next column, 2175, he says that we should not have imposed any restriction on local authority housing maintenance.  At column 2180, he calls for a higher level of capital spending and says that we should have made &ldquo;room&rdquo; for this in some unspecified way.</P>
    <P>I think this fairly and comprehensively summarises the main criticism of the national plan by the Leader of the Opposition and repeated by many subsequent Fianna Fáil speakers.  These criticisms raise the question, however, as to what actual policy the Opposition believe we should pursue.  I have read and re-read Deputy Haughey's speech, in particular, for some clue as to the Opposition's thinking on this subject.  Beyond a reference to the need for a &ldquo;complete turnaround in thinking and policy&rdquo;&mdash; another U-turn? &mdash; I could find no clue of any kind.  I challenge any Member of the Opposition to direct my attention to any such clue in any line, sentence or paragraph in that speech.  The mystery is really quite profound.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey in his speech assumes less favourable external conditions than those on which the plan is based: we, he alleges, are too optimistic, and by clear implication our national growth rate will be slower than we have projected.  He assumes that spending levels would be higher.  He regards our decisions on public service pay as unrealistic, rejects our spending cuts and wants bigger increases in public capital spending.  He believes that taxation should be reduced as a proportion of GNP during the period of the plan.  He manages to believe simultaneously that we should reduce the <Col N="2976" /> deficit and borrowing faster than we propose to do &mdash; presumably, in view of the wording of his criticisms, and the proposals of his own document <i>The Way Forward,</i> to which he referred and whose proposals he did not modify in any way &mdash; eliminating the deficit by 1987.</P>
    <P>Frankly, if, especially against the background of the first assumption about unfavourable external conditions, he can believe that those three latter objectives can be achieved at the same time, he might be able to govern Wonderland, but he is totally incapable of facing up to the task of governing this or any other country in the real world.  How anyone can argue for the elimination of the current budget deficit by 1987, while simultaneously calling for more spending and less taxation, and all this in a more unfavourable external environment, quite escapes me, and will, I believe, escape the electorate also.</P>
    <P>The absence of a positive proposal of any kind from his speech must constitute a record for any politician purporting to expect to be in Government.  His words were in fact the words of a man who despairs of ever being in Government and feels he can luxuriate in totally negative criticism, regardless of the absurdity of the picture he, by implication, draws of the policies he would pursue.  His speech has, in fact, ruled him out from the world of serious politics.  He used the phrase &ldquo;emperor without any clothes&rdquo; during his speech.  It struck me how appropriate it was to the Opposition's own position as set out in their Leader's speech.  I believe I am dispensed from further comment on the Opposition's barren approach to this debate and can concentrate instead on the positive and constructive task of presenting the national plan to the people of this State.</P>
    <P>Before doing so I should like, however, to mark the contrast between the attitude of the then Opposition to the early economic programmes of the late fifties to the early sixties and the attitude of the present Opposition to this plan.  I believe that there are only ten Deputies in this House today who were there in 1964, including the Leader and Deputy Leader <Col N="2977" /> opposite when the Second Economic Programme was launched &mdash; the first document to set out a number of specific targets for economic performance &mdash; without, however, going into as much detail in respect of the current Government finances as has <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P>At that time I was not active in politics, but as an economist I was asked by the then Opposition for my advice on their reaction to that plan, with whose preparation I had been closely associated as had the present chairman of the National Planning Board.  While pointing out that my advice was somewhat partisan because of my close involvement with the preparation of the document, I said that in my view the national interest would not be served by any attempt to denigrate or downgrade it; but instead that I hoped the Opposition, then under the leadership of Mr. James Dillon, would give the plan their support, while going into such peripheral constructive criticisms as they might think appropriate.  My advice was taken by an Opposition which had a deep sense of their duty to the nation and which put that before any thought of short term advantage.</P>
    <P>That Second Economic Programme largely achieved its targets, although, somewhat foolishly as I thought at the time, it was effectively abandoned by the then Fianna Fáil Government after the recession of 1966, when it appeared for a time that their targets had been rendered unattainable by that relatively minor setback.</P>
    <P>I regret very sincerely that the same spirit that existed in politics then, the sense of solidarity where the national interest was concerned, transcending party considerations, is not present today.  We now have opposition divorced from logic or argument, simply for the sake of opposition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>But in the first instance this will not deter us from the task we have undertaken, and in the second place I am not sure that it matters as much as <Col N="2978" /> it might have done then, because our people today have become a good deal more sophisticated and brush off very lightly the kind of political rhetoric that we have heard in this House since last Wednesday, recognising in its totally negative character an element of party politics that contributes nothing to the national advantage.</P>
      <P>I turn, therefore, to the plan itself, with some preliminary comments on one or two points where questions have been raised which I think deserve an answer. One of these questions relates to the assumptions about the growth of the labour force upon which the employment-unemployment projections are based.  As I explained to the House in a reply to a Parliamentary Question last Tuesday, this projection is based on the latest demographic forecasts available to us, prepared by an expert group with participation from outside the Civil Service; or, to be more precise, it is based on one of a pair of alternative projections prepared by that group &mdash; the forecast that assumes a lower rather than a higher level of emigration.  I should add that the average increase of 15,000 in the labour force, upon which these calculations are based, is higher than that recorded in the labour force survey in 1982-83, the latest year for which data are available and higher than the middle estimate for 1984-87 presented earlier this year in the ESRI study on employment and unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We used the authoritative figures.  We could have tried to justify using lower figures to make the task seem easier by using the latest increase we have for the last year or by going back to the ESRI paper.  We did not do that but took the figures produced by the expert group and used them.  Apart from that point, a second query about the assumptions on which the plan is based appears to be the suggestion that it should have assumed continuance of American interest rates at the present high level indefinitely.  No other country, so far as I am aware, is working on such a remarkably pessimistic assumption and if we were to do so, and to draw from such an assumption the <Col N="2979" /> logical consequences, we would have to make room for the additional interest rate burden by very substantial additional cuts in spending, undertaken on a purely speculative basis, and with obviously most damaging effects both in social terms, and in terms of their deflationary impact on the economy.  I do not think that we are being unduly optimistic in the assumption we have made that there will be some fall in interest rates at a certain stage in the year ahead, but I am content to leave this judgement to those who read the plan.  We at least have been completely open in stating clearly the precise assumptions with regard to the external environment upon which the plan is based, so that each person who reads it can make their own assessment of its realism.</P>
    <P>Another criticism relating to figures on which the plan is based is that which suggests that the public service pay targets are over-optimistic.  I can only say that the Government gave the most careful consideration to this matter and came to the conclusion eventually that the maintenance of public services, of social welfare provisions, of a reasonable level of employment in the public sector &mdash; adequate to service the needs of the community, and our view that the burden of taxation should not be increased; all these combine to require that the public service pay bill be held at the figures set out in this programme.  This is not a question of optimism or pessimism.  We are talking here about a decision that the Government have had to take in the public interest. There could be no real plan that did not set out figures of this kind as part of the framework.</P>
    <P>We believe that unpalatable though this decision must necessarily be to the public service &mdash; and indeed to parliamentarians whose pay is linked to that of public servants &mdash; this decision must and can be upheld and will in fact in the ultimate have the co-operation of the members of the public service, not merely because they enjoy an exceptional degree of security of tenure, together with assurance of pay-related pensions on <Col N="2980" /> their retirement, but even more because through the nature of their work, they are aware, in a way that is not quite as true of the rest of the community, of the compelling need to maintain public services and to hold taxation to its present level.</P>
    <P>This decision of the Government is, of course, crucial to the success of the plan. We shall be most anxious to discuss the details of its application with the unions that represent the public service, with whom I hope and believe we will be able to secure the necessary measure of agreement on this aspect in the public interest. Though, of course, the family income supplement scheme and the later child benefit scheme will cushion the impact of these public service pay provisions on low paid workers with families in the public service, as it will in the private sector, the Government will be anxious also in these discussions with the unions to have particular regard to the interests of these lower paid workers.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the Government's attitude to tax reform and in particular to the proposals of the Commission on Taxation.  This criticism is based on a misconception.  The Government remain committed to moving towards the goal of a simple, equitable and efficient tax system but tax reform is not something that can be accomplished overnight.  The Commission on Taxation have stressed that tax reform must be phased over a period of time to meet the requirements of fairness and practicality. Indeed they seemed to visualise some of their recommendations as requiring a very long period of time to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that the current high level of taxation restricts the degree to which structural tax reform can be considered.  Much of the reform will have to await an easing of the tax burden. Some of the more ambitious proposals of the Commission on Taxation cannot be implemented in the period of the plan. The Commission would not suggest that they should be.  I refer here specifically to the proposed abolition of mortgage interest relief and to the proposed single rate of VAT, including the application of <Col N="2981" /> VAT to food.  It would not, in the view of the Government, in the view of the two parties, be right to impose the severe costs on certain groups which these steps would at the current levels of taxation, involve.  I am not prepared to effect a 15 per cent increase in the price of food in order to bring down other VAT rates to that level, the net effect of which at this time would be strongly repressive and very damaging to the social interests in terms of the effect it would have on the less well off.  Nor am I prepared to add a couple of thousand pounds at a stroke to the tax bill of a young married couple just setting up house.</P>
    <P>The new farm tax represents a major reform in taxation as it applies to an important section of the community.  I am convinced that the approach which the Government have decided on: to apply a tax to the productive value of the land, to exempt smaller farmers from the complexity of income tax and to apply the revenue for local purposes, will provide positive benefits on a broad front.  A number of technical issues of implementation are now receiving expert attention and when the relevant legislation is circulated it will confirm that what the Government are proposing is both workable and ensures that farmers make a fair, and greatly increased, net contribution to the State and local authorities, increased in a way that would not have been practicable if the existing taxation system had been maintained intact, as the Opposition apparently prefer.</P>
    <P>Let me turn from this brief review of some of the points that have been raised with respect to the assumption underlying the plan to a consideration of the need for a plan of this kind, and the reasons why it takes the shape it does.</P>
    <P>The need derives above all from the requirement to reintroduce into the life of this country some element of certainty and security about the future development of public policy, especially in relation to the level of taxation and the pattern of public spending both current and capital.  This need, combined with the need to provide an assurance of political stability in the years ahead, is, I think, <Col N="2982" /> felt quite desperately by very many of our people in every walk of life, whatever their political convictions.  They have been through a most traumatic period &mdash; one without parallel since the war years. During two years of political instability, marked by three changes of Government, their living standards fell on average by 10 per cent and because of the way in which the living standards of the least well-off, those on social welfare, were protected, even improved, during this period, the impact on those at work was on average even greater than these figures would appear.  Moreover, during the three years from 1980 to 1983, broadly contemporaneous with this period of falling living standards, unemployment virtually doubled.</P>
    <P>On top of all this there was a deep uncertainty about the future brought about by the gross disorder in the nation's finances &mdash; knowledge of which, through the political debates occasioned by these elections, became common currency among our people during this difficult period.  They knew that the level of national borrowing had reached astronomical proportions and that each year an increasing proportion of their taxes was being eaten up in interest payments, much of it payable to foreign bankers in respect of debts incurred abroad.</P>
    <P>In this crisis of national morale our people demanded action by their Government that would restore their shattered confidence in the capacity of the political system to serve their needs. Their expectations have not been unduly high.  They have not sought unrealistically an overnight elimination of unemployment or a dramatic recovery in their living standards to those to which they became accustomed by the early eighties. Nor have they demanded, with any real conviction, a substantial immediate drop in the burden of taxation, though that is the ambition of us all.</P>
    <P>What they have required from their Government is a plan that will show that each of these problems is being tackled and that progress, even if necessarily in the early stages somewhat limited progress, is being made with each of them. <Col N="2983" /> And that is what <i>Building on Reality achieves.</i></P>
    <P>It makes no false claims in respect of unemployment.  It does not pretend, as the document <i>Development for Full Employment</i> published on 16 June 1978 pretended &mdash; believe it or not &mdash; to have a &ldquo;programme for ending unemployment within five years&rdquo;.  That was the policy with which Fianna Fáil attempted to fool the people.  The plan proposes instead concrete actions designed to halt the already slowing increase in unemployment, and to reverse it, so that in the later years of the plan unemployment will be falling rather than rising.  The plan could, of course, have raised false hopes by phony figures but it has not done so. Even if this Government had been prepared to indulge in that kind of exercise, which we are not, I am all too conscious of the fact that after the many deceptions of recent years, any claim to be able to reduce unemployment rapidly would, quite properly, not have been believed.</P>
    <P>This plan does not propose to restore by 1987 the level of living standards of three years ago.  Under exceptionally favourable conditions, both externally and domestically, I suppose that this might be possible.  But we have no right to make such assumptions of exceptionally favourable conditions, and a more realistic assessment has suggested that, with due allowance for the continuing, though now slowing increase in population, living standards in 1987 will be 2.5 to 3 per cent higher than they are today.</P>
    <P>We could have held out an inflated hope of a significant reduction in the burden of taxation in this period, though, once again, our people, knowing the level of borrowing to which past extravagances pushed this State and the high burden of interest payments that have to be made each year on this borrowing, would have been unlikely to have believed any claim on our part to have been able to achieve such a significant reduction within the next couple of years.  Instead we have made the realistic commitment to hold the overall burden of taxation at its present level and, within this framework, <Col N="2984" /> to improve the equity of the system.  This may not be a spectacular target but it is a realistic one.  This Government aim to be realistic and have no desire to emulate their predecessors and become a spectacle.</P>
    <P>Again, we could have held to our original ambition of eliminating the current deficit by 1987 &mdash; the objective which we set ourselves on coming into Government. But, realistically, faced with the enormous increase in the burden of interest, even on the reduced amount in real terms now being borrowed by the Exchequer, this could have been accomplished only at the cost of a deflation of the economy which would not only have brought severe hardship, but could, indeed, have initiated a downwards spiral which might have been very difficult to halt.</P>
    <P>Thus under each of these headings our ambitions are palpably modest.  Deputy Flynn is welcome to this point, I make him a present of it, but what he clearly misses is the point that, unlike other documents produced in the late seventies, the very modesty of our proposals means that they carry conviction and have done so already since the plan was produced.  Where people have lost confidence in the kind of claims that have been made by politicians in recent years, they can now find confidence again in these more modest and realistic aspirations, which they can see are capable of being achieved.</P>
    <P>Moreover, they now have a firm and solid basis upon which to plan.  They know, uniquely for the first time since the foundation of the State, the broad shape of the next three budgets.  They know that these will not contain any increase in the burden of taxation, and that such adjustments as will be made will be in the direction of reducing, even if in the first instance only by a small amount, that share of the burden that falls on the PAYE taxpayer.  They know also in which areas Government capital spending will be reduced because of the completion of major programmes, as in the case of telecommunications and power station construction, or will be <Col N="2985" /> held back, and those areas in which it will be pushed ahead rapidly, as in the case of road construction and educational building.  They know the scale of the housing programme that has been decided upon, and can make plans accordingly.</P>
    <P>Moreover, uniquely, they know just how this Government propose to restrain their own current spending in the years ahead &mdash; holding the level of this spending down in such a way that the whole of the increase in national output in these years ahead will be available to boost living standards for a rising population, and to increase investment: not merely public investment in the sectors I have mentioned, but leaving room for additional private investment also.  They know where the Government propose to cut Government spending and the precise effects in respect of each Government Department of the sum of individual decisions that have been taken with respect to current Government spending under the individual heads into which this spending is classified.</P>
    <P>No Government have ever previously imposed such a discipline on themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the consistent pattern of all previous Government programmes that they have failed to impose such a discipline on current spending, and have in each case failed, albeit in varying degrees, to hold down the weight of current expenditure by the public authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of this provides a framework within which both the private sector and the <Col N="2986" /> public sector can plan their entrepreneurial expansion in the years ahead. People now know where they stand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and because they know where they stand, they know how they can move ahead.  This is what a National Plan should do and this for the first time is what an Irish National Plan is doing.</P>
      <P>It has not been easy to achieve this outcome.  I would be less than frank if I did not admit that at certain moments during the past year I have almost despaired of being able to achieve at one and the same time these different targets which we had set ourselves &mdash; an increase in employment that would match and outrun the fall in employment over the last four years; a reversal of the rise in taxa-unemployment; a halt in the rise in taxation; a substantial reduction &mdash; a cut of one-third in the event &mdash; in both the current deficit and borrowing, bringing total public sector borrowing down to a lower level in terms of GNP than at any time in the past decade &mdash; while at the same time as securing these objectives creating the conditions that make possible a revival of investment and a recovery, however modest, in the living standards of our people, which had fallen so spectacularly in recent years.</P>
      <P>To have produced an honest plan, every assumption of which is clearly stated, every figure in which has been objectively verified, every Exchequer financial target in which is backed up by the specific Government decisions necessary to secure their attainment &mdash; to have achieved this from the point at which we started, is something of which I am frankly proud, without having any illusions that it represents more than a start towards the resolution of the problems that have been created by the gross extravagance with which our affairs were run for so many disastrous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an aspect of this plan upon which I want to lay particular stress.  Inevitably it is the economic framework of <Col N="2987" /> the plan that has attracted most attention&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are into Messiah politics now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, from the social viewpoint as from every other viewpoint, it is vital that that economic framework be right, and that it work.</P>
      <P>But economics is but a means to an end, that end being social justice.  If, even in a period of grave economic difficulty, even at a time when a high measure of priority must be given to the restoration of economic growth &mdash; from which alone the resources needed for social progress can come &mdash; we set on one side or show ourselves forgetful of the social needs of our people, we may find that the social stability necessary for the attainment of these objectives is undermined.</P>
      <P>I want to develop further this point about social reform.  No one looking clear-sightedly at our society today could be satisfied that anything approaching social justice exists in this country.  It is certainly true that neither the proportion of people of great wealth, nor the share of total wealth concentrated in the hands of a minority, is as great as many other societies.  It is also true that we have made great strides in recent years in improving the general living standards of families without breadwinners in employment. Nevertheless the extent of under-privilege in our society remains horrifying.</P>
      <P>The fact that the child of a professional person has an opportunity of securing third-level education 450 times greater than the child of an unskilled labourer is one of the most striking examples of the scale of this inequality &mdash; and one which the social reforms in the educational system during the past 15 years or so have unfortunately failed to alter significantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, while a significant proportion of the itinerant population has been settled and housed, there still remains a very large number who are not prosperous traders, but are living in dire poverty under conditions that are incompatible <Col N="2988" /> with any conceivable concept of Christian society.</P>
    <P>The poverty and alienation of many people in parts of centres of our cities has contributed to a scale of crime, violence and drug addiction amongst young people in these areas, many of them young people without apparent hope of ever securing worthwhile employment.</P>
    <P>We cannot rest while these social evils remain to be tackled.  We are either in politics because we are motivated to deal with these social problems, or we should not be in politics at all.  That means that we have to be willing to tackle the inequities in our social system, some at least of which derive from the extent to which we have built up and assiduously protected a system of transfers of resources from &ldquo;haves&rdquo; to other &ldquo;haves&rdquo; or back to the same &ldquo;haves&rdquo;, a system that raises the burden of taxation to a level which impedes effective and adequate transfers to the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>During a period of declining real incomes and living standards amongst the settled community of those with jobs, it is not easy to tackle this problem, or to make major progress with social evils such as those I have mentioned.  What is remarkable perhaps is that during this recent period we have been able, unlike many other European societies, to sustain and improve the living standards of those who depend on social welfare.  I cannot help feeling in retrospect, however, that the diversion of some small proportion of the resources put to this purpose into more selective schemes to aid those who are really at the bottom of the heap, might have been a more worthwhile and fruitful use of some of the money involved.  We have been bad at targeting our aid to those most in need, and have tended to disperse it too widely and unselectively.</P>
    <P>During the period of the national plan, as national output begins to rise again, and as, through the curbing of general State expenditure, resources are released for increased investment and to secure some improvement in living standards generally we must begin to revise and refine our social targets.  We must start to <Col N="2989" /> tackle the problem of social disadvantage more intelligently and more skilfully.  In this manner we can prepare the way for significant shifts in social policy in the years to come, on the basis of the analysis and recommendations being prepared by the Social Welfare Commission, which I am sure will have much to offer us in this field.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the plan itself makes a start, particularly in respect of educational disadvantage.  Even for these three years ahead the plan is by no means the last word.  The Government will be continuing to examine the existing distribution of resources for social purposes within the financial limits which have been set by the plan, with a view to modifying this distribution even within the plan period to 1987.</P>
    <P>At the same time it is my intention that the work which must begin before long on the preparation of a plan for the period after 1987 shall focus explicitly and unambiguously on these social issues, and on improving the selectivity of our system of transfer resources through the tax and social welfare system.  This next plan must of course work towards a reduction in the burden of taxation, together with a further phasing out of the current deficit, but these economic targets cannot and will not be pursued to the exclusion of our social commitment.  That is a message which I wish to deliver unambiguously in this House today.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the danger to our social stability deriving from social injustice. This stability is fragile.  Our society has been destabilised in many ways in recent years &mdash; perhaps one might even say in recent decades.  In the fifties, when, for seven successive years, emigration represented the equivalent of over three-quarters of our annual birth rate, our whole society appeared to be in disintegration. Tens of thousands of our people lost confidence in the viability of our society, and even those who had jobs in many cases left them to seek security for their children in other lands.</P>
    <P>It was out of that threat to the stability of our society that the recovery of the sixties was born.  As an impetus deriving <Col N="2990" /> from the desperation of our circumstances a new spirit was created in our society which gave birth to the economic recovery of the sixties and early seventies.</P>
    <P>But those years carried within them the seeds of later instability.  The Government that, inspired in their first programme by Dr. T. K. Whitaker, led that economic recovery, failed in the years that followed to realise the need to create a new ethos of mutual solidarity that would transcend and withstand the pressures of self-interest, of commitment to material gain, which flourish under conditions of economic growth.</P>
    <P>Together with my commitment to achieving a radical change in then-prevailing political attitudes towards Northern Ireland, it was in fact the recognition of that failure of imagination on the part of the Government of that time, of which Deputy Haughey and Deputy Lenihan were both then members, that led me to take the step of entering politics.  Stimulated by the critique of that increasingly materialistic society that was emanating from so many far-sighted young people with whom I had the advantage of being in close contact at that time, I decided to enter political life and to join with others, like Declan Costello, in trying to substitute for the materialist society then beginning to grow strong as new wealth was being created, the concept of a just society.</P>
    <P>As the years have passed I have been increasingly convinced that my diagnosis of that period was profoundly correct &mdash; that from the mid-sixties onwards there was a desperate need for something like a spiritual revival in our country.  Those of us who shared that vision cannot claim to have been successful in halting the growth in materialism, nor can we claim to have done more than soften some of the asperities of the cruder aspects of the capitalist system that evolved in our State under these hothouse conditions.  But I believe we helped to keep alive the ideal of a society in which social justice would have a major role, and that many young people who might otherwise have succumbed to despair about the future of <Col N="2991" /> our society have been encouraged to maintain that confidence in the possibility of securing social progress, even in the face of the most adverse conditions.</P>
    <P>The problem which I foresaw in the mid-sixties became acute to the point of frenzy in the late seventies when an artificial boom was created on top of the natural recovery which was occurring world-wide after the first oil crisis.  It would be unfair to say that during those years the needs of the disadvantaged in our society were totally ignored.  At least the level of social benefits was maintained or improved, even though little or no thought was given to filling the gaps in the system or introducing humanity into the areas where bureacuracy reigned supreme, much less to seeking consciously to turn the thoughts of our people away from the mere accumulation of wealth and towards the issue of how it should best be distributed in the interests of society as a whole.</P>
    <P>These were years during which an illusion was created that the bubble would never burst &mdash; that the largely phoney rise in living standards, based on a totally unsustainable level of borrowing, could be maintained forever.  Our people were sheltered from the realities of the world outside by borrowing from that world on a scale of unmatched recklessness.</P>
    <P>And when the bubble burst the effect on our society was traumatic.  Material living standards which had been boosted, partly artifically, by no less than one-fifth, suddenly collapsed, leaving behind a wreckage of bankruptcies, of debt-burdened households and, worst of all, of massive unemployment.</P>
    <P>It would be unjust to claim that in the difficult conditions of the world-wide recession of the very early eighties there would not in any event have been here in Ireland as elsewhere a significant rise in unemployment.  But had our resources been husbanded as they should have been during the late seventies; had we set aside prudently some of the increased wealth created in those years instead of spending it, and accumulating on top of that a massive additional burden of debt, we <Col N="2992" /> would have been able to mitigate to a very significant degree the tragedy of that unemployment.  We would have had the resources at our disposal to sustain employment by boosting activity in the construction industry &mdash; instead of finding the ranks of the unemployed being swollen by those who are losing jobs that had artifically been created in that sector during what would, without any such artificial action, have been good years for that industry.</P>
    <P>The risk to the fabric of our society from the pursuit of these policies has been enormous.  A whole generation of young people who were brought up to believe not only that jobs were, and would indefinitely be available for all, but that from the moment of employment they could start trading upwards to larger houses in more attractive suburbs, and buying bigger cars, found themselves suddenly trapped with a mountain of debts like many farmers, and those who came after them, their younger brothers and sisters, found that where jobs had been created regardless of cost for those who went before, there were to be no jobs at all for the greater number of their generation.</P>
    <P>We are now suffering from the aftereffects of this go-stop policy, which have destabilised our society at every level. This policy has brought ruin to many who were wealthy and whose wealth was built upon an illusion.  It has brought hardship to many who were encouraged to live far beyond their means.  And it has brought misery to tens of thousands who have lost their jobs and tens of thousands of others, young men and women completing their education, who find that there are no jobs for them.  And, as a consequence of all this, it has brought a disillusionment about the political system and politicians which has not been confined to the individual politicans who carry specific responsibility for what happened during those terrible years, but has spread to the whole of politics, and has threatened our democracy itself.  The recently published Youth Policy Report has shown that out of a long list of different professions, that of politician is held in lowest esteem by <Col N="2993" /> the young in this country.  That this is so is a disaster &mdash; not just a disaster for those of us engaged in politics, who find ourselves faced with a generation of young people who have lost confidence both in the political system and in those who man it, but a disaster for our society as a whole and one from which it will with difficulty recover.</P>
    <P>It will require the most dedicated leadership from those of us who carry the responsibility of leadership to reverse this tide of discontent and disillusionment. We shall have to engage in a mission to the new generation, during which we shall find ourselves facing a bitterness and hostility which will not easily be turned aside.  We must not flinch from this.  We must, now, at last, take our responsibilities.</P>

      <P>Deputy Calleary sought to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 731 of 10 October 1984.  He has four minutes and the Minister has two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I thank you for the opportunity to avail of this very short time to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 731 and the very poor conditions that exist at Creevagh national school, Carrowmore, Lacken, Ballina, County Mayo.  I should like to set out in chronological order what happened in this school for the past two years.  This is a two-roomed school and it is somewhat significant that this is the second time that this matter has been raised here: the last time was when our present EEC Commissioner was Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>On 26 October 1982 the Office of Public Works inspected the school and on 11 November 1982 the manager wrote to the Department requesting that urgent repairs be carried out.  This letter was acknowledged only on 1 March 1983.  On 11 March 1983 the manager again contacted the local office of the Office of Public Works and they promised to send two reports to the Department, one setting out the necessary repairs to keep the school habitable and the second setting out the major repairs necessary.  Nothing happened for the rest of the year.</P>
      <P>On 20 February 1984 a meeting took place in the school at which public representatives, the management board, teachers and parents attended.  On 21 February 1984 the manager wrote to the Department and informed them of the meeting and of the steps to be taken. That letter was acknowledged on 6 March 1984 and it was stated they were still seeking a report.  In March 1984 a further inspection was carried out by the Office of Public Works and a report was sent at the end of March or at the beginning of April.  In April and May the manager was in touch with the Minister of State who acknowledged his representations.  On 13 June the INTO became involved.  They were in touch with the manager and with the Department setting out what would happen if the necessary repairs were not carried out.</P>
      <P>On 28 June 1984 &mdash; this is the crux of the matter &mdash; the Department wrote to the manager and asked him for his views on amalgamation.  These were sent back on 8 July and I should like to emphasise that date.  On that date the manager replied setting out the views of the parents and emphatically rejecting amalgamation. On 17 July the Department said essential repairs would be carried out to make the school habitable and the Office of Public Works were so advised. On 13 September 1984 a further letter was received asking about amalgamation. On 10 October the manager sent a copy of his previous letter and on that date I had a question down in the House. The answer was that they were still awaiting a reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This school is in a very poor condition. As a matter of urgency the roof needs to be repaired or replaced.  There is rain down and the floors are dangerous.  I ask the Minister to ensure that work is put in <Col N="2999" /> hand immediately to make the school haibtable.  I should also add that the Department informed the INTO on 30 July 1984 that repairs would be carried out as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not very satisfactory to have to reply to a question of this kind in two minutes.  The Deputy raised some points that do not come within the responsibility of my Department.  These questions are in relation to the Office of Public Works and I do not propose to deal with them.</P>
      <P>On 10 October in reply to his question as to when urgently required repairs would be carried out to Creevagh national school, I advised the Deputy that proposals for amalgamation of Creevagh with Carrowmore school in the same parish had been put to the boards of management for their consideration in consultation with the parents and teachers. I went on to say that when the views of the interests concerned had been made known to my Department a decision in the case would be taken as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reply was given to the Deputy in good faith, on the basis that my Department had not heard from the chairman of the school's board of management. Since then, that is since 10 October, I have been shown a letter which was written by the person in question on that date to my Department enclosing a copy of a letter which he stated he had sent to an officer of the Department on 8 July 1984. The original of the letter dated 8 July 1984 has not come to light despite extensive inquiries.  I must conclude that the letter in question went astray, and what I propose at this point is to deal with the problems which must be addressed <Col N="3000" /> arising from the request that major repair works be carried out at the school.</P>
    <P>Creevagh national school is a two-teacher school of low enrolment.  It was built in 1895.  Its replacement was initially recommended by the Commissioners of Public Works as long ago as 1958.  Carrowmore national school is four miles distant.  The amalgamation of the two schools was first proposed in 1966.  The majority of the parents of pupils at that time were in agreement with the proposal but the then school manager insisted that a permanent room rather than a prefab be built at Carrowmore to accommodate the Creevagh pupils before he would agree to proceeding with the amalgamation. Subsequent attempts to amalgamate the two schools came to nothing. In 1978, following a further unsuccessful attempt at amalgamation, the then Minister approved a grant for essential repairs and I understand these repairs were carried out.</P>
    <P>Arising out of a letter from the chairman of 21 February 1984 my Department asked the Commissioners of Public Works to furnish a report and recommendations on the matters in relation to the school building raised by the chairman. Having regard to the possibility of future amalgamation the Commissioners were requested to detail the minimum essential improvements required to keep the school in a habitable condition and the chairman was so informed on 17 July 1984.</P>
    <P>I have now seen the report furnished by the Commissioners of Public Works in this matter and they are adamant that there are not any minor works which could be carried out to this building which would result in the provision of suitable accommodation for pupils.  Their report states that it would cost £46,000 to bring the condition of the building up to a satisfactory standard.  It would simply be out of the question to consider expenditure of this magnitude on a school which was built in 1895 and where the current level of accommodation could, I am advised, be provided from the new one at lesser cost.  Apart from any consideration of the propriety of spending <Col N="3001" /> public funds on such a project, the necessary local contribution to works of this magnitude would be a heavy imposition on the local community.  Moreover to facilitate the carrying out of such works the school would have to be vacated.</P>
    <P>In this situation the possibility of amalgamation has to be considered and this was an option put to the chairman in the Department's letter of 28 June 1984. While it is now apparent that the proposal to amalgamate with Carrowmore has been rejected by the local community I am not satisfied that they have arrived at <Col N="3002" /> this decision in full knowledge of the facts of the situation.</P>
    <P>I would wish to assure the Deputy that the question of the accommodation at Creevagh is receiving urgent attention in my Department and that the matter will be further discussed with the chairman as soon as he is available with a view to securing a suitable solution to the immediate as well as the long term problems of national school provision.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.33 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 23 October 1984.</P>

    <P>The total numbers of grants shown include grants paid under the current and former schemes of improvement grants and solid fuel grants and under the disabled persons and essential repair grant schemes administered by the local authorities.  The total value of grants shown includes the amounts paid by the Department by way of statutory recoupment to local authorities of part of the <Col N="2932" /> cost of disabled persons and essential repair grants.</P>
    <P>Applications under the former schemes referred to were not accepted after 1 February 1980 but payments continued to be made under these schemes provided the relevant works were completed and claims submitted by 30 June 1981.  The current scheme of improvement grants was introduced in October 1981 and expanded in April 1982 to cover major necessary repairs to the basic fabric of dwellings.</P>
    <P>The number and value of grants paid in particular years is not necessarily indicative of the volume of administration arising in those years.  In 1981, for example, substantial work arose from the final processing for payment of the very large number of grant applications received immediately prior to the final date for the acceptance of applications under the former schemes.  On the other hand the bulk of the work in 1982 and 1983 related to the processing of applications received in these years under the current scheme; many of these applications had not matured for payment by the end of 1983.</P>
    <P>The total cost of administration is not available in my Department on the basis requested by the Deputy.  The following figures represent the estimated costs of departmental administration (including the costs of travelling expenses, accommodation, telephones etc.) of the schemes of improvement grants: 1981, £915,000; 1982, £857,000; 1983, £937,000.</P>

      <P>Under the Road Transport Act, 1932, any suitably qualified person may apply to the Minister for Communications for a licence authorising him to <Col N="2934" /> carry on a specified road passenger service. The Minister in considering the grant or refusal of an application for such a licence is required to have regard to, <i>inter alia,</i> whether the proposed service is required in the public interest taking account of the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service.</P>
      <P>No application has been received in my Department from a bus operator for the operation of a bus service in the limited area in Finglas affected by the curtailment of CIE services.  Any such application would be considered on its merits. In that connection, there would be a need to bear in mind that CIE, the existing operator, is prevented from providing full normal services in the area because of causes outside the Board's control.</P>
      <P>Apart from the fact that the operation of any type of taxi service must comply with the provisions of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1963-1983, made by the Minister for the Environment, a taxi service involving the charging of separate fares would appear to constitute a road passenger service within the meaning of the Road Transport Act, 1932, and would accordingly be subject to the licensing requirements which apply to buses operating road passenger services.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there have been numerous efforts to solve the difficulties which gave rise to the curtailment of services in the Finglas area and I hope that solutions will be found in the near future.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer ceased employment on 9 September 1983, and, according to official records, has not been re-employed since then.  Following a review of his tax liability for 1982-83, all the tax deducted from his earnings for that year has been refunded to him.  Similarly, the total income tax deducted in respect of the year 1983-84 has been repaid to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>On further examination of this case, it has emerged that the taxpayer's last employer, possibly because of an oversight on the part of the taxpayer in providing the necessary documentation, did not include on Form P.60 details of pay, tax and PRSI contributions for the year 1982-83 in relation to a previous employment. The inspector of taxes is now communicating with the employer with a view to rectifying the position.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is at present in receipt of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £17.50 based on a means assessment of £14.25 weekly as a single man.  It came to light recently that he was married and arrangements have been made with his local office for the reauthorisation of his claim at the married rate.  He will, therefore, be entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £40.55.  Arrears due will be paid next week.  His case has been referred to the social welfare officer for a review of his means.  When inquiries are completed, the assessment of his means will be reviewed and the rate of unemployment assistance payable to him will be determined accordingly.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed for the statutory period of six weeks from 13 September 1984 as she failed to attend for examination by a medical referee of the Department on 4 September 1984. Her explanation for failure to attend for examination has now been accepted and payment of benefit has been restored from 13 September 1984.  All disability benefit payable to 10 October 1984, the date of the latest medical certificate received, has been issued to her.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid an increase in the weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable to him in respect of a housekeeper during the period 17 September 1979 to 21 June 1983.  It was subsequently ascertained that he did not fulfil the conditions for such an increase and an overpayment was assessed against him.</P>
      <P>Recovery of this overpayment is being effected by deductions from his current payment of unemployment assistance with effect from week ending 4 September 1984.  He is currently in receipt of £35.35 unemployment assistance weekly being the maximum rate of £40.35 applicable to a man with one dependent child less deductions of £5 weekly towards recovery of the overpayment.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be fully available for work and must be genuinely seeking work.  When the person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 3 September 1984 she stated the she was avail-bourhoo <Col N="2945" /> able for part-time work only, and consequently her claim was disallowed.  She appealed on 28 September 1984 against the disallowance and arrangements are being made to have her case determined by an appeals officer at the earliest opportunity.

      <P>The person concened was assessed with means at £7.70 weekly derived from the value of board and lodging in his parents' home.  He was dissatisfied with the amount of means assessed against him and he appealed his case but an appeals officer also assessed him with means at £7.70 weekly.  He is at present in receipt of unemployment assistance at £24.05 being the appropriate rate £31.75 less means £7.70.  If however he considers that his circumstances have changed since his means were assessed by an appeals officer on 26 March 1984 it is open to him to apply to have his case reinvestigated.

      <P>Inquiries were necessary to establish whether the person concerned satisfied the contribution conditions for entitlement to unemployment benefit and in particular the condition which requires at least 26 contribution weeks paid or credited in the previous contribution year.  These inquiries established that he was entitled to credited contributions in that year which qualified him for benefit at the weekly rate of £34.80 increasing to £37.25 weekly from 5 July 1984.  All arrears due were paid to him <Col N="2946" /> during week ending 1 August 1984 and further payment was made up to 10 August 1984 after which he ceased to sign as unemployed.</P>

      <P>The person concerned appealed against the amount of means assessed against him which resulted in the disallowance of his unemployment assistance claim.  Arising out of contentions made by him in support of his appeal it was necessary to refer the case to a social welfare officer for further inquiries. These inquiries were extensive and were not completed until the end of June 1984 when the case was referred to an appeals officer for determination.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2948" /> The appeals officer required further information and it was necessary to refer the case back to a social welfare officer for additional inquiries.

      <P>The person concerned applied for a free telephone rental allowance on 28 August 1984.  He is in receipt of an invalidity pension from the Department and is permanently incapacitated.  His wife, however, is not, from the information furnished, a permanently incapacitated person as required by the scheme and he cannot therefore qualify for the allowance. His wife could however qualify for the allowance provided she is in receipt of a qualifying payment.  She was therefore requested on 12 September 1984 to furnish details of any pension she might have.  When this information is furnished, a decision will be given in the case and the applicant will be notified of the outcome.</P>

Following consideration of the matter the appeals officer reduced the assessment of means, which are derived from the profit from his holding, from £63.40 weekly to £48 weekly.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The Garda authorities report that the current full-time strength of the Crime Prevention Advisory Service is 24, comprising a detective inspector and four sergeants based at Harcourt Square who serve the Dublin Metropolitan Area, two sergeants in the Cork East Division and one sergeant in each of the other 17 Garda Divisions.  In addition, there is an administrative unit at Garda Headquarters with overall responsibility for this as well as some other services.</P>
      <P>The cost of specialised services of this kind is met from the overall financial allocation in the Garda Síochána Vote and the question of specially earmarking funds for this or other services does not arise.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that, while the Garda Crime Prevention Advisory Service is an important arm of the Garda Síochána in the prevention of crime, it would be misleading to mention that service without reference to the fact that all members of the Garda Síochána have a responsibility in the prevention of crime as part of their ordinary Garda duties and that the Garda authorities are anxious that all members of the force should promote public interest in crime prevention.</P>
