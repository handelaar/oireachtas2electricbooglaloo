      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if it is intended to avail of any opportunity today, or tomorrow, to inform the House of the arrangements which have been made in respect of the Whiddy oil terminal.  I am sure the Chair will agree that this is a matter of pretty far-reaching importance and implication. As the matter has been mentioned in the daily press and on the radio it is only proper that the House should be given information about it at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Chair wait until he hears what I am about to propose? I should like to suggest to the Government Chief Whip that at least one hour of that time be devoted to a Committee Stage discussion on the Bill.  I presume that that is not only relevant but essential.  The time is totally inadequate but, nonetheless, we need at least one hour for a Committee Stage discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A Bill, the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1984, which has just been circulated has <Col N="2316" /> a number of unusual features.  It will take some time to debate the Bill, and, indeed, it may require some significant amendments.  I should like to know when it is intended to take the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it that an explanatory memorandum was not circulated with the Bill or is it intended to provide one later?  This Bill has a number of unusual features and an explanatory memorandum would be very helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Unusual things are happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of judgment whether a Bill requires an explanatory memorandum, but it does not appear to be so in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying there will not be an explanatory memorandum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there is not one, and it is a matter of judgment whether there should be one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach if he will provide one because of the unusual features in the Bill which will require detailed explanations.  Is the Taoiseach trying to conceal something in the Bill?  Is that why there is no explanatory memorandum?  This is a substantial Bill with very wide-ranging powers being given to the Minister and the Government and in my view it would require an explanatory memorandum.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make an appeal to Members?  We have just agreed on a very heavy day's Order of Business and provided a limited time for disposal of that business.  I would ask Deputies not to erode the time available by raising numerous matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Sir, I asked a very relevant and simple question and asked for a simple answer.  It appears the <Col N="2317" /> Taoiseach is not prepared to provide an explanatory memorandum.  If that is so, let it be seen to be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the period for reporting back of the Joint Committee on Building Land be extended to 30 June, 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the information of the House, may I make a short statement?  The Joint Committee have before them the draft final report for consideration and adoption. Since their establishment in March 1983 <Col N="2324" /> the present committee held 28 meetings and since January 1984, 21 meetings.  The committee's normal practice has been to meet one day each week.  The work of the committee has been held up because of the delay in making available the Attorney General's legal opinion on the constitutional effects of the McKinney Report.  There was a delay of up to six months before the committee received a legal opinion on those proposals.  The committee were empowered in March 1984 to engage specialist advisers to help in their assessment and examination of the material and submissions before them and in the preparation of the committee's final report.  The committee commenced consideration of the first draft of their final report at a meeting on 5 July 1984 and the second draft of the final report is currently under study by the committee.</P>
    <P>Given the complexity of the matters referred to the committee for consideration, the committee have not found it possible to proceed with their deliberations at a rate which would enable them to make a final report before the date appointed by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  The committee are anxious to submit a comprehensive and fully considered final report and they, therefore, request Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann to extend the date by which they are required to report to 30 June 1985.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to enable me as Minister for Finance to ensure the continued efficient operation of State financial transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures in it are such as would be reasonable to cater for any temporary disruption or threat of disruption of the public finances.  This need not necessarily be due to a strike but could be due to <Col N="2325" /> any other factor e.g., breakdown in a computer facility.  It is therefore, desirable in the widest sense that this Bill be passed.</P>
    <P>I propose now to refer to the provisions contained in the Bill.  First, I wish to draw the attention of the House to two minor errors in the Bill as circulated.  In Section 1 on line 22 of page 2, the word &ldquo;Exchequer&rdquo; is misspelt and in Subsection 2 (2) (c) on line 49 of page 3 the word &ldquo;reference&rdquo; should be in the plural and the comma after the word should be omitted.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains some necessary definitions.  Provisions for commencement and termination are contained in section 2 (1).  I would point especially to the provisions in section 2.1 (a) that before making any arrangements under the Act, the Minister for Finance will be required to be satisfied that due to special circumstances it is impossible to carry on business in the normal manner and may accordingly, in the national interest, make whatever special arrangements are deemed necessary.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Finance I am responsible under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, for:</P>
    <P>The administration and business generally of the public finance of Ireland and all powers, duties and functions connected with same, including in particular the collection and expenditure of the revenues of Ireland...</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that it is the Minister for Finance alone who is responsible for the State's financial business. Many of the functions carried out by the Central Bank on a day-to-day basis are delegated to it for reasons of convenience.</P>
    <P>The collection of the State's revenues and payments of the State's expenses are, rightly, the subject of careful statutory restriction.  Article 11 of the Constitution provides for payment of all the revenues of the State into a single fund, known as the Central Fund, and payments into and issues from that fund are regulated by law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2326" /> Section 2 of the Bill provides, if necessary, for the introduction of special revised arrangements for operating the Exchequer and State accounts and for carrying out certain State financial transactions, and it is the purpose of the first important part of the Bill (section 2 (2)) to provide statutory support for these arrangements.</P>
    <P>A statute which is particularly relevant in this regard is the 1866 Exchequer and Audit Departments Act.  This old statute is still the basic Act governing much of the State's accounting practices.  It sets out strict controls in relation to the lodgment of revenues to and the issue of moneys from the Exchequer Account involving the Comptroller and Auditor General in his capacity as Comptroller of the Exchequer.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has been fully consulted by my Department in relation to the preparation of this legislation and that office agrees with the need for the proposed legislation.  The Bill provides for my Department to consult with the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to any arrangements made and it will be the intention of my Department to provide arrangements which satisfy him.  The arrangements made will, of course, be subject to review by the Comptroller in the normal course.</P>
    <P>The second important part of the Bill (section 2(3)) empowers me to postpone by order the redemption of, or the payment of interest or dividends on, Government domestic securities where I am satisfied that it is not possible to make such payments.  During the Central Bank strike it will not be possible to make dividend payments on domestic Government stocks or land bonds listed on the Irish Stock Exchange issued before the commencement of the strike on 3 December 1984; or to redeem domestic securities falling due for redemption during the period of the strike, where the registers of such issues are held by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the procedure for arranging for the redemption of, or payment of interest or dividends on, securities postponed under section 2 (3) when <Col N="2327" /> the situation returns to normal.  A new date for the redemption or payment of interest or dividend may be fixed by me and this new date must be within three months of the end of the strike or whatever special circumstances required the postponement.  The section also provides that interest will be payable on payments which were postponed and the order will specify the actual rate.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the laying of orders made under the Bill before each House of the Oireachtas and section 5 is the normal provision for administrative expenses.</P>
    <P>To sum up, this Bill is necessary to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Enable the Minister for Finance to fulfil his statutory responsibility for the administration and business generally of the public finances; to ensure that he has adequate statutory support for such temporary measures as are needed to maintain operations on the Exchequer and other related accounts; to provide for payment of interest to persons who may be deprived of interest or dividends or repayment of capital owing to the temporary inability of the Minister for Finace to ensure payments.</P>
    <P>Failure to take the proposed measures would cause very substantial disruption to the state's financial business and very considerable inconvenience &mdash; and hardship in many cases &mdash; to ordinary citizens.  Even with the measures in place there could still be considerable inconvenience.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House as a realistic and sensible measure to ensure the continued smooth operation of the State's banking and financial business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an unprecedented Bill introduced in an unprecedented way to the House.  It is indicated on the back cover of the Bill that it was presented by the Minister for Finance on 7 December 1984.  That is a totally and utterly false statement on the cover of the Bill.  The Bill was first brought to the attention of the Opposition in proof &mdash;<Col N="2328" /> not final &mdash; form on 10 December 1984 after I had returned from some very important consultations in which my party were engaging with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  A proof form of the Bill was on my desk at six o'clock in the evening requesting a full debate on all stages yesterday, 11 December.</P>
      <P>No copy of this Bill was available to anybody inside or outside the House until 11 December.  Significantly also, no explanatory memorandum was available on what everyone acknowledges to be a highly technical and complex Bill and it is not yet available to any Member of the House.  To say that the Bill was presented by the Minister for Finance on 7 December 1984 is a serious mis-statement and is not in accordance with the facts.  It was not presented to the House until four days later and even then on the basis that we would have to deal with all stages in three and a half or four hours today, 12 December.</P>
      <P>I agree with the reservations expressed by Deputy Mac Giolla and we would oppose this kind of action if there was any other option open to us.  However, because of the Government's failure to deal with this matter in a proper, reasoned way, this House is now obliged to deal with unprecendented legislation in a hasty, rushed and totally unsatisfactory way without Members having any opportunity of considering the consequences of what we are obliged to pass here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite extraordinary that in this term there has been little or no legislation in the normal course of Government business, but there is this exception. Many examples of emergency legislation of one form or another have been introduced in this rushed, hasty fashion, some of which had later to be withdrawn.  Let me give the House some examples.  There was the Copyright Bill, introduced because it was needed urgently to cover some loopholes in the law but withdrawn subsequently because it had not been properly prepared or presented.  There was the Air Transport Bill introduced becase of emergency requirements to <Col N="2329" /> protect certain positions of Aer Lingus, but subsequently withdrawn because, obviously, it had not been given due consideration. We hardly need to mention the legislation required to liquidate Irish Shipping, the time given to it in this House and the unsatisfactory manner in which we were again forced to attempt &mdash; and it was hardly even an attempt &mdash; to discharge our role as legislators in relation to legislation of that importance rushed in without any background explanation or detailed information being given to this House.</P>
    <P>Quite consistent with that we have today this Bill which the Minister may say was necessary to enable him to fulfil his statutory responsibilities.  It can have far reaching consequences that may even now undermine the role of the Central Bank in relation to control of credit, our exchange control and our role, in particular, with the EMS.  Whatever caused the necessity for this legislation should not have been allowed to happen.  It is not my purpose to go into the question of the industrial relations dispute at the Central Bank.  My colleague, Deputy Ahern, will go into that matter in greater detail. However, if as a consequence of Government directive, persuasion, influence, or pressure, the actual staff negotiations on pay and conditions of service in the Central Bank are being brought within the restrictive approach to the public service, then the Government are responsible for our having this emergency legislation brought in now.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister assure this House that he or the Government have not in any way attempted to influence the Central Bank, which incidentally under the 1927 Currency Act is authorised, and obliged under section 31 (3), to conduct its own negotiations in respect of salaries and remuneration?  That Act says:</P>
    <P>There shall be paid to the Secretary and the other officers and servants of the Commission&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is the equivalent of our Central Bank.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2330" /> such salaries and remuneration as the Commission may determine.</P>
    <P>Clearly, we must be assured that in approaching the need to vindicate the role of the Central Bank and its independent function &mdash; and it has independent functions which the Minister will recognise are enshrined in a statute, very important functions which Ministers for Finance time after time have pointed out &mdash; that bank would not be obliged to contravene the terms of the Currency Act of 1927 which says that those matters shall be determined by the Commission. We must be assured that the Central Bank were not in any way influenced, persuaded or directed by Government to apply the norms of the public sector pay negotiations within the public service.  If that is what is happening there will be farreaching consequences of that directive.</P>
    <P>This Bill will enable the Minister not just to ensure payment into and out of the Exchequer account, because obviously we all recognise that that must be done.  We cannot see the whole machinery of State revenue and expendure in that sense being undermined. However, it goes much further than that and this is what the Minister has not said. This Bill will enable him to delegate the vitally important exchange control function of the Central Bank to a commercial, profit-making bank.  One does not have to raise the question of the good faith or <i>malafides</i> of any bank, but it is quite clear that that function in terms of exchange control where large amounts of funds being transferred into and out of the country are subject to these exchange controls, for very obvious reasons resides with the Central Bank and not with any commercial bank.</P>
    <P>This function resides very obviously with the Central Bank because commercial banks are in the nature of things in competition one with the other.  One or other of the commercial banks will now be given that delegated function for as long as this Bill remains in force.  There we are certainly moving away from what was always intended under the Central Bank legislation and even going back as <Col N="2331" /> far as the legislation to which the Minister referred &mdash; the Exchequer and Audit Department Act of 1866.  There are very good reasons for this independence and for the Central Bank's fulfilling its function within fiscal monetary control and being the only body to have that authority. The Government should have done everything possible to head off a situation in which that essential function of the Central Bank is now being necessarily transferred to a commercial bank.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This I do know, if the Deputy wants to have my opinion and I have said this many times before.  This Government took this tunnel view and narrow actions in respect of, for example, their borrowing programme.  They took <Col N="2332" /> a decision that they were going to adhere to certain rigid limits in terms of domestic and foreign borrowing and did not even seem to have the capacity to see how that would distort our whole internal money market and give rise, automatically, to interest rate increases.</P>
      <P>This is another example, in my view, of the same risk.  They bring in this emergency legislation four days after they said it was published and we, the legislators, will get only three-and-a-half hours to deal with it and do our job as legislators to ensure that it is all done according to law.  They have not thought out what options there might have been to ensure that this legislation, with its consequences, would not have been necessary. Someone might say that before the Central Bank legislation in 1970 the Bank of Ireland had this kind of role in any event, the 1970 legislation stating that the power resides with the Central Bank; but at that point we did not have the exchange control and certainly did not have the sole responsibility of the Central Bank in retaining the position of the pound within the EMS.  The primary function of the Central Bank in that instance &mdash; this cannot be discharged by any commercial body &mdash; is to maintain the value and exchange rate of the IR£ within the system.  This involves the preservation of the position of our currency relevant to the EMS constituents.  This is an essential function of the Central Bank since we joined the EMS system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major foreign currency dealings are conducted through the Central Bank as are Government dealings in the foreign exchange business.  The transfer of these accounts to other institutions seriously undermines the process of maintaining the currency to the extent that we do not even have an official quotation for our currency from the Central Bank.  That is an immediate consequence of this industrial dispute but it is also a consequence of the fact that action was not taken much earlier to head off a dispute of this nature and ensure that the provisions of the Currency Act, 1927 which require that these matters be determined by the Central Bank were complied with.  We have no <Col N="2333" /> official quotation as to the exchange rate of our currency within the EMS.  For those who wish to buy other currencies it is a question of taking a leap in the dark. I am sure the banks will work on some kind of a guide.  However, it is an essential function of the Central Bank to provide such a quotation and this Bill cannot deal with that.  Everyone will recognise that this is, to say the least of it, a very sorry state to be in.</P>
    <P>In the course of his short statement the Minister did not deal with any of these implications.  The Minister for Finance has a statutory function in relation to the management of our finances.  I thought he would have pointed out some of the difficulties that will inevitably arise.  As regards the management of our official external reserves, the transfers of these accounts under the proposed legislation will impede the management of these reserves because the monitoring of Government foreign exchange dealings will be extremely difficult.  The Government's foreign exchange dealings have been transferred from the Central Bank to a commercial institution.  The lack of experienced personnel in the Central Bank as a consequence of this strike means that the investment of the official external reserves is not being correctly managed.  That is a matter which the Minister for Finance with his statutory role and responsibility must be concerned about.  It could mean that the bank are losing vast sums of money every day on their investments.  The Minister said nothing about this.</P>
    <P>The Bill was introduced just as if it was a question of arranging to have the Exchequer account managed so that we could make payments into it and get money out of it but the Minister said nothing about the fundamental role of the Central Bank in the areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>As a result of this strike, no credit information or monetary information is being compiled.  That is a matter which will have serious consequences.  This means that the Central Bank are no longer able to monitor credit data at a time of high seasonal demand which this <Col N="2334" /> year has been accelerated by the inordinate demand by the Government for money from the domestic money markets. No one is monitoring the control of the credit demand at this time of high seasonal demand and when we have the all-embracing, consuming appetite of the Government on the domestic market.</P>
    <P>In relation to the dividend payments on existing Government stocks this legislation &mdash; the Minister says necessarily &mdash; invalidates the contract which the Minister for Finance entered into with ordinary citizens.  The Minister may say it has to be that way but that is what it does. Over 200,000 investors who supported Government fund raising projects in the past have already suffered considerable loss through the rise in interest rates.  Now the deferment of redemption payments will seriously undermine public confidence in Government stock investments. We cannot accept, as is suggested in section 3, that at any time when this strike is over &mdash; the Minister had an interesting reply to make to Deputy Connolly yesterday which seems further to confirm the purpose of the section &mdash; the Minister will then determine the rate of dividend payments and interest on these dividends in respect of the period during which the strike took place.  In the reply the Minister gave to Deputy Connolly he said that on the cessation of the strike, arrangements would be made for the payment of those interest or dividend amounts which have necessarily been postponed. He said payments would also be made on amounts due in respect of securities. Then he said that in all such cases interest at a rate to be determined would be payable on the amounts in question in respect of the period of the postponement at a rate to be determined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>At a rate to be determined by whom?  From this legislation it appears to be by the Minister.  Surely it would have been reasonable for the rate to be determined by the Central Bank. They should be the arbiters of what should be the appropriate rate not just to <Col N="2335" /> compensate but, in equity, to make up to those who have been deprived of their dividends, payments and entitlements under contract.  It is being left on the basis that it will be determined by the Minister.</P>
      <P>We have a very limited time to discuss this Bill and I know my colleagues wish to contribute.  We will insist, however, that a time limit be put on this proposal. The Minister may say that it is not possible or that he is not prepared to do it. We will be putting down an amendment, which we hope the Minister will accept, which will ensure that the interest rates to be paid at the termination of the strike will be determined objectively &mdash; not just by the Minister as he might determine &mdash; having regard to the rates which have been applicable during the period.  Our view is that it is the Central Bank alone whose function is being undermined in this legislation, not deliberately perhaps, nevertheless as a consequence.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of great regret to all of us that we must have legislation of this kind coming in as it has come in.  I am sure it is a matter of concern for the Minister.  The Central Bank has fulfilled a very important role.  Their staff are expert in areas where only they have been dealing.  Their whole grading structure indicates that they are not in any way in line with public sector grades.  There are grades and responsibilities in the Central Bank which do not exist anywhere in the public service and <i>vice versa</i>.  Their functions as bankers to the Government and to the banks, as lenders of last resort and regulators of the money market, the Minister will recognise at least as much as I do, are essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that this kind of emergency legislation must be brought in here just to protect, apparently, the income and outflow from the Exchequer account.  It is doing much more than that.  What is here now as enabling legislation could be on the Statute Book forever and could be implemented by order whenever.  I hope that that will not be the case and that we will put a time limit on this which will make it appropriate to the need of <Col N="2336" /> the occasion.  Secondly, I hope that we will deal with the other matter I have suggested in terms of the contractual obligation to Government stockholders.</P>

      <P>I want to begin a fairly short speech by saying that what I have just heard from Deputy O'Kennedy is of a piece with the financial advice which he has been giving the electorate over the last several months.  He is not alone in that.  The rest of his party, so far as they are competent to do so, have been joining him.  It is all criticism but no suggestion as to how the thing might otherwise have been done.  I do not single out Deputy O'Kennedy in any way.  Perhaps he is not by any means the worst.  He just happens to have spoken this morning, and he spoke recently on another financial matter.  Only a week ago I heard him say in regard to the rise in the bank rate that it was all the fault of the Government because the Government had borrowed too heavily, in the domestic market, thus, since money is a commodity when it is short the price of it &mdash; which is interest &mdash; goes up, thus leaving too little for the private borrower, thus pushing up interest rates.  I have not heard that anybody took Deputy O'Kennedy through his point of view and put these matters to him, but the insinuation there was that the matter of domestic borrowing was entirely black and white, that to have borrowed domestically instead of abroad was something in favour of which nothing could be said or so little by comparison with foreign borrowing that it did not deserve discussion.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy was Minister for Finance for a period and he knows perfectly well the difference between domestic borrowing and foreign borrowing. Either course has disadvantages, but foreign borrowing has colossal disadvantages. The foreign borrowing indulged in by Government over the last decade has been responsible largely for leaving us in the condition out of which this Government are trying gamely to fight their way.</P>

      <P>If the sense of Deputy Connolly's interjection is that the Minister should be left here like one of the figures in a fairground barrel 50 years ago as described in <i>Fiche Bliain ag Fás</i> at whom people on the far side are entitled to throw blocks, without anyone throwing any back, that is not what I consider debate to be all about.  I will not speak for more than ten minutes, but I want to say that nothing that Deputy O'Kennedy has produced here contains a tittle of a suggestion as to what else the Minister might well do.  It is a Second Stage debate so far, and possibly we will hear from the Deputy or his advisers on Committee Stage, but the Second Stage contribution <Col N="2338" /> coming from that financial spokesman, that alternative Minister for Finance, that shadow chancellor of the Irish Exchequer, reveals not a single idea in his head about how this crisis, this emergency, is to be confronted.  He insinuated that the Government are at fault somehow in not having &ldquo;headed off&rdquo; the industrial dispute which closed the Central Bank. He refused to give an opinion about the industrial dispute itself, because the industrial world for Fianna Fáil is becomming analogous to <i>sub judice</i>.  It is <i>sub</i> industrial dispute, so we must not say &ldquo;Boo&rdquo; to either side, no matter how strong one's opinions may be.  His insinuation was that the Government were in the wrong.  I asked him to say where the Government were in the wrong on the dispute, and he ducked that with all the eel-like skill which 25 years' membership of the Fianna Fáil Party would make second nature to him.  Nonetheless, he was willing to lambast the Minister for having brought this situation to pass.</P>
      <P>It is not just Deputy O'Kennedy I complain about; this is true in regard to all of the Opposition, and people on this side can be guilty of it also when we are over there.  He had not it in him even to say that the Minister is not to blame for the emergency which the State financial apparatus is now facing, and that if he can help the Minister to put it right by making constructive suggestions then he will make them.  The Fianna Fáil Party are not short of tycoons, bankers, people who know what big money is all about. That is why they are in and supporting Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no shortage there of people, who deal in strings of noughts as long as your arm, to advise Deputy O'Kennedy about what might have been an alternative way of facing up to this crisis.  That the notice was short I accept, and also that Deputy O'Kennedy had this Bill before him for less than 48 hours. That may be so, but 48 hours is time <Col N="2339" /> enough to get advice from the kind of people who are available on matters such as this, and Deputy Connolly, Deputy Ahern and Deputy Brennan know that. They are doubly available to a party such as Fianna Fáil, who go out of their way to conciliate those sectors by promising them anything which their own shortsightedness does not lead them to see is going to plunge the country deeper into hardship five years further on if they are given the chance to put it into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every reason given by Deputy O'Kennedy why the Central Bank should be left with its functions unimpaired and why this legislation should not pass seems equally strongly to argue for a proposition which he never approached within an ass's roar of.  That is: that certain public functions vital to the people should be outside strike freedom altogether.  Hundreds of thousands of people in the country who vote for all parties know that in certain vital functions the ordinary freedom to strike should be suspended by contract or agreement or as a point of honour.  In saying that I am making no comment on this dispute or on either side in it.  I must admit that I am only dimly instructed about it.  However, every reason given by Deputy O'Kennedy for the necessity to leave functions with a bank which has effectively closed its doors is the reason why that strike should not have taken place.  A similar thing could be said about a very large range of other disputes which bring other closures in other parts of the public sector which are injurious, not to capitalists or to the system &mdash; as I am sure Deputy Mac Giolla will tell us &mdash; but injurious to the public of which he and those who vote for him are members also.  I should like to know what Deputy O'Kennedy thinks the Minister might have done.  I am not an expert on public finances, so I cannot say whether the mechanism he has chosen represents the one best calculated to serve the object which it is his statutory duty to support.  I will not judge that; but not a word I have heard from the <Col N="2340" /> Opposition spokesman, or shadow chancellor, enables me to judge that mechanism any better than I could have done half an hour ago.</P>
    <P>Do the Deputies on the other side imagine that it would be possible to leave the State in the same condition during the Central Bank strike as they left it during repeated strikes of the commercial banks?  I recall the late Deputy Colley when he was Minister for Finance, in the fifth month of a national bank strike, having no ideas about what might be done if the banks never reopened.  There was no hint from the then Government that an effort would be made to adapt the Post Office system into a rudimentary banking substitute, or of trying to start what I am sure Deputy Mac Giolla would have supported &mdash; a State banking system, which would have been wound up as soon as the commercial banks came back into operation.  The result was that, in the late Deputy Colley's picturesque phrase, people &ldquo;wrote their own credit,&rdquo; kept issuing bits of paper which were dishonoured when the banks reopened. That had the effect of ruining many people.  On three occasions in the past 12 years the public have had to endure bank strikes, one of which was extremely prolonged and which caused enormous hardship.  But there was no suggestion from the Government of the day as to what might have been done to break that strike, if I may use that ugly phrase.</P>
    <P>I do not have anything against people who in the normal course of industrial relations assert their rights; but we must remember that the public come first. Their interests are more important than Fianna Fáil.  They are more important than Fine Gael.  The interests of the public are more important, too, than any union or any number of unions.  Every trade union member himself depends on a huge range of public services, just as those of us who are not union members depend on those services.</P>
    <P>I am not qualified to comment on the strike in question but this whole area is one that politicians have fought shy of for far too long.  I have read about a time when Fianna Fáil had far more guts than <Col N="2341" /> they have now.  If one were to shake them today one would hear a farthing rattle around their insides, they are so devoid of guts.</P>
    <P>In 1941 the late Mr. De Valera and the late Mr. Seán McEntee were not afraid to introduce a Bill limiting the number of unions to one per trade.  That was a regulation of the right of association but the Supreme Court ruled &mdash; wrongly, in my opinion &mdash; that it was a denial of the right of free association.  That was in 1945, and we have not heard anything about legislation of that kind since.  It was an effort by the Government of the day to save the country's industrial structure from the disruption which the proliferation of unions was causing even then, and which now has gone beyond all limits, as anyone who is not afraid to say booh will recognise.</P>
    <P>Naturally, we will not hear anything in this regard from the Opposition, because they are putting their weight behind the ICTU in the hope of luring disillusioned Labour voters.  If I have the opportunity during the Adjournment debate, I shall have a good deal to say about what Fianna Fáil have hooked themselves onto in support of the ICTU document and on its doctrines and programmes with which they must recognise themselves to be identified. I do not believe that even 25 per cent of the people in Fianna Fáil have read that document.</P>
    <P>To some extent we are all guilty of fighting shy in this whole area of industrial relations but that can be said of Fianna Fáil more than of any one else. We are not talking about an area that is sacrosanct.  There is no sacrosanct area of legislation in this country.  The State is proposing to stick its nose into people's business in their own businesses, their own property, their own homes, in how they rear their children and in every other area.  I do not see why industrial relations should be a no-go area for this House, for the other House or for the President. We are talking about the governing body of the people of Ireland, irrespective of membership of trade unions.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy says that what the Minister is doing &ldquo;invalidates&rdquo; contracts <Col N="2342" /> made by the Government with their investors.  That was a well chosen phrase. What is happening may frustrate those investors.  That would be the correct term to use.  The arrival on the scene of a cause from outside, in this case an industrial dispute, may frustrate the discharge by the Government of their contracts with their investors, but that should be said plainly.  The Government have not broken their contract and do not propose to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy's last remark which he appeared to consider to be his best point, judging from the flourish with which he led up to it, was that the phrase, &ldquo;the rate of interest would be determined&rdquo; might mean that investors would receive only an arbitrarily chosen and perhaps derisory return of interest on payments that will be overdue.  Obviously, the Deputy intended frightening investors into believing that that will be the case.  He should know that the State cannot pay something less than what is a fair rate of interest.  To do so would be confiscatory.  It cannot be done in a free country, or within the terms of a Constitution such as ours.  I do not mean to prejudge what rate would be appropriate; but the Deputy is wrong in trying to frighten investors into believing that Government would pay a rate of something like 2 to 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>I trust we will hear more of Fianna Fáil's ideas about this dispute, and about disputes of this type generally, as well as what alternative they might have to this legislation, when other speakers from that side address the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly wandered a good deal but I suppose that living in a metropolitan area he is in cloud cuckoo-land in many respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal particularly with section 3 of the Bill because it appears to have far reaching consequences for investors. Thousands of people are due interest on land bonds on 31 December this year. The money is paid on 1 January.  I have tabled a parliamentary question in this regard for written reply and I have done so as a result of having being approached <Col N="2343" /> by constituents on this matter.  Two of those with whom I spoke outlined that they had entered into commitments with builders and with builders' providers and had given undertakings that on 1 January they would be able to honour those commitments as a result of the dividends that were due to be paid to them on that date.  Those commitments are now in a shambles.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances where do the small builders, the builders' providers and other business people stand?  What is happening could result in some companies going to the wall.  They are depending for cash flow on moneys which apparently will not now be paid.  Nobody here would be foolish enough to think that contracts are not entered into in good faith in relation to houses, farms and so on.  Now investors will not be able to meet their financial commitments on 1 January.  Could the Minister not make an arrangement to deal with that situation so as to pay investors their legal entitlements on 1 January?  The Minister is looking for a deferment and in reply to a question I put down in the Dáil the Minister was vague about the terms of interest. The interest rates should be spelt out. Will the interest rate be 16¼ per cent as it is on some land bonds and other Government securities?  That is something I and my colleagues will want to know about.  I agree that some arrangements have to be made but I am perturbed about some cases that have been brought to my notice where people will find it difficult to meet financial commitments. These people could take action against the Minister for Finance if their money is not paid on the due date. Government securities were always reckoned a safe investment.  What will investors, shareholders and others think if their money is held up for a considerable time and if commercial companies are looking for their money in January and cannot get it.  Many companies have gone into liquidation and have brought others with them and now there will be a stop on the cash flow which is badly needed to sustain the industrial life of the <Col N="2344" /> country.  When replying will the Minister say if some arrangements can be made for the people who invested in good faith? The Minister should be able to make some arrangement with the commercial banks who will now be taking over the role of the Central Bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear whether the Opposition are in favour of or against the Bill.  Deputy Connolly's contribution has been opposite to the contribution made by their spokesman on Finance.</P>
      <P>To create the impression that the Minister for Finance is responsible for what is happening in the Central Bank is not right.  That problem is caused by a trade dispute.  What we should be concerned with are the measures being taken to give the Minister for Finance powers to deal with this situation.  That is part of the role of the Minister for Finance.  This is not a complicated Bill but so far we have been discussing a Finance Bill rather than a simple measure to allow the Minister to carry out his functions.  In giving the Minister these powers I would be concerned that it be seen that Dáil Éireann is not giving the Minister the right on our behalf to be a strike breaker. We should not be seen to be making a precedent which would be seen by the trade unions to be strike breaking.  I would like the Minister to say how he proposes to deal with the movement of cash from the Central Bank and what staff will be employed to carry out this function.  Would people now employed at senior management level carry out this function or do the management in the Central Bank propose to take in staff? Will we make the bank situation worse by doing this?  Only the absolute functions of the State's finances should be dealt with in the course of this dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From listening to Deputy Kelly one would have thought that a trade dispute should not have a side effect but no matter what trade dispute is involved it creates inconvenience to the public.  It should be remembered that the main inconvenience is caused to the people who are on strike and to their families.  I am horrified that people talk about trade <Col N="2345" /> disputes as if they were illegal.  A trade dispute is as legal as actions taken under other legislation.  The right of people to withdraw their labour is a fundamental constitutional right which we should safeguard. As long as people go on strike in accordance with the law of the land they are upholding democracy and not tearing it down.  I am horrified at the way some people talk about the strikers and their effect on the public.  The farmers went on strike in a democratic and legal way when they wanted their rights and trade unionists go on strike to achieve their rights.  There is nothing wrong with that.</P>
    <P>I would like to be reassured that the measures being taken will not be seen by the trade unions as an attack by Dáil Éireann in order to smash a strike.  I wish to be assured that this will only be a temporary measure which will not be used as a precedent in other disputes that may occur in banking institutions or elsewhere in the public service.  I entirely agree with the point that has been made in relation to the last bank strike.  On that occasion the whole finances of the State were left in somewhat of a heap because as a result of the dispute many people suffered severely, not during the strike &mdash; strange as it may seem, many people had a ball in that time &mdash; but after the strike.  People found they had lost their life's savings not as a result of the strike but because of lack of control or direction at Government level of the operation of financial transactions.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be able to tell us if he is aware of any efforts that were made to try to resolve the dispute which would have avoided the necessity to introduce this Bill.  At one time I was responsible for a section of a banking institution as a trade union official and I know it is not always easy to get satisfactory agreements in that sector.  Perhaps the Minister might look at that in consultation with the Minister for Labour.  In an essential service, proper arbitration and conciliation machinery should be available to deal with industrial disputes in a concentrated way.  Very often, people like those in the Central Bank would come to the conclusion that a threatened strike would <Col N="2346" /> not happen, that some fairy godmother might hand out something to avoid the strike.  There is a lot of brinksmanship in that sector and it has been there for many years.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when this dispute is over the arbitration and conciliation machinery in the Central Bank and the method of negotiation should be re-examined because I suggest the Minister's portfolio will come into this more and more.  I ask the Minister to reassure us that this Bill is essential and that it is not being used and will not be used in any way to interfere with industrial relations in the Central Bank and that the legislation will not be abused in order to interfere with or break what is an officially and legally constituted strike.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the point made by Deputy O'Kennedy &mdash; I have made the same point many times in the House as Government and Opposition Whip &mdash; that it is totally unfair to the Opposition to be subjected to certain Departments coming up with this type of legislation in the last week of a session.  Unlike Deputy Kelly who can master these things in a few hours I do not have the ability to do so.  I do not know any of the millionaire advisers Deputy Kelly spoke about, but then I am not a professor and I do not frequent the sort of places those afternoon people go to.  That is obviously why Deputy Kelly holds the views he expressed on strikes and industrial relations and senior advisers in banks.  The rest of us politicians in Opposition do not have access to those academic millionaires Deputy Kelly referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is dated 7 December, so some people had it last week.  It was printed on Friday but the Opposition merely got a proof.  I am not blaming the Minister for Finance, but this practice is unfair.  Today I am involved in two Bills, this one and the Social Welfare Bill in regard to which the Dáil has been given similar treatment. It is a very shabby way of doing things.  Having been Government and Opposition Whip I know exactly why this practice exists.  Certain Departments, one in particular, hold back Bills until the <Col N="2347" /> last moment so that they may be able to get them through quickly because debates will be limited.  I have said it is not the Minister's fault.  The Department of Finance through the years have been very good at this practice, but other Departments have nearly equalled them.  In the last session an attempt was made to push through the Air Transport Bill on the second last day at a time when the Minister was out of the country.  The Minister of State admitted that he had not read the Bill but he tried to ram all Stages through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but the Transport Bill came in on the second last day of the last session and had to be pushed through.  The Minister should try to do something about it.  I tried some time ago, and I succeeded in stopping the practice in some Departments.  The Minister spoke about computers breaking down and said that is the reason why this legislation might be needed in the future.  That was a real try-on by the Minister because would it not have been better to fix the computers than to draft this complex legislation?  The real reason for the Bill is the trade dispute between the Central Bank and the staff.  The Minister has said that under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, he needs these functions.  I do not say that he can do otherwise and therefore we will not be voting against giving a Second Reading to the Bill.  We are a responsible Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his usual rambling speech, Deputy Kelly asked what was the alternative to this Bill.  My reply is that the Minister should not have asked to come here today with this Bill.  The strike should have been avoided.  In a Private Notice Question last month I asked the Minister for Labour if he had considered the serious consequences of this strike for the national economy and what steps he proposed to take to avoid the threatened <Col N="2348" /> strike of the 450 staff in the Central Bank. The Minister for State told me that the union involved had made a claim for a 15 per cent increase.  An offer of 3 per cent with a seven months pause in accordance with Government pay guidelines had been made and the offer had been rejected.</P>
    <P>Here there has been obvious interference by the Government to ensure that the terms of the national plan would be followed in the Central Bank dispute. Last month the Minister of State said the Government would not get involved.  He said that until now section 31 of the 1927 Currency Act had given the Central Bank a unique statutory position which entitled them to negotiate pay but that that had altered in some way.  Of course, the official answer is that the Central Bank made up their own minds, but from my experience in dealing with trade unions and disputes it is clear to me that there was massive interference.  To find who is guilty of such interference is a difficult job.  I met the full council of the Labour Court and heard their views.  I had a good discussion with them.  As far as possible they are trying to uphold their independence. I am sure the Central Bank will do the same.</P>
    <P>Decisions are being made consistently in the public service and in a number of other areas where the public service have influence which are obviously being dictated to certain people.  I have already said that is leading us down a very dangerous road.  Deputy Kelly seems to be talking about something that happened 20 years ago.  There is no question of anyone being afraid to say anything to the unions. Our party had a good, straight talk with them the other day.  It is not a question of running away.  When the process of free collective bargaining which was fought for for years is interfered with and undermined, and when undue influence is exerted on people who negotiate, that is fundamentally wrong.  In Government Fianna Fáil had difficulties about free collective bargaining but it is wrong to interfere with it.  This House should not <Col N="2349" /> do anything which makes free collective bargaining more difficult.</P>
    <P>This Bill does that indirectly.  The Minister has to carry out his functions and I support him in that because otherwise he would not be doing his job.  If the Minister for the Public Service was not running the country into industrial chaos this would never arise.  That is our argument against the principle of this Bill. Confrontation is building up in a number of areas, and this is one.  The entire public service area came under threat in a number of cases such as Irish Shipping and the Land Commission and there is alleged interference in several other cases.  They went before the Labour Court and decisions were made.  Others are awaiting reports and recommendations from the arbitrator.</P>
    <P>They are all getting into unecessary difficulties.  This requires the Minister for Finance to bring in legislation.  The Minister would prefer the 200,000 people to get the benefits and dividends to which they are entitled.  Some of them badly need them.  People invested in what they thought was the last safe place.  The Minister for the Public Service does not see it that way.  He goes down the road of aggressive action, confrontation, no conciliation.  He had to be forced into appointing an arbitrator in the face of a national strike on 3 October.  All these things are building up resentment.</P>
    <P>I will give a few quotations.  In 1980 the Minister said that the Government did not propose to interfere with the administration of the Central Bank which would be independent in carrying out its functions.  He said this independence was possessed by almost every central bank in the world and it was a very desirable provision.  That was said by a colleague of my own.  In the Dáil debate in 1980 Deputy Garret FitzGerald endorsed what the Minister said about the role of the Central Bank and stated that there would be a grave danger for our currency if the role of the Central Bank was undermined. Deputy Peter Barry said at that time that everyone in the House would ageee that the Central Bank should not be interfered with in any way by <Col N="2350" /> Governments or politicians.  He said it must be independent.</P>
    <P>This is taking away their independance. The Minister is doing that for a reason.  In our amendment we are asking the Minister to do this for the duration of the strike only.  We know that industrial relations problems are the reason for the Bill.  There is no need to try to cloak that. Nobody denies that the Minister has to carry out certain functions.  This Bill should be taken off the Statute Book on the day the industrial problems are solved.  If the Minister does that, he will be doing a good day's work.  This is emergency legislation and it should be dropped as soon as the difficulty is over. If the computer breaks down and the Minister needs the Bill again, we will put it through on the nod.  The Minister is having no difficulty today even though in principle we are against his reason for doing it.</P>
    <P>The staff of the Central Bank are being treated unfairly.  Successive Governments in recent years have followed fairly stringent guidelines and there have been holdbacks and cutbacks.  The staff of the Central Bank have lost substantial increases and pay benefits.  They have lost from 17 per cent to 27 per cent.  They did not receive special increases which were given to the generality of the public service.  Arbitration decisions given in favour of the Civil Service were not given to the Central Bank employees.  It is unfair to say they are linked to the national plan and the Government guidelines. In the negotiations with the Central Bank an attempt was made to link them with certain analogous grades. Their representatives disputed those grades.  The staff wanted to have a say in regard to which grades were analagous.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was a good trade unionist in his day and I am sure he would say that was not unfair. This group of responsible and respected people, from clerical grades to economists, do not want to be involved in industiral action over the Christmas period. They are not the type of people who are unruly and who try to bring down financial institutions.  The employees of <Col N="2351" /> the Central Bank give an excellent service. They work in difficult circumstances and under pressure.  They are not paid inordinately high salaries.  They did not get some of the increases and the perks which employees of other banking groups got over the years.  We are not dealing with an elitist group of 400 employees. Quite a large number of them are females on very low salaries and in grades earning under £100 a week.  It is not a case of these people having to be set up and taught a lesson.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be passed because the Government have a majority.  We will not oppose the Second Stage of the Bill. We will wait to hear the Minister's comments on Committee Stage.  When the Bill is passed I hope the Minister will urge his colleague, the Minister for the Public Service, to speak to the people in the Central Bank and to release the constraints which obviously he has put on them.  He has taken away their power to follow the provisions of the 1927 Act.  He has taken away their right to co-operate with a large responsible trade union group and to participate in free collective bargaining in the normal way.  The employees looked for 15 per cent and they were offered 3 per cent.  If the principles of free collective bargaining had been adhered to, I have no doubt that a settlement could have been reached and analagous grades, which are at the centre of this problem, could have been found.</P>
    <P>It is a little strange that, while the Central Bank could not negotiate with the clerical staff of the ASTMS, they went ahead and the Irish Printing Federation agreed to give a 9 per cent increase in two phases over 15 months after a four months pay pause.  They are committed to maintaining relativity between 48 security guards and security guards in the associated banks.  The increase in that area is 10 per cent over 15 months.</P>
    <P>It has been stated to the staff at present in industrial dispute, who are now in their second week marching the streets coming up to Christmas, that the banks' 24th pay round must remain, as indicated, a seven months pay pause and 3 per cent from 1 <Col N="2352" /> January next over an 18 month agreement. This is contained in a letter written by the Central Bank stating that that must be the position and there is no need for me to repeat it at length.  The Department of the Public Service have said that the pay guidelines as laid down in the national plan must be maintained in the case of the Central Bank staff because they should set a guideline to other workers. But while there are 450 people marching the streets we are here discussing unnecessary legislation, legislation which can be dangerous in certain respects.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell made a valid point in that respect.  If we were to arrive at a situation &mdash; and we have seen this happen in the case of companies not too far from here &mdash; that every time there was an industrial dispute the Minister present, for valid reasons under his powers and functions brought in this type of legislation, such could become a vehicle to beat disputes in other areas &mdash; in other words, that the solution is to introduce emergency legislation, rushing it through this House. That is how one beats certain classes of workers.  There may be a temptation for people to do so in other Parliaments.  I hope this will not be only the first of such instances here.  I accept the Minister's reason for doing so on this occasion but not those of the Government because they could have done something about it while the Minister could not.</P>
    <P>There are others who wish to speak.  I must contend that the Minister for the Public Service and his officials obviously are not concerned because neither he nor the Minister for Labour has bothered to enter into any part of this debate though they are the people directly responsible. Rather they have sent in the Minister for Finance to the House today.  Perhaps even some of their officials would examine what has been said in the course of debates, endeavouring to bring this industrial dispute out of its present deadlock, which I believe can be done.  I believe that some little discussion on analogous grades could break the deadline if the rope was taken off the Central Bank, if they were allowed continue in <Col N="2353" /> the normal way, following the guidelines they have been following for 55 years, following the normal free collective bargaining pattern.</P>
    <P>They should be allowed to follow what has happened in allied institutions such as building societies, insurance companies and other banking institutions.  Were they allowed to follow the pattern followed in those institutions, this dispute could be ended tomorrow morning.  I accept that the Minister for Finance cannot do that but it could be done by the Minister for the Public Service by way of a telephone call from Government to the Central Bank.  If there is no such breakthrough effected these unfortunate workers will be placed in the position of having to continue their industrial dispute.  That would be unnecessary action for them, causing unnecessary difficulties to investors and all of the other problems outlined by the Minister for Finance today and mentioned by several Deputies.</P>
    <P>It does not seem much to ask that in the week before Christmas the Minister for the Public Service could at least do that.  Obviously he will not win his battles on his 3 per cent.  Obviously there will not be an arbitration decision of 3 per cent.  Why not at least endeavour to offer 9 per cent or 10 per cent to these workers overnight, agreeing that analogous grades be taken into account, which I believe would lead to a breakthrough. There should be discussions carried out in line with what the Central Bank has done, accepting relativities with the Irish Printing Federation, with the security guards and the associated banks.  If they can do so in one area why not in another? There is an inconsistent approach being adopted.  That is because of Government interference in the process of free collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>Hopefully the provisions of this legislation will continue merely for the duration of this strike.  I would ask the Minister for Finance to use his good offices to convince the Minister for the Public Service not to continue down this disastrous path rubbing salt into various trade union groups, in an endeavour to win an argument he must know he has not a chance <Col N="2354" /> of winning, by endeavouring to set unrealistic and unfair guidelines, forcing workers out onto the streets, leading in turn to other industrial disputes in, say, local authorities, which will be the next to arise.  They can be avoided.  I want to see them avoided, the Minister for Finance wants to see them avoided and so does the country at large.  In the midst of our current economic difficulties we cannot afford such major industrial disputes. The reason they have been brought about is the tough, unfair and unreasonable attitude adopted by the Government, through the Minister for the Public Service, forcing his colleagues rather than himself to introduce fairly dangerous legislation if allowed to remain on the Statute Book for too long.</P>
    <P>In these the last few days before the Christmas recess I hope we shall be given some assurance that this will not be the path we shall continue.</P>
    <P>I should say I resent the inferences contained in Deputy Kelly's remarks about our discussion with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  We are entitled to talk to whomsoever we wish.  We are entitled to accept whatever principles we wish.  Deputy Kelly may wish to drop out of Government, to revert to the back benches and to pontificate on all types of policies and all sorts of matters, at times being totally irresponsible and at other times being responsible.  We are a large Opposition party, an alternative Government. We are entitled to talk with the FUE, with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, with the Irish Farmers' Association or anybody else.  I resent anybody challenging our rights to so do.  We did not make any major statement.  We said we agreed with some of the principles contained in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' document.  Everybody in the country agrees with those principles.  It is what is done about them that is important and it is to that end we shall continue to direct our efforts in order to arrive at some solutions to our unemployment problems.</P>
    <P>This will not be achieved by dictates of <Col N="2355" /> Government or through their interference in the process of free collective bargaining, introducing emergency legislation, allowing semi-State companies to go down the chute, even to the extent of allowing other civil servants in the Land Commission to go the same way.  That is not the way to solve our problems.  If the Government feel they must bring in a few backbenchers to support that type of legislation from any onslaught, saying anything and everything, then that does not constitute very good government.  Yet Deputy Kelly accuses us of not engaging in very good opposition.</P>
    <P>I have said that we shall not oppose the Second Stage of this Bill.  We see that the Minister for Finance has a function to play.  But that should not prevent us from putting forward our point of view, which is that we should not continue to travel this path.  Rather we should endeavour to persuade the Government to accept some of our amendments.  If one were to follow Deputy Kelly's line of argument then it could be said that we should all go away, allowing the Minister for the Public Service to run the country subjecting everybody in the State and semi-State areas to various dictates.  We would then arrive at a position some time in 1985 when there would be no civil servants remaining, whether they be public servants who do not wish to become involved in industrial disputes, staff of local authorities or those of the various health boards.  This is the path we are beginning to follow, but one we must not continue to follow.  The Minister's only alternative, which is to introduce emergency legislation within 24 hours, constitutes a dangerous and frightening pattern.  The Government will have a few weeks over the Christmas recess to think about that, and about changing that pattern very quickly.</P>

      <P>It is amusing to hear Deputy B. Ahern speak so sincerely, honestly, almost cravingly, that certain things be done.  The reason the Minister <Col N="2356" /> and the Government have to travel certain roads in regard to Government pay guidelines is very simple: it is that Deputy B. Ahern and his party placed public finances in such a state that we cannot now afford to do what we would like for our public servants.  Indeed, we would have more public servants employed if there had been a more responsible attitude shown by the people who had the responsibility then for managing public finances.</P>
      <P>Deputy B. Ahern spoke about Fianna Fáil being a large Opposition party entitled to meet with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I should say that they are entitled to do whatever they like.  But they should not endeavour to deny the rights of Deputy Kelly and me to criticise the Opposition party and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions or, for that matter, anybody else we feel fit to criticise if we believe them to be wrong.  I shall do so on behalf of the people who elected me here.  I believe it constitutes a gimmick on their part &mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is only through putting our points of view honestly that we can achieve some sort of consensus as to where we should be going.  With regard to the meeting between the Fianna Fáil Party and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to some extent, we do resent it because the very same Congress have not even the courtesy to extend to some <Col N="2357" /> Deputies a facility to brief them, for instance, on their attitude to taxation. Only some months ago when the farmers were on the warpath the ICTU held the opinion that it was better for them to remain aloof from political parties and politicians and to deal only with the Government on formal matters.

      <P>I will, if Deputy O'Kennedy stops interrupting.  The solution put forward by the Opposition is always very simple.  This is the worst Opposition in the history of the State.  I have to say that I am one of the backbenchers who would be critical of the Government as well.  I do not believe it is my job to rubber stamp everything the Government do.  I am on record as having criticised the Government where I believe they are wrong.  I have put my point of view within the parliamentary party and sometimes outside it.  Even in matters of this kind the Opposition constantly put forward the simple answer that it is the Minister's fault, always and ever.  Their simple solution is to blame the Minister but this is not a simple problem. It is a difficult problem where a trade union dispute is involved.  There has to be some right and perhaps some wrong on both sides.  Surely we can elevate the debate beyond simply blaming the Minister and put forward some constructive suggestions based on constructive reasoning as to why the problem has come about.  If we approach it in that way we may make a greater contribution towards solving the problem.  We are undermining the people on strike and undermining the trade unions by always blaming the Minister.  If we could put forward constructive arguments, saying that one part of their case was right or another part was wrong, we might be able to help in resolving the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bell made a point about the just rights of people.  I accept that and pay tribute to the trade unions for their contribution through the years.  Many widows were left with large families &mdash; I come from one of them &mdash; and they might not have survived if it were not for the actions of the trade unions.  That does not mean that they are always right, that they are infallible, beyond criticism and that they cannot be questioned and brought to heel when they are wrong.  We seem to suffer from cowardice when it comes to criticising any wrong committed by a <Col N="2359" /> trade union.  I suspect that 99 per cent of Deputies do not know who is right and who is wrong in this dispute.  The amount of information and briefing available on it is appalling.  I regret that nobody has taken the time to brief Deputies on the situation.  We cannot simply stand up and talk about just rights.  Everybody has some rights but also responsibilities.</P>
    <P>On the general question it may be asked who has the right to strike.  Have the Army or the Garda the right to strike? Have the Judiciary the right to strike? Have the civil servants the right to strike? Have the Central Bank the right to strike?  Presumably they have under existing legislation.  We should really be concerning ourselves with the question of who has the right to strike.  If we deny people that right then we must ensure that they have a proper means by which they can air their grievances and put forward a case.  We must examine each case as it arises and not become involved with emotive terms such as &ldquo;strike breaking&rdquo; and &ldquo;just rights&rdquo;.  Right and wrong exists in every situation and sometimes it is a question of degree.  At some stage this dispute will have to be resolved and I do not know why it has had to come to a strike.  I should like Deputies to have more information so that we could make some contribution.  To that extent I agree with Deputy Kelly.  There seems to be a feeling that the elected representatives of the people in Parliament and the Government should not have the right to say anything about an industrial dispute, no matter how much it affects the public interest.  I reject that.  It is very silly of us to think that could be accepted.</P>
    <P>I should like to know more about this dispute.  There should be a briefing document for Deputies as to how it came about, how much the people concerned are being paid, how much they are seeking and exactly what are the terms of the problem.  Obviously we must pass this legislation but we should know all the facts which have led to its introduction. Nobody has seen fit to brief Deputies in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern criticised the <Col N="2360" /> Government for interference.  &ldquo;Interference&rdquo; is a great word.  We are supposed to interfere with the Garda from time to time or to interfere with this and that. All I can see down the line is people interfering with the rights of politicians, the rights of Government, the rights of elected Assembly.  As elected representatives we have the right to raise questions here.  Deputy Ahern went on to interfere by putting forward all sorts of arguments and suggestions.  We have to be very clear that our loyalty is not to a party or a trade union; our loyalty is to the public interest. If that means criticising the party or the Government of the day or trade unions, that is where our duty lies.  We must consider the public interest.  It is not our duty to be unfair to anybody or to support the Government simply because we are Government backbenchers if they are being unfair to anybody.  I do not wish to be unfair to anybody involved in this dispute.  There is no point in saying that because one has the term &ldquo;trade unionist&rdquo; or the term &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo; after one's name right is on one's side.  Our loyalty is not to a party or trade union but to the public interest.</P>
    <P>What would happen if the Minister did not bring in this legislation?  What would happen if the Central Bank were unable to function, if the public finances could not be serviced?  How could we uphold the State without some powers to deal with the situation as outlined in the Bill in the event of an industrial dispute?  I believe that people involved in the dispute will accept that there has to be some power to deal with what could develop into a serious financial situation for the State.  If there is a strike in a hospital doctors will always keep emergency services going.  This is an essential service and that is the essence of the thinking behind this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point regarding section 2 (3) which empowers the Minister to postpone by order the redemption of the payment of interest or dividends.  Perhaps the Minister would explain the effect of such a provision.  If it is necessary to use these powers he should ensure that people who are dependent for their living <Col N="2361" /> on interest from Government securities are not left without an income.  It may be said that there is no power under the legislation to make such a provision but an arrangement could be made with private banks, or some Government Department, to make payments on account to such people so that those who depend on interest or dividends from such securities for their livelihood are not left without money.  We should provide for that especially in the period leading up to Christmas.  A lot of retired people have put their nest egg into State securities and depend on the interest cheque coming to them.  The Minister should tell us how such people will be dealt with.  He should ensure that they are not in any danger in this dispute.</P>
    <P>I clearly endorse and support trade unionism.  It is a healthy and good thing and it has been very beneficial to the State.  However, I should like to make it clear, irrespective of what people might think of the comment, that it is not becoming for Parliament to accept any snub, abuse or discourtesy handed out by any trade union leader without putting forward our point of view because we are fearful of being identified with criticism of trade unions.  If we criticise trade unions, or their leaders, it is on the basis of what we belive is wrong in trade unions.  It does not mean and should not be identified that we are opposed to them.  There is that terrible fear among politicians.  It is causing us to undermine trade unionism in the long run.  Effectively, we are saying to people that we will do this and that when we get into Government but when we get into Government we cannot deliver on those promises.  In turn that is being passed on to union members who become restless. We should be able to say that we are not doing this simply because it is a popular thing to be associated with trade unionism. We are doing it because we believe it is right and because we support what is good about trade unionism.  I support the legislation.  I regret it has been found necessary to introduce it.  I hope the Minister finds it possible to give Members a briefing document on precisely what <Col N="2362" /> has caused this dispute from the point of view of his Department and perhaps, we may get a document from Congress giving their view.  It is a matter on which Deputies should be brought up to date.</P>

      <P>I must again emphasise the danger of rushing legislation like this through the House in a short time, four hours in the case of the Bill before us.  The Bill was not made available to Members until yesterday.  It is a complex Bill and it is rather difficult for Members to understand the full implications of its provisions.  We do not know yet what the implications of it will be.  In his opening statement the Minister did not enlighten us on the need, the purpose or the effect the Bill will have on public finances.  It is not a temporary measure. It is there to stay.  It gives the Minister wide powers to introduce its provisions or phase them out any time he likes. There are extraordinary provisions in it and I do not understand the implications of them.  One provision states that funds may be transferred to a commercial bank or any other institution.  Good heavens, imagine putting that in legislation.  What does it mean?  Does it mean that the Minister can transfer Government funds to any other institution, a public or private company, any place he wishes?  The Minister appears to have total power under a Bill that is being rushed through the House without Members having any idea of its implications.  We are all supposed to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to it.  It will be on the Statute Book for ever more without Members having any understanding of the implications of it for the public finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It gives a part of public administration over to a private company.  It is creeping privatisation and it is permanent, not just for the course of the strike.  In his opening statement the Minister said that the provisions were there to deal with any difficulty, where there was any threat of any <Col N="2363" /> temporary disruption or otherwise such as a breakdown in a computer facility or anything the Minister might see as a threat.  We are giving extraordinarily broad powers to a Minister for Finance which totally undermines the independence of the Central Bank although successive Ministers for Finance down the years have emphasised the need for that institution to have independence. The Minister is removing all independence from the Central Bank with this legislation which amounts to a panic measure being rushed through as a strike breaking Bill.  The House is being asked to get itself involved in strikebreaking, undermining the independence of the Central Bank which is supposed to have independence in negotiations on pay. The Minister is interfering in the pay bargaining procedure of the Central Bank in an attempt to ensure that his guidelines are kept.  Already the Minister has pressured the Central Bank to the extent that they gave a totally unjust offer of 3 per cent over 18 months with a seven month pay pause.</P>
    <P>Earlier Deputy Mitchell expressed the view that there were rights and wrongs and he asked who was right or wrong in this dispute.  Any person who sees an offer of 3 per cent over 18 months with a seven month pay pause will know who is right and who is wrong.  That person will see that the management of the Central Bank are the cause of the strike.  The Minister is using the Bill to bring the Government and the House into the pay dispute.  He is using it to interfere with the union bargaining position and the position of the Central Bank in the strike. Some Deputies today were moralising, like Deputy Gay Mitchell, about the public interest.  They said that they were anxious to defend the public interest. Deputy Mitchell said all he was concerned with was the public interest but what is the public interest?  The Deputy did not define that statement or tell us the public he was interested in.  He certainly was not interested in the ordinary general public.  The Government have not defended the interests of the general <Col N="2364" /> public either in their taxation system which is totally unjust or in their cutbacks on health and education.  Was the removal of food subsidies in the public interest?  Will Deputy Mitchell defend that decision in the public interest?</P>
    <P>Last week bank interest rates were increased by 2 per cent and I should like to know if that was done in the public interest.  The Minister for Finance last week said he was against that move and described it as a bad thing.  The banks thought it was a bad thing and yet a motion on that was agreed here.  The Minister in his speech today said:</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that it is the Minister for Finance alone who is responsible for the State's financial business.</P>
    <P>That is untrue.  It is not the Minister for Finance alone who is responsible for the State's financial business because the commercial banks make the major decisions which effect everything the State does.  In fact, they direct and decide what decisions the Minister for Finance can and will make in given circumstances.</P>

      <P>It is true.  It is a fact that the Minister for Finance is not in control of the matter at all as was demonstrated last week.  He said then that he did not want an increase in interest rates and yet there was an increase.  What power has the Minister for Finance to decide on issues like that?  What power has he to decide on the lending policies of the banks or anything of that nature? In this Bill he is undermining and interfering with the independence, instead of strengthening the position, of the Central Bank.  The Bill has implications which we do not understand.  I would like more time to discover all the implications of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to tell the House what other institutions besides the commercial banks will benefit from this Bill. <Col N="2365" /> The commercial banks will benefit for instance from the effects on exchange control but I am not competent to say what the full implications will be.  When this Bill is passed the commercial banks will have a power they have always looked for.  They have been fighting constantly with the Central Bank over issues like exchange control and transfers of assets out of the country.  We do not know over which assets the Central Bank will no longer have control and the Minister has not given any indication what powers the commercial banks will take from the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly made a very interesting statement which indicates the attitude of this Government, the Minister for Finance and Deputy Kelly himself.  He said that to pay less than a fair rate of interest would be totally wrong and unjust and could not be done by a Government, but they have no problem in paying less than a fair wage.  That would not be wrong or unjust or against the Constitution, against private property rights and so on. You may pay an unjust and unfair wage but you cannot pay an unfair or an unjust rate of interest.  That is the attitude of this Government.  Their monetary policy has a total disregard for the rights of people and the effects which their legislation is having.</P>
    <P>Last week the Government looked around for any kind of EC document they could get to debate in this House because they had absolutely no legislation on their books, but this morning we were told that two important Bills were to be rushed through today with the guillotine introduced on each and the House did not have the right to debate them fully.  This very dangerous legislation is being pushed through and when the full implications are examined it will be seen to be giving the must unusual power to the Minister for Finance to transfer powers from the Central Bank to commercial banks and other institutions.  That is the most extraordinary information to be given in this Bill &mdash; that certain powers will be transferred to &ldquo;any other institutions&rdquo; whether it be the ESB, Guinness, local authorities or any other institutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2366" /> What precisely has the Minister in mind? Why put in such loose wording?  I ask the Minister to have another look at the implications of this Bill.  Even if he insists on pushing it through as a strike breaking effort, I ask him to at least insert a provision that the Bill will collapse when the strike is over, in other words, that this Bill is only a temporary measure.  It appears that the Minister is taking this opportunity to implement something he or the commercial banks have had in mind for some time.  He is giving the Bank of Ireland powers formerly held by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I object to this legislation and to the way it is being rushed through the House preventing Deputies from studying it and putting down amendments.  I object to the Government Whip saying this morning that he phoned us last night but could not get a reply, implying that we were not in the House.  We cannot sit beside the phone waiting for Deputy Barrett to give us a ring, when he did not ring that office once in the past 12 months.  He never gave any indication that he wanted to consult us on legislation coming before this House but now he says he rang last night but could not get through.  He seems to think that this covers him for rushing through this legislation today.  I do not accept that.  The way the Government are rushing this legislation through is dishonest because it does not give the Deputies, the public or the media time to study the implications of it before it is passed in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My reaction to this legislation is simple.  This is a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  This is very serious, determined wide-ranging legislation to solve what is basically a very temporary and passing problem.  I want to take up Deputy Kelly's invitation to say what we on this side of the House consider should be the approaches one would take in matters like this.  First, one can panic and call in the parliamentary draftsman &mdash; who seemed to be too busy to draft legislation which we have been waiting for for a long time &mdash; to draft this legislation in a hurry and then rushed it <Col N="2367" /> into this House, but there are other ways to tackle this problem and there are other courses which should and could be tried before this legislation is passed.  I am in some agreement with Deputy Mac Giolla about the wording of this legislation and I will deal with that in a few minutes, but while this Bill will solve some of the problems arising from this dispute, it will worsen a whole series of statutory provisions which are the job of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>This Bill may deal with the Exchequer Account end of the Central Bank, but it cannot deal in the long term with items such as the printing and distribution of currency, the regulation of the exchange rates, the EMS position, the protection of our foreign credit rating, the monitoring of key indices and assets and liabilities of banks, the liquidity ratios of the various banks and the role of supervising commercial banks.  The Bill may solve a very short term problem but in the long term were the strike to drag on, it would have a very serious effect on our financial regulatory system.</P>
      <P>We are not voting against the Second Stage.  I sympathise with the fact that the Minister has to face a situation which has to be dealt with quickly.  There were one or two other avenues which should have been explored.  Deputy Kelly and I have one thing in common &mdash; we represent the Dublin South constituency and our currency is printed in the very fine plant at Sandyford which is in the constituency. From what I know of the people employed there, there is still a way of solving this difficulty.  Section 18 of the 1976 Industrial Relations Act gives power to the Labour Court to intervene in a dispute provided that dispute is damaging the national interest.  I ask the Minister and the Government to use that section of the Act and to ask the Labour Court to intervene to settle this dispute in the national interest.  A dispute which merits emergency legislation is very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Court have not been involved in this dispute except at conciliation <Col N="2368" /> level.  They should intervene now and if they fail the House will stand behind any necessary legislation which is needed to resolve the problem.  The Government should also explore the area of arbitration headed by a senior figure who might be available to the Labour Court to be of assistance.  I fail to understand why this sledgehammer has been brought in when ordinary machinery has not been tried.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly also berated the Opposition for listing the role of the Central Bank and reiterating all the fine work they do, without putting forward specific proposals.  I have put forward a proposal and I do not oppose the Bill because I sympathise with the Minister who is attempting to handle a very difficult situation. From my perspective of the problem and from that of the workers I know in the Central Bank, they are amenable to a settlement of this dispute without greatly shattering the Minister's pay guidelines. The Minister is dealing with very responsible people who compile Central Bank reports &mdash; and every Deputy loves to get his hands on a copy of a Central Bank report &mdash; who know the figures relating to the economy and what the country can stand.  They understand the Minister's language when he speaks about the need for pay restraint and the necessity to cut down budget deficits, which I wholeheartedly support.</P>
    <P>It is important in a Bill like this to be very clear about the sensitivities of the Central Bank.  The delicate nature of our financial system has been demonstrated many times.  For example, the run &mdash; for want of a better word &mdash; on the Trustee Savings Bank which is directly under the Minister's control and is the safest of all banks for that reason, was due to groundless rumours.  I commend the Minister for scotching the rumours and I support the action he took in that regard. It shows how fragile our financial system is and what a spark of lack of confidence can do.  It also surfaced last year in the budget when we attempted to deal with non-residency accounts.  Even the Minister was surprised at how quickly the most mobile of all commodities, money, moved.  Confidence is essential in avoiding <Col N="2369" /> a breakdown or disruption of the financial system.  How can the Minister avoid major disruption when the institution set up under the Central Bank Acts to regulate that system is, in effect, frozen by legislation?  My main complaint is that it may not have been necessary if other courses had been tried.</P>
    <P>The question of EMS realignment has to be mentioned in any debate on the Central Bank.  As the Minister knows, EMS realignments tend to happen over a holiday weekend.  Speed is of the essence in responding to EMS realignment which may happen every five or six months.  Technical expertise is also essential&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Breannan Mr. S. Breannan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Breannan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill to reassure me that, in the event of an EMS realignment, the State can react without the services of the Central Bank.  Deputy Mac Giolla mentioned commercial banks.  Obviously it is not desirable to have the institutions which the Central Bank was set up to supervise, regulating our financial system.  I am attempting to be constructive and helpful because my information and understanding is that if proper procedures are tried in this dispute it could be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously we cannot vote against this legislation because to do so would plunge the country into immediate financial disruption if the Bill were defeated.  We do not have any alternative but we do not vote for it with any great relish.  It is never very popular to defend the role of banks as one is accused of being a capitalist or a privatisation expert.  However, it is time that people stopped double thinking and stated the precise role of these institutions. The last accounts of the banks showed an 8 per cent to 9 per cent return on capital.  If the State or anybody else was running the system I have no doubt that we would be talking about a minus return on capital.  Those who advocate a massive onslaught on the banking system as some kind of a get rich quick solution <Col N="2370" /> to the problems of the State are living in Walt Disney land.  The difficulty is to earn more money for Ireland Limited so that we can distribute it among ourselves and are not continually fighting about an every-dwindling pool of capital and investment.  However, that is a debate which I hope to take up on the Adjournment. The affairs of this State are at the lowest ebb for many a generation and I feel extremely strongly about that.  I ask the Minister to use the existing machinery and not to have recourse to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am glad that there appears to be general agreement with regard to this essential Bill.  Everybody in the House and throughout the country recognises its importance and we must all take it very seriously.  We are dealing with the finances of our country and the accounts of our nation.</P>
      <P>The staff in the Central Bank are in a very unique, special and privileged position. We all have a duty to listen carefully to comments and reports issued from that bank, because they have a thorough grasp of what is happening in relation to the finances of the country and our whole economy.  What they say must be taken as the basic truth of the situation.  People in such a privileged position with regard to themselves and the economy should consider very carefully their actions before pursuing the course they are on at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be faith and belief in Exchequer stock.  People have invested in that public stock, issued on the Irish Stock Exchange, and there may be a regrettable delay in the payment of dividends and with regard to stock falling due for redemption.  This is very serious.  The actions of the Central Bank staff are causing problems for the ordinary investor and it is important that the Minister take whatever action is necessary to ensure that these delays are minimised to the fullest possible extent.  People on small and on fixed incomes who are depending on the payment of dividends must be considered.  They have invested in Irish stock which is used for the benefit of the country and withholding payment of such <Col N="2372" /> dividends is unfair and wrong and should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>People in such privileged well paid positions, should be very slow to strike because they cause such great inconvenience. These people are quick to lecture us and it is important that we are all lectured and listen to some of what is said.  However, one is judged by one's actions.  The Government have been forced to take necessary action to protect the State's finances and they are to be congratulated in moving in this manner. They have been correct in taking this important decision.  By their present action, the staff of the Central Bank are jeopardising the good which they have been trying to do for the country.  They should be more cautious and careful before taking such precipitate action. The Government have no choice but to bring in this measure this morning in the interests of the country.  I hope that there will be full agreement with regard to its general provisions, although there may be some specific items about which some Members will not be happy.  It is important that a measure of this nature should have the full co-operation of all parties in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be as brief as I can, bearing in mind that Deputies on both sides of the House have raised a number of questions which need to be answered at the end of Second Stage debate.</P>
      <P>With regard to the date on the Bill as circulated, that is the date on which it was presented to the Clerk of the Dáil for printing.  That date always precedes the date of circulation on every Bill brought into this House.  Deputy O'Kennedy received a true copy I understand, of the Bill, on Monday and it was circulated on Tuesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not, as Deputy O'Kennedy has claimed, an unprecedented Bill.  The 1970 Finance Act contained a similar provision in relation to the redemption of securities being deferred due to the closure at that time of the Bank of Ireland, which at that stage was handling the State's financial affairs.  In 1971 the Exchequer account was transferred to the Central Bank from the Bank of Ireland which up to then had care of it.  It is not true to say that it is unprecedented. The only statutory function of the Central Bank that is affected by the provisions of this Bill is the operation of the Exchequer account.  The other statutory functions are not affected by the Bill. I do not say that they are not affected but they are affected by the Bill.</P>
      <P>As far as the exchange rate operations and the EMS are concerned, the foreign exchange market continues to operate smoothly and continues to be monitored by the Central Bank.  The operations of monetary policy are primarily a matter for the Central Bank and they continue to be in a position to control and monitor overall bank liquidity so that there is no immediate problem on that side.  The normal reporting procedures which are required of the licensed banks continue to be observed.  The Central Bank have at their disposal all the credit information necessary to monitor these developments. The provisions of the Bill do not interfere with the statutory functions of the bank other than the operation of the Exchequer account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the payment on dividends and interest, this Bill does not represent the rupture of a contract by the State between the State and citizens.  As Deputy Kelly pointed out, an external event has frustrated the operation of the contract.  The provisions of the Bill are not to stop payment but to provide for payment at the earliest moment when it <Col N="2374" /> is possible to make payment.  The provisions of the Bill are not the cause of people not being paid.  In fact, section 3 is designed to remedy that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>But they will not get their money on 1 January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot make payments to the people who are entitled to them, simply because the register of people who are entitled to these payments is held in a separate bank and I do not have access to it.  If I had access to it I could make the payments.  That is why I had to make a specific provision in the Bill.  The provision in the Bill is not the cause of the problem but rather attempts to bring about a remedy to that problem.  To the extent that people have entered into other commitments in the expectation of these payments I appreciate they have a problem but in the absence of access to the register I cannot make payments.  I would not know who was entitled to payment or any other information which is required.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan characterised this Bill as a sledgehammer to crack a nut and then outlined all the things the Bill does not deal with.  As he went through his list he seemed to be knocking bits off the sledgehammer so that what we have, to use his own phrase, is a very precise little hammer which does a particular job.  This Bill provides the minimum that can be possibly provided in order to keep the financial business of the State going.  It is in everyone's interest that this be done. It would be a mistake to present the Bill, as Deputy Mac Giolla attempted to do as a strike breaking Bill.  What the Bill provides for is the measures which are the necessary minimum to keep the ordinary financial business of the State going.  That is in keeping with everyone's idea of the public interest however it may be defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer if we did not have to have this Bill.  However, there is a wider case for it than simply the dispute which has been the immediate cause of the Bill being introduced.  In the national plan and in previous statements the Government have made clear their views on pay <Col N="2375" /> policy for the economy as a whole and for the public sector, the private sector and areas where they directly control pay and, indeed, areas where they do not directly control it.  That is a legitimate activity for Government and it is in order for the Government to say they believe these are the limits which should be set in pay developments in both the private and public sectors.  I do not accept that the Government should stay away from those areas as Deputies opposite seem to think, particularly since in a number of cases we are talking about areas which will directly or indirectly affect the total size of the Exchequer pay bill and the call we will have to make on the taxpayer in order to find that expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the lectures are not conducted on an organised basis and that they are given only in areas where requests are made to the Department?  In view of the fact that in the three years since it was announced the scheme has not got off the ground, is it not time it were put on an organised basis with the co-operation of such bodies as ACOT and the county development teams?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are problems in this regard.  First we do not have the facilities around the country by way of locations where the lectures can be given. Neither do we have the necessary close relationship with the farmers.  Consequently, we depend on intermediaries such as people in the ACOT area and others who request lectures, who show that degree of interest.  It is a matter for the people requesting the lectures to arrange for facilities by way of accommodation in hotels or halls and to invite farmers to attend.  There is close liaison between my Department and these organisations.  Officials of the Department are made available to provide the lectures when they are requested but the problem is that we depend on other people to arrange the accommodation and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not time the Department utilised the regional development organisations, the country teams and even the VECs to promote such programmes? It is accepted that forestry is the one area of development in which there is no possibility of over-production. That means that there is tremendous potential for this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that organisations such as those mentioned by the Deputy, and including the VECs should be involved by way of promulgating information in relation to grants and so on.  I would be very pleased if that would happen. Members of this House are in a position to do a great deal to arouse interest in the project among those bodies.  We are <Col N="2382" /> in a position to provide the manpower and to supply information on various schemes and so on.</P>

      <P>The first recorded infestation of this pest outside mainland Europe occurred recently in parts of Wales and the British midlands.  My Department are fully aware of the potential danger to Irish forestry were this very aggressive pest to reach this country.  The steps being taken to prevent such include the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;strict prohibition on the importation of coniferous timber with bark attached <Col N="2383" /> and of Christmas trees exceeding three metres in height;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a requirement that all imported timber be accompanied by a certificate to the effect that the material is free from this and other pests;</P>
    <P>&mdash;periodic surveys of forest areas, especially in the vicinity of seaports and a contingency plan to cope with any reported infestation; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;on-going liaison with the Department of Agriculture, as well as regular contacts with forest authorities in Britain and Northern Ireland, in relation to plant health matters to determine the most effective preventive and control measures for all potentially harmful pests, including the beetle referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess to being somewhat alarmed at the tenor of the Minister's reply in that he does not appear to indicate the potential disaster this pest represents to our forestry.  Is he aware that nothing less than the entire future of our forestry stocks is at stake in so far as this virulent pest is concerned? Consequently would he not use the medium of this question to impress on everyone concerned the enormous potential damage that could be done in the event of this pest gaining access to our forests?  Also, is there any research being done in the Department on this whole question and in particular can the Minister give us any optimistic news in respect of the Dutch elm disease which poses exactly the same type of problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Haughey has raised this question.  It is of the utmost importance that we do everything possible to avoid this very damaging pest gaining access to our forests.  As I have said, for the first time the pest has been seen in Wales and the British midlands. As the Leader of the Opposition will appreciate, while we can do our utmost to ensure by way of the measures I have mentioned that the pest does not reach here, I cannot give a guarantee that our efforts will be successful.  I would stress the absolute importance of the <Col N="2384" /> reporting of any sighting by anyone of this pest to the Department.  As the Deputy has said, the disease caused by the pest can have disastrous effects.  It is a very virulent type of pest.</P>
      <P>A great deal is known about it.  We know for example that the disease is produced by the beetle and by the larvae of the beetle.  It is somewhat different from Dutch elm disease which results from an insect carried virus.  Both diseases are very damaging but it is difficult to establish what causes this pest.  All we know is that it attaches itself to Norway spruce and Sitka spruce and mostly to mature trees, trees of 20 years plus.  That is why we are prohibiting the importation of Christmas trees above a certain height. It is a very dangerous pest and we are taking every step to ensure that it will not be introduced here.  If people see any sign of this disease in trees they should report it immediately as the importation of this disease would have a disastrous effect on our forests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that were this disease to find its way here it would be equivalent, in the forestry sense, to a major outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the agricultural area?  Would the Minister agree that it is as potentially serious as that and that there is an urgent need for much more to be done than has been done so far and would he consider something in the nature of the steps taken by the Department of Agriculture in regard to foot and mouth disease being taken in regard to this very real menace?  It would be, as the Minister knows, a commercial disaster for us if this disease were to be imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The steps being taken are somewhat similar to the monitoring done by the Department of Agriculture at points of entry to the State.  I agree that the kind of disaster that would ensue from an infestation of this kind would be somewhat similar to a major outbreak of foot and mouth disease in animals.  We have been taking steps in relation to the importation of timber.  It must carry a <Col N="2385" /> certificate.  We are prohibiting the importation of certain types of trees and there is a strict prohibition on the importation of coniferous timber with the bark attached as it is the bark that is attacked and infested by the larvae of this pest. We have been taking precautions which are adequate at the moment to meet the risk.  It does not guarantee absolute freedom from infestation but neither do the precautions taken in relation to foot and mouth disease, although they have been very successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The signs have been made known to them.  The pest is not that easily seen.  The damage is seen on the bark of the tree and it is caused by the pest and by larvae from the pest.  The <Col N="2386" /> attacked tree is recognised by the presence on its bark of one or more blobs of crystalised resin.  It is not that easily recognisable because blobs of resin can be found on trees which are not infested. This is one of the symptoms of a diseased tree but there are other symptoms of which the people in the industry are aware and I hope it will be reported if such symptoms are found.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="2388" /> for Fisheries and Forestry if a licence has been issued for the taking of red deer from the Killarney herd for commercial purposes; if so, the terms of such a licence; and whether he is aware of the feelings of dismay among all those interested in the conservation of our national heritage by reports of the issue of such a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>A licence to capture such animals alive as breeding stock for deer farming purposes was granted some time ago.  It relates to the six month period from 1 September 1984 to 28 February 1985 and is confined to a limited area in respect of which the applicants had the written permission of the landowners concerned.</P>
      <P>The licence requires that capture be carried out only by methods approved under the Wildlife Act, 1976 and provides that any deer so captured be tagged and appropriately recorded.  It was also made clear that any introduction of deer from other sources would not be countenanced.</P>
      <P>I am aware that reservations have been expressed in the matter.  However, I can assure the Deputy that, while any action taken on foot of the licence is not likely to pose a threat to the Killarney herd of red deer, the situation has been closely monitored and my understanding is that, to date, no animals have been captured.</P>
      <P>I might add that, as a result of certain information &mdash; which was only very recently brought to my notice &mdash; in relation to a change in the licensee's circumstances, I am having the position reviewed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if the Wildlife Advisory Council were consulted by him or his officers before the licence was issued?  Were any other bodies interested in deer or in conservation consulted?  If so, what views were expressed about the matter?  Is there any limit placed in the licence on the number of red deer which can be captured or taken by the licensee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Such consultations did <Col N="2389" /> not take place and the licence did not specify a limit to the number of deer to be taken.  The reason for this is that it was felt &mdash; this has been borne out by what has happened in the last four month period &mdash; that so few have been captured anyway&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pursue this purely in a non-political way, strictly in the interest of conservation.  Does the Minister not think it is extraordinary behaviour by him in his departmental capacity to issue a licence of this sort with such far-reaching implications without consulting the body specifically set up by the Oireachtas to advise in matters of this sort?  Does he not think that by issuing a licence for a protected species without consulting the council he is making a mockery of our whole process of conservation? Does he not think that it is irresponsible on somebody's part to have issued a licence of this sort without any limitation on numbers?  Does the Minister not think that it was irresponsible to have issued a licence at all, but does he not think that to have issued a licence without any limitation on numbers for a rare and imperilled herd which in total numbers only 300 indicates that somebody has behaved in an extraordinary fashion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not argue on the figures involved.  The licence was issued on the basis that the anticipated success with which the licensee would capture these deer was such that very few would be caught.  Let the herd be 300 or 400, it was felt that this would not in any way <Col N="2390" /> endanger the species.  I would point out to the Deputy that because of information that came to me recently I am having a real hard look at this question and I hope to take action very shortly.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact, and I am sure he is aware of it, that this is a unique species in Ireland, that it is the last remaining pure bred herd of Irish red deer, that there is no other pure bred herd anywhere in the country, that this herd has been gravely endangered&mdash;at one stage it was practically extinct?  Now it has more or less stabilised at around 300 but it is hardly a viable herd.  It is a priceless national asset and, far from issuing a licence of this sort which would endanger its future in any way, the Minister and his advisers should take every possible step open to them to protect this herd and to ensure not just its preservation but its enlargement.  If the Minister is aware of it, would he advert to the fact that the real danger in regard to this herd is that of inbreeding, that everywhere else throughout the country red deer have inbred with sika and other deer, and that the introduction of a deer farm into the Killarney area carries a grave danger of bringing a process of inbreeding?  To introduce a deer farm into the Killarney area where the last herd has found its last refuge is the environmental equivalent of bringing a lighted torch into an explosives factory. I used that simile advisedly.</P>

      <P>I will not go into the simile but I agree that this is the last outpost of the species, Killarney National Park.  I hope it will become more viable and that it will be preserved.  In case any <Col N="2391" /> misapprehension goes abroad in relation to the licence, I wish to point out that certain conditions attach to it.  First, the capture of deer was for breeding purposes which in theory would expand the herd.</P>

      <P>No. 2, it was confined to the Killarney area and No. 3, there is strict prohibition in the conditions in relation to what the Deputy described as a danger of inbreeding or mixing with other species.  The preservation of the purity of the species was a <i>sine qua non</i>.  I agree that we have been very fortunate at a very late stage to have had the common sense to concern ourselves with the preservation of the species, which is unique. These are the only ones left.  The matter is now in hand and I can assure the Deputy and the House that a close eye will be kept on it and action will be taken. I hope the Deputy's own herd is doing well.</P>

I am reassured by what the Minister said about this licence.  Before concluding may I ask the Minister again to keep in mind in the future the priceless nature of this herd of deer?  Apart from this instance, would he accept that anything in the nature of deer farming in any proximity to this last refuge for this herd would be courting environmental disaster?

I am told that by the end of the decade we will have a sufficient volume of pulp wood for the kind of facility.  This matter is under active consideration.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I am only too well aware of the vulnerability of forests to fire damage.  My Department operate a comprehensive forest protection programme against fire hazard and the various fire prevention and control measures at each forest centre are kept under regular review. Decisions as to the creation or cleaning of fire belts are taken in the light of cost and potential fire hazard at each forest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that now that our plantations are fully mature, it is very important that we should protect them from fire?  Would he agree also that it is most important that we prevent fire reaching our forests.  I have seen examples in my area where fire came to within a matter of feet when it would have cleared hundreds of acres of mature timber?  Would the Minister consider ordering his Department to have those fire belts cleared and to provide fire belts around new forests as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that this is a continuing practice. Precaution is taken in relation to the provision of fire belts.  That is just one of the precautions taken.  For the benefit of the House I should say that fire belts are planted with resistant species normally in order to prevent fires which invariably commence outside of State forests through the careless burning of scrub by individual people who, in many cases, ought to know better.  There are provisions for them to do so under controlled conditions.  They are aware of those conditions but still they do it.  Apart from fire <Col N="2397" /> belts, there is the provision of fire lines and breaks, for example, protective and co-operative burning, and counter-fire and screening.  All of these are undertaken where appropriate and the forester in charge of each area is the person responsible for that.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the vast bulk of forest fires are caused by carelessness on the part of people &mdash; in most cases not done deliberately &mdash; from outside, people who tend to burn scrub.  We have had fairly substantial losses because of such carelessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalMoynihan" hpid="Mr. D. Moynihan Mr. D. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that that is not the way in which we should provide such fire belts because on the land about which we are speaking it is impossible to get any fire-fighting equipment which would prevent such fires destroying State plantations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Deputy that that is the case.  For that reason if we do provide precautions such as fire belts, fire lines and fire breaks, we should maintain them in a condition to ensure that they do the job for which they were intended.  I would accept that.</P>

      <P>Ón méid á dúirt an Teachta b'fhéidir go dtuigfí nach bhfuil tada á dhéanamh ar son na n-oileán. Chomh fada agus a bhaineann leis na hoileáin Gaeltachta, tá a gcúram ormsa, agus go deimhin tá áiseanna á gcur ar fáil agus curtha ar fáil dóibh agamsa agus ag daoine a chuaigh romham.  Tá áis farantóireachta, cuir i gcás ag Oileán Cléire, ag Oileán Árainn agus ag Arann Mhór. Tá áiseanna cé agus áiseanna bád ansin. Maidir leis an méid a dúirt sé faoi a lán Ranna a bhfuil baint acu le forbairt na n-oiléan agus maidir leis na háiseanna atá á gcur ar fáil tá sé sin fíor, ach is cuma céard a dheineann tú, dá mbeadh, fiú amháin, Aire Oileán ann, ní fhéadfadh seisean an fhorbairt seo a dhéanamh gan dul ar ais chuig Ranna eile, mar is acu siúd atá na daoine leis na hoibreacha a chur i bhfeidhm.  Chuir an Teachta Molloy iontas orm, fear a bhfuil taithí aige ar an Teach seo agus ar Ranna Stáit, mar iar-Aire, ag rá dá mbeadh coiste le déileáil leis go mbeadh chuile rud déanta. Ní féidir é sin a dhéanamh gan teangmháil agus gan tagairt do Ranna Stáit eile a bhfuil cúramaí faoi leith orthu.  Cuir i gcás córas uisce séarachais san Roinn Comhshaoil, an bhfuil an Teachta ag rá go mba cheart coiste a chur ar bun agus na cumhachtaí iomlána atá scaipthe thart ar fud Ranna faoi láthair a chur isteach sa choiste sin agus ligint dóibh an job a dhéanamh?  Má tá sé sin á mholadh cén chaoi is féidir é a dhéanamh?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for Agriculture if he would make up the shortfall resulting from the fact that the EC are withholding £3 million in payments due to Ireland for the month of December 1984, if he will allow various schemes to continue at their present level of subsidisation, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Community law it would be illegal for me to make up any shortfall in EC funds due to Ireland in the coming months.  Due to Community budgetary constraints the Commission have reduced by 20 per cent the advances for December for Ireland in common with other member states.  This reduction will result in a shortfall for Ireland of some £15 million to £20 million.  Where possible payments in full will continue to be made to farmers in respect of various schemes, but payments to traders and other producers of export refunds etc. may have to be reduced having regard to the level of available funds.  The actual amount available will not be known until later this month.</P>

      <P>I regret that due to unreasonable pressure of time an important question like that raised by Deputy Walsh had to be dealt with in this way.  I also regret that because of the Government's failure to present this kind of legislation earlier we have to rush through the debate and do less than justice to the presentation of the case and the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from what the Minister acknowledged before we adjourned that this unprecedented situation &mdash; and I insist on calling it that &mdash; arises because of the direct intervention of the Minister for Finance in trying to ensure that the Central Bank would not operate independently as required under the Currency Act, 1971.  The Minister has acknowledged &mdash; and one must give marks for honesty &mdash; that he has been in direct contact with the Central Bank and as a consequence of that direct contact we find ourselves in this extraordinary and unacceptable situation, where this House <Col N="2460" /> is being asked to pass emergency legislation which in our opinion should be of limited duration, for that and other reasons.  We are not satisfied to give the Minister, who is the direct cause of this extraordinary situation, unusual and exceptional powers under this Bill which when passed into law will be a permanent feature of our legislation.  Having regard to the circumstances we could not in all conscience give the Minister the power he seeks under section 2 which we are trying to amend.  Under the Bill as drafted it all depends on when the Minister is satisfied and on special circumstances of a temporary nature.  I do not have the time in 30 minutes to go into all the gaps in that type of general provision but under this Bill the Minister can take unto himself these exceptional and unprecedented powers.  For instance, he would be able to delegate any institution to act.  That we cannot accept.</P>
    <P>Everybody wants a return to the normal role discharged by the Central Bank, which is a very special and crucial role in monetary control and regulations, and the Minister would be the last person to deny that.  It is because we want a return to that normality that we are not prepared to legislate permanently for a situation which would suggest that on any occasion the Minister sees fit, and on his own terms, he can implement this type of legislation.  He might say that neither he nor his successor would do this frivolously, but the chances are that in the near future the Minister's successor will be faced with this situation rather than the Minister.  Nevertheless, I do not want to see any Minister taking unto himself the type of authority in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that these powers are outside the normal function of the Minister for Finance of the day. There is no point in pretending otherwise. They are not to be found in the normal discharge of his duty, although he may see it necessary now because of circumstances he has created by intervening directly in what would have been normal consultation with the staff associations and the management of the Central Bank.  This Bill will merely ensure <Col N="2461" /> that the national accounting system will not collapse.  Payments in and out of the Exchequer on a global basis will be pursued. That is the only effective exercise which will result from this.  One could say the national accounting system must be protected from total collapse and to that extent we are in agreement.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we do not have time to discuss the matter in detail but it is clear that the Minister cannot, in the circumstances of the ineffectiveness of the Central Bank due to this dispute, comply with the provisions of the 1886 Act.  This Bill is clearly an attempt to get around that. The Minister said that this is not interfering with the statutory function of the Central Bank&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister's original statement to the House was far too brief.  There was no explanation of each section beyond a brief synopsis.  I will outline some of these implications.  While this situation persists, there is no way in which anything other than global transactions can be recorded or dealt with.  There is no facility for detailed control, monitoring or regulation of the national accounts in the manner in which the Central Bank discharges its responsibilities statutorily.  I challenge the Minister to tell me that as long as this condition persists there is such a facility to regulate in detail and to check and control as is normally the case.  We are now putting up with and accepting global transactions in and out of the account.  The Minister said that in a sense the Central Bank are operating normally outside the Exchequer accounting area.  There is no detailed control effective through the Central Bank and the Minister knows this.  There is no point in trying to fool the public in this regard. For as long as this situation persists transactions through the Central Bank will be minimal.  The Minister is asking us to treat this as being a condition which we should sanction under permanent legislation. That cannot be acceptable.  We <Col N="2462" /> should be able to argue this for days to test our capacity to put the questions and to test the Minister's capacity to reply.</P>

      <P>Within the next few days payment is due on the 46,000 dividends on records which normally are held by the Central Bank on the 6 per cent Exchequer stock 1982-85.  On December 15 the 9 per cent Exchequer stock of 1987 will fall due and also the 7 per cent National Loan of 1987-92.  Through December and January there will be a list of matters in respect of which there can be no detailed control or check at present.</P>

      <P>That is the point.  The Minister said that the other statutory functions of the Central Bank are not affected, but the truth is that the Central Bank cannot discharge their main function as long as this condition persists. There is no point in pretending otherwise. I do not think we have time to press both our amendments but we certainly want to press this one, that this Bill will have only the minimum possible period. Three months up to the end of March should be adequate.  If it is necessary to continue it, let the Government come back here and ask the House to pass legislation for a limited period of three months and no longer.  This is not the kind of legislation which we can leave on the Statute Book <i>secula saeculorum</i> on the basis that a computer facility might break down some time.</P>

      <P>I made my arguments this morning in my brief Second Stage speech but I hope the Minister will at least mention that I asked him to consider this amendment.  I cannot see why he should not allow this legislation to lapse at the end of March and, if necessary, to re-enact it later on.  The Minister mentioned a breakdown in the computer facility. Obviously nobody told him that <Col N="2463" /> Government accounts are not on computer but are manual.</P>

      <P>What is the Minister saying?  Why should the Minister need legislation for a computer facility to deal with something that is not on a computer? If the workers are not there to deal manually with a certain matter you do not need a computer to do it.  The accounts are manual so the computer could not break down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave an example in my speech of another kind of eventuality in which measures of this kind might be necessary.  I was not in anyway referring to any part of the Central Bank's operations either on computer or manually.  It was just to illustrate the problem and difficulty to which Deputy O'Kennedy referred a few minutes ago regarding the payment of interest on dividends and redemptions.  That operation is all on computer, so that is one part of the bank's operation in which there might be a difficulty. There may also be others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is to deal with the Exchequer accounts.  The Minister has already admitted that in the other matters for which the Central Bank are responsible nothing has happened. There is no staff in there.  This legislation is being brought in to protect the Government accounts.  The Minister said he needed a computer, that this legislation might be needed in the future because the computer might break down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to become involved in arguments, but there is no computer.  The Minister also said that many of the functions carried on by the Central Bank on a day to day basis are delegated for reasons of convenience. The Central Bank, as I understood it, are independent of Government.  They were set up as a separate entity so that certain controls could be effected.  If there were a wild and mad Government, these controls would be available.  This Bill clearly would take away these functions.  If these functions are there as a matter of convenience, this applies everywhere else in the world.  I do not see why the Minister made that point.</P>
      <P>It is commonly known that there is not sufficient money available to make the double week payment to social welfare recipients.  That should be paid this week, I understand.  It probably will be easier to appeal to the staff of the Central Bank than to the Government to try to cooperate in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked a question before lunch to which the Minister kindly replied.  However, I should like to put on the record of the House that the Central Bank have been consulted and that the Government and the board have been fully involved in the drafting of this legislation.  My colleague has made quite clear that the surveillance of the Central Bank and the various banking supervision schemes and monetary credit policies are not being carried out at the moment.  These sections are not in operation and this Bill does not cover those matters.  Finally, it would be far easier for everybody if the Minister's colleague, the Minister for the Public Service, could take part in this debate.  I thank the Minister for admitting that there has been intervention by the Government.  That is why we are here today discussing this Bill.  If there were <Col N="2465" /> negotiations at a meaningful level involving the Ministers for the Public Service and for Labour, that would be a great help.  We have co-operated all day but not once did these two Ministers or the Ministers of State come into the House to listen to what the Minister for Finance had to say or to what we have had to say in return.</P>

      <P>Obviously, they are not too concerned.  It is a hard handed, unreasonable attitude which is getting nobody anywhere.  At this, our last opportunity of debating this Bill which is being unfairly rushed through, with even more limited notice than that given to other less important Bills, the Ministers have refused to deal with a very serious matter in any way other than by legislation. It would have been much easier &mdash; and still is &mdash; to talk to the ASTMS, whose staff members are responsible people who look after the interests of this State very adequately, rather than go through with this type of legislation. These people are not irresponsible and they have proved that by helping out the Department of Social Welfare who are now desperately trying to get £30 million to pay social welfare recipients.  The Minister for the Public Service must show equal responsibility and talk with these people very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We all want to get this matter cleared up.  I am sure the Minister does not want the country to be in this extraordinary position.  Agreements were made, for example, with regard to the Trusteee Savings Banks and the associated banks.  Why should the Government take this unique intervention position with regard to the Central Bank staff when they see all the consequences which we now have to tolerate? What about the superisory role of the Central Bank over the associated banks? Who is going to supervise them?  This is because the Government chose in this instance to use a very blunt instrument <Col N="2466" /> indeed.  They are not even being consistent. Staff at some levels in the Central Bank are, apparently, being allowed to go through the normal channels and have been allowed increases in line with the normal conciliation procedures.  The whole basis of our monetary control, internal and external, is totally out of line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clear up a few points for me on Committee Stage?  I understood him to say that he had no access to the register of payments because it was in the Central Bank.  I take it that was because there were no staff there, that the Minister could not, as it were, get his hands on the documents.  Assuming that is the reason, who then specifically is carrying out the functions that the Minister said this morning were not interfered with, such as the monitoring of the key indices of the banks, the watching of the liquidity ratios, dealing with the other statutory functions of the bank, currency regulation and so on, supply and distribution of currency?  For the same reason as the Minister cannot get at the register in the Central Bank, I assume that the Central Bank cannot carry on these functions. Without naming the actual individual but getting as close as possible to it, could the Minister say who specifically is carrying out these functions?  I responded to a challenge from Deputy Kelly to make a specific suggestion as to how we might handle this situation.</P>

It says that the Labour Court may intervene in the national interest. This is clearly the case now and I ask the Minister if his Government feel that they can ask the Labour Court to use section 18 of the 1976 Act to help in resolving the difficulties.

It is alleged that I am preventing the Central Bank from acting independently; I am not.  I am not interfering in this Bill with any of the statutory functions of that bank.

    <Title>Whiddy Oil Terminal: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there are statements on the Whiddy project.  These statements will be made under Standing Order No. 38.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>As is obvious from the media reports during the past 24 hours, I was pleased to be able to announce last evening that the Whiddy terminal is being restored at an early date.  The estimated project cost is $60 million.  I am informed by Gulf Oil that there will be an estimated 250 jobs in the construction phase and that the bulk of these will be available to Irish people.</P>
      <P>I arranged for copies of my media statement to be made available in the Library of the Oireachtas promptly at time of issue.  I am happy, however, to avail myself of the opportunity to summarise the details of the package here in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is known that there have been protracted negotiations with Gulf Oil over a period of several years on this question. I saw it as an important priority to bring those negotiations to an early conclusion and I think I can justifiably claim that this <Col N="2473" /> has now been achieved with considerable success.  There are a number of ingredients in the package and I propose to mention them briefly.</P>
    <P>The jetty will be rebuilt to handle tankers from 30,000 tonnes up to 275,000 tonnes.  The original jetty could take tankers up to about 350,000 tonnes but I am advised and accept that there is not now much demand for that type of facility. As I mentioned already, this project is estimated to cost $60 million.</P>
    <P>The facilities of the terminal will be upgraded to handle petroleum products as distinct from crude oil.  Gulf have given a commitment to upgrade for middle distillates, mainly gas oil diesel and kerosene, at a cost of $2 million to $3 million. They will also include petrol provided this can be done safely and that the cost is not exhorbitant relative to the cost of the rest of the project.</P>
    <P>Gulf will provide strategic stocks at a minimum level of 160,000 barrels.  They will increase this at a rate of 80,000 barrels for each tank beyond the first two brought into active service.  Members will be aware that there are 12 tanks in all. Two tanks of a total capacity of 1.17 million barrels will be at the disposal of the State free of storage charges indefinitely. There is a commitment that any oil which is in the terminal when an emergency is declared and which is owned by Gulf or any of its affiliates may, at the option of the Minister for Energy of the day, be included in the strategic reserves of the State.  Furthermore &mdash; and this is a very important point &mdash; if any of these strategic reserves have to be drawn down they will be paid for at defined pre-crisis prices.  There was no such provision in the former agreement on strategic stocks and there was in fact a very real possibility that stocks drawn down would have to be paid for at crisis prices.  This would be effectively little better than having to buy on the open market at crisis prices.</P>
    <P>I know that I am open to the charge that I gave away the existing one million barrels stocks.  The clear advice available to me is that there had been grave doubts as to whether that arrangement was enforceable since 1979 in the context of <Col N="2474" /> an unoperational terminal.  A one million barrel commitment is not a particularly onerous burden in a terminal which is operating at a high throughput but in the situation which has existed for the past six years it was a very heavy burden indeed.  The original arrangement was for one seventh of the terminal.  After the 160,000 barrel minimum the new arrangement is <i>pro rata,</i> in that it gives one-seventh of each tank in use.  When taken in the context of the wider features of the package I think this has to be seen as a reasonable and business-like approach.</P>
    <P>The oil existing at present in the terminal is being offered to the State at a discount.  If, for whatever reason &mdash; and there are some related to quality &mdash; the oil itself is unattractive to the State, then there will be a prompt payment of $1 million dollars in lieu of the discount.  The arrangement includes provision for an additional unconditional payment of $1 million to the State.</P>
    <P>The terminal will be brought into interim operation at an early date if technically safe and feasible.  The target date for completion of the project is end of 1986 and the project will be subjected to rigorous examination from the point of view of safety, bearing in mind the findings of the Costello tribunal and the current &ldquo;state-of-the-art&rdquo; internationally. In other words, it will be to the highest standards and will be vetted in accordance with dangerous substances regulations, oil jetty regulations, fire safety and environmental aspects.</P>
    <P>Gulf have given me a commitment that they will employ Irish citizens and use Irish goods where feasible in the project. I particularly welcomed this policy statement from them.</P>
    <P>I want to briefly mention a few other points.  When the terminal is back in operation Gulf will be increasing their own workforce and the usual service jobs will come back into place giving a total of about 100 permanent jobs.  Lest I mislead the House and the people of the locality I want to make it clear that this number includes the existing 38 employees on Gulf's payroll.  Gulf have been taken over <Col N="2475" /> internationally by Chevron, possibly subject to the ironing out of a few details in relation to their joint operation within the United States, and performance under this deal is being guaranteed by Chevron.  I acknowledge that there is litigation pending in the UK High Court between Gulf and other parties arising from the <i>Betelgeuese</i> accident and I want to say that this deal stands independent of that litigation.</P>
    <P>I have already been asked two questions outside the House which I wish to deal with briefly.  There is no cost to the State arising out of this package and there is no offset under any other policy area.</P>
    <P>Finally, preliminary indications available to me indicate that, subject to satisfaction on the question of safety and the environment which I have dealt with earlier, the announcement has been generally welcomed in the part of the country directly concerned, that is, Bantry and its surrounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Full utilisation of the facilities at Whiddy has always been supported by me and by Fianna Fáil in general. Since the unfortunate accident there in January 1979 I have made many demands for the reconstruction of the jetty.  Irrespective of whether the Government or an international organisation carry out the work, we support in principle the need to have the facility fully operational.  I welcome the job creation potential both in terms of the construction work and of a permanent operating staff.  We welcome this aspect particularly for the Cork area which we know only too well has been decimated by the actions of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I must be sceptical of the projected completion date and of the estimated cost having regard to the inevitable delays that will be encountered in respect of the redesign and planning application.  We are putting the Minister on notice that we will insist on the closest scrutiny of the safety factors to be incorporated in the new design.  We will be demanding that the recommendations of the Costello tribunal report, which at the <Col N="2476" /> time of its publication was the subject of international tributes, are strictly complied with.  I am conscious of the fact that the Government are waiving the existing legal obligations of the Gulf Oil people in relation to restoring the terminal to its original state.  A new situation is thereby being created.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled, to say the least, that the Minister can point with confidence to an expenditure of $60 million having regard to all the unknown factors involved in the new design, in planning permission and to all the delays that are inevitable.  I am sceptical also as to the projection that the work will be completed by the end of 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>One must be sceptical. This is a well hyped-up announcement. These are some of the areas in respect of which questions must be asked and answered before this matter is concluded. On behalf of this party, on behalf of the House and on behalf of the people in general I am requesting that the memorandum of understanding be put before the House and be made available in the Library and that the final agreement also be put before the House so that we can have full details of what is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Deputy did not take the steps we are taking when he had the opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the bad record of the Department of Energy in the matter of memoranda of understanding.  We all recall the memorandum of understanding that was drawn up by that Department in respect of the natural gas deal with Northern Ireland and with the British Government.  During a period of 18 months we were all assured <Col N="2477" /> that everything would be in order, but that proved to be incorrect and finally we realised &mdash; though some of us knew all the time &mdash; the extent of the good relationship that existed between our Government and the British Government.</P>
      <P>The details of the memorandum of understanding and of the final agreement must be exposed fully in order to ensure that the nation's strategic oil reserves are protected fully.  There must be no back-room deals in this matter, deals of a kind that would jeopardise the country's access to emergency supplies.  Again, I am putting the Minister on notice that we need an immediate answer as to what the position is to be in relation to our strategic reserves when this operation begins.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to talk about a minimum of 160,000 barrels by way of strategic stocks, increasing by 80,000 barrels per tank beyond the first two when the project is in operation. The Minister then told us something we knew already, that there are 12 tanks there.  There are one million barrels of oil there at the moment.  That forms part of our strategic national reserve, but what is to happen when the reconstruction work begins?  Are these stocks to be moved out in advance and, if so, what guarantee can the Government give the country that our reserves are stocked elsewhere?  It is not good enough to come here with a confusing statement about 160,000 barrels with an increase of 80,000 barrels per tank.  We do not know when that situation will come into existence but we must know where the one million barrels are to be placed.  In saying that he would probably be accused of giving the stocks away, the Minister left himself open to just that accusation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To turn now to a broader question, that is, the timing of this announcement, as we are only too well aware, negotiations in this matter have been going on for a considerable amount of time with the Gulf-Chevron Corporation involving Atlantic Resources and Union Oil.  Is there a direct connection between the deal being worked out now and one that is perhaps half baked but which may be <Col N="2478" /> ready for presentation during the Christmas recess?  That is a logical question when one has regard to the oversupply situation in the world so far as oil is concerned.  One is led to be suspicious and apprehensive of the Gulf-Chevron Group.  Not long ago Chevron purchased Gulf for $13 billion.  We must ask why they should be so forthcoming at this point in engaging in expenditure which one of their representatives said on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today is not essential to their operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of good negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a direct connection? We are aware that discussions are taking place on an early production system for the oil that has been found by the same group in the Celtic Sea.  We must have regard also the fixed taxation terms which the Minister of State at the Department of Energy said two or three weeks ago would be available in a week or two from then.  So far these have not materialised.  We fix our taxation terms and put them on the table.  Why is this one coming now and no sign of the other? Will we hear about it after the Christmas recess or during the Christmas recess or can we have a guarantee that all the relevant factors and all the information will be out on the table?  In view of what I have said is there a <i>quid pro quo</i> in this situation with regard to the companies concerned?  What will be the position down there when this operation is rebuilt? Will there be a proper port authority for Bantry?</P>

      <P>I know that Deputy Sheehan would not be in the least interested if the oil terms and taxation terms were waived in order to get badly needed employment in Cork, but what price is being paid for this?  Is there a <i>quid pro quo</i>?  Has a deal been done in the back-room? We welcome the whole operation in principle but the Minister was far from forthcoming in his statement.  The oil is being offered to the Government at a discount price of $2 million.  About two or three years ago that oil was on offer for a much larger discount.  I am always sceptical about the carrot being offered, the carrot being the sprat to catch the salmon.  With my knowledge of the operation there I feel that this offer does not add up.  This oil terminal was put on offer to me at the end of my short term as Minister for Industry and Energy for a nil figure.  I was not prepared to take it because I felt the Gulf Oil people were getting out from under their existing obligations far too lightly.  If they had offered me a contribution of £15 to £20 million dollars I was prepared to consider it.  In view of the known facts the discount is miserly.  There is no reason why it should be so small.  There is no reason in a hard <Col N="2480" /> business world for the Gulf people and the Chevron people to be so oncoming at a time when they do not have to spend the money, when operations do not demand this type of expenditure.  We want answers to those questions.  Has another deal been done?  If so the people and the House should know about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone concerned about the unemployment problem in Cork and elsewhere must welcome the project that has been announced by the Minister.  It is a pleasure to be able to welcome the provision of new jobs.  Far too often we are decrying the fact that jobs have been lost or have not been created.  This project will provide badly needed jobs in the Cork area during its construction and during its operation.</P>
      <P>I understand that this is a memorandum of understanding.  What legal standing has this memorandum?  Are Chevron in a position to back out of that agreement if they choose to do so as happened on a previous occasion with the natural gas deal with Northern Ireland? There is also a need to ensure that a port authority is established in the area.  The Minister's statement did not refer to that at all.  The Minister referred to the project being subject to rigorous examination bearing in mind the findings of the Costello tribunal.  There is no specific commitment towards establishing a harbour authority before this project gets under way.  There is no specific commitment as to how the recommendations of the Costello inquiry will be implemented. Apart from the construction of the project to the highest possible standards there is also the need to ensure maintenance to the highest possible safety and environmental standards once the project is in full operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious from what the Minister said that the provision of this storage capacity will be very useful from a strategic point of view but it will have little if any impact on our general energy requirements.  We are importing in the region of £1,000 million worth of oil per annum at the moment and the cost is <Col N="2481" /> increasing.  There is little prospect of significant industrial development here until we tackle the huge differential between our energy costs and those in the rest of Europe.  The differential is something in the region of 10 to 15 per cent and we are on the wrong side of it.  It is important that some steps be taken to free ourselves from our dependence for our oil supplies on the multi-nationals.  There is an opportunity here for the Minister in his negotiations with Chevron to put pressure on them to join with the State in bringing ashore the oil from the Celtic Sea which is estimated to run at the rate of around 10,000 barrels per day.  This in multinational terms is small but in terms of its effects on our energy requirements it would be quite significant.  It would presumably be necessary to upgrade the Whitegate oil refinery to take full advantage of that oil.  There could also be a place for an additional refinery which would be expensive but which would have a significant impact on our long term industrial development.  It must be obvious to most people that the sooner we can refine most of our oil the sooner we will be in a position to free ourselves from the stranglehold of the dollar on our industrial development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development but I would prefer to hear more specific commitments from the Minister regarding the establishment of a harbour authority, and special commitments in regard to maintenance, safety and conservation as legal requirements.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1984: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is designed to implement two decisions which were made by the Government in the context of the Government plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>.  The first relates to the introduction of the new social employment scheme for the long term unemployed and the second decision concerns the abolition of the intermittent unemployment insurance scheme known as the wet-time scheme.  The Bill is a fairly <Col N="2483" /> straightforward one but I trust that Deputies will have found the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill helpful in their examination of the various measures being proposed.</P>
    <P>In regard to the social employment scheme, this major new initiative will be brought into operation over the coming months by my colleague, the Minister for Labour, who will be giving an outline of the scheme in the House tomorrow.  For that reason I do not propose to go into any great detail on the scheme except to refer to the aspects of the scheme which are relevant to the proposals in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the new social employment scheme persons who have been unemployed for at least a year and who are drawing unemployment assistance will be offered part time work for two and a half days a week.  The work will last for up to 52 weeks for each person and the £70 wages under the scheme will be paid in lieu of the unemployment assistance that would normally be paid in respect of a full week.  Accordingly the savings on unemployment assistance will partially offset the cost of wages, supervision, materials and general overheads.  The wages under the scheme, like wages under any other employment, will be liable for income tax, where appropriate, and for PRSI deductions.</P>
    <P>This Bill will facilitate the introduction of the new scheme by providing for the exclusion of participants in the scheme from unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit and by setting out the PRSI arrangement for the workers concerned.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 9 of the Bill deal with the PRSI arrangements for employees under the social employment scheme. The effect of section 9 is to classify employment under the new scheme as an &ldquo;excepted employment&rdquo; for the purpose of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  This excludes the employment from normal social insurance cover. However, section 3 of the Bill provides that the employment will be insurable for occupational injuries purposes.  This is the type of insurance cover that already <Col N="2484" /> applies to employment under schemes promoted by AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency.  The intention is that the social insurance position of social employment or training schemes should be broadly similar.</P>
    <P>As employment under the new scheme will be insurable for occupational injuries benefits only, the Class J rate of employment contribution will apply instead of the normal PRSI contribution.  The Class J rate normally amounts to 3.4 per cent 0.4 per cent for the employer and 3 per cent for the employee.  The 3 per cent comprises the 1 per cent health contribution, 1 per cent youth employment contribution and the 1 per cent income levy. However, where the employee has a medical card &mdash; and it can be assumed that many participants in the social employment scheme would be holders of medical cards &mdash; the full 3.4 per cent contribution is paid by the employer.</P>
    <P>It will, of course, be open to persons employed under the social employment scheme to engage in other employment for the remainder of the week.  Depending on the hours worked and other factors, that employment could be fully insurable and this will enable the person concerned to maintain his existing insurance record and the possibility to requalify for unemployment benefit.  However, where a person does not succeed in getting insurable employment for the remainder of the week his social insurance record will be fully protected through the award of special credit contributions. These credits will substitute for the credits normally awarded when a person draws unemployment benefit or assistance and I will be making regulations for this purpose on the same lines as those already in force in respect of AnCO and youth employment trainees. Accordingly, workers in the new scheme can be assured that their social insurance records will be fully protected.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin is that participants in the social employment scheme will not be eligible to receive unemployment payments for the balance of each week that they participate in the scheme. <Col N="2485" /> To allow participants to receive unemployment payments while employed under the scheme would undermine the whole rationale of the scheme.  Sections 2 and 4 of the Bill provide that they will be disqualified for receiving unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance respectively.  As I have stated already, the scheme is being funded on the basis that participants will not be eligible to draw unemployment assistance &mdash; hence the provision in section 2 of the Bill. Participants will also be disqualified for receiving unemployment benefit through section 4 of the Bill &mdash; this is necessary because some participants could by virtue of getting fully insurable employment for the balance of the week succeed in qualifying or requalifying for unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>The new social employment scheme will I believe offer new hope to the long term unemployed and I am glad to bring forward measures in this Bill to facilitate its early introduction.  The new scheme compliments the special efforts which have already been made by this Government to improve the social welfare incomes of the long-term unemployed. Deputies will be aware that this group have received special increases in their rates of payment over the last two years. These were the 5 per cent increase granted in October 1983 and a further 1 per cent above the level of general increases in payments in July last.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the winding up of the wet-time scheme which is dealt with in sections 5 to 8 of the Bill.  Before looking at the individual sections of the Bill, I would like to give the House a general outline of the scheme and the background to the Government's decision to abolish the scheme from the beginning of the new year.</P>
    <P>The scheme was introduced in the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Act, 1942, and is now incorporated in Part V of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  It provided insurance against loss of wages due to inclement weather for manual workers in the building trade.  Prior to that, those who were normally paid by the hour, received no <Col N="2486" /> compensation for loss of earnings due to recurrent short periods of interruption of work due to bad weather and a great deal of hardship ensued.  In 1955 the scheme was extended to include manual workers in the civil engineering and painting trades.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme workers are compensated for the earnings lost in periods of inclement weather, up to a maximum of eight hours per day.  The wet-time benefit is paid by the employer and is repaid to him by the Department of Social Welfare out of the Wet-Time Fund.  To qualify for benefit, a worker must have 12 contributions paid between the beginning of the previous contribution year and the date of the stoppage of work.</P>
    <P>The hourly rates of wet-time benefit payable since 27 May 1978 are as follows:&mdash; skilled worker £0.87; unskilled worker, £0.79 and young person £0.32.</P>
    <P>The total cost of benefit payments is borne by the contributions of employers and employees which are paid into the wet-time fund.  The costs of administration, however, are borne by the Department of Social Welfare.  There is a separate weekly wet-time contribution distinct from the PRSI contribution and payable in equal shares by workers and employers in the industries concerned by means of stamps affixed to or impressed on wet-time books which are issued at employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>Contribution rates have been adjusted periodically over the years to ensure that the fund is adequate to discharge its liabilities. The current contribution rates are:</P>

    <P>The original objective of the wet-time scheme was to compensate workers in the building trade for loss of wages due to unemployment caused by bad weather. This was certainly a valid objective at a time when no other form of compensation for such a loss existed.  However, <Col N="2487" /> improvements in the conditions of employment of the workers concerned have meant that there is no longer any loss of wages because of unfavourable weather.</P>
    <P>Under an agreement dated 1 June 1966, which was registered under section 28 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, with the Labour Court, the Construction Industry Federation and Trade Unions agreed that the working week would be 40 hours.  The agreement also provided that a worker who kept himself available for work throughout the normal working hours of each working day of the week but who had been prevented from working due to inclement weather during any part of that week was entitled to payment of not less than 32 times the hourly rate applicable to him.  This became known as the guaranteed week.</P>
    <P>At that time I was very much involved in the negotiations on that question.  A great deal of work was done by the construction industry workers and the trade union officials, notably by colleagues, such as the late Leo Crawford, who were instrumental in ensuring the implementation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>By a further agreement which became effective from 1 November 1980 the guaranteed week is now 40 hours.  A worker in this industry, therefore, is paid for a full 40 hours regardless of any time lost because of any weather and the consequent loss of wages which is part of the definition of &ldquo;intermittent unemployment&rdquo; no longer applies.  The existence of the guaranteed working week in the building industry is the main reason for the Government's decision to abolish the scheme.</P>
    <P>In practice what happens at present is that where a stoppage of work occurs due to bad weather, the employer pays the full wage in respect of the guaranteed 40 hours and subsequently recovers from the wet-time fund the amount of any wet-time benefit due.  In effect, therefore, the wet-time benefit partially subsidises employers in implementing the 40 hour week to the extent that it is 50 per cent <Col N="2488" /> financed by the employees.  This subsidy costs employees over £0.5 million a year.</P>
    <P>Another factor in the decision to abolish the scheme was that the administration of the scheme in recent years has given rise to a great deal of difficulty and my Department meet with a great deal of reluctance on the part of both employers and workers to comply with the provisions of the scheme.  This adds considerably to the administration costs of the scheme.  Abolition of the scheme will relieve the Exchequer of the cost of the staff of the wet-time section in my Department.  In addition there are costs with regard to social welfare officers, employment exchange and accounts branch personnel, post office charges, etc., which are not precisely quantifiable. The termination of a scheme which no longer fulfils an effective role is all the more important in present circumstances when a central objective of Government policy is to reduce public expenditure.</P>
    <P>A further consideration in the Government's decision to abolish the scheme is that the fund from which benefit is paid was intended to be self-sufficient. There is no provision for any Exchequer subsidy to meet a deficiency in the fund.  The only assistance which can be provided by the State in such an event is to lend the necessary moneys to the fund and these must be repaid with interest.  It is now apparent that the fund will not continue to remain solvent beyond the end of the year.  To maintain solvency it would be necessary to increase the contribution rates substantially &mdash; by about 30 per cent &mdash; even to maintain present benefit rates.</P>
    <P>Benefit rates were normally maintained at approximately 60 per cent of hourly wage rates in order that a worker affected by stoppages due to bad weather would not suffer any significant reduction in his take-home pay.  However, these rates have not been increased since May 1978 with the result that they are now equal to only about 30 per cent of wage rates.  To bring the rates of benefit into line with wage rates would require further significant increases in contributions and I do not imagine that the workers would <Col N="2489" /> be willing to pay their share of the increased contribution rates with no benefit to themselves.  This is another argument in favour of winding up the scheme at this stage.</P>
    <P>I will now briefly refer to the individual sections of the Bill which give effect to the Government's decision to abolish the scheme.  Section 5 substitutes a new definition of &ldquo;intermittent unemployment&rdquo; the effect of which is that payments of wet-time benefit will not be made for any periods of work stoppage occurring after 6 January 1985.  Section 6 provides that contributions under the scheme will cease to be payable after 6 January 1985.  This coincides with the end of the contribution year under the scheme.  Section 7 provides that applications from employers for repayments of wet-time benefit may be made to my Department up to 29 March 1985.  This should give employers ample time to submit any outstanding claims.</P>
    <P>It is likely that there will be insufficient assets in the wet-time fund in 1985 to meet the cost of outstanding claims and section 8 of the Bill provides that any deficit will be met through an Exchequer grant to the fund.  It is estimated that the short-fall could be of the order of £0.5 million and provision for this sum has been made by Government decision in my Department's Estimate for 1985.</P>
    <P>In present day circumstances it is particularly important to identify the priorities among our social objectives and indeed to question whether some of the original objectives are still entirely valid.  The introduction of the new social employment scheme, which is facilitated by this Bill indicates the priority which the Government attach to relieving the appalling plight of the tens of thousands of long-term unemployed.  Likewise the abolition of the wet-time scheme is evidence of the Government's resolve to eradicate unnecessary and wasteful public expenditure at present so that resources can be freed to help the most needy sectors of our community.</P>
    <P>Accordingly I commend this Bill to the House for favourable consideration.  I am <Col N="2490" /> hopeful it will have a relatively speedy passage.</P>
    <P>I want to apologise to my Opposition colleague for the haste with which the Bill was introduced.  I have had difficulty with a good deal of social welfare legislation in the past two or three months, in having a Bill drafted and cleared by Government.  At present there is a substantial log jam of a very large volume of legislation, including an exceptionally large volume in my Department, both in regard to social welfare and health.  I want to thank Deputy McCarthy for having agreed to receive the Bill on Monday last which I know placed him in considerable difficulty in regard to his response at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister has endeavoured to explain to us why this Bill was presented to us in such unseemly haste, having been presented, as it was, for the first time on Monday last.  It appears to us as if this constitutes an attempt to rush it through with undue haste and has rendered things more difficult for us in our preparation for it, in our consultations with one another but I do accept the Minister's attempted explanation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the introduction of part time employment for those who have been in receipt of long term unemployment benefit or assistance for over a year, who will now be enabled, on a voluntary basis, to obtain part time employment for two-and-a-half days a week and be paid for that &mdash; losing their benefit or assistance &mdash; it is unlikely that the figure advanced by the Minister of 10,000 people benefiting from its provisions will come to fruition.  I would contend that that is certainly over-optimistic. I would hope that such numbers would avail of its provisions.  Members on this side of the House would support anything that would help to reduce the numbers on the live register, whether they be in receipt of benefit or assistance.  We would support anything the Government would do which was fair and logical to reduce those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2491" /> This would appear to be a slightly gimmicky type of scheme which might appear attractive from a publicity point of view, but whether it will achieve its desired effect is another question which only time will tell.  Of course it would be ideal if a lot of people did reap its benefits because the type of work in which they would engage would be non-profit-making, probably community-type work.  More than likely their employers would be comprised of local authorities and other such bodies, including voluntary bodies. Indeed that type of community work might help to bring about an improvement in the face of our countryside and towns, giving us a cleaner image as a nation which in itself would be a good thing and something about which tourists have complained consistently.</P>
    <P>I am led to believe that this scheme will be financed by the Department of Labour.  It has not been brought to our attention but it should be noted that its funding will be provided by the Department of Labour while, at the same time, the Department of the Environment will lose their youth employment grant schemes.  I do not think there has been any allowance given for such schemes in the Book of Estimates for next year. Therefore, in a sense, this scheme will constitute a replacement thereof.</P>
    <P>The Government should have taken more positive action in relation to the whole concept of unemployment tackling its real basics.  I might add a note of warning to the Minister and the Government with regard to possible dangers inherent in the implementation of this scheme, that is that people who engage in this part time, two-and-a-half days work, may take up other employment which will be taxable.  It will be very difficult then to explain to other people in receipt of short term unemployment benefits &mdash; that is under 12 months duration, people who would not be eligible for the benefits &mdash; of this scheme &mdash; that they would not be entitled to engage in the same type of work while receiving their unemployment benefits.  They might feel that they had open licence to do the same as their <Col N="2492" /> counterparts in receipt of long term unemployment benefit or assistance and, if and when it was discovered that, by so doing, they were in breach of the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, they might well feel they were being hard done by. I am not in any way condoning such practice. I am merely adding a word of warning lest it had not occurred to the Minister and his advisers.</P>
    <P>If one is talking about unemployment then one must realise that one must examine its broad, overall concept and what must be done in order to reach a solution.  Any such concept has been totally omitted from this crazy document, the national plan, which all of us on this side of the House are sick looking at.  It is about time it was put in the dustbin.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister convince the people in Mayo when he went down there because I gather only ten or 12 people turned up?  There were not too many in Cashel anyway.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because that is what has happened and Deputy Kenny is chirping up there as if the whole problem of unemployment had been solved through the provisions of this Bill.  We have now reached the rather sad stage when there are approximately 217,000 people on the live register rapidly advancing toward the 250,000 mark.  It appears that no real attempt is being made to stem the tide.  In fact, if we refer to November we will see that the projection for that month was that unemployment would increase by 2,400, but in fact the number of people who lost their jobs in that month was more than 4,500.  It must <Col N="2493" /> be remembered that many of the projections in the Government's book on unreality are based on such figures.  In the case of the month of November Government projections were 50 per cent out.</P>
      <P>It is sad that the Government are not making a more positive attempt on the broad aspects of economic policies to try to stem this tide.  Every additional 1,000 people on social welfare benefits cost the country in the region of £2,500,000 annually. Sadly most of our young people have little hope of obtaining employment.  The Government, aided and abetted by their national handlers, the propaganda merchants who remain in the background, consistently flood the media with false promises of what will take place.  Approximately 70,000 young people are listed as officially unemployed but that is not a true position because the figure does not take into account the number of people who are not on the live register.  When discussing the problem of unemployment one must carefully quantify and analyse it and, for a start, the figures must be correct.  I have no doubt that 12,000 to 14,000 young people who live at home with their parents and who because of the means test are disqualified from obtaining unemployment assistance are not included in the figure quoted.  Those young people are unemployed and many of them do not have any hope of obtaining employment.</P>
      <P>How many thousands of young people are engaged in training courses?  How many young people have decided because the outlook is so bad to remain at school for a further year?  Those young people are better off at school rather than sitting at home.  Many of them have lost all hope of obtaining a job.  Such people have not been included in the so-called real figure of young people unemployed.  I am sure that the number of unemployed young people is near 100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By their policies the Government have done inestimable damage to the possibilities of job creation.  Their policy of cutting back on the capital development programme has had severe repercussions in the construction industry.  That industry is very labour intensive and <Col N="2494" /> down the years it has provided thousands of jobs, but the cutbacks in the capital development programme have done a lot of damage to it.  The Government are obsessed with economics.  They could be called a computerised Government because they are not concerned about people but about figures, pseudo-economists because on occasions they get their figures wrong.  It is not so long since the Minister for Finance showed that he was not able to add properly.  A short time later the Minister for Agriculture showed that he was not able to add properly. In their own speciality they have failed to be exact and have made many mistakes.  Is it any wonder when they failed to give the correct projections in their speciality that they have failed badly in the areas about which they do not have much knowledge?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the problems of taxation and unemployment are inextricably intertwined.  According to the book on unreality the basic taxation problems which affect employees and employers will not be altered to any great degree until 1987, if the Government are still in power.  It is my view that they will be packing their bags and polishing their boots very shortly.  If we are to believe that document there will not be any attempt by the Government to reduce taxation because their commitment is not to increase taxation.  That is not good enough in a country where the taxation increase last year was the highest in the European Community.  We have the highest rate of indirect taxation and the second highest personal taxation rate in the EC.  That militates against job creation. Workers do not have any incentive to continue working.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant.  I am trying to help the Minister because he and his colleagues, who think they have solved the problem, have left out a lot. With my colleagues I am trying to put them back on the right road.  We will do <Col N="2495" /> everything possible to assist the Minister and his colleagues on that road.  There is no incentive for employees to continue working because of the rate of taxation. On the other hand there is no incentive for employers to create jobs because of the tax structure.  Let us be honest, no employer, native or foreign, expands his business purely for the purpose of creating jobs.  Such people expand because they believe they will make a fair and reasonable profit.  However, if they feel that the profit will be eaten into to a great extent by the Government's crazy taxation policy they will not expand their business.  Therefore one of the major incentives to job creation is removed unless this job is tackled.</P>
      <P>When speaking about the first part of the Bill the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The new scheme complements the special efforts which have already been made by this Government to improve social welfare incomes of the long term unemployed.</P>
      <P>I am amazed at that because of our Private Members' motion.  We have shown that the Minister will savagely reduce the incomes of many of those on long term unemployment benefits because of the way he is going to implement the EC directive.  I will deal with this on another occasion and we will try to get the Minister to see the light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view what the Minister said today is hypocrisy.  What have the Government done for the long term unemployed?  They have halved the food subsidies, which is affecting these families very badly and many children are hungry.  For the first time ever the Government have refused to give these people the double payment at Christmas. I appeal to the Minister to change his mind even now, because it is not too late.  Everybody needs something extra at Christmas, particularly children.  Also for the first time the unemployed have been excluded from the free fuel scheme.  This has been written specifically into the memorandum sent by the Department to the social welfare investigating officers. <Col N="2496" /> The Minister said that when the food subsidies were halved the family income supplement would make up for any loss which might result, but again the unemployed have been specifically excluded from claiming this supplement.  What the Minister has said here today about helping the unemployed and those in receipt of long term social welfare benefits is wrong and misleading.</P>
    <P>In the second part of the Bill, which deals with the abolition of the wet-time scheme, I would like to protest at the way this has been done.  It has been done with unseemly haste and without any consultation with those involved in the construction industry.  It is unjust to abolish this scheme without consultation.  The inference that the unions were making great demands for the abolition of this scheme is not true, and it is misleading to pretend that there has been great clamour from the unions.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with representatives of the joint industrial council of the construction industry on 26 October 1978, the then Minister for Social Welfare agreed to a suggestion by the trade unions, supported by the employers' representative, that a committee be set up to review the operations of the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Act, or wet time scheme as it became more generally known, and to make representations regarding any amendments deemed necessary.  A member of the staff of the Department of Social Welfare was made chairman of that committee.  It is only right that I go into the reasons for the wet time scheme.</P>
    <P>This scheme was introduced by the late Seán Lemass in 1942 to provide insurance against loss of wages due to inclement weather for manual workers in the building, civil engineering and painting trades and the scheme provided for in the Act was the first of its kind.  When the scheme was introduced manual workers in the building trade were normally paid by the hour for the time worked and a full week's wages could only be earned when weather conditions allowed normal hours to be worked in full.  The frequent rain which falls in all seasons in Ireland results <Col N="2497" /> in recurrent short periods of interruptions of work while interruptions are also caused by frost, snow and high winds. Unemployment benefits are not normally paid for such short spells.  Before the Act was introduced in 1957 there was a prolonged strike of building workers in pursuance of increased wages.  One of the points raised by them at that time was the interruption of their employment and their loss of wages because of inclement weather.  It was for this reason that the scheme was introduced.</P>
    <P>The wet time legislation originally applied to workers in the building trade only, and while the Act was initially confined to this trade provision was made for the extension of the scheme to the other trades by a subsequent ministerial order.  The Act provided for the compulsory payment of weekly contributions in equal shares by manual workers in the building, civil engineering and painting trades and their employers.  The Department did not have to fund it but they had to administer the fund.</P>
    <P>Since 1943 the rates of weekly contributions have been amended on eight different occasions while the hourly rates of wet time benefit have been increased on nine occasions.  Under statutory regulations, every insured person who is intermittently unemployed in any day is entitled to wet time benefit to be paid by his employer and the employer subsequently recoups that money from the Department of Social Welfare out of the fund.</P>
    <P>The number of workers employed in the building, civil engineering and painting trades in 1982, according to the Central Statistics Office, was 40,306.  The number of persons who benefit from the scheme annually has never been calculated as the amount of benefit payable is computed on the basis of hours lost rather than the amount payable in respect of individual workers.  The number of employers who stamp wet-time books for their employees is approximately 5,000, the income of the fund in 1982 was £1,549,888 and repayment of benefit amounted to £1,573,312.</P>
    <P>The wet-time scheme has ensured that <Col N="2498" /> workers in the building, civil engineering and painting trades who are intermittently unemployed due to stoppages of work are insured against loss of wages. By an agreement dated 1 June 1966 and subsequently amended on a number of occasions which was registered under section 28 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, with the Labour Court in the register of employment agreements the Construction Industry Federation and trade unions agreed that the working week would be 40 hours.  The agreement also provided that a worker who kept himself available for work throughout the normal working hours of each working day of the week but who had been prevented from working due to inclement weather during any part of that week was entitled to payment of not less than 32 times the hourly rate applicable to him.  This became known as the guaranteed week. By a further agreement, which became operative from 1 November 1980, the guaranteed week is now one of 40 hours.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in proposing to abolish the wet-time scheme, is doing so on the basis that the guaranteed 40 hour week has effectively replaced the wet-time scheme.  This is not so, the 40 hour guaranteed week is a top up on the wet time scheme.  A worker is, in practice, guaranteed payment of 40 hours work weekly. Where a stoppage of work due to inclement weather occurs, the employer pays whatever wages are due to the workers for hours worked in the week in question, wet-time benefit due in respect of the loss of wages because of the stoppage of work in that week and the balance, if any, necessary to bring the total payment up to the equivalent of payment due for the guaranteed week of 40 hours.  It is quite obvious that the guaranteed 40 hour week is a top up on the wet time scheme.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister has not forgotten that wet-time scheme payments are a social welfare benefit and are not subject to taxation.  If it is replaced directly by payments from a 40 hour guaranteed week, it would be subject to taxation because there would not be a social welfare element involved.  Having regard to the fact that workers in the construction <Col N="2499" /> industry now receive payment for 40 hours work in the week regardless of stoppages due to unfavourable weather and to the definition in the Act of intermittent unemployment&mdash;</P>
    <P>unemployment and consequent loss of wages due to stoppage of work which is unavoidable owing to inclement weather...</P>
    <P>&mdash; the chairman on a number of occasions asked the representatives of both sides of the industry for their views as to the necessity for the scheme in present circumstances. The representatives on each occasion confirmed that they wished the scheme to continue.  It is obvious, therefore, that there has not been a great clamour from the unions for its abolition.</P>
    <P>The joint committee of unions and employers held their first meeting on 7 December 1978 and, in all, they held 14 meetings.  The Minister might have given the impression the other day that the 14 meetings were concerned with details of whether the wet-time scheme should be abolished.  This is not so as the early meetings were of an exploratory nature and a wide variety of aspects of the building industry were discussed.  At the fourth meeting, held on 21 March 1979, Mr. Malone, acting chairman, requested both sides to furnish their proposals in writing and this was agreed.  In a letter dated 11 May 1979 the trade union side conveyed five proposals relating to the wet-time scheme.  Further proposals, generally from the employers, emanated from later meetings.  At their meeting of 11 May 1981 there was agreement on a number of proposals but no conclusion had been reached on others.  On one occasion when there seemed to be some demand from the unions, in a letter dated 10 July 1981 the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union informed the Minister of a number of resolutions which had been passed at their annual conference and requested a meeting to discuss them.  One of the resolutions was:</P>
    <P>That in view of the guaranteed week now operating in the Construction <Col N="2500" /> Industry, Conference calls on the Minister for Social Welfare to abolish the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Act, 1942.</P>
    <P>The requested meeting with the Minister did not take place until 17 November 1981.  It was agreed at the meeting that it would be necessary to consult with other interested parties, namely other ICTU unions and employers, before any decisions could be made regarding the matter in question.</P>
    <P>On 14 December 1981, the Department wrote to Messrs.  Duffy, who represented the unions, and Reynolds, who represented the employers, asking them for their views regarding the resolution. Mr. Reynolds, in his reply, expressed the view that the appropriate venue for the ITGWU to raise their viewpoint would be the joint industrial council for the construction industry and suggested that the Minister might so advise the union.  This was the council which had been originally set up at the behest of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Mr. Reynolds's viewpoint was conveyed to Mr. Carroll, General President of the union by letter on 15 January 1982, copies of which were sent to Messrs. Duffy and Reynolds.  Mr. Carroll in his reply dated 26 January 1982 stated that his union would arrange to have the matter discussed at the joint industrial council and would advise the Department of the outcome.</P>
    <P>It was subsequently confirmed in a letter that the council did meet and at their monthly meeting on 18 May 1982, they confirmed that the conclusions reached by the review committee on the wet-time scheme represented the views of both sides of the joint industrial council. They stated that the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained.  Subsequently, Mr. Carroll was asked whether this information represented the views of his union and on 15 June 1982 he replied as follows:</P>
    <P>Thank you for your letter dated 28th May regarding the policy of this Union in relation to the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Act, 1942.</P>
    <P>As you are aware, developments have taken place at the National Joint <Col N="2501" /> Industrial Council on this matter and, indeed, our Union has contributed to an ongoing review of the operation of this legislation.  We are satisfied with the views of the Trade Union Side of the N.J.I.C. on the matter and will continue to review the situation in conjunction with our representatives in the industry.</P>
    <P>While we require changes in the present arrangements, we support the collective approach of the trade unions in the industry to the matter.</P>
    <P>In other words, the ITGWU acceded to the decisions taken by the joint council representing employers and employees.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that I must protest at the manner of the abolition of this scheme.  At least the normal courtesies should have been observed by the Minister and his Department with the joint industrial council before the decision was taken to abolish it in this hasty fashion. It is only right that they should have been consulted and given the opportunity to express their views and to reach a consensus, if possible.  Instead of that, the Minister and his Department intend to abolish the scheme without consultation, which is a very dangerous thing to do.  In the construction industry, relations have been very good.  Many agreements have been reached very easily and accepted and honoured by both sides and the 40 hour guaranteed week has been accepted.  The imposition of a decision such as this without consultation must be a matter of protest by Members on this side of the House on whose behalf I speak.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words in relation to this Bill.  Deputy McCarthy has spoken to the nation on more than one occasion and has lectured us here on the <i>Building on Reality</i> document produced by the Government.  I listened to him last week and earlier this week calling for the resignation of this Minister and saying that his party would oppose this measure.  I subsequently heard a member of one of the unions involved saying that <Col N="2502" /> that should not be the case.  I have nothing personal against Deputy McCarthy, who represents his constituents as I do mine.  Probably one of the most carefully costed documents that ever came into this House, so we are told, was the document produced by his party, termed <i>The Way Forward</i>.  That went something like £700 million off the rails after seven months. So much for reality in that context.</P>
      <P>In certain quarters of the Opposition Party in the last two to three months there has been a new swaggering arrogance with assumed hopes of taking over Government after impending elections. The electorate would want to get down to the reality of the costing of the documents produced by the Opposition in the last few weeks.  The interpretation of the local government document is that there will be no charges for any of the services at present being charged for.  The people should have these costings put before them and let them decide for themselves in terms of reality.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Social Welfare has been branded in certain places as some kind of gone wrong voodoo medicine man from the jungle who puts the kiss of death on everything he looks at.  This is very unfair treatment of a Minister who has been, and is, facing the political realities of life head on. There is no point in dodging the issues. They must be faced up to.  The people of this country must decide for themselves on the issues of the day.  We are not the people that we were 50 years ago.  We have not the same mentality as people had then.  People today have pressures placed upon them which their fathers and ancestors did not have to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme introduced by the Minister has been extended and broadened by Deputy McCarthy who dealt with the national issues of unemployment, motivation, incentive, flair, opportunities and the creation of jobs.  I agree with him wholeheartedly that unemployment certainly is one of the major social ills of our time.  It is past time for this House to react on an issue such as unemployment. It is past time for the House to have more frequent debates on how this problem <Col N="2503" /> should be tackled and various measures structured and introduced to alleviate, to some degree or extent, the terrible burden created by unemployment.</P>
    <P>The thrust of this Government certainly should be pumped into job creation. When people are employed their minds are working, their morale and confidence rise and this does a lot to help the national economy.  A recent report from the United States indicated that in 15 to 20 years' time all manufactured goods will be made by 5 per cent of the population. One wonders where we are headed and new priorities must be considered on leisure time, health and environmental matters and the general use to which people will put their energies, talents and abilities.  This type of report leads one to believe that we must become part of the technological era mentioned by Deputy McCarthy.  That word has been grossly over-used, because everyone is a technologist in his or her own way.  We all can communicate, make signs and do various things.  The opportunities now available to many young people in this area are not understood, particularly by some Members in the House and those of older years simply because these opportunities were not available in their own time.</P>
    <P>The scheme is a start to do something to give hope and relieve the frustration of many people who have been unemployed for over 12 months.  I would like the scheme to be properly promoted initially, otherwise we could end up as they did in Britain some years ago under some of their employment schemes &mdash; with people of considerable talents and skills sweeping seaweed off the beaches and leaves off the footpaths.  If properly structured, the scheme can be of benefit. Every public representative who is dealing with the problems of unemployment apparent in the eyes of those with whom they are dealing every week, as is the case with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, can understand the frustration and depression which can set in when people are faced with the reality of unemployment for a period of 12 months or longer. The confidence and boost to the personal <Col N="2504" /> morale got from using their abilities and talents in a job in doing something for themselves, their environment and their country must be witnessed to be understood. Those who avail of jobs and can see the benefits accruing therefrom take on a new lease of life.</P>
    <P>I understand that a full-scale debate will be introduced by the Minister for Labour in relation to the various types of schemes which can be promoted.  I do not propose to go into that matter in great detail now.  However, if these schemes are to be structured in the regional offices of the National Manpower Service, those offices should be given every facility at Government level to choose the proper people for the proper jobs and ensure that the numbers registered as unemployed are catered for.  Without the computerisation of the National Manpower Service, the names of many people, after being entered in the log-books as eligible and available for work in the National Manpower Service offices, are never heard of.  This scheme should be properly promoted by the Department and the people who will introduce it should be given every assistance to enable them to do their job in an efficient manner.  The kind of schemes which are promoted and the various sponsors of the schemes are all important.  If the scheme takes off properly in the beginning it could do a lot to solve unemployment.  The Government expect 10,000 jobs to be created but it could result in many more jobs.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy referred to the number of people who are unemployed and he made great play of the figure of 217,000.  That figure will probably rise.  It is not properly understood or appreciated that in order to halt the ever-spiralling increase in unemployment the Government must provide incentives and opportunities for the income generating sections to provide 23,000 new jobs per year.  That is a job which has never been properly tackled or equalled in the past. It poses an all-time challenge to the Government.  This is a start to tackle the problem on the outer fringes.</P>
    <P>As regards the 217,000 people who are unemployed, there are people who are <Col N="2505" /> unable to work, people who do not wish to work, and people who are prepared to take up any kind of employment in order to relieve themselves of the boredom and frustration that unemployment leads to. Emigration has been in the news recently.  Deputy Kelly has often mentioned it in terms of the skilled personnel who leave the country for a period of years in order to gain experience.  That is happening whether we like it or not. Many doctors, technicians and skilled people go abroad in order to gain experience. It now takes only one hour to travel to Brussels and five hours to travel to the US.  I come from the west and it would be unreal to deny that the traditional emigration we have had is not taking place to a certain extent.  Some of my neighbours have gone back to Britain to look for work for the winter period and some of them have gone so far as to be gainfully employed on the Falkland Islands for the British Government.</P>
    <P>We must look at the kind of people who are unemployed.  The public perception of what goes on in employment exchanges leaves a lot to be desired. Within the number of 217,000 who are unemployed there are people who are not supposed to be working but who are drawing a considerable amount of money from the State coffers.  It is difficult to blame them the way the system operates. If by signing your name you can get money for nothing there are few people who will not do so.  The structure of the system needs to be looked at.  Many people who are unemployed say they would much prefer to work.  The number of unemployed is probably fewer than that which is stated on the register.  It is the responsibility of the Government of the day to create opportunities and incentives for these people so that they can see for themselves that by being gainfully employed they are doing something for their families, their environment and the economy.</P>
    <P>Often people have asked me what I am doing as a public representative for their son or daughter.  There is a certain warped sense of national thinking when we consider that £300 million was spent <Col N="2506" /> in retail outlets in the North and yet people ask that question.  Recently I came across people who were singing Republican songs in a certain place and it was obvious that two or three people involved had been to the North with their families the previous weekend to purchase goods and equipment.  It is ironic for people to castigate the State when their actions in purchasing goods in the North are to the detriment of the economy.</P>
    <P>In many cases people who get grants from the Government or the IDA and who are successful are deemed to be the pampered recipients of State grants out of an endless fund.  If their enterprise fails they are treated with derision, contempt and an &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; attitude.  People must understand that by investing their money and time and that by using the opportunities and incentives created by the State they can make a better life for themselves.</P>
    <P>In the context of assessments, the Minister mentioned that insurance for occupational injuries will be covered and that is as it should be.  Those who are medical card holders will have a contribution levied on them.  I had a question down for written reply this week in relation to means testing of people who are recipients of unemployment assistance and medical cards.  There appears to be a difference in the type of assessment made by officers in the health board and those in the Department.  We all know of cases where people have had their medical cards withdrawn but are still eligible for unemployment assistance and also of cases where people were deemed not to be eligible for unemployment assistance but were allowed to retain their medical cards.</P>
    <P>The scheme appears to be very attractive for single people in that a married person with a family with the rates that exist at present could draw more money by being unemployed.  I hope the Department in promoting the scheme project the benefits of the scheme in such a way that the unemployed will understand it and want to participate in it.  In relation to caretakers and secretaries in schools, <Col N="2507" /> will the scheme cater for them?  For example, a caretaker might be employed on a full time five day week basis in one school.  Could two people now be employed doing two and a half days work each with half the pay and paying normal tax?  The scheme should cater for this.  I realise that there may be difficulties with unions and that it would need to be handled with delicacy and understanding.</P>
    <P>Calls for the abolition of the wet-time insurance scheme have been made over the years.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his endeavours to promote the Bill and I trust that it will result in generally taking several thousands of people off the unemployed register by giving them something to do in decent schemes so that they will improve not alone their own feelings about work and their lifestyles but also their environment and that this will result in benefit for the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must welcome any measure introduced by the Government which will do anything to relieve unemployment and in that regard I welcome the Bill, but I would like to say a few brief words about it and emphasise the following points.  For many years I have thought that the system of unemployment exchanges, the National Manpower Service, AnCO etc. should be dovetailed together in what I would term a national <Col N="2508" /> hire agency.  We have in all our constituencies unemployment offices, National Manpower Service officers and so on. People sign on at unemployment exchanges and draw their social assistance there or they register with the NMS where they are given a list of jobs and recommendation to various employers. The NMS operate schemes such as the employment incentive scheme.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that when a person becomes unemployed he should go to one office in his county or wherever and sign on with the Department of Social Welfare to draw his or her benefit and at the same time in the same building he should register with the NMS.  I do not know whether it would be possible under existing regulations, and perhaps new legislation would be necessary for this, but every employer in that area should be in continual contact with the NMS. Whereas people have the right to work or not to work as they see fit, it should be the right of the State to decide that if they do not want to work then the State does not have to pay this kind of assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been and always will be a certain number of unemployed people who are drawing benefit and playing the system and perhaps would not take a job at any price, but in the past couple of years I have come to the conclusion that the vast majority of unemployed people really want to work, to have a job.  We should consider a dovetailing of the system.  I know employers in my constituency who have telephoned the NMS looking for ten or so workers.  The agency would sent them a list of perhaps 20 or 30 people in that area who would be suitable for the job.  In that area of high unemployment at present very few of those people would turn up and the few who turn up would say that for the wages given it would not be worth their while to work and those people continue to sign on at the Department of Social Welfare. If the system could be dovetailed then, say, the NMS could be in contact with the employer willing to employ the people they would sent out and he could then tell the social welfare officer that a <Col N="2509" /> person would not take the job offered.  I am talking about people who have general operative skills.  The present system should not be allowed to continue.  I ask the Minister to consider adopting the type of system I have suggested.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us in two parts, one regarding the wet-time scheme and the other concerning new social welfare legislation which provides that a person would be able to work for two and a half days per week and earn £70 but he would be disqualified for the rest of the week from drawing unemployment assistance.  The Bill sets out the various regulations which must be met, but that is the gist of it.  It will not take an unemployed Einstein to work out whether he will be better off working two and a half days and getting £70 or staying at home.  Under the present social welfare legislation only single people would benefit if they took up work under those conditions.  Anything that will get people back to work is to be welcomed, but this is another of the schemes that for years we have been bringing into this House.  The youth employment scheme and the employment incentive scheme have been attempts by successive Governments to do something about unemployment, but we have all failed to generate sustainable employment.  That is the test facing us. Politicians are blamed for nearly everything but they cannot be blamed for every single thing that happens in the country. Our duty is to relieve this scourge and to have sustainable employment, but it is the job of Government to provide the framework necessary to create employment. We can have all the schemes we want.  This scheme will transfer a little bit out of the Social Welfare allocation to the Department of Labour allocation, but the overall picture is one of continuous rising unemployment.</P>
    <P>How is this scheme to be operated? In my constituency in this year Kildare County Council have had to put some of their workers on a two weeks on, two weeks off basis.  I presume this scheme is to be on non-profit making work, so we can presume that it will be on work undertaken normally by local authorities. <Col N="2510" /> I hope that the Minister is right when he says that about 10,000 people will avail of the scheme, but I doubt that.  However, say 10,000 people wish to avail of this scheme and be employed by local authorities.  We are going to give them two and a half days work with a local authority and other employees of the local authority will be let go because we have not enough finance to keep them going.  This does not make sense, but that is what will happen.</P>
    <P>On the one hand one arm of the Department of the Environment &mdash; in this case let us say Kildare County Council &mdash; will be letting workers go, next year probably, for a few months of the year and on the other hand under another State scheme they will be taking unemployed people on for two and a half days each week to do the same job.  That does not add up.  A single unemployed person, whom this proposed scheme would attract, would realise that by working two and a half days per week he will get the £70 but he will be debarred from unemployment assistance.  In present day Ireland with the black economy flourishing due to our taxation system, he will realise also if he has a tittle of wit that if he is getting basic unemployment assistance, he can make up to £70 in any event. Therefore, he is not going to avail of this scheme.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that, if people do not want to work, they do not want to work.  We can say that this scheme is good and that we will try to operate it as best we can.  Why not put the NMS and the unemployment exchange in the one area together?  If we want to get people to avail of this scheme and make them do local authority work, we are not prepared to say so because we do not want to upset anyone who might not be too keen on that.  All the time we are ducking the hard decision.  I believe the Minister is doing his best here, but will it really work?  Why do we not do something like what I suggest if we are serious about the effects of long term unemployment?</P>
    <P>When one is unemployed for a certain period or, say, takes a break, whether because of illness or some other reason <Col N="2511" /> from his profession, it becomes extremely difficult to return to the routine of getting up early and working through a full day.  Unfortunately this scheme is to apply only to people who are unemployed for a year; but those who are most anxious to obtain work are the ones who are told that the concern in which they are employed is to go out of business within days.  These are the people who will scour the country seeking other types of work.  But if they should be unemployed for six months or a year they may not be as anxious to obtain work as they were on first hearing that they were to be rendered unemployed. This would be true especially of people who did not have very big commitments and who perhaps might get by doing a few nixers.  If we are to have a scheme of this kind why should it not apply to people faced with the prospect of becoming unemployed immediately?</P>
    <P>However, I wish the Minister well with the scheme, though I consider it to be impracticable.  It represents merely another of those sops that we continue to throw out to the unemployed trying to give the impression that we as legislators can wave a magic wand and create jobs.  All we are doing here is transferring money from the Department of Labour to the Department of Social Welfare.  We must be seen to be doing something so we draw up this kind of scheme.</P>
    <P>On the second aspect of the Bill, I must agree with the Minister that the wet-time arrangements are long out of date.  Since the building industry has a guaranteed working week as it were, the wet-time fund is of no benefit to anyone other than in the sense of subsidising some employers who because of inclement weather experience periods of short time working and, consequently, are able to retrieve some of the money.  The cost of the scheme must have been enormous. Employers that I know of have had so much work with the scheme, affixing stamps and so on, though they employ only five or six people, that one wonders what amount of work the social welfare people must have to do in dealing with <Col N="2512" /> the scheme on a countrywide basis. Therefore, I can see the benefit of abolishing the scheme.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister should have made the announcement in consultation with the trade unions and with the employer representatives but I have always contended that the job of Government is to govern, to make decisions.  While recognising the logic of abolishing the scheme there are a few questions I should like to put to the Minister.  He tells us that the fund has almost run out and that there is no provision for the Exchequer to top it up other than by way of a loan.  What I consider to be the reason for the depletion of the fund is not spelled out.  The only moneys that should be taken from the fund would relate to claims on it in respect of short time working as a result of bad weather.  But there has been very little bad weather in 1984.  Therefore, the only reason I can think of for the depletion of the fund are the masses of people who are unemployed in the construction industry.  Consequently all the contributions that would come from those people if they were employed are being lost to the fund.  For the past couple of years there must have been a considerable reduction in the level of the contributions.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what view people may have as to how the engine of economic growth should be started, it is an accepted economic fact in this country, as in others, that an injection of funds to the building industry is the prime giver of life to the economy.  The point I wish to emphasise is that the depletion of the fund must be the result of the decline in the numbers of people engaged in the building industry.  While I welcome the abolition of the wet-time scheme to the extent that it has long since served its usefulness and while I appreciate that the Minister, like everyone else here, is anxious to do something about the unemployment problem, I do not think that the other aspect of the Bill will be successful in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that this legislation is being brought in at <Col N="2513" /> such short notice and that Deputies are being given little time to give adequate or detailed consideration to it.  While on the face of it the Minister's argument that the abolition of wet time is long overdue he will accept that often the implications of the various Bills coming before us only come to light after detailed consideration and sometimes only after they become law.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that this is a particularly inappropriate time to introduce this Bill as the unions and employers are in the process of wage negotiations. The trade unions fear that the abolition of the wet-time scheme will strengthen the hands of construction industry employers in the wage negotiations.  They will claim that they will have to bear the cost of hours lose due to wet time, now that they can no longer claim compensation from the State, and that for that reason they cannot meet the wage claims being made by the trade union movement. Obviously since the Bill is now before us the damage has been done and it cannot be undone.  It appears that this Bill was introduced without the interests involved in the wet-time scheme being consulted.  While discussions have been going on for some time with the trade unions and employers about the scheme, no notice was given about its imminent abolition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection in principle to the abolition of the scheme.  Where employers and employees agree as to wages and working conditions there is no problem. However, unfortunately there has been a trend in the construction industry towards the development of the black economy and no effort has been made to ensure that agreements made between trade unions and employers in the construction industry should apply to all workers in the construction industry.  Many reputable firms involved in large projects employ sub-contractors who do not employ trade union employees and do not pay trade union wages or give trade union conditions.  Two of these projects have been brought to my notice, one a hospital in Cavan and the other in James's Street hospital.  The people employed by <Col N="2514" /> these subcontractors will lose out as a result of the loss of the wet-time scheme because their employers do not abide by trade union agreements.</P>
    <P>In relation to Government contracts it is now arguable that the trade union clause which was included in all the contracts up to about 18 months ago should be restored.  This was a mechanism that ensured that all the labourers employed on contracts for local authorities or Government Departments would comply with the high standards insisted upon by the trade unions.  That clause is no longer in Government or local authority contracts with the result that working conditions in many projects have deteriorated. In fact some people who are not registered in the Construction Industry Federation pension scheme are getting Government contracts.  All these things are related to the conditions of work for construction workers.  While on the face of it the abolition of the wet-time scheme is sensible and straightforward, there are other related matters which affect the conditions of workers which are not dealt with in this Bill and which will in effect lead to a deterioration in working conditions for those employed in the construction industry.  As a minimum demand for the abolition of the wet-time scheme workers in the construction industry who are guaranteed a 40-hour week, should be given statutory protection so that all employees would be protected regardless of whether or not their employers allowed them to join trade unions.</P>
    <P>In a submission made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in November 1983 they pointed out that there was an increasing frequency in the employment of &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; as a means of obtaining cheap labour to the exclusion of genuine workers who wanted to work within the terms of the agreement.  The vast majority of unemployed people are people who cannot find work but there is obviously a tendency in the construction industry to abuse unemployed people by insisting that if they want to be taken on they must continue to draw unemployment benefit and be happy with a wage lower than the trade union rate.  For many people who <Col N="2515" /> are anxious to work, the temptation to do that is very strong.  The abuse of the system is being forced on the unemployed by unscrupulous subcontractors who do not want to have anything to do with trade unions or with making PRSI and PAYE contributions.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that Deputies would come into this House and imply that the vast majority, or a significant number, of the unemployed are simply people who do not want to work.  There is an attitude of mind, which I call the &ldquo;workhouse attitude&rdquo;, among some Deputies &mdash; Deputy Kenny came very close to it in his contribution &mdash; which implies that a person who is unemployed should be near poverty level before he is entitled to any benefit, that he must prove himself incapable of work or at such a level of deprivation that he cannot keep body and soul together without a few shillings before he is entitled to social benefits.  Tied in with that is the attitude that the benefits people get must never go beyond keeping them on or just above the poverty level. The attitude is that to do so would encourage laziness and idleness, that to do otherwise would only encourage the lower orders not to take up all the employment that is available out there for them, that they should pull up their socks and go out and look for it.</P>
    <P>These attitudes only encourage the belief that this House has no answers to the unemployment problem.  Deputy Kenny said it is not the responsibility of this House to deal with unemployment or to create jobs, that it is the responsibility of the individual to create his own work.  That is a total anachronism in the 20th century when there are such complex technology and organisation.  To imagine that people can generate sufficient income through their own efforts these days is ridiculous.  It is only through the development of agencies and the marshalling of the resources of the State by the State that adequate employment for everybody can be provided.  Dependence on private enterprise in the past 60 years has been fruitless and it is pointless to <Col N="2516" /> have Deputies here telling us that it is the answer to unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Bill is laying the ground for the social employment scheme.  I agree somewhat with Deputy McCreevy who said that the scheme will simply transfer resources from one Department to another or from one hand to another.  On the one hand the Government call for a reduction in pay and personnel in the public service or are putting pressure on those in the public service who are not serving a useful purpose to get out.  At the same time they create all of these schemes, training under AnCO and various projects under the Youth Employment Agency and others, all of them aimed at taking people from the unemployment register and saying to them: &ldquo;There you are, there is a bit of work for you and you will get a few bob for it.  Then we will be happy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point strongly that many of the services of local authorities in Dublin and throughout the country have been cut back drastically, with workers on a three-day week or on a week-on week-off or a week-on&mdash;two weeks off rota, yet this social employment scheme will be used to get work done which the local authorities should be doing if they were provided with the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>I can give a specific example of that in my constituency.  The Department of the Environment provided funds to the corporation to initiate the environmental work scheme.  Very useful work was done under it but that was work which the maintenance department of the corporation normally should be doing if the resources were provided.  An estate in my constituency was built in the early seventies but the builders thought that walls were not needed so garden walls were not provided around any of the houses.  When the corporation had a few bob they attempted to provide the walls but they ran out of money and the environmental work scheme was initiated and the walls were then built under that scheme.  It does not make sense for the Government to be cutting back on local authorities, preventing them from <Col N="2517" /> employing their full quota of tradesmen and labourers, and then coming up with this flashy scheme of giving £70 a week to people for working two-and-a-half days a week.  The Minister today claimed that this will take 10,000 of the unemployment register.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned this is a con job.  It is nothing more or less than a confidence trick.  They pretend to be doing something about unemployment when all they are doing is making the pretence that they are providing employment. The scheme raises a number of questions.  If the manager of an employment exchange decides when an individual, man or woman, young or old, comes in to collect his or her unemployment assistance that there is a suitable job available under this scheme, because the £70 is less than that person would be getting in benefit, and if that person refuses to take up that &ldquo;job&rdquo;, will the person be taken off the unemployment register and will he or she be refused unemployment assistance?  Apparently a person must accept whatever work is available at whatever wage is offered regardless of whether it is lower than the money he or she already receives.</P>
    <P>It is not a matter of people living in luxury on unemployment assistance but of people trying to raise families and trying to maintain the best possible standard of living on the money available to them.  If a man with two children and a wife getting £72 per week unemployment assistance, is asked to take one of these social employment scheme jobs at £70 per week minus 3 per cent PRSI and employment levy deduction, will the exchange manager be entitled to take that man off unemployment assistance because he refuses to accept the job for the good reason that his income on which to keep his wife and family would be reduced?  That is an important point which has to be dealt with in the scheme.</P>
    <P>I could not exist on £72 a week and I would not expect anyone else to try to exist on £72 a week.  No one should be expected to live on less than £72 a week. Will a person have an option to refuse one of these jobs on the basis that it <Col N="2518" /> would mean a fall in his living standards if he were to accept it?</P>
    <P>There is the whole area of the Youth Employment Agency and AnCO.  In the plan <i>Building on Reality</i> there is talk about creating a whole plethora of agencies, all with the intention of giving the impression that something is being done about unemployment.  This scheme is another attempt to give that impression. When I first read the document <i>Building on Reality</i>, it struck me that one of the effects of the scheme would be a growth in the black economy.  Assuming people accept £70 a week less deductions, and work two-and-a-half days, the Minister says they can earn whatever they like but they will not get unemployment benefit or any other benefit.  The tendency will be to move into the black economy.  I wonder what controls, if any, the Minister proposes to prevent a growth in the black economy as a result of this scheme. That is an important area of concern.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong in principle with the abolition of the wet-time scheme, but the way it was introduced is regrettable.  I was told it has done damage to wage negotiations between the unions and the construction industry.  Whatever I say about the other scheme, it will be introduced.  I do not see it as a solution to the unemployment problem.  I do not believe for a moment that the Minister can be all that happy with it.  It is an excuse for not doing anything realistic about creating sustainable long term jobs for the thousands who need them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille seo.  I have a few words to say on this Bill.  That is why I am here in the House listening with a keen ear to the views being expressed by Deputies from all sides of the House on the provisions of the Bill and the Minister's efforts to put certain people to work who are now in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in all his efforts to provide work.  This Bill gives the House an opportunity to consider the problem of the provision of employment for almost 250,000 people who are on the <Col N="2519" /> unemployment registers.  Where are we heading in relation to this grave problem? Many people may say it is not the duty of the State to provide work.  I do not agree with that.  Man has a God-given right to employment.  Nobody has the right to deny man the fulfilment of his purpose in life by depriving him of useful and profitable work.  Man without work is not man.  It takes work to develop man, whether his hands, or his intellect, or his brain.  The State has an obligation to help man to develop his intellect and to give him suitable training to enable him to engage in employment for which he should be in receipt of a proper wage to enable him to marry and bring up his family in accordance with the full terms of Christian decency.</P>
    <P>Man is entitled to work because without work, man loses his sense of dignity. A sense of dignity can never be measured in pounds, shillings and pence, in francs, in marks, in dollars, or in any currency.  Our people are losing their sense of dignity.  In many instances our people have lost their sense of dignity. Have they lost it for all time?  Many would not disagree with that theory.  It is the responsibility of a Government keenly concerned about restoring the dignity of man to create employment for him.  If that is not the duty of the Government, what is their responsibility?  What is the responsibility of the local authorities and all the organisations which were established to create employment for which man will be paid?</P>
    <P>I often feel that men in public life are becoming so far removed from the realities that they are advising man to provide his own form of employment without considering how he is to be paid for creating his own form of employment.  The economy can create employment.  We get out of the economy only what we put into it.  If we put nothing into it, nothing comes out of it.  So it is with the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>There is reference in this Bill to the abolition of wet-time for 40,000 building workers.  I do not dispute that.  I do not find fault with the Minister for it, despite <Col N="2520" /> the fact that there should have been wider consultations with the trade union authorities and other interested parties. The creation of employment is of vital importance.  Under the provisions of this Bill if various forms of activity are to be assessed by the Department of Labour I hope the Minister for Social Welfare, or the Minister for Labour, will tell us what will be the nature or form of such activities. I might respectfully suggest many forms of useful activity.  For example, when one visits various parts of the United Kingdom one sees there the conservation of buildings of architectural design and interest and the work carried out on them by unemployed persons. Much valuable and useful work has been done in that respect.  Likewise there is the example of the marvellous work undertaken by the Scottish Trust in relation to the conservation of very old houses as a result of schemes having been implemented, such as this one, although it must be said that more research and detailed planning was undertaken in advance.  Such work is done in the various localities with a great sense of pride and joy.  I hope as a result of the passage of this Bill that some such schemes will be devised by the Department of Labour, ensuring that they are implemented here.</P>
    <P>I have never accepted the theory accepted by many Members of this House that there is no solution to our unemployment problem because that amounts to despair, the waving of the white flag, surrendering all of the ideals of the men who established this State.  I shall never accept that the State has not a duty to provide employment for its citizens. Neither do I accept for one moment the theory that there is no money available in order to engage in the various forms of activity leading to the creation of such employment.  Nor will I accept the theory, when this Bill has been passed, that there is not a variety of schemes under which people will be paid £70 a week for two-and-a-half days' work.</P>
    <P>We have our priorities very wrong in this country.  When I see that there is no money readily available to provide profitable work for tens of thousands of <Col N="2521" /> unemployed people, in order to provide useful work for themselves and their communities, while there is being expended £544 million, for example, last year on security at the Border I ask myself if we have got our priorities in order.  If Mrs. Thatcher wants to keep the Border there she should be made pay for it.  There is no reason Irish tax-payers should be asked to put their hands into their pockets and cough up £544 million to safeguard the Border while there obtains a means test restricting old age pensioners from eligibility for the full benefits of the old age pension.</P>
    <P>There was a plea recently in that regard by a prominent churchman calling for the abolition of such means test.  But we were told by the Minister for Social Welfare that such a proposal was impractical, that it could not be put into operation that there was no money available to do so. Which would amount to a greater investment for the Irish taxpayer &mdash; the protection of our Border for Mrs. Thatcher or looking after our aged and the provision of employment for young people who do not yet know what work is?  We must get our priorities in order here, but it will take courage to do so.  Our first duty should be to our people, looking after the sick and the aged, the disabled, those who cannot provide for themselves and, above all, giving hope, security and the prospect of a future to those people now so disillusioned, writing, indeed crawling to Manpower in the hope of getting a job.</P>
    <P>A Bill of this kind may be advantageous but it merely scratches the surface of the problem.  We must ask ourselves what will happen next year, the year after and henceforth in relation to job creation. Are we limping from crisis to crisis rather than seriously tackling the problem of the provision of work for our young people, for those who do not want to be in the dole queues?  I want to assure all Members of this House that it is not the wish of any young man or woman to line up to receive charity by way of unemployment assistance or benefit.  It lowers the dignity of the person having to queue up outside these awful labour exchanges where in most cases shame <Col N="2522" /> and necessity abound.  They must line up in these queues to keep body and soul together.  This is totally humiliating.  It lowers the standard and dignity of man and deprives him of a right guaranteed in the past in this country: the right to work and to independence in his own country. One must remember that one cannot be independent without work.</P>
    <P>My opinion on this has not changed over the years.  It is the duty and responsibility of the State to ensure that work is provided for its citizens and particularly for its young people, who today are in despair.  I do not know what the passage of this Bill will mean to young people. They may say it is a step in the right direction, but more is now needed.  Massive strides are needed in order to solve this problem.  If this unemployment problem is not grasped seriously within the next two or three years, we shall face a serious threat to democracy as we know it today.  How many times have I and many other Members made speeches within and outside this House in relation to this serious threat posed to democracy? When a person is deprived of his dignity, when despair sets in and is allowed continue, with no prospects or hope for the future, that in itself leads to a threat to democracy.  It should be remembered that we are now dealing with better educated young unemployed persons, people who will not accept the standards accepted in the past when educational skills were not as readily available.  That is where this country faces grave danger. Perhaps civil servants and ministerial advisers in the Departments of Labour and Social Welfare cannot see that.  Perhaps Ministers are now becoming so remote from the public that they do not see it either.  But there are many Members in rural areas today, and likewise in our towns and cities, who have a close connection with the electorate and who are conscious of the trend developing among young unemployed people that they must get money by any means, that they must sustain the standards that prevailed here in the fifties and sixties.</P>
    <P>While the provisions of this Bill may constitute a step in the right direction by <Col N="2523" /> providing work for a shorter period for people recommended by Manpower and who have signed on for unemployment assistance, I respectfully suggest that it may not constitute the whole solution. At least its passage will, I hope, enable some people to be removed from the live register for two-and-a-half days per week and to earn £70.  I hope it will not be regarded as coming from Parliament that one is expected to live on £70 per week because that figure is mentioned in the legislation.  I will be sorry for those who have to work two-and-a-half days for the £70 and will not be able to seek employment elsewhere for the remainder of the week to boost their pay to a figure that will enable the family to keep body and soul together.</P>

I understand that both sides are aware of that agreement.

      <P>I should like to support the motion tabled by our spokesman, Deputy McCarthy, who has been successful in smoking out the Minister for Social Welfare and bringing him to the House to account for his proposals.  It is clear from the proposals outlined in the Government's document, <i>Building on Reality,</i> that they have forgotten about a large sector of the unemployed.  Those people would have suffered badly, and may still, if the Minister was not forced to take them into account in his calculations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the unemployed are the forgotten people as far as the Government are concerned, particularly those on unemployment assistance.  Those people are on the lowest income and are suffering the greatest hardship at this time.  I have many of them in my constituency. I resent the Minister's suggestion last night that these measures will only fall adversely on a small number of people, a few thousand.  If that is the case then they all live in my constituency because many thousands on the north side of Dublin will be affected by the Minister's proposals.  Our motion is vital for such people who have been forgotten by the Government, the Minister for <Col N="2525" /> Social Welfare and in the proposals in <i>Building on Reality</i>.  As far as such people are concerned there is nothing in those proposals that will give them hope of obtaining employment but, to add to that, the Minister regards such people as an anomaly in the calculations on the equal treatment proposals.  The Minister's omission, corrected by our motion, is regarded by him as an anomaly.  He has shown a grudging acceptance of their poverty.  His amendment does not protect them.  I warn members of the Labour Party to be careful about that amendment because it simply asks us to note that the Government have legislative proposals at an advanced stage for the implementation of the Directive in a fair and equitable manner, which will involve substantial net additional social welfare expenditure.  We all knew it would involve additional expenditure but there is nothing in the amendment to say that the people I have referred to will be protected or given fair and equitable treatment. They will not get much comfort from the Minister's statement last night.</P>
    <P>The reality is that many families will lose between £20 and £40 per week.  The Minister resented descriptions such as penny-pinching but it is worth recalling that he had to be shamed into giving the double week payment for Christmas last year.  The same applied this year but he has still excluded the unemployed from that double payment.  I object, in the strongest terms possible, to the decision to exclude the unemployed this year from the double week payment.  They are forgotten people.  They are forgotten in all regards because the Government are not concerned or interested in them and then the Government wonder why we say they are taking the Thatcher line.  The double of the dependant's portion which was given by us has been denied to the unemployed this Christmas.  Members on the Government side are aware of that.  By this action the Minister is saving something less than £3 million but he should have considered the comfort such a payment would mean for those people.  Is it not penny-pinching to take such a small amount back although it would have <Col N="2526" /> meant so much to them?  Food subsidies were halved at a most inopportune time and the unemployed did not get anything to compensate them for that loss.</P>
    <P>There has not been any increase in the amount for fuel vouchers since I was in charge of the Department.  In 1982 we raised the value of the voucher to £4 but no increase has been granted for two years.  It must be remembered that the price of a cylinder of gas, one of the most frequently used forms of heat, has almost doubled in price in that time.  A cylinder of gas now costs about £8.  The Minister has not granted any increase to cover that.  Those on unemployment benefit have been excluded from that fuel scheme.  The Minister, in his directive, stated that it was not the intention that persons on short-term social welfare payments, for example, unemployment assistance, should be included in the scheme.  He deliberately excluded them from that scheme.  In the scheme that operated before the Government took office such people were included.  Clothing vouchers were cut and health boards were asked to apply the cuts.  Voluntary agencies, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, are inundated with demands following those cutbacks.  I appeal to people to support such groups this winter because of the predicament the poor face.  Members on the Government side are aware of this but are not doing anything about it.  In fact, they are making the matter worse.  Like the Brussels milk debacle, the unemployed have been left out of the Minister's calculations.</P>
    <P>I understand that a difficulty is being experienced by some people in regard to the payment of the double week because of a strike.  I should like to call on the ASTMS to take the necessary steps to ensure that widows, old age pensioners and other beneficiaries receive their double week payment for Christmas.  It has always been the spirit of the trade union movement to show care and compassion for the elderly and those in need, particularly at Christmas time.  I hope the union will take the steps necessary to ensure those people get their benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that only men <Col N="2527" /> will lose out but in my view families will lose.  A man on unemployment assistance whose wife earns £50 per week to supplement their income and feed their four children told me last week that they will have their income reduced from £133 per week to £96 as a result of the Minister's proposals.  That is making poverty worse and is not acceptable.  The Minister should go back and do his homework. He has got it wrong.  The proposals in <i>Building on Reality</i> are wrong and the Minister has forgotten these people.  His primary duty as Minister is to protect the most deprived in our society.  The Minister should stop blustering and putting up smokescreens.  Fianna Fáil always protect the unemployed and deprived. The record of Deputy Haughey in this respect speaks for itself.  His achievements over the years in the area of health and social welfare compare favourably with those of any other Minister.  They know that very well.  There is no point in the Minister trying to denigrate our party leader.</P>
    <P>The Minister took selective quotations from the bottom of the barrel but they will do no good at this stage.  The people are fed up with the Minister's sleight of hand.  When I was Minister I got 25 per cent increases in three successive years for old age pensioners and widows, but this Minister has consistently eroded their positions.  He has taken money from them in real terms.  He has given increases which were less than the cost of living and in addition he has taken away their food subsidies but he has not increased their fuel vouchers.  The Minister has taken a series of measures which have put these people in the poverty group.  He should not add insult to that particular injury but he should take the advice given in this motion.</P>

      <P>I welcome <Col N="2528" /> the opportunity to speak in this debate. The implementation of the principle of equal treatment as set out in the terms of the EC Directive will, when introduced into our social welfare code in the Bill which Deputies will have on Friday, effect one of the most fundamental changes in the social welfare system for some considerable time.  It is vitally important therefore that Deputies and the public generally should have a clear understanding of what is involved.</P>
      <P>In his speech yesterday evening the Minister outlined in a clear and concise way the issues underlying the principle of equal treatment and the equitable and balanced approach the Government have adopted in the matter.  The contributions including Deputy Woods's contribution, from the other side of the House in return have however clearly demonstrated that the Opposition simply do not know what they want or even what the implementation of equality of treatment should involve.  The same lack of purposefulness has of course characterised their performance on this issue in the past.  As far as I can see, the former Minister for Social Welfare implemented one change and that was the result of a High Court action.  I would hope that as a result of this debate the Opposition will take the opportunity to acquaint themselves with what is involved so that when a fuller debate takes place on the provisions of the Bill they will be in a position to make a more positive contribution based on some understanding of the social welfare code as it stands and which recognises what the principle of equal treatment entails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech dealt at length with the difficulties in applying the principle of equal treatment and the various options that are possible.  I fully support the approach being adopted as I think any right-thinking person must.  In the limited time available to me therefore I do not propose to speak about the full range of equality proposals.  There are some aspects of the proposals which I think we should dwell on particularly in view of the contributions made by some <Col N="2529" /> Opposition speakers and more so because of the text of the motion now before the House.</P>
    <P>The difficult area in regard to equal treatment is clearly recognisable as the revision that is necessary in the conditions governing the payment of dependency increases.  Under present legislation any married woman living with her husband is regarded as his dependant.  As the Minister explained last evening, the principle of equality is a neutral concept which must be applied unconditionally to all.  Similar conditions must apply to men and women.  I should repeat that because that is the essence of the EC Directive. Similar conditions must apply to men and women.  If no one is to lose out as a result of the revision of the present conditions, which is what the motion now before the House asks, then clearly the only way to achieve that is to allow all married women who claim a social welfare payment to qualify for increases of benefit in respect of husbands who are living with them and who are gainfully employed.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out in his speech yesterday evening, even in its present application the condition governing adult dependency is inequitable in that it enables wives receiving substantial earnings from employment or on benefit in their own right to be regarded as their husbands' dependants.  Clearly to extend this equitable provision to married women beneficiaries could not be justified as it would involve totally unnecessary payments to many families where the husband is in employment.  In other words, as I said, similar conditions must apply to men and women.  At the moment an unemployed man can claim for himself, his wife who is in employment &mdash; and it could be well paid employment &mdash; and all his dependent children.  If we were to have equality, an unemployed woman could claim for her employed husband and all the dependent children.  If both husband and wife were unemployed, both could claim for themselves and each other and both could claim for all the children.  In other words, in a family of four dependent children the <Col N="2530" /> husband and the wife could claim separately for all the children thus getting eight child dependant allowances.  That is clearly an indefensible solution to the problem of equality.  One could not accept that kind of situation but that appears to be what the Opposition want.  They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot have equality of treatment without facing up to the difficulties in a courageous manner and trying to bring in measures which would enable the Minister to do something about the people who are hardest hit.</P>
    <P>There are only two ways to implement the EC Directive, the way we are implementing it in the proposed Bill and the other way is to give married women, unemployed or on sick benefit, the right to claim for their husbands who are employed and all the children.  That approach would cost over £100 million to implement and no Minister for Social Welfare could stand over such unwarranted expenditure.  In terms of the PRSI contribution rate it would take an increase of the order of 2 per cent on the rate to raise this revenue.  Is this really what the Opposition have in mind?  If so, they should come out from the vague rhetoric and tired old clichés they have been issuing and tell the people clearly what their notion of equal treatment, with all its consequences, really is.</P>
    <P>The approach being adopted by the Government is, as I have said, a fair and balanced one.  Some married men beneficiaries will suffer a reduction in their entitlements.  All married women will have improved entitlements.  In the case of married men beneficiaries I think it necessary to again emphasise the point made by the Minister that in 75 per cent of such cases no reductions will occur because the wife is engaged on domestic duties.  These proposals make no difference to the entitlements of the husband. She will still be regarded as an adult dependant and the husband will continue to receive an increase of his benefit in respect of her.  In very many of the remaining cases the wife will either be on benefit or in employment with substantial earnings.  In only a small proportion of <Col N="2531" /> cases, numbering no more than a few thousand, will the earnings of the wife be so low that the reduction in the benefit entitlement of the husband would seriously affect the income of the household. In this area the Government and the Minister have shown their concern because options &mdash; such as the possibility of an earnings floor below which a spouse in employment would continue to be regarded as an adult dependant &mdash; are being considered to mitigate the effects of the proposals in this type of case.</P>
    <P>Consideration is also being given to special mitigating measures which would cushion to some extent the income drop which implementation of equal treatment will involve for families where both spouses are separately in receipt of social welfare payments.  The Bill as published will contain general provisions enabling the Minister to make regulations providing for such alleviating measures to the extent that resources permit and to the extent that it is operationally possible. This is an extremely complex matter which still needs further examination but it can and will be fully debated during the passage of the Bill by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In his contribution yesterday evening Deputy Connolly raised a question as to the timing of the measure and whether its provisions would be back-dated. When the provisions have been fully debated and approved by this House and whatever procedural arrangements necessary to implement them have been taken they will be brought into effect. There will be no question whatsoever of back-dating the changes or of implementing the measures in any other way.</P>
    <P>In moving the motion yesterday evening Deputy McCarthy spoke of the living standards of the less well off being worsened by the equal treatment proposals and other recent Government measures. Such statements fail altogether to recognise that the proposed approach to equal treatment will in fact have a substantial net cost resulting in a further £17 million per year being added to social welfare expenditure.  Quite clearly it cannot be said, therefore, that the Government are <Col N="2532" /> approaching equal treatment in a mean or cost-conscious way.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is also wrong in his criticism of the performance of the Government in the social welfare area. Significant progress has been made by this Government since coming into office and in the context of the national plan this will be built on in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Despite the very severe shortage of Exchequer resources this Government have increased the real level of social welfare payments.  In 1983-84 ordinary social welfare rates were increased by 18 per cent, long-term rates for pensioners etc. by 20 per cent and the long term unemployed rates by 25 per cent.  The general increases in social welfare payments from last July will, despite the effects of the changes in the food subsidies to which the Deputy referred, generally protect the purchasing power of those payments.  In addition, children's allowances have been increased from 1 August by 7 per cent.  The total annual costs of these increases alone amounted to £172 million in 1983 and £140 million in 1984.</P>
    <P>As regards future adjustments in rates of payment, the intentions of the Government are quite specific and the national plan provides that long term payments will be adjusted in line with price rises, while short term payments will be adjusted in line with movements in take-home pay.</P>
    <P>In view of the concern which this Government have clearly demonstrated for the less well off it is very difficult to understand the Deputy's criticism of the Government's performance.</P>
    <P>Obviously time would not permit me to go over other aspects of the Government's performance to show how totally unfounded is the Deputy's criticism but I must take him up on one issue when he states that the unemployed were excluded from the Christmas double payment for the first time this year.  In fact the payment this year followed the pattern of previous years and the Deputy is quite wrong to suggest that a departure was made this year.  With regard to the unemployed, this Government have <Col N="2533" /> shown a particular concern for their plight.  In addition to a special 5 per cent increase in unemployment assistance rates to the long term unemployed in October 1983, their rates of payment were increased by 1 per cent more than the general increase in benefits this year. The combined effect of those special increases is the equivalent of three extra weekly payments a year.</P>
    <P>It is to areas such as this that financial resources that become available should be devoted.  The motion now before the House, however, in the name of the Oopposition would instead have us devoting vast sums of money to the tune of £100 million in a wasteful and unjustified way in an obsessive chase of their vague and undefined concept of equality.  Clearly no socially conscious Government could follow such policies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  When one notes the many discriminations contained in our social welfare code, one feels somewhat ashamed that these discriminations have been tolerated for so many years.  It does not do our cause any good to have to say that equality comes now as a result of an EC directive that has been in existence for over six years.  The complete lack of attention to eliminating the discriminatory aspects of our social welfare code and the lack of attention by the previous Government is lamentable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the contributions of the Minister and the Minister of State on this matter which deeply concerns us all.  Where the earnings of a wife are very low and where the reduction in the benefit entitlement of the husband would represent a substantial loss of income to that household, I welcome the fact that the Minister will seek ways and means of making sure that people on this low level of income will not suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned about the plight of low income households and the level of breadline poverty on which people live.  The Commission on the Status of Women reported in 1972 on one of the most obvious and overt discriminations concerning social welfare, particularly <Col N="2534" /> concerning the married woman working outside the home.  That happened 12 years ago.  Consistently, each report of the commission would just come out and be referred to the House.  The Second Process Report on the Implementation of the Recommendations in the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women of December 1978 is worth quoting.</P>
    <P>In working towards the elimination of discrimination between men and women in the field of social welfare, the Committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>They mean the Women's Representative Committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;considers that the ultimate objective should be to grant social werlare benefits on a basis involving no discrimination based on sex and founded on the principle of true equality between men and women in the home and in employment.</P>
    <P>I viewed with concern during this debate the total obscuring of the basic rights of women who up to now have been discriminated against to the extent of being defrauded of their rightful benefits from contributions just because they were married.  It has been pointed out here and it is part of the traditional role of women in the home that the great majority of our married women are based in the home with only domestic responsibilities. They, therefore, will not be affected, nor will the household incomes be affected by this legislation.</P>
    <P>There is another group of women who will not be affected by this.  This is the group who are working part-time.  Up to 90 per cent of our part time workers are women who because of their ineligibility on account of the hours worked to claim any social welfare will not be part of this equality.  Poor consolation, but it is some consolation, that their household incomes will not be affected.</P>
    <P>What I would like this House to consider is that one of the most dismaying and distressing features is that one of the main reasons for the very problems with which Deputies on each side of the House <Col N="2535" /> are concerned with regard to reduction of the household income because of granting equality rights in social welfare is the very low earnings of women who are exploited on the labour market.  They are definitely and consistently kept beneath the social welfare line of benefit, to themselves anyway, or find themselves working at such low rates&mdash;some at one-sixth of a man's wage &mdash; that their very earnings are so dismal as to affect the household income.</P>
    <P>Members of this House would do well in the debate on this Bill to pay some attention to the little progress which we have made here regarding working conditions and pay for women and to examine their consciences with regard to the opposition and hysteria concerning the granting of equality, which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>As a mark of the extent of the discrimination against married women &mdash; and remember that we still have the lowest number of married women working outside the home within the whole EC, with perhaps the exception of Greece &mdash; even within that small number of married women who have gainful employment outside the home it will take £17 million to make up for what they were being denied in true equality up to now.  I would like this debate to be concentrated first on the fact that although we had six years in which to bring about the equalising of social welfare benefits for married women workers compared with the rest of the workforce, we are now here against a deadline because successive Governments did not do that.  They did not even attempt to modify the effects or bring in, even in an evolved way, the removal of the discrimination.  The very low earnings of women today highlight the problems we are now discussing, and rightly so, with regard to low income households.</P>
    <P>It was not until we were up against the deadline of having to bring in this legislation that we began to think seriously about it.  Many other women and I believe that the tradition in this country of lack of political will towards granting equality for women in equal pay, <Col N="2536" /> equal opportunities and now in social welfare benefits is such that it has taken a European directive on each occasion to get us seriously to think about it.  As members of the Community, each time we have had to obey such a directive we have done so, not at the beginning of the time given but at the very end.  We have done it against a background of allegations that women in some way are taking away the rights of men.  Much of this debate has had a colouring of this.  This can only bring about a backlash against women along with all their other difficulties.</P>
    <P>Another point on which we must take care is that in introducing this legislation we do not force women through a backlash, psychologically or otherwise, to give up the low paid jobs, bad as they are, and go back inside the home, or drive them into the black economy, where not alone would they continue to be badly paid but they and the nation would lose out.</P>
    <P>I am using this opportunity to focus the minds of the Members of the House on what this legislation is all about.  It is about righting great wrongs.  It is about giving some justice against great injustices down the years.  It is about honouring the place of the woman in the home as the breadwinner.  Even in our changing times when men, because their traditional work has gone or because of the results of the recession, have become the parent in the home, having been made redundant and becoming unemployed, regardless of the wife becoming the breadwinner, because she is seen totally as a dependant of her husband, even though she pays her full social welfare contribution, she does not have the right to be seen as a worker in her own right and to claim on behalf of her family and her husband the rights which that social welfare contribution gave to her husband when he was earning, unless he is an invalid.  That does something dreadful to both men and women.  We are talking about a concept of sharing equality and responsibility at work and in the home. Surely we must first remove the legal obstacle against allowing either husband or wife to act as breadwinner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2537" /> I welcome the concern of the Minister and everybody who has spoken in this House for the protection of low income households.  I ask the Members to accept that a commitment has been given that that area will be looked at.  They should see this legislation as something positive and overdue, which we all, as legislators, should welcome and work positively upon.  Above all, they should not see it in some way as punishing women further or pushing them back along the small distance which they have come in progress with regard to employment outside the home.  They should see it as a sharing of responsibilities and the ensuring of equal opportunities for women at work. It is pointless to talk about equal treatment for women at work when under the law and through the social welfare system we did not give them the same rights as other workers even though they were paying the same contributions.</P>
    <P>I welcome this, overdue as it is.  I ask all Members to welcome it.  The areas of concern can be worked on, but we must not allow the debate to obscure the removal of one of the greatest injustices and resentments women have had up to now because of the way married women were treated when they worked outside the home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a lot of what Deputy Barnes has said.  We must be concerned to ensure that there is equality in social legislation.  There is no need to repeat what Deputy McCarthy said that we are committed to the principle of equality and ensuring that women get equal treatment in legislation.  What we are concerned about is the manner in which the Government are going about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at the speech made by the Minister of State and some of the comments made by the Minister last night, it will demonstrate that no one will be satisfied with the way the Government are approaching this very serious issue. The Minister of State referred to the contributions made from this side of the House and said the Opposition did not know what they wanted.  It should be very <Col N="2538" /> clear to everyone that the social policy of Fianna Fáil has not changed over the years.  We want a social policy which will ensure that those dependent on social welfare &mdash; the old, handicapped and unemployed &mdash; will be able to have for themselves and their families a decent standard of living.  They have not had that for the last few years.  We have an unprecedented level of poverty at present and no one can challenge that.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to increases which were made and how proud the Government were of their achievements in the area of social welfare. He said that in 1983-84 social welfare rates were increased by 18 per cent. That was over two years.  In their last two years in office Fianna Fáil gave increases of 50 per cent.  That is the difference in policy between the two Governments when in office.  He referred to the fact that children's allowances had been increased by 7 per cent since 1 August this year.  That was one increase they gave while in power and they celebrated their second anniversary in office yesterday.  In their last two years in office Fianna Fáil gave an increase of 25 per cent each year. Yet the Minister of State said that the Opposition do not know what they want. People will judge the concern this Government have demonstrated.  From what the Minister of State told us, it is obvious they have not got the concern of the unfortunate people who are depending on social welfare at heart.  Recently an unemployed person came to see me looking for tranquilisers for his wife.  He had received a bill for building materials. He lost his job through no fault of his own.  I would say it was through the fault of the economic policies of this Government. He told me he gets £83 a week for himself, his wife and four children.  He pays £6 a week for a bag of coal which lasts three days.  That is all he can afford. For the rest of the week, in the middle of winter, they have no coal or fuel and therefore, no fire.</P>
    <P>Where do the Government stand in relation to the national fuel scheme?  Up to 1983 it was stated in a circular issued to the health boards that where there was <Col N="2539" /> hardship the community welfare officers were at liberty to interpret the position and grant free fuel under that scheme to those on short time and other benefit. Since this Government came to office, with a Labour Minister for Health and Social Welfare, a new paragraph was inserted in that circular which states that those on unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and disability benefit are excluded from the free scheme.  Yet the Minister of State tells us we can see the concern the Government have demonstrated.  The circulars are there for anyone who wants to check the record.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State thinks the Opposition do not know what they want or are wrong because they believe the community welfare officers should still have discretion to give vouchers for free fuel to people who are unable to meet their commitments, he and the Government should look again at their social policy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the equality legislation has the Minister consulted the Council for the Status of Women or the Irish Congress of Trade Unions?  They are not happy about his legislation.  When the Minister told us it would cost £17 million he did not say he would be saving £15 million by virtue of removing the dependants allowance from men whose wives are working or are in receipt of benefit or assistance.  Neither did he say that he would take half the children's allowance away from them.  That will represent a major saving for the State.</P>
    <P>The Council for the Status of Women have expressed reservations about this legislation as have the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They are concerned that people will be victimised and that the incomes going into the houses of low earners will be considerably reduced. This will put them further into the poverty bracket.  We cannot be sure about the Minister's figures.  Great hardship will be caused to many people as a result of the fact that the dependants allowance will be reduced.  A married man with four children whose wife is <Col N="2540" /> working, perhaps only part time and getting £30 a week, will lose £41.72 as a result of this legislation.  Then we are told the Opposition do not know what they want.</P>
    <P>We were told that 35,000 families would be eligible for the family income supplement, but the reality is that only 4,700 families have applied for it.  That is an indication of how the Minister puts his figures into perspective.  Not even one-seventh of the number of people we were told were going to apply have applied and the reason they have not applied is that it does not take account of the fact that people who are on unemployment assistance, doing part-time work or even small farmers on very low income are not eligible to apply for that scheme.  We were told that the number would be about 35,000.  I doubt if the scheme proposed to be introduced will cost £17 million.  It would appear that there would be a major saving to the Government in many areas, particularly in relation to the children's allowance and the removal of the dependant's allowance.</P>
    <P>The Minister last night in proposing his amendment noted that the EC directive on equality of treatment for men and women in social welfare matters came into effect in December 1978 when Fianna Fáil were in office and that no real attempt was made by that Government to implement the directive.  That is incorrect. The Minister knows that, because Fianna Fáil in office set up an interdepartmental committee at the time of that directive to study what the effects of that legislation would be and to bring forward recommendations.  The Minister in his speech last night made reference to what Deputy Haughey, then Minister for Health, said at the time.  He must criticise Deputy Haughey in this House.  No Member of the House is in the position to stand up and criticise Deputy Haughey, the leader of our party, in relation to social welfare and social policy, because in his capacity as Minister for Finance, Minister for Social Welfare, Minister for Justice and Taoiseach he has been responsible for implementing some of the most far-reaching and radical social <Col N="2541" /> legislation not alone in this country but in Europe, for the sake of those people who are least well able to look after themselves. He introduced the free electricity scheme, free travel and free telephones, very important and much appreciated at present when so many people are in fear of their lives because of the number of break ins and robberies going on.  That enlightened social approach has always been the hallmark of Fianna Fáil.  That free telephone rental scheme is very much appreciated.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, is coming in later he might tell us why this Government after two years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  I would like to know why after two years, seeing that in this week we were able to introduce two bits of emergency legislation and have one passed this morning and one passed in the afternoon, we are not in a position to see this legislation, to debate it here and have it implemented. By 22 December if the Dáil adjourns for the Christmas recess we will be in breach of the EC directive.  I fail to understand why that should be.  The Government are two years in office, and much of the homework had been done for them by Fianna Fáil before we left office.  Fianna Fáil in office wanted the philosophy that runs through the way in which this Government intend to implement this legislation, but I would like to know why it is not being implemented in effect this week.  Is it because of a dispute with the employees?  Is it because of the embargo applying in the Department of Social Welfare under which two out of the three vacancies will be left unfilled?  Under the Government's policy unemployment has risen by 60,000 since they came into office.  Is it because the officers in the Department of Social Welfare are unable to cope because of the Government's disastrous policies?  Is the reason as stated in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on Sunday, that the unions are not prepared to implement it?  The Government should come clean <Col N="2542" /> and tell us what they intend to do, and not come in here and act the socialist when the record is there of not being fully behind legislation that will do justice to women but will not cause hardship and not increase the unprecedented level of poverty which we have seen over the last two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get an opportunity to say a few words on this legislation.  Deputy O'Hanlon has made the case very well for anyone who wanted to listen.  He spelt out how over the years Fianna Fáil have been the one party who have been to the fore in bringing forward and making progress in legislation giving social justice and equality to persons of all persuasions, of all means and to both sexes.  The records are there in the Official Report and in legislation over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it must be accepted that discrimination exists in the social welfare system between men and women.  This form of discrimination must be abolished. We on this side support this concept totally. Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome states that equal pay means not only equal wages or salaries but also equality for any other considerations whether in cash or kind which the worker receives directly or indirectly in the course of his or her employment.  Last evening the Minister inclined to cloud the issue, as he does always, by implying that Fianna Fáil had not implemented the directive immediately in 1978, but he is aware that this type of legislation is complicated and that it is time to bring it into effect.  He has been a number of years in the post and what has he done?  We have been waiting for a Bill for some time, and when he was questioned as to when it would be introduced we were told time and time again that it would be very soon.  The deadline for the directive is 19 December, and that is coming up in seven days' <Col N="2543" /> time and still we have no Bill before us. I believe the reason for that is that the Minister is afraid and does not want the Bill to be introduced here in this House because it will once again show the people of the nation the skulduggery and indecision that he has towards this type of legislation. It does not surprise me that it does not come forward while we are sitting and can debate it.  If I were the Minister I would choose Christmastime when the spotlight is some place else to keep down the defenceless, the hungry and the less well off members of society and push them further into the gutter.  That is what the Minister is doing with his refusal to bring legislation before the House.  A great fear among those on social welfare is that because of the manner in which the Government delay to implement the directive, families already on low incomes will have these incomes further reduced, and the Minister in his speech last evening confirmed that.  Over the last year many decisions of the Government have hit hardest at the least well off members of our society.  Early on we had the imposition of school bus fares.  We have had cutbacks on food subsidies, on bread, milk and butter, and those affected all members of society but most of all those on the breadline.  We heard much talk about the family income supplement, but it has not lived up to the publicity that the Minister and the Government displayed about it.  Then the fuel scheme was tampered with.  I am sure every Deputy could relate examples of people who, because they may be in receipt of as little as £1 per week in addition to their old age pension, were cut off summarily from receiving free fuel this year though they had received it in the past couple of years. This shows the lack of knowledge on the part of the Government of the difficulties being experienced by many of our old people.</P>
    <P>Again, on 24 October there was a Government decision to exclude specifically unemployed persons and their dependants from a double social welfare payment at Christmas.  The practice of the <Col N="2544" /> double payment was introduced by Fianna Fáil.  Last year the Coalition indicated that they did not intend paying it but under pressure from us they relented. This year they have not given in fully with the result that those who are most in need of a double payment will not receive it.</P>
    <P>According to what is known as the national plan, all food subsidies are to be abolished by 1986.  We are told that there will be a new child benefit scheme, but when one examines the small print one finds that the payments will be taxable. This is another example of the sleight of hand attitude of the Government.  It is another example of the continuing attacks by the Government on our people.</P>
    <P>I believe that there should be equality between men and women in regard to pay and social benefits, but this equality should not be at the expense of the family.  I fear that under the legislation we are discussing the family will suffer and that there will be further breakdowns in family life with a consequent deterioration in society.  What concerns me about the present administration is their mishandling of the totality of social justice. The country is crying out for a return to power of Fianna Fáil so that we may continue the progress that was being made in this most important field.  I am confident that at the next general election the people will realise who they must return to power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for agreeing to let me use some of his time. This enables me to contribute to this very important debate on equal treatment for men and women especially in the matter of social security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effects of the proposals, particularly in regard to the definition of dependency, could be very serious for low income families.  Thousands will be affected by the legislation.  As I understand it, a husband who is head of the household and is in receipt of social welfare benefit for himself, his wife and children, will lose the benefit for his wife and 50 per cent of the benefit for his children if, as is the position in many such <Col N="2545" /> cases, his wife is working.  This puts him in a catch-22 situation.  In many of these cases a wife goes to work to preserve the marriage and to supplement the social welfare income.  What we are proposing here would create great hardship for such families.</P>
    <P>I welcome the principle of equal treatment for men and women in the area of social welfare benefit.  The principle of the EC directive is to eliminate from certain social security schemes all discrimination based on sex, either directly or indirectly, by reference particularly to family status but it is clear that the greatest impact of this directive will be on the larger families who are dependent on social welfare, because they may lose up to £40 per week as a result.  The net loss in the case of a husband, wife and six children where he is in receipt of unemployment benefit and the wife is working will be in the region of £48.60.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House of some promises that were made in the Coalition's programme for Government. I quote:</P>
    <P>Unemployment and disability benefits will be kept in line with take home wages and salaries.  Expenditure on other social benefits will be maintained in the light of inflation so that, even if a drop occurs in the immediate future in the purchasing power of better off groups in the community, the living standards of the section of the community dependant on social welfare payments will be maintained. Additional help over and above the standard increases will be provided for specially disadvantaged groups.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and to the Government to show concern for the weaker sections who have been affected already as a result of the withdrawal of food subsidies.  Many such people in my constituency approached me at the weekend to express the fear that as a result of this legislation their living standards will be eroded further.</P>
    <P>In December 1978 the Council of Ministers adopted a directive regarding the <Col N="2546" /> gradual introduction of the equal treatment of men and women in social security schemes, covering especially illness, invalidity, old age, accident benefits as well as family allowances.  I submit that it was never intended that families depending on social welfare payments would lose financially as a result of that directive.</P>

      <P>I should like to comment first on Deputy O'Hanlon's remark that the Minister was incorrect in saying that equal treatment would cost £17 million in a full year.  The Deputy said that £15 million would be saved as a result of the change in the dependency conditions.  That is incorrect.  The amount set aside by the Government in respect of the net cost of equal treatment is £17 million.  That takes account of any savings that may arise as a result of any dependency condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the implementation of this directive represents an important milestone for many women who currently find themselves accorded less than equal treatment as regards entitlements under the social welfare code. The practical substance underlying the principle of equal treatement is recognition that the concept of a husband as the sole or invariable breadwinner in a family is no longer one that applies universally in our society.  Equal treatment in statutory <Col N="2547" /> social welfare schemes is, therefore, particularly welcome as a coming to terms with what is anyway a fact of life as well as constituting an important step in the attainment of equal opportunities generally for women.</P>
      <P>For many years now, married women have identified as key areas of discrimination their unequal treatment when claiming, for example, sickness benefit, as old age pensioners unable to claim for their husbands, except in very exceptional circumstances, and particularly in the area of unemployment where they receive unemployment benefit for less duration than men and, in the case of unemployment assistance, are effectively debarred from the scheme.  With the implementation of the directive, some 40,000 married women will receive increases in their weekly entitlements and will be entitled to claim for 78 days longer than previously was the case.  Married women will also be given entitlement to apply for unemployment assistance in the same way as other unemployed persons.  All of these changes are changes which have been fought for long and hard by women over the years.  Indeed, much of the correspondence I have received since assuming the office of Minister of State for Women's Affairs has concerned these very areas, and I therefore welcome the fact that they are now being effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not surprising that the most complex area in regard to equality of treatment is that relating to increases in respect of dependants.  Hitherto, as the underlying assumption was that the husband was always the breadwinner, only he could generally receive increases of benefit in respect of his wife and children, exceptions arising only where he was incapable of self support through mental or physical infirmity, in which case the wife could claim him as a dependant. There are now, however, about 128,000 married women in the labour force, a growth of almost 90,000 in the period 1971-1983.  Many thousands of married men are being paid adult dependant allowances in respect of wives who are either in employment or receiving a social <Col N="2548" /> welfare payment in their own right.  It is clear, therefore, that it is necessary to apply genuine and uniform criteria of dependency in all cases even if unfortunately in some instances there will be certain people losing out.  Under the new system a spouse who is in employment or who is receiving social welfare payments in their own right will not in general be regarded as an adult dependant.  I know that as a result of this there will be some cases &mdash; for instance, where the wife is in low paid employment &mdash; where family income will suffer a loss.  However, the Minister could not, in an attempt to meet this situation, continue to allow a husband to claim the adult dependant allowance for his wife and at the same time be seen to implement equality of treatment. Clearly, equal treatment could not result in an over-generous dependency condition being applied in this way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there will be provisions in the Bill which will allow the Minister to bring in, on a limited basis, measures to alleviate hardship cases.  This combined with the new family income supplement scheme should ensure a mitigation of some of the losses involved. Overall, then, we are talking about an important equalising measure for women which will involve a sizeable Exchequer cost and will benefit many homes.  When the Minister's legislation goes through, the Irish social security code will for the first time treat married working women as economically independent in their own right rather than seeing them as dependent on their husbands or, indeed, as some form of secondary labour force who somehow happen to be there but are seen and treated as different to other workers. It will, I hope, as a result be more difficult in future for people to disparage and reduce the role of married women in the labour force as their full contribution and right to both work and claim benefit in the same way as others will be fully validated with the implementation of the directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion tabled by Deputy McCarthy.  I would emphasise, as did Deputy McCarthy last night, Fianna Fáil's commitment to the <Col N="2549" /> principle of equality for women.  Our party are totally opposed to any form of discrimination against women.  I was very disappointed with the Minister's speech last night, as he devoted the greater part of his speech to criticising Fianna Fáil and blaming Deputy Haughey for not doing anything when he was Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  Since this Government assumed office in November 1982 they have been blaming Fianna Fáil for everything that has happened. The result of the recent by-elections and European election should indicate to the Government that the people no longer accept this.  The time has come for the Government to act in accordance with the principles enunciated by them before the last general election.  To date they have failed to implement their policies.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy representing the constituency of Dublin south-west which includes Tallaght and Clondalkin I am representing one of the constituencies worst hit by Government policies.  We heard a lot about the family income supplement, which was one of the key issues for the Labour Party prior to the last general election.  It fell far short of what was promised.  In relation to this Bill one must have some doubts about it, having regard to the way the Minister for Social Welfare spoke about it last night.  The Minister said that the Government had provided £17 million to implement the provisions of this legislation.  They may have provided this money on paper, but the money is not there.  That is one of the reasons why the introuduction of this Bill was delayed.  The general consensus about this Bill is that the gains will be very small by comparison with the losses. It is also clear that the greatest impact will be on larger families depending on social welfare with one spouse on very low earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister would answer this query I would be only too willing to afford her the opportunity.  This morning I received a telephone call from a constituent suffering from a heart ailment and who has been in receipt of disability benefit for the last five years.  This man has a wife and one child.  He is now in receipt of £70 <Col N="2550" /> disability benefit.  His wife works and her earnings are approximately £70.  Having checked it with the officials this man claims that he will now lose anything from £30 to £35 of his disability benefit.  Is this what the Minister was talking about when she was speaking here tonight?</P>

      <P>It is a sorry day for this House and it is a sorry day for the Irish people when a member of the Labour Party introduces this type of legislation. All the Minister could do last night was blame Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>When Deputy O'Hanlon was speaking tonight he outlined the situation as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.  We do not have to worry about our record on social welfare.  Now that Deputy Fennell has confirmed what I was told in the phone call this morning I am very disappointed with this legislation.

      <P>I listened to the Minister without interruption.  Even if the Government cannot perform I would at least expect some manners from a representative of the Government.  I have <Col N="2551" /> been a long time in this House and when I come in here I listen to speakers without interruption.  It is no wonder the Government are in disarray.  The Government have been in office for more than two years and they have blamed Fianna Fáil for not introducing legislation to implement the EC Directive.  That job is the responsibility of the Minister of the day. Great play was made last night about the Government making a provision of £17 million for this but we must wait to see if the money will be available next year.  Is the lack of money the reason for delaying the legislation?  We have been told that the legislation will be introduced over the Christmas period so that we will have an opportunity to discuss it in our constituencies. I hope this will be the case.</P>
      <P>I again support the motion of Deputy McCarthy and I am glad to be a member of the same party and to have an opportunity to speak on it.  When it is put tonight I hope we will have the support of the Labour and Independent Deputies. At the beginning of their period of office the Government made great play of the amount of legislation they would introduce.  Are we the only country in the EC to have delayed the introduction of this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will celebrate their two-year period in office by reneging on the poor, the unemployed.  If the two Ministers concerned here, Deputies B. Desmond and Fennell, would care to come to Tallaght or Clondalkin in my constituency they would see that seven out of ten households have not got a member working and they will find that eight families out of ten have not got a breadwinner.  Then they will see the cruelty they are imposing by not granting <Col N="2552" /> a second week of unemployment benefit at Christmas.  Of course they have reneged on the poor for years.  They have reneged on all their general election promises in 1982.  They got themselves elected on those promises but they will see the people's reaction when they are next called on to go to the ballot box. They showed their contempt for the Government in by-elections and in the European elections.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were the first Government to introduce double benefits for the poor at Christmas.  Of course the present Government do not think of the unemployed, or is their problem that they have not got the money?  At Christmas the old and the needy require a little extra money.  It is a time when we all should think of our neighbours.  A double week benefit, particularly in Dublin, would have relieved enormous hardship.  When we walk into the division lobbies later I hope the Labour Party will be on this side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been saying that the duty and responsibility rest on any elected Government to endeavour to provide for citizens profitable, full-time work.  It will be interesting to hear from the Minister how it will transpire that, under the provisions of this Bill, we shall create 10,000 part-time jobs, a most useful exercise.  It appears we are prepared to spend money on the provision of those 10,000 part-time jobs while at the same time putting at risk the jobs of those at present in full-time, permanent employment.  It is correct to say that, because of cutbacks that have been implemented, some thousands of our people have lost their jobs, not only in the private sector, in industry, but in secure, Government or semi-State employment.  Therefore I fail to see the wisdom of placing full-time, permanent jobs at risk, dispensing with the services of people in such positions, through the creation of a fund for the purpose of introducing part-time employment for those people, through the manpower services, people at present registered with labour exchanges and in receipt of long-term unemployment benefit or assistance.</P>
      <P>I have been sadly disappointed, indeed disillusioned, that after over 60 years of native Government, a serious effort is not being made to provide our people with a reasonable standard of living through the maintenance of full-time employment.  I do not accept that our youth should be educated for emigration. The young people who are emigrating are better educated than those who left the country some years ago.  Parents have worked hard and spent thousands of pounds on the education of such young people.  According to statistics 100 people are emigrating daily.  With emigration reaching 700 per week does the Minister expect the legislation before us to do anything to create more employment?  I would not be optimistic about that.</P>
      <P>I support and applaud any effort by the Minister to provide employment, particularly for those who are on the unemployment register and do not wish to be on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Chair but I view the Bill as an effort to give those who are unemployed £70 for two-and-a-half days work rather than having them drawing unemployment benefit for not doing any work.  It is my understanding that those people can earn as much money as they wish for the remainder of the week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is not taken that £70 per week is sufficient remuneration for any man, married or single.  If work cannot be provided now, I wonder where the work will be created for these proposals.  I am anxious to know what the position will be for a married man with a large family who is in receipt of unemployment assistance and who <Col N="2557" /> works for two-and-a-half days for £70 but whose unemployment benefits will be in excess of that figure.  Will he be paid the difference?  I do not want any unemployed people to be worse off as a result of working two-and-a-half days.  It is vitally important that people should work and I do not think any person wants to line up outside a labour exchange seeking what can only be described as money which lowers his dignity as a citizen. Nobody is anxious to be drawing unemployment benefit.  I do not accept the argument that there are people who will not work.  There is a great degree of self pride left in our people.  They like to be independent, fully developed and associated with some form of creative activity. I do not believe, as has been said thousands of times, that there are people who would not work if it was available for them.  People will work if the jobs are there and a good standard of living is guaranteed to the worker and his family at the end of the week.  Workers do not aspire to being rich or wealthy but they expect to be better off on Friday night when work finishes than they were when they started on Monday morning.  If under the Bill attractive employment is created I have no doubt a section of our people will be grateful to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the Bill merely scratch the surface.  They are an attempt to assist those who are anxious to get off the unemployment register but we need to know more about it.  I presume there will be a debate in the House when the Minister for Labour outlines the schemes; the variety of work and whether work will be available for plasterers, bricklayers, carpenters, roofers, plumbers, slaters and a variety of other tradesmen. If the move is to let the unemployment position limp from month to month for one year it may bring some relief to those anxious to be employed. To be unemployed must be one of the greatest disasters to befall any individual, especially an energetic and enthusiastic person who wishes to be engaged in some creative activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the proposals in the Bill every success.  Let this not be the last word in <Col N="2558" /> relation to the provisions of useful and effective schemes which will be an asset to everyone in the towns, cities and country.  There are a variety of schemes crying out for attention.  I hope what the Minister has in mind will reach a very satisfactory outcome.  I cannot see this making any great impact, but I welcome it even if it only provides Members of this House with an opportunity to deal with the problems of those in receipt of social welfare benefits who are very anxious to be relieved of the responsibility of having to queue up each week for their benefits.</P>
    <P>In my view the Minister should have given more notice about the abolition of the wet-time scheme because 40,000 building workers are likely to be affected. I agree with the Minister that circumstances today are completely different from what they were when the scheme was introduced.  I hope the abolition of this scheme will focus attention on the building industry.  In my opinion there is no greater source of employment than a thriving building industry.  I want to pay a tribute to the 40,000 dedicated workers who have given a great service to the building and construction industry.  They have worked in all kinds of weather.  I hope the Minister, in consultation with his colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Labour, will not let this be the last occasion when serious thought will be given to the problems facing the building and construction workers.  Although these 40,000 workers will be losing benefits under the wet-time scheme from next month, they will expect an input into the building industry so that they will not have to worry about wet-time because they will be guaranteed security of employment by a thriving building industry.  It is very necessary for this country that the building industry be a thriving one.</P>
    <P>This is a very short Bill which must be welcomed.  I hope it will lead to a reduction in the number of registered unemployed, but other moves must be made in co-operation with the Manpower service, the Department of Labour and <Col N="2559" /> all the training organisations to provide jobs for our young people as well as for our not so young.  However, we still have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>When the time comes we will be judged by the electorate on our record.  There is nothing more important than providing jobs.  As I said on many occasions, if we have our priorities right our first priority should be the provision of employment. I wish the Minister luck with this Bill.  We will have another opportunity to have a further debate when the Minister for Labour introduces his Bill.  Any step which takes people off the dole is welcome, but I do not want my constituents to approach me or the other Deputies representing our area telling us that they were better off before the Bill was passed.  We must avoid that.  I hope the Department of Social Welfare will ensure that no person who is registered unemployed will receive less for working than he is drawing at the moment.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction; but it is not steps we need to deal with problems of this kind but a race.  We have a responsibility to provide employment for a very large number of fine honourable boys and girls who unfortunately are unemployed at present.  We must accept responsibility for providing employment. There would not be so many on the dole queues if private enterprise was encouraged to create more jobs thus taking people off the labour exchanges.  Only tax reliefs will help create employment.</P>

      <P>I welcome any legislation which will help to reduce the numbers on the unemployed list.  I particularly welcome any legislation which will help young people, but I regret that time was not allowed today for the Minister for Labour to speak.  The Minister said that the Minister for Labour would be giving an outline of the scheme in this House <Col N="2560" /> tomorrow.  It is a great pity some arrangement was not made to facilitate the Minister for Labour to make this information available to the House today.</P>
      <P>I welcome any legislation which will help to reduce the numbers of unemployed especially when there are 225,000 people on the unemployment register. Under this new scheme, persons who have been unemployed for at least a year and drawing unemployment assistance will be offered work for two and a half days per week.  Who is going to make employment available for these people? I am aware that the Department of the Environment scheme may be discontinued or replaced.</P>
      <P>We are also told that the work will be of a community nature and non-profit making.  If we are ever going to solve unemployment and the economic and financial problems we must create and provide productive employment on a short or long term basis.  This work will be available for 52 weeks of the year and the wages of £70 per week will be subject to income tax.  It will be for two-and-a half days per week and it will be open to people to find employment for the remainder of the week but we all know &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will accept it &mdash; that there is no incentive for young people to work because of the income tax they have to pay.  It is unfortunate that this Bill specifically mentions income tax.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister for Labour will encourage young people to accept this kind of scheme.  There are criticisms daily of the income tax system and there is no incentive to work.  It is a pity that the details of this scheme were not mentioned in the House so that the Members who spoke in the debate would have been in a position to speak far more knowledgeably on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputies for their contributions to the Bill.  I propose to reply in the order in which the sections of the Bill are laid out, namely, the social employment scheme and the abolition of the wet time-scheme.  The social employment scheme is being operated by the <Col N="2561" /> Minister for Labour and Deputies will have an opportunity of discussing the details on the Supplementary Estimate debate for the Department of Labour. The Minister for Labour will speak in detail on Friday in regard to the Bill. He is unable to contribute to the debate today as he is in Brussels and will also be there tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill solely relate to facilitating the introduction of the scheme whereas the details will, of course, be a matter for the Minister for Labour.  Generally speaking, applications for participation in the scheme will be accepted for the employment of long term unemployed on projects which respond clearly to identified community needs.  They could range from environmental projects to those in the arts and cultural areas.  The projects must have a non-profit orientation and must not be in substitution for existing employment or bring about a reduction in the hours of work of existing employees.  I concede that it is not easy to meet these criteria. The introduction of this scheme involved considerable soul-searching and administrative analysis, particularly in the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Finance and the Department of Labour.  However, the scheme was eventually agreed by the Government and will be operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy and Deputy De Rossa said that the scheme merely represented a transfer of money from the Department of Social Welfare to another Department but that is not correct.  The gross cost of the scheme next year is estimated at around £29.5 million.  The savings arising from the Vote for Social Welfare as a result of this scheme are estimated at £11.5 million.  Admittedly, these are subjective estimates as they must be in terms of employment provided by the scheme.  Nevertheless, the basis of our approach is that the scheme will involve a net additional expenditure of £18 million in 1985.  That provision has been incorporated into the general Estimates of our Department.  We will be monitoring its progress, I will give it every support and encouragement and, like all <Col N="2562" /> new schemes, there is a degree of unpredictability about the take-up and the overall effectiveness.  If we were to do nothing, we would equally be subjected to considerable criticism.</P>
    <P>An essential feature of the scheme is that it is designed to give people who are now unemployed some opportunity to get employment and come back into the conventional habit of work.  I agree that it must be utterly demoralising for the many who are long term unemployed and any measure which holds out hope and which is reasonably cost effective is worthwhile and merits the support of Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy implied that there was a connection between the introduction of the social employment scheme and the abolition of the special projects for the employment of young persons operated by the Department of the Environment and funded by the youth levy.  Again, that is not true.  The Government decided in November 1983 to discontinue the special projects for two main reasons: there was considered to be a very low training in work experience element involved in the projects for young people, and labour costwise it was very expensive.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy and Deputy Flanagan made the point that only single people would benefit from the scheme. This again is an over-simplification.  If one examines the position, one will find that the married person who is currently receiving the maximum rate of long term unemployment assistance &mdash; namely, £56.45 per week will benefit to the tune of £14.  In the case of a single person, the gain will be far higher, up to £26 extra when account is taken of PRSI and PAYE deductions.  There is that element of incentive.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy referred to the many State agencies dealing with the unemployed &mdash; AnCO, social welfare exchanges and the National Manpower Service.  He suggested one point of contact in each area or county for the unemployed. He can rest assured that he is talking about an issue which is very dear to my heart.</P>

      <P>I saw a slight step forward in that development when the Government recently appointed the chief executive of the YEA as chairman of AnCO in a fundamental effort to bring about some co-ordination and integration of the multiplicity of services for a population of 3.5 million.  It is fantastic what a mess we have managed to get into in the delivery of the multiplicity of those services.  The Deputy's suggestion will be considered in relation to the White Paper on Manpower Policy which is being prepared by the Minister for Labour.  That Minister and I were the first two Ministers of any Government to share emphatically the view that there must be co-ordination, integration and unified delivery. That can and should be done as rapidly as possible.  I would point out that there is at present a close liaison between the Departments and the National Manpower Agency in relation to the placement of the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the wet-time scheme, Deputy McCarthy suggested a lack of consultation on the abolition of this scheme.  There were inevitably time constraints. I do not deny that.  There had been a whole series of reviews since 1978 when the review committee was set up. While the question whether the scheme should be continued in operation was not one of the matters to be examined by the then committee, nevertheless the question arose for consideration during the course of the review.  It is true that at the annual conference of my union, the ITGWU, in 1981, there was a call for the abolition of the scheme.  At a subsequent meeting with the then Minister for Social Welfare it was agreed that it was necessary to consult with other interests, namely, the unions and the employers. There has been much consultation.  I have not found any great hostility to the Government's decision and, frankly, it is not reasonable to expect that the Government should continue to consult indefinitely and seek agreement <i>ad nauseam</i>.  In that context, there was no intention on <Col N="2564" /> my part in any way to refuse a consensus or to be discourteous to trade union or employer interests.  I had to take a decision. The problem in this country is that nobody takes a decision.  We go on the merry-go-round, consulting one another and, being the incestuous nation that we are in terms of sectional interest, eventually I had to write to the Construction Industry Federation and the Construction Industry Committee of Congress and inform them on 19 November of the Government's decision to wind up the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy wanted to know the reason why the fund was running down. The income over the last two or three years has shown a significant decline while the claims have remained fairly steady.  This is due, to a great extent, to the fact that there was no time limit on claiming recoupment of benefit.  A large proportion of claims related to stoppages which had occurred 12 months previously. I am glad to say that the officials in the Department of Social Welfare need no longer be weather watchers, nor will they be perennially checking in exchanges as to whether raincoats were worn on a given day.  That onerous responsibility will be removed from them.  The amount at present in the fund would not be sufficient to pay claims beyond the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa asked whether participation in the social employment scheme would displace people being made redundant or being put on lay off by local authorities.  An undertaking has been given to the ICTU that no such displacements will be made as a result of this scheme and the necessary measures will be taken in implementing the scheme to ensure that will not happen.  Deputy De Rossa also raised the question whether a person on unemployment assistance at a rate in excess of £70 a week would be penalised if he refused to take up employment under the scheme. Essentially, the scheme is intended to be a voluntary one.  There is no intention of penalising persons in the manner suggested. The Deputy also suggested that there is basically a Victorian or workhouse <Col N="2565" /> mentality behind the scheme.  Simply, many who become unemployed are unable to re-enter employment, no matter how hard they search for work or how diligently they go about it.  It is proposed under the scheme to offer such persons a basic, and admittedly limited, alternative in lieu of total non-involvement in the work ethos.  There will be some enhanced payments instead of unemployment assistance for doing work of benefit to the community.  The overall benefit of the scheme, while admittedly limited, will mean that a person on work of a temporary nature can move on to full time employment of a more permanent nature.  Secondly, there will be a production of socially useful goods and services and, with an increase in skills and better qualified people coming into the labour force, the prospects for the hard core of long term unemployed being able to compete successfully for any available employment opportunities will be enhanced generally.  The proposals in this Bill are valuable and I am pleased to introduce them.  I thank Deputies for making up their minds urgently as to where they stood in relation to the Bill.  I thank the House for the tolerance it showed for going through the Second Stage of the Bill today and hopefully taking Committee Stage tomorrow when the Bill was only published on Monday.  I am obliged to attend a meeting of Social Affairs Ministers in Brussels tomorrow.  I will not be here but Deputy Pattison will take the Bill through Committee Stage and hopefully he will pilot it through remaining Stages.  I thank the House for its co-operation in this matter and I hope I have not unduly imposed on Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I move amendment No.1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (4) (b), line 32, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No.1 is consequential on amendments Nos.2 and 3.  Amendment No.2, by exempting the provisions referred to by the application of section 2, will ensure the continuation of the existing statutory powers of the courts to make maintenance orders in respect of children up to 21 years of age.  At present a maintenance order may be made under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, or the Illegitimate Children (Affiliations Order) Act, 1930, as amended by the 1976 Act in respect of a child up to 21 years of age if he is receiving full time education.  Under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, a maintenance order may be made for a child up to 21 years without any requirement as to full time education.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as initiated, will have the effect that reference to 21 years in these statutes would be construed as reference to 18 years after the commencement of the Bill.  Consequently maintenance orders could not be made for children over 18 years of age except in respect of incapacitated children in respect of whom there is no upper age limit.  The Law Reform Commission considered the question of maintenance of children who had attained the age of majority.  In their working paper they indicated they were in favour of continuing the existing law relating to entitlement of maintenance up to 21 years.  In their final report, in paragraph 67, they concluded it would not be desirable to impose continuing maintenance obligations on parents of children other than those who are mentally or physically disabled who had reached the age of majority even if they were receiving full time education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission considered that the balance of the argument favoured the <Col N="2567" /> view that a necessary implication of attaining majority is that a person is sufficiently mature and independent to be responsible for his or her own maintenance rather than looking to their parents for support.  The Bill was drafted on the basis of the recommendations in the commission's final report.</P>
    <P>There are arguments on both sides.  On the one hand, maintenance under our laws has never been payable beyond the age of majority except in the case of handicapped children.  It can be argued that once the law accepts that a person has attained adulthood, obligations on his parents to support him beyond that age, where there is no question of handicap, should not be imposed by law.  It can also be argued that it is only where parents are separated and in dispute that one or other will, in practice, be obliged by law to maintain a child in higher education and that this is unfair.  For the majority of children whose parents are living together there will be no question of one or other of the parents being obliged to maintain the child in higher education. This argument is really on the lines that children of separated parents should be treated no differently from other children. It is leaving it to the parents themselves to decide up to what age beyond 16 years that they should maintain their child.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it can be argued that a reduction in the age of majority which is intended to be of benefit to young people should not operate to the detriment of some of them who may be in difficult family circumstances and not in a position to support themselves but whose parents can afford to support them.  Having listened to the views of Deputies who referred to this question and in particular to the persuasive argument put forward by Deputy Shatter and having weighed the arguments for and against, I have come to the conclusion that we should preserve the present position under which maintenance may be ordered up to the age of 21 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, as the Minister <Col N="2568" /> said, a point which was raised on Second Stage in general terms and very specifically by Deputy Shatter.  We agree with the Minister's proposal and support it.</P>
      <P>There is a small drafting point and that is that the Minister is continuing the term that provides for payments to be made for maintenance or support of children up to 21 years of age.  That occurs in a number of places.  We are taking the age of 18 years as being the adult age.  It might be desirable to say something like &ldquo;for minors up to the age of 18 and thereafter for eligible persons of full age up to the age of 21 years&rdquo;.  It is purely a drafting point.  Perhaps if the Minister was not under such pressure of time it might have been possible to look at that concept. However we can discuss it again.  We support this amendment.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The amendment was drafted on the basis that the provisions of the Illegitmate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, or the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, or the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, provide for payments to be made for the maintenance of children up to the age of 21 years.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this amendment.  It was badly needed.  I appreciate his flexibility in dealing with it in this way.  I know the original provisions of the Bill created some anxiety.  I have had contacts from people who followed the debate on Second Stage and who welcomed the fact that the Minister indicated that he would introduce such an amendment.  It is an important one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter is still left open and the Minister did not deal with it.  It could be <Col N="2569" /> dealt with in the context of the recommendations being made by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  What the Minister is doing is preserving the legal position as it was before the introduction of the Bill.  That is desirable, but we need to go a step further.  In the context of recognising that this is a support provision to enable children of broken marriages to have the facility of education, and in many cases of third level education, one of the problems with the existing law is that very often children in those circumstances will not be able to complete their education until they are about 22 years of age.  I hope the committee might make a recommendation that this area of law should be amended to allow the court some degree of flexibility to extend support payments to a stage where a young person has completed undergraduate education. Obviously it cannot be openended, but where a person was proceeding in undergraduate full time education between the ages of 18 and 21 and where a further year is required to complete the course, we should be more flexible, as they are in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister and wish to draw one matter to his attention &mdash; no one appears to have tabled an amendment about it &mdash; and that is the new provisions in section 6 which also relate to support payments and the Guardianship of Infants Act.  It refers to the age of 18 in the context of continuing maintenance payments beyond that age for young people who suffer from some form of permanent disability.  It would seem that that needs to be tidied up in the light of the Minister's amendment.  The Minister might want to consider that.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i>: I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (4)(b), line 35, after &ldquo;twenty-one years&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&rdquo;, and</P>
      <P>any statutory provision relating to prisons, to Saint Patrick's Institution or to any other place for the custody of persons&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to exclude from the effect of section 2 statutory provisions relating to sentencing, imprisonment, commital for trial, detention, remand in custody etc.  It was not intended when the legislation was being drafted that references to 21 years of age in such provisions should be construed as 18 as a result of a change in the age of majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods expressed concern about this and it is in response to comments he made that I am introducing this. There were a number of references to the age 21 years in statutory provisions relating to imprisonment, detention etc. For example, under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, where a person who is not less than 16 years of age and not more than 21 is convicted of an offence for which he is liable to be sentenced to penal servitude or imprisonment, he may instead be sentenced to be detained in St. Patrick's Institution.  The Prisons Act, 1970, amended the 1960 Act to empower the Minister for Justice by order to reduce the maximum age for commital to St. Patrick's Institution to 19 years, but no such order has been made.  It is 21 rather than 19 that is at issue here.  Other examples of references to 21 years of age in this type of legislation are to be found in <Col N="2571" /> the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, and the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914.</P>
    <P>The considerations that have to be taken into account when age limits have to be fixed in relation to imprisonment, detention etc, are not related to the age of majority and it would be quite inappropriate to effect any change in such ages in legislation dealing with the age of majority.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Woods for pointing this out and giving us an opportunity of putting down an amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment, naturally.  We saw this as something which could be very undesirable.  I appreciate that it was not in any way intended initially.  Obviously it is quite important that young persons would continue to be treated in the way they have been in the past, and I know this was the Minister's intention especially with the new facilities for young people being built currently in Wheatfield.  One can expect that these would be much more appropriate to the treatment of younger offenders and in that light we would not like to see any change in relation to the age which applies in their case &mdash; for instance, that they could be committed to Mountjoy or some of the other prisons.  Therefore, we welcome the Minister's amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of things to say about the section in general. Let us take section 2 (4) (b) and remove paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), and replace them with the following &ldquo;Section 19 of the Marriage (Ireland) Act, 1844, as amended by section 7 of the Marriage Act, 1972 is hereby amended by the substitution of 18 years for the word `21' in subsection (1) thereof&rdquo;.  The effect of such an amendment is to allow for the free age for marriage over 18 years <Col N="2572" /> without any consent.  A simple amendment such as that would make that change at this time.  The Minister said that this question is left to another Minister and to a later date, but it would be very simple at this stage to amend the Bill in the way I have suggested and thereby to introduce the free age for marriage at 18.  In this Bill we are creating an age of majority of 18.  At 18 young people now generally become adults, but one major question that remains is the consent for marriage.  A simple amendment of that sort at this point would effect that change.  The Minister on Second Stage gave his reasons for not wanting to do this at this time so we will not press the matter any further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i>: Yes, but marriage legislation has always been the subject of separate legislation.  The 1972 Marriage Act was promoted by the Minister for Health and I envisage that changes in the Marriage Act would be proposed by the Minister for Health.  We do not need an amendment at all to change the free age of marriage from 21 to 18.  There is provision in the Marriage Act for the Minister for Health to do this by order.  The Minister for Health could by order say that the free age of marriage is 18 from tomorrow if he wished to put the order together.  Therefore, it is not only a question of the difficulties of amending this legislation or the ease with which we could amend it.  It is appropriate that it would be the subject of separate legislation sponsored by a different Minister, but also it is a matter of policy rather than amendment or drafting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of issues about the age of marriage.  There is the issue of what the free age should be.  It is now 21.  One needs the consent of parents or guardians between 16 and 21 years and below 16 there is provision for the consent of the High Court.  A number of questions arise on the age of marriage. What would the free age be?  What would the minimum age of marriage be?  What exceptions would be made?  It is very easy to make a statutory provision to change it, especially to change the free age from <Col N="2573" /> 21 to 18; it simply requires an order from the Minister for Health.  The policy question would be a matter of more fundamental debate.  We have to deal with the issue of both minimum age of marriage and the free age of marriage and they may not necessarily be the same age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 2 (4) (b) (iv) &ldquo;the Social Welfare Acts, 1981 to 1984&rdquo;, here again we are making young people adults at 18 and we are having equal treatment legislation in the House, or it is coming on Friday according to the Minister.  We have had a motion here tonight and last night in relation to equal treatment. Again there would have been an opportunity here to reduce to 18 the qualifying limit for unemployment assistance without reference to the parents' means. In other words, if a young person becomes an adult at 18, as we say in this instance, something which is of fairly wide application at the moment, it would not be a very grave consequence in terms of expense, to alter the Social Welfare Acts in such a limited way since we make young persons adults at 18 by making them liable on their own means without taking into consideration their parents' means, while of course taking into account accommodation or whatever else they were getting.  There would appear to have been an opportunity here for that, but any alteration to these Acts was excluded from consideration here.</P>
      <P>In relation to section 2 (4) (b) (iv), there will be an anomaly, if the Social Welfare Acts are excluded, for instance in relation to such matters as blind persons' pensions.  We pointed to these on Second Stage.  They will remain anomalies once this Bill has gone through.  I appreciate that there are financial considerations, but for blind persons' pensions, for instance, again these would not be very great.  However, these are all being left to a later date apparently by a decision of the Government and by reference to the fact that the Minister presumably considers that it would be more suitable in some other legislation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i>: One can <Col N="2574" /> take the point the Deputy is making but there is another side of the coin.  The reduction of the age of majority to 18 and the application of that to social welfare payments would rule out for payment dependants between 18 and 21.  There are persons who at present quite obviously are entitled to social welfare payments in respect of children between 18 and 21.  If in logic we apply the social welfare code to the new age of majority, 18, then while there would be gains to certain individuals along the lines the Deputy suggests there would be a major reduction in the income of certain families because they would no longer be dependants under the social welfare code.  Consequently, if the changes are to be made in the Social Welfare Acts it is much better to leave it to the Minister for Social Welfare.  It is not a simple matter, and here we are saying that the social welfare legislation will not be affected by this Bill.  Arguments are to be made, some to the advantage of young people and some to the disadvantage of the families of young people when we are considering whether the appropriate age now for all social welfare legislation should be 18 in regard to independence or dependence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That kind of point could be covered here because it concerns eligible persons, dependent persons under 21. Language like that would cover that point.  There is no problem in drafting. The Minister is very good at coming back with some reason or other, but the main point is that he does not want in the context of this legislation to make any of these changes.  I am pointing out some of the anomalies which are there to be dealt with, presumably on another day.  Nevertheless, they become greater anomalies now because we have made young people adults at 18.  I ask the Minister to communicate some of these to the Minister for Social Welfare.  In the context of the budget it is normal for the Minister for Social Welfare to draw up a list of big, expensive items and little items and the things he can do.  I know it well because I have had many of these lists myself drawn up on previous occasions.  Some of <Col N="2575" /> these anomalies can be taken out.  Now that this change has been made here I ask the Minister to convey to the Minister for Health and Social Welfare the fact that this is an anomolous situation and that he should, where it is feasible without great expense, correct it &mdash; for instance in regard to blind pensions as one clear example.  That might be done in the context of the budget.</P>

    <P>In page 5, paragraph 1, line 35, after <Col N="2576" />&ldquo;attaining full age&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and any provision in such order or directions referring, whether expressly or by implication, to the period before which, or the time at which, a person attains the age of majority shall be construed accordingly&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a technical drafting amendment. The existing paragraph provides that court orders or directions in force before the commencement of the Act, relating to the control of money payable to an infant as a result of proceedings shall have effect as if any reference therein to the attainment of 21 years of age were a reference to full age, that is, 18 years or time of marriage.  The amendment is designed to ensure that a court order that uses expressions such as minority or age of majority instead of speaking of attaining 21 years will be caught.</P>
    <P>The existing practice of the High Court when making an order of this kind is to refer in the order to the investment of the funds and accumulation of interest during the infant's &ldquo;minority&rdquo; and to payment of the proceeds to him when he &ldquo;attains majority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Doubt has arisen whether the paragraph would cover orders worded in this way.</P>
    <P>The additional words being inserted by the amendment are intended to ensure that any references, whether express or implied, to the period before majority or the attainment of majority will be construed by reference to the new age of majority.</P>

      <P>In relation to the power of trustees to apply income to the maintenance of a minor, within the terms of this Bill this will not apply to instruments made before the commencement of the Act.  What are to be the trustees' powers concerning instruments that will be made after this Bill is enacted?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i>: Paragraph 3 of the Schedule proposes that where a trust instrument made before the commencement date is concerned with <Col N="2577" /> land or property to which an infant is beneficailly entitled, the powers of the trustees under sections 42 and 43 of the Conveyancing Act, 1881 in respect of the income of the land or property will continue until the infant reaches the age of 21.</P>
      <P>At present sections 42 and 43 of the Conveyancing Act, 1881 empower trustees to apply income from land or property held under a trust instrument for the maintenance, education or benefit of an infant beneficiary or to pay such income to his parent or guardian for the same purposes, until the infant reaches 21 years of age.  Subsection (1) provides that the change in the age of majority will not affect that power in relation to a trust instrument made before 1 March 1985.</P>
      <P>In the case of a trust instrument made on or after 1 March 1985 the change in the age of majority will affect the trustees' powers under sections 42 and 43 of the Conveyancing Act, 1881.  References in those sections to infancy and 21 years will be then construed as relating to the new age of majority.  Accordingly the power to apply income or to pay it to a parent or guardian will cease at 18 years or on earlier marriage.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for having taken note of what was said at Second Stage.  We have made clear the points we consider should be given attention following the passage of the Bill. There is one aspect which we mentioned earlier and which I intended referring to at Committee Stage, that is, that there remains an element of lack of protection from loan sharks.  We mentioned this on Second Stage.  The Minister may say that we cannot have it both ways, that we cannot make an adult of the young person, allowing him to take on loans and so on without his having to take risks also.  Of course we want to see that arrangement.  Nonetheless I would ask the Minister to see if any further measures can be taken to protect young people between the ages of 18 and 21 from the activities of loan sharks.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Ahern, who wishes to speak first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We thank you for allowing us to raise this matter on the Adjournment. We are asking the Minister to review the strike by members of the Irish Customs and Excise Union which was due to commence at midnight last week and which will recommence for one day at the end of this week because of the grave financial and social consequences that would ensue and to say what steps he will take to prevent the strike.  There were four minor issues in this strike three of which were cleared up last Monday week in letters from the Department clarifying a number of definitions relating to homes and bases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This strike has been caused by how relief officers are treated and how their <Col N="2579" /> expenses are paid.  Relief officers are entitled to certain travelling and subsistence allowances when they travel to deal with routine cases of an investigative nature near their posts if it is under 15 miles.  When they are temporarily transferred from their posts to another post within 15 miles they are not entitled to the same allowance.  If an officer was sent out to investigate the case of a man who lived ten yards away from a customs post he would get one level of expenses but if he was transferred to another post temporarily he would receive a different allowance.  This is a very silly anomaly causing a major strike.  About 700 officers are continuing this strike next week over this.</P>
    <P>We made it clear last week that there would be no control on the points of entry to the State.  The Minister in an acrimonious statement said that we were at fault for raising this matter in the House, although it has been on the front pages of most of the papers that morning and was referred to on the radio the following morning.  We are again asking the Minister to endeavour to find an amicable solution to this strike.  It is only a matter of interpreting the regulations and it will not cost a lot of money.</P>
    <P>This dispute has continued for two and a half years but it came to a breaking point six or seven months ago when the officers concerned refused to use their own transport because they were not getting the proper rate of expenses.  They started to use taxis which are costing much more than the allowances would cost.  Far from cutting State expenditure this situation is costing the State money.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister said that there were adequate numbers of gardaí to police the entry points to the State but that was not correct as a number of points were completely open.  Private individuals would find it difficult to import over the legal limit but people involved in smuggling large quantities of items must be stopped as it creates a very serious situation.  The union involved in the strike are not irresponsible.  This anomaly has arisen due to the interpretation of the <Col N="2580" /> regulations and due to the fact that probably one civil servant has calculated that the effect of this one concession would cost millions.  That is always said, but it would probably save money.  It would be cheaper than providing taxis as there are only 20 people involved.  The relief officers concerned are key people.  The officers should be able to get the one level of subsistence for both types of assignments.  The situation is ludicrous. The strike has cost the State millions and the effects of it will be felt possibly for years to come.  The Minister is introducing harsh measures to save money but the revenue lost to the State on that day was gigantic and nobody seems to care. I would ask the Minister to get his colleague, the Minister for the Public Service to intervene in this strike to end it by solving this ridiculous argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to raise this on the Adjournment having raised it last Thursday.  That is sufficient to indicate the importance of this matter.  We are giving the Minister another opportunity to intervene in this strike.  If the Minister is not prepared to intervene he could at least appeal to the union to call it off. The Minister did not take that opportunity last week but we are giving him an opportunity this week.  An appeal by the Minister could bear some fruit.  The proposed strike for Saturday next will have disastrous financial and social consequences for the country, particularly for the border counties.  Hopefully the Minister will accept this opportunity.  There will be no winners or losers in this but a substantial amount of money can be saved.  It is impossible to calculate the amount that has been lost already.  A strike such as this will have detrimental effects which will not be felt in the near future but will be felt over the months ahead and perhaps for many years to come.  The electrical trade will lose thousands of jobs and many firms will go to the wall because of the major differential in the price of electrical goods in Northern Ireland as against electrical goods sold here.  The 700 officials are supporting <Col N="2581" /> their 20 colleagues known as relief officers by going on strike.  Those men are not being treated as the others in regard to the mileage rate which was agreed in 1984.  They were permitted to use taxis which would cost four times the cost of using their own cars.  Therefore, if the 1982 agreement were implemented in their respect there would be substantial saving for the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>We hope the position on 7 December will not arise next week, but if the near inevitable happens I should like to know about the legality of goods which may be imported at land frontiers, airports or sea ports.  It could well be that such goods will be presented at import points but there will not be anybody there to accept the duty or the VAT.  Therefore I believe importers of such goods are in danger of having the imports declared illegal.  I do not know much about the legal position but I suggest it could pose problems.  At a later stage if customs officers want to seize goods imported on those days or prior to those days the importers could have difficulty.</P>
      <P>Exports pose another important problem. They have been affected as a result of this dispute, and I put the Minister on notice that there will be serious problems for the fishing industry, particularly on Saturday morning.  Tonight, 2,000 tonnes of mackerel caught by Irish boats are on transit from the north-west coast of Scotland back to the Republic for export. There will be serious difficulties because much of these cargoes are in a perishable state and therefore the exporters will lose heavily.  The strike will certainly affect the price the fishermen will get, with serious consequent financial losses for fishermen and fish processors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Minister told us that he would not become involved in debate across the floor of the House.  When he said that I understood him to be inferring that he would be prepared to become involved in some other way.  We saw the outcome on Friday &mdash; I was wrong, he did not become involved in any way.  Last week he said he did not envisage any serious disruption in regard to imports or exports.  Having seen the consequences <Col N="2582" /> of Friday's strike, if he still maintains his stance he is living in cloud cuckooland and out of touch with reality.  He told us that arrangements had been made to ensure that the strike could not be exploited, that he would ensure that the Garda would have a presence at customs posts. I said that that might not be possible, that the Garda might not afford co-operation, but he said that I was casting aspersions on the Garda.  I did not do that.  To substantiate what I said then, I made my way to a frontier post at 9 o'clock the next morning.  I spent two hours there and found there was no Garda presence whatsoever there.  I spoke to others who had visited a number of frontier posts along the Border and they found that the Garda had not been there.</P>
    <P>This is not a reflection on the Garda. They have their own job to do, and in the past number of days and weeks they have had a difficult job at the best of times.  Because of widespread attacks on the elderly recently more gardaí are required and they must be allowed to carry on their duties.  If we were to remove them from those duties in order to man Border posts there could be many more attacks, because criminals would take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>I understand that the men's union met on Saturday last and decided to give a breathing space to the Revenue Commissioners who had said it was not possible to negotiate while the threat of strike was still there.  The union informed the Revenue Commissioners of this by letter on Monday at 11 a.m.  The letter was delivered by hand.  Until today that letter has not been acknowledged.  The olive branch handed out by the union was not accepted.</P>
    <P>Last week there was smuggling by large-scale operators.  This is what worries me.  Those large-scale smugglers operated from midnight on Thursday until midnight on Friday with the consequent loss of millions of pounds to the State.  We all know that the day trippers could not carry sufficient money into Northern Ireland to purchase goods because they are allowed only £202 each. In these recessionary times such people <Col N="2583" /> would try to take advantage in some small way, but that is not a serious matter.  It was the large-scale smugglers who caused losses of about £6 million last year through illegal imports of electrical goods such as television sets and video machines. That was done while customs officials were working.  If that could be done in such circumstances how much was smuggled last week when there were no customs officers on duty?</P>
    <P>A Garda spokesman said that they were more interested in the movement of arms, explosives and drugs than toys and videos.  As legislators we must take urgent steps to ensure that we do not help to make a few smugglers rich at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer. Of course the drugs problem worries me particularly, and the customs officers contributed in no small way to prevent and to detect the illegal importation of drugs.  It is much easier detecting and preventing than trying to deal with drugs when they appear in the streets.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would refer to the thousands of jobs lost in the Republic last week because of the strike.  At this late stage we are appealing to the Minister for Finance to intervene in some way.  He has two further days during which to negotiate directly or indirectly to get the strike called off so that professional smugglers cannot continue their activities of last week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin by apologising to you and other Deputies for being a little late.  I had expected to hear a division bell but Deputies opposite decided otherwise.  I share the concern of Deputies Ahern and Gallagher, and I do not think I need to go into the reasons why.  I doubt that either of the Deputies on the other side of the House would accuse me of taking lightly any potential loss of revenue.  Most of the time they seem to hold it against me that I am a little too enthusiastic for their taste in collecting revenue.  I share their worry about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true to say that last week I did not make any statement about the <Col N="2584" /> officers who were on strike.  I have the record of our discussion last week and at column 2006 of the Official Report of 6 December I made a remark and I did not make it lightly or facetiously.  I said: &ldquo;It is always possible for the union to change their minds between now and midnight.&rdquo; I do not know that my joining the Deputies opposite in an appeal to the striking officers to call off their strike next week would make any great difference.  I dearly wish that those officers would reflect on the position and decide not to go on strike for a number of reasons.</P>
    <P>The main reason is that the cause of the strike is fairly simple and straightforward as Deputies opposite said.  I am afraid Deputies opposite may not be entirely informed about the matter.  The matter in contention goes back to July 1982.  It is one of the terms of an agreement made then between the customs officers and the Revenue authorities, not the DPS.  The part of the agreement in question is not peculiar to the customs service in spite of what Deputies seem to think.  It has general application in the Civil Service and, as I said last week, there is only one exception.</P>
    <P>The officials in question are seeking full mileage rate for officers travelling to and from their headquarters to temporary centres.  At the moment they are paid 50 per cent of the normal mileage rate for that.  As I said last week, exactly the same position applies to other officers in the public service with the exception of one group.  The vast majority of public servants who are entitled to receive mileage rates are treated in exactly the same way as these officers.  They are not being discriminated against.  They are not being made a special case.  They are not being treated less advantageously than other officials.  That is part of an agreement which goes back to July 1982.</P>
    <P>I say this in the most uncontentious spirit possible.  I honestly think that is not a sufficient cause for action which could potentially have the kind of effects which Deputies opposite are worried about.  I try to be a reasonable person at all times. I say this is the most uncontentious way possible.  It is entirely reasonable on my <Col N="2585" /> part to say to those officers that that is not an adequate cause for that kind of action.  As I said, they are being treated in exactly the same way as the vast majority of people in the public service who are entitled to be paid mileage rates during the course of their work.  That is the central point.</P>
    <P>I said last week that I was not prepared to have the kind of discussion across the floor of the House which would be more proper between union representatives and Revenue representatives.  I want to make that point clear for the record.  On the other issues raised by the Deputies I can well conceive of the fact that there are dangers in this situation.  Last Friday, as Deputy Gallagher knows, there was not a high volume of traffic across the Border.  The reports I have heard indicate that, if anything, the level of traffic was a little less than it would be normally, although I would not read anything in particular into that.  We do not know what was in that traffic.  As Deputy Gallagher said the Garda took the view that their first concern had to be about the possible smuggling of explosives or drugs. <Col N="2586" /> I take it that will be their position again this week.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice will be discussing with the Garda Commissioner measures which might be taken to ensure a strong Garda presence not necessarily on the Border but in the Border area with that concern in mind.  I do not intend to go into any more detail on that for reasons which will be obvious to the House.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything I can add to those remarks.  I appreciate the concern shown by Deputies.  I honestly think the matter at issue does not justify the kind of action which is in prospect. I would be just as happy as Deputies opposite if the officials in question could see it that way.  I hope they will.  In the meantime, if they do not, I will be looking at the arrangements which can be made not necessarily on the Border itself but in the Border area to meet what must be the primary concern of the Garda in this matter.</P>

      <P>The Central Development Committee never made any recommendation as to the provision of a helicopter service to any island.  The second part of the question does not arise therefore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1977 the inhabited non-Gaeltacht islands sub-committee of the Central Development Committee examined the question of helicopter services.  This sub-committee did not recommend any increase in the level of service; they merely recommended that existing emergency services by the Department of Defence be formalised.  There had already been a formalised arrangement, operated by the Department of Defence, <Col N="2408" /> in relation to helicopter ambulance services. In the light of this it was considered that there was no need to formalise arrangements for helicopter services in the event of other emergencies.  At present Inishbofin can avail of the flexible arrangements which exist for the provision of helicopters to relieve the islands during periods of isolation and the Minister for Defence assured the House on 2 February 1983 that these arrangements are operating satisfactorily.</P>

As the existing workforce in County Wexford forests is considered adequate to undertake the essential work programme there are at present no unfilled vacancies in the county.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he intends to follow the recommendations contained in a report dated April 1981, prepared by representatives of Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and the Department of Transport and Power, concerning the need for a new runway at Dublin Airport of approximately 9,000 feet in length.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind the age of the Dublin Airport runway system, which dates from the mid-forties, the developments in size and weight of aircraft in recent years and the need to provide for long term traffic needs at the airport, a detailed examination of the airport's future runway requirements was carried <Col N="2423" /> out in the late seventies by a working group.  The group recommended that a new east/west 9,000 feet runway should be built.  Aer Rianta endorse the working group's report and the company have advised me that the operational life of the existing main runway cannot be guaranteed beyond 1988.</P>
      <P>In the light of these considerations I will shortly be seeking formal Government approval for the level of investment necessary for a new runway at Dublin Airport.  I am not, therefore, yet in a position to indicate the length of the proposed runway or the nature of the instrument landing system to be provided.  I should make it clear that while details of the funding arrangements for the project have not yet been finalised it is expected that the project will be funded primarily from non-Exchequer sources, i.e. borrowing by Aer Rianta and the company's own resources.  Completion and operation of a new runway at Dublin Airport will not hinder or adversely affect operations at Shannon Airport.  I can assure the Deputy that there will be no change in Government policy under which Shannon is Ireland's only designated transatlantic gateway for traffic to and from Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that there have been no delays in dealing with this case.  The taxpayer did not notify the inspector until 29 May 1984 that he had retired on 17 March 1984. Certain information which was required for the purpose of carrying out a review of his 1983-84 liability was requested by the inspector on 18 June but was not supplied by the taxpayer until 25 August. The review was carried out on 4 September and a cheque in settlement was issued to the taxpayer two weeks later.  Subsequently, additional information was supplied by the taxpayer which necessitated a further review of the 1983-84 liability. This resulted in a further small repayment being made on 9 October last.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the information at present available to the Revenue Commisioners, the taxpayer's tax-free allowances for the current year are likely to exceed his income for that year and accordingly it is not anticipated that any liability to tax for 1984-85 will emerge.</P>

      <P>Following a re-investigation of her circumstances in April 1983 the widow's non-contributory pension, which had been in payment to the person concerned since April 1982, was terminated because she did not provide the social welfare officer with enough information to establish her full means at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case was further investigated in May 1984 and her means, derived solely from the profits of a farm, were assessed at £57.69 per week.  This amount exceeded the limit of £40 per week (£44 from 6 July 1984) applicable to her as a widow with no qualified children and her claim to pension was accordingly refused. She appealed against the decision but her appeal was disallowed by an appeals officer on 28 October 1984 and she was notified accordingly.  The appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive and can only be reviewed if there is a <Col N="2440" /> material change in the claimant's circumstances.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is subject to the condition that an applicant is available for work and to fulfil this condition an applicant must be capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no trace of a claim for an unmarried mother's allowance from the person concerned.  On the evidence available, however, she would not qualify for unmarried mother's allowance <Col N="2446" /> on the ground that she had been a married woman.  Also there is no trace of a claim for orphan's pension in respect of the family.  The children would not qualify for this, however, because they are living with their mother.  The person concerned made a claim for a widow's pension at the end of last year but this was refused on the grounds that, whilst the man with whom she had been living had died, she was not married to him and could not therefore be regarded as his widow.</P>
      <P>She also made a claim for a deserted wife's payment but this was also refused. Two of the conditions for the receipt of a deserted wife's payment are that the claimant's husband must have left her of his own volition and that she must have made reasonable efforts to trace him and to prevail on him to contribute to her support and maintenance and that of their children.  The deciding officer held that these conditions were not satisfied in this case and disallowed the claim. Notification of the decision and of her right to appeal against it was sent to the claimant on 23 March 1984.  There is no record of any appeal having been received from her.  She is at present in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

      <P>In Dublin, where the Office of Public Works is responsible for the provision and maintenance of courthouse accommodation, the District Court and the High Court each has a specially provided family law courtroom, complete with waiting rooms and consultation rooms, in Ormond House, while similar facilities are available to the Circuit Court in Dolphin House.</P>
      <P>Outside Dublin, while I am, of course, anxious that proper facilities be provided, the position is that responsibility for providing and maintaining court accommodation is vested by law in the local authorities.  I have no power to make finance available to them for the purpose.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 670 to 674, inclusive, together. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal was established in 1974 to operate the non-statutory scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted.  The scheme which is a detailed document and constitutes what no doubt the Deputy has in mind by &ldquo;terms of reference&rdquo; was laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 7 February 1974 and may be consulted in the Library.  The tribunal is required by paragraph 19 of the scheme to make annual reports to the Minister for Justice which are to be presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas. Such reports have been presented for each year of the tribunal's operations up to and including 1981 and provide information as to the compensation awarded and the manner in which claims were dealt with up to and including that year.  As regards the years 1982 and 1983 the total amount of compensation awarded was £2,599,745 and £3,490,224 respectively.  The numbers of applications received were 1,112 and 1,417. Applications were dealt with as follows:</P>

    <P>Statistics are not available under the exact headings requested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Application forms are available from the tribunal.  I am not aware that this leads to any hardship since the forms will be sent or given out in response to a simple letter or a telephone call &mdash; or, for anybody who happens to be near at hand, to a personal caller.  While I would not exclude the possibility of some other small number of offices keeping the forms as well, if a real need for doing so were shown, the Deputy will appreciate from the relatively small numbers who apply that it would involve a wholly disproportionate amount of administrative waste for such forms to be stocked in offices as suggested, the staff of which would have the task of storing and keeping them available on the off-chance that somebody might, sometime, look for one.</P>
