      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if the Government will consider the introduction of legislation to allow for the establishment of small claims courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The question of small claims courts is a complex matter which raises difficult issues, not the least of which is the question of the legal representation of the parties, an issue which has arisen even in relation to proceedings before certain tribunals which were intended to operate on a wholly informal basis.  While I do not rule out developments in this area, I would have to say that because of present financial and other constraints I see no prospect of changes in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider instituting on an experimental basis a system whereby an adjudicator would be provided, such as a practicising solicitor, to adjudicate between parties in disputes over small amounts of money who would not be represented by solicitors? This would be a relatively cheap experiment and I believe it would show that there is a need for such an adjudication or tribunal system for small claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The question of establishing small claims courts has arisen principally in connection with the resolving of consumer-trader disputes.  This aspect of the matter lies primarily within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  On the general issue, I do not think it would be possible to have a scheme which would forbid legal representation by the parties involved.  There would be the practical difficulty, say in the case of firms, in how they would be represented at a particular hearing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he recognises any responsibility for the orderly, comprehensive <Col N="1882" /> and rapid publication of all written judgments of the High Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Supreme Court; and whether he has any proposals for improving the chronically unsatisfactory position in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I assume that the Deputy is not asking about legal responsibility and that the question is concerned with the situation in practical terms.  On that basis, my attitude is that I recognise the need for the expeditious publication of judgments and that it is right that I should give any assistance that I reasonably can, having regard to available resources.</P>
      <P>The Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for Ireland, which is an independent body and is responsible for the publication of the Irish reports, has for many years been in receipt of an annual grant-in-aid from my Department to assist with the compilation and publication of the Irish reports.  The grant this year is £27,000.  There have been criticisms of the Irish reports to the effect that they do not include as many judgments as would be desirable and that publication is not sufficiently prompt.  I am informed that the council has taken steps to meet both criticisms.  It intends to include in the reports a greater number of judgments and it has recently made new arrangements which should secure a substantial improvement in publication dates.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, there is an arrangement whereby copies of all written judgments are made available for purchase through the Central Office of the High Court and are also supplied by that office, free of charge, to the Law Library, the Incorporated Law Society, the Oireachtas Library, the universities and other educational institutions.  I am aware that recently for a period of some months there were delaays in the preparation of the photo-copies of written judgments with the result that the issue of the copies by the Central Office was significantly delayed.  That particular problem has been solved and there is now no delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the position as a whole, therefore, I believe that the position has <Col N="1883" /> already improved in certain respects and that a substantial further improvement is on the way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Will the Minister not agree that whatever little help may be afforded by the availability of a typescript it is a very inconvenient mode of access to a judgment compared with the orderly printing of official reports that once were comprehensive enough but now, as the Minister correctly admits, have become quite inadequate?  Further, will he not agree that the delay in cases that can involve the State either on the civil or criminal side, the accused persons and ordinary private litigants, is quite scandalous in that it can sometimes take three or four years for a Supreme Court decision to appear in print?  In this connection I refer to the Murphy decision regarding married couples' income tax: it was three-and-a-half years before it got into reports.  Will the Minister consider getting his Department to hold a simple conference of interested parties?  These must include not just the Bar Library but everyone who teaches and has to learn this stuff to see what can be done to make available here what exists in every other country, namely, a complete service of information about the law of the land as interpreted by the courts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I recognise the need for expeditious publication of judgments.  A grant of £27,000 is supplied by my Department.  There have been some difficulties and there is room for improvement, whether by means of conference or some other consultation. I will take up the Deputy's suggestion and see if matters can be organised more expeditiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept that I intend no criticism of himself or his Department: I accept they provide this grant.  However, will he not agree there is a ludicrous disparity in terms of the State commitment between the system whereby the most casual and trivial remark made by a Deputy in this House <Col N="1884" /> or by a Senator in the other House is set in type, printed and made available to the public within seven days whereas in the cases of judgments of the Supreme Court, the High Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal it can be seven years before they are reported, if they are reported at all?  I was working with such a case a few days ago that is ten years old but is still not in print.  Will the Minister not agree that it is a ludicrous situation, where casual speeches that have no legal importance can be printed within a matter of days but where the same does not apply to the law of the land?</P>

      <P>I assume that the information sought by the Deputies relates to payments made to solicitors and barristers under the criminal legal aid scheme, which comprise the only fees that my Department pay to solicitors and barristers.</P>
      <P>It would require a disproportinate expenditure of public time and money to compile the information sought in regard to court appearances, adjournments and cases.</P>
      <P>Records of the fees paid to individual solicitors and barristers under the criminal legal aid scheme are kept on a tax-year basis in my Department.  The amounts paid to solicitors and barristers, not including payments in respect of VAT, travelling, subsistence and other disbursements, for the tax year ended 5 April 1983 are in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would refer the Deputy to the written reply which I gave on 24 November to a question about Garda stations in rural areas. In my reply I stated the up-to-date position in relation to the new system for policing rural areas which has been introduced in two pilot districts and I outlined the main features of the new system.  As this system is designed to meet the particular needs and circumstances of rural areas, it is not proposed to extend it to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public access call-boxes which are provided at small rural Garda stations as part of the system are for the purpose of enabling members of the public to make immediate contact with the Garda at times when the stations are closed.  As all Garda stations in the Dublin area are open 24 hours a day, there is not the need for the same type of facility at these stations. However the possibility of providing <Col N="1898" /> the public with facilities for contacting the Garda, additional to the existing 999 phone facility, is being considered as part of the new Garda radio communications system being provided for the Dublin area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In general there is a scheme to provide a radio communications network for the Garda throughout the country.  It is being done in two phases: it is being done in the country divisions initially and then in the Dublin metropolitan area as a separate contract.  In many rural areas Garda stations are not open for the full 24 hours and the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; system &mdash; as the Deputy has described it &mdash; is used to contact gardaí when they are not on duty in the station in question.  In the Dublin area stations are open on a 24-hour basis and, thus, there is no necessity for having the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; system on the exterior wall or door of the Garda station.  On the other hand, there is an argument that could be made that in certain areas it would be of benefit to local communities to have access if there is not an adequate public telephone service or if there is a problem with the public telephones being vandalised.  In the context of the contract for the communications network in Dublin, the idea of whether the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; system could be used in a different way than in the rural areas is being examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the rural areas, will this be a supplement to the provisions already there or will it replace staff and result in savings?  Which is the purpose?  I have come across a case where the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; was outside and the station was open all day.  People were ringing up from outside and getting through to headquarters some distance away and then the call went back to the local station, which seems unusual.  I appreciate it is all at a pilot stage and that is why I am trying to find out how exactly it is intended to be operated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Rural policing is on a pilot basis but the Garda communications system is not.  There are certain Garda stations which are not manned for 24 hours a day.  If somebody arrives at the station and there is a garda manning it he can contact the garda.  If such a person arrives at the station and there is not a garda manning it, he will use the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; externally and can get into immediate contact with gardaí in the central station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this mean that some of the stations which are on a 24-hour basis will have their hours reduced and that the community will then have to rely on the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; outside instead of the blue man inside?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy is mixing two different things. There is a radio network all over the country and this involves the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; which will help the public to communicate with the Garda when their local station is not manned at the time when people are looking for the Garda.  On the other hand, there is the rural policing scheme which does not envisage closing down any Garda stations.  The &ldquo;green man&rdquo; will help people in rural villages when a station is not open 24 hours a day. Whether the station is a one-man or a two-men station, there will be access to a central station through the communications system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Though the station is open, the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; is on outside and this <Col N="1900" /> seems to be an indication that the hours are restricted.  Will the green man be a supplement or will it be replacing the service which is there?  It is not very clear.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The green man is a kind of box with a mesh in it.  You pull a lever and it gets you through to the central Garda station.  On the other hand, if there is somebody in the local station, you go in and you meet the garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is not the intention.  The Garda communications network is a totally separate concept, costing £10 million.  It is entirely separate from and independent of the rural policing pilot scheme which makes for greater access.  In many parts of the country at the moment there are one-man or two-men stations and obviously they are not manned for 24 hours a day. In a one-man station, naturally the garda locks the door if he has to go about his business in the village.  He is not in the station all day and when he is not the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; comes on and people can get access to the central station.  They are two independent things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That still leaves me confused. If it is bigger than a one-man station there are plenty of personnel inside. The comment has been that even though the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; is outside it would be much easier to go inside and contact the blue man there.  Is this a predisposition to reducing the opening hours of rural stations?  I am afraid I will have to inquire further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have been trying to get across that the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; communications scheme is a permanent structure.  The &ldquo;green man&rdquo; is outside the Garda station.  Obviously, when the Garda station is manned the gardaí do not put it under their arm and go away with it.  It is there.  For example, in my city, Limerick, I can take Mary <Col N="1901" /> Street Garda station.  It is not open at night but it is open during the day.  If somebody wants to contact the Garda he uses the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; and contacts the central station.</P>

      <P>One of the functions of crime prevention committees which the Minister is sponsoring is to arrange that all the facilities are there to help to prevent crime.  This is one of the things that <Col N="1902" /> is most urgent.  In the north side of the city the police are involved with local communities to have laneways closed and cul-de-sacs created.  The Garda have been instrumental in getting this kind of work done.  Since the home watch system is being piloted in the city does the Minister not agree that, as has happened in other countries, the home watch and block watch systems have meant a watch on the environment and are concerned about aspects such as public lighting?  If this is not done people may become frustrated at lack of development, and crime levels will consequently continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.  This incident occurred when ban-ghardaí were working in the prison during the dispute last November between the Prison Officers' Association and my Department.  The ban-ghardaí were unfamiliar with their surroundings and did not realise that a prisoner had taken a bottle containing largactil from a locker in the chief officer's office, some time after 2 p.m. while the prisoners were on recreation.  The bottle was concealed by the prisoners until later when ten of them drank its contents.  The ban-ghardaí were unaware that anything was wrong until that evening at about 7.15 p.m. when they observed that ten of the prisoners were drowsy.</P>
      <P>Arrangements were immediately made to have the prisoners transferred to the Mater Hospital for treatment.  The media became aware of the incident while the transfer arrangements were being made and news of the incident was broadcast before it was possible to notify any relatives of the prisoners.  At that time the authorities at the prison were fully occupied arranging transfers of prisoners and increased surveillance of the other prisoners in case any of them had consumed some of the substance.</P>
      <P>It is clear that so much largactil &mdash; approx. 1½ litres &mdash; should not have been in the female prison at that time as only one prisoner had been prescribed the drug in question by the doctors attending the prison.  A complete review of the arrangements for ordering, storing and administering drugs to all prisoners is in progress at present and when a decision on a revised procedure has been taken I will be making a public statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, a new medicine cabinet has been installed in the female prison, the key of which is held by the <Col N="1904" /> supervising officer on duty.  All drugs are kept in this cabinet.</P>
    <P>At present 11 women prisoners are receiving medication.  Only one day's supply of dangerous drugs &mdash; librium, mogadon etc., are kept in the prison while up to one week's supply of nonaddictive and harmless drugs, such as iron tablets, may be kept.  As no prisoner is at present prescribed largactil no largactil is held in the prison.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the drug largactil normally kept under lock and key before the incident occurred?  Can he explain how it came to be available to the prisoners at the time the incident occurred?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The largactil which the prisoners acquired was kept in a locker in the chief officer's office and it was taken by the prisoners some time after 2 p.m.  The prison officers in charge of that section were not on duty, as the Deputy is aware, at that time, and the ban-ghardaí who were running the female prison at that stage were not familiar with their surroundings.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is avoiding the basic question.  Was the largactil not locked in the cabinet at that time?  How did it come that the key was available?  Was the key left around somewhere? This is the basic point.  I appreciate what the Minister is saying about it being in a store room, but I would understand that in those circumstances the room was locked.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the fines-on-the-spot <Col N="1908" /> system, the Government decided that a study be made of the possible extension of the system and this study has begun. The introduction of any changes considered to be desirable would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Government also decided that, having regard to the complex legal issues involved, two recommendations which the Prices Advisory Committee made for changes in court procedure in civil liability cases should be examined by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, prior to further consideration by the Government.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Prices Advisory Committee made a recommendation on motor insurance and that has been referred to the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  The decision involved giving a greater discretion to the judge in recommending levels of claims when a claim was being tried by jury.  That has been referred to the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure. There will not be further consideration of this matter by the Government until a report is received on that.  With regard to the other question, certainly there are delays in civil cases in the High Court and quite a large number of these are related to motor insurance claims.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Delays in court actions on motor insurance mainly arise not in the Circuit Court but in the High Court.  For example, High Court statistics for the legal year 1982 to 1983, the year ended 31 July 1983, show some significant improvement in the state of High Court business.  The main features are as follows: an increase of 33 per cent in the number of jury actions disposed of during the year &mdash; 3,107 as compared with 2,328 in the previous year &mdash; an increase of 61 per cent in the number of non-jury common law actions disposed of &mdash; 503 as compared with 312 in the previous year and a reduction from 22 months to 20 months in the average delay from the date of setting down to the date of hearing in the case of jury actions and from 15 months to 13 months in the case of non-jury actions.  Two additional judges were appointed in 1982 and there is now very effective management of court business.  I am giving average monthly delays.  There is a difference, for <Col N="1910" /> example, in the delay in the High Court in Dublin, in Cork and in Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I partially agree with the Minister, but does he not agree that this is basically a Dublin High Court problem? There is a serious administrative blockage in the administration of the High Court in Dublin, which is causing the public intolerable delays in getting their appropriate legal remedies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are a number of reasons for the delays. Firstly, the longest delays are not in Dublin but in Cork and the shortest delays are in Limerick.  Dublin, carrying most of the business, affects many people.  One of the reasons for the delays is lack of accommodation in Dublin but that will be dealt with satisfactorily over the next few months, when we will be providing two extra jury courts in the Four Courts building.  That will certainly help matters quite a lot.  Another factor in causing delays is the unwillingness shown by some practitioners to settle before arriving at the door of the court. If these were prepared to settle earlier in the process, the list would not be so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is a long-standing recommendation made either by this or the previous Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, to the effect that a <Col N="1911" /> system could easily be adopted to effect a settlement of pre-trial issues &mdash; matters of technical details as between medical and engineer witnesses on each side. These could be settled pretty easily in office or in chambers by an official such as a master or a registrar.  The main issues going for open trial before a judge or a judge and jury could be reduced to the key issues involved.  That is a very simple procedural reform which has existed for a long time by way of recommendation before successive Ministers for Justice.  I would ask the Minister to examine it as a reform which would be very easily implemented and would bring very practical benefits.</P>

There are three aspects of the delay, firstly examination of the existing accommodation and I am proceeding to deal with that, especially in the case of Dublin. As I have already said, extra courts will be provided in the immediate future and further courts in the medium term.  The second issue arising concerns the number of judges and I have not evaluated that as yet.  The third issue is whether some of the preparatory work, as the Deputy has mentioned, could be engaged in, for example, by the Master of the High Court.  I am having that examined at the moment.  It is not a simple administrative matter, but would require legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>The Land Registry have been radically re-organised in recent years and, within the constraints imposed by the embargo on public service posts, the efficiency of the registry is under constant review.</P>
      <P>The registry receive about 120,000 applications annually for land certificates, copy maps, copy folios and instruments and these are supplied within four to six working days on average.  About 90,000 applications for registration of title are lodged annually; of these roughly 95 per cent are completed within about three months on average.  The remaining 5 per cent consist of complex cases such as first registration applications or applications for establishment of title by possession. Those cases take about 15 months on average to complete.  Detailed examination of title and extensive correspondence are normally involved as well as the issue of statutory notices to interested parties, which usually gives rise to further correspondence.</P>
      <P>The numbers of outstanding applications on 31 January 1984 were as follows: Land certificates, copy maps, copy folios and instruments, 2,570; Registration of transactions affecting land already registered 24,065; First registration, including establishment of title acquired by possession 6,175.</P>
      <P>Proposals for a radical reorganisation of the processing of applications for first registration, including establishment of title acquired by possession &mdash; the only area in which there is a problem &mdash; have been prepared for some time but because of the embargo on public service posts they cannot be implemented at present. In the meantime all that can be done by the Land Registry to speed up the processing of the applications under the existing system is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as technology is concerned, a <Col N="1916" /> programme of computerising the Land Registry folios commenced in December 1982.  It was decided to start with Dublin because there were no duplicate folios available for Dublin as there are in the local offices for the other 25 counties.  It is expected that all the Dublin folios will be computerised by mid-1985 and the programme will then be extended to other areas of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's assurances that the procedures will be updated but could he put a figure on the number of delays caused because of insufficient information being supplied? Has there been any communication between his Department and other bodies who have an input into the Land Registry with a view to making the supplying of information more efficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It depends on which activity of the Land Registry is being discussed.  As I said, about 120,000 applications for copy maps, land certificates, copy folios and so on are received yearly and they can be supplied within four to six working days. About 90,000 applications for registration of title are lodged annually and roughly 95 per cent are completed within three months on average.  The remaining 5 per cent of complex cases of first registration are causing difficulties and sometimes they take on average 15 months to complete.  Extensive correspondence is involved and letters have to be written frequently.  That is why it can take up to 15 months to complete the work.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is a different question but there is a considerable delay at the moment because, as a result of extending the scheme for a further 12 months, there was a huge number of applicants.  I will find out how long the delay is and I will communicate that information to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="1917" /> agree that the Land Commission is a commercial proposition as far as the State is concerned and is making money?  In view of that fact, it is only commonsense to increase staff, to improve staff efficiency an to introduce computerisation and any other step which can be taken to make this an even more viable office.  I ask the Minister to take a favourable look at the Land Commission because of this fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The computerising of the Land Commission is going ahead and all folios for Dublin will be computerised by mid-1985.  I am sure the Deputy understands that the embargo on public service posts applies right through the public service and that is causing some difficulties for the Land Registry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister look at this situation again because this is a commercially viable operation which could yield further revenue to the State if more efficiently run.  Therefore he should look at the embargo situation in a more flexible way and make a case to his colleague, the Minister for the Public Service.  A special case should be made for all units of the public service which are commercially viable and capable of yielding more revenue to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I understand that the position is that the Land Registry and those offices of the courts which charge fees and which are run on commercial lines are not intended to make a profit but to be self-financing.  I take the point made by the Deputy that there is a special case to be made here and that these areas should be treated differently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has agreed there is a very big backlog in dealing with schedules and first registrations.  As an exceptional measure, would the Minister consider transferring staff from another area of his Department to deal with the backlog of first registrations because this is creating enormous difficulties for house <Col N="1918" /> buyers and first time purchasers?  This matter is causing a great deal of concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is a backlog of, on average, 15 months in dealing with first registration but it cannot be totally attributed to lack of staff. The amount of correspondence causes the delay rather than lack of staff to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that when the final queries have been dealt with by the solicitors acting on behalf of their client, the first registration could be expected to issue within three months of that date?  That would be reasonable.  As it stands it often runs to years and some first registrations are not dealt with for 18 months after they have been received in the Land Registry office.  Will the Minister seek to relieve the backlog in the Department?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West)</i> asked the Minister for Agriculture the exact terms of the decision taken by the Agriculture Ministers of the Community today in Brussels and if the position now is that the Irish Government have agreed to accept the full implementation of a super-levy on milk production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>A conditional <Col N="1919" /> outline arrangement on the milk super-levy was made by the Agriculture Council today.  Ireland reserved its position because a derogation for this country is being sought and because this matter will be raised at the European Council of 19-20 March.  Two other member states, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, also expressed reservations.</P>
      <P>The main features of the arrangement are that, apart from the derogation being sought for Ireland, the total quantity free of super-levy would be fixed at 98.2 million tonnes of milk in 1984-85 and 97.2 in subsequent years, with an annual reserve of 0.6 million tonnes to be allocated by the Commission.  The duration of the arrangement would be five years.  The super-levy would be applied at dairy level or individual farm level at the choice of member states.  I must emphasise that these arrangements do not prejudice the form of the derogation to be granted to this country which remains to be decided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments were agreed between Deputy Flynn and me and they represent a consensus.  It might be argued that I should go further in raising these penalties but, as I indicated to Deputy Flynn, the consequence of going further would be that we would no longer be able to proceed by means of summary proceedings and consequently there would be delay in bringing a prosecution. This delay would reduce the enforceability of the legislation and would be undesirable because proceedings by indictment are more lengthy and cumbersome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister agreed during the Second Stage debate that there was need for a rethink as to the penalties that might apply and I am pleased that he agreed to revise his opinion on the matter.  There is a sizeable increase from £5 to £100 per item and this indicates that the Minister recognises the seriousness of this piracy.  It is unfortunate that matters cannot be dealt with on indictment in a quicker fashion so that we could exceed this provision.  I see that the Minister has nodded to indicate that he accepts that point of view.  I must comply with the <Col N="2013" /> amendment because we are confined to summary proceedings and to the limits applied to the courts which deal with these matters.  I take it that the fine of £100 will be attached to each article to which the first offence applies.  Irrespective of the number of pirated video cassettes that might be seized in any seizure, do I take it that the maximum fine would still be £1,000 for one seizure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we are limited to the £1,000.  The penalty of £100 per item is quite satisfactory but the £1,000 maximum will not deal with the problem to any significant degree.  It is possible to make sizeable amounts of money from this type of piracy and I doubt very much if a fine of £1,000 would be a deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might allow me to make a point of clarification. There is a maximum of ten fines of £100 for each work but if in the course of a seizure ten different works are seized then there could be a fine of up to £10,000.  The limit of £1,000 applies in respect of individual works rather than the entire seizure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is much more satisfactory but it is difficult to read it in the section.  It is not specifically stated that the offence applies to the title of a work. I would be quite satisfied if the Minister would ensure that this could not become a loophole in the law of which a clever advocate could take advantage.  The reading of the section would lead one to believe that irrespective of the number of titles involved in the seizure the maximum fine would still be only £1,000.  I would be pleased to hear that the question of the title does apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <P>I should like to think that in a year's time the matter will be pursued in the light of what transpires after the enacting of this legislation and when we would be in a better position to establish whether what had been enacted had proved to be an effective deterrent.  I should like the Minister to put it on record that following a reasonable time allowed towards the pursuing of illegal operators he would consider favourably the introduction, if necessary, of stiffer penalties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy may not be aware that there is provision for the presentation to the House of a report from the office of the Controller of Patents and Copyrights.  Perhaps the appropriate method of reviewing the effectiveness of the legislation would be in the context of these reports.  One of the problems with which we are faced in this House is the absence of any method whereby all the various reports that are presented to the House can be discussed. It might be worth while for the Deputy to raise this matter in the context of the next report of the Controller of Patents and Copyrights.  Indeed, it might be possible for us in the meantime to improve the procedures for reviewing the contents of these reports.  In that situation the point the Deputy is making would be kept under observation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister's reflection on subsections 4 and 5 of section 27 which concern the way the matter can be dealt with through the District Court.  Would the Minister not consider it necessary, particularly in relation to subsection 5 in so far as Garda action is concerned, to adjust that provision?  I had contemplated an amendment in that area but the Minister may be able to find another way of dealing with the point.  I have in mind particularly the question of an inspector of the Garda being the officer who needs to be employed in dealing <Col N="2016" /> with the matter and also the question of the times during which raids or seizures can take place.  In the context particularly of the showing of illegal videos, would the Minister not consider it to be non-effective to apply a time limit in present-day circumstances?  The two subsections in question are somewhat cumbersome in terms of dealing effectively with the type of operator we are talking of.  There seems to be a loophole so far as he is concerned while there is a very large onus of responsibility on the applicant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean that the offending video could be brought in after 9 p.m. and taken away before 6 a.m.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Prior notice of application in the court would render it very simple for an illegal operator to evade the law.  It is my opinion that those two subsections will not be effective, so perhaps the Minister would consider an alternative.  The Chair will realise that we are <i>ad idem</i> in trying to find a better way of dealing with this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>When the application is made the District Court must be satisfied, on oath, that an offence is being committed but this would render it difficult subsequently for the Garda on foot of a warrant to catch the operator in the illegal act particularly when there is a restriction as to a particular rank of garda and a certain timescale during which the officer may enter the premises or seize the items in question.  Those two subsections could have been incorporated in a simple section providing for application to the court whereby the Garda would be issued with a warrant.</P>

      <P>Another matter to which I referred in my Second Stage contribution and to which I had hoped the Minister would reply in concluding that stage concerned the publication of the Official Reports of the House in the context of how I was interpreting the definition of literary work in section 2 of the original Bill.  As I understand it, the copyright of the Official Reports would be vested in the Government and my question was whether it would be necessary for one to seek permission from the Controller of Government Publications before reports of the proceedings of the House can be reprinted in whole or in part.  I should like to know whether the question of privilege as defined in article 15 of the Constitution extends to publications of <Col N="2018" /> the Official Report.  What is the legal position as to the publishing of extracts from statements made here in so far as newspaper reporting or television stills are concerned?  I am talking of quoting selectively from debates as against publishing the whole Debate and I am wondering whether permission must be sought in such a case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It resides in the Government.  It is necessary to get permission for the reproduction of the debates.  That is the legal position.  I would tend to question whether we should tend to be unduly pernickety in dealing with this matter.  I do not know what the Deputy has in mind.  It does not seem to me that there is much abuse in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned about the actual reporting.  There has been a tendency of late in periodicals, books, magazines and other places to give selective quotations &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;selective extracts from the verbatim report of the debates in the House.  It is very important that the public should know that you cannot give <Col N="2019" /> these quotations without obtaining prior permission.  Selective reporting could lead to many difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal position is that permission is required.  I would not be over-exercised about it one way or the other.  I do not think it is a real problem. Obviously it is much more difficult to give a quotation out of context if one produces the verbatim report or to put a gloss on it.  We could end up in a worse position than where we started if we were inclined to be too difficult about using the verbatim report.  People would tend not to use it, and use less adequate sources for reportage.  This would not be desirable. I have to confess that I was a bit puzzled as to why Deputy Flynn was raising this matter.  I am even more puzzled now.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> We have certain reservations with regard to this section.  Certain subsections are far-reaching. I refer to subsection (1) (a), (b) and (c).  The provisions laid down in this subsection are part and parcel of good farming operations.  Subsection (1) (c) refers to the dimensions and layout of housing for animals, the materials to be used in the construction of such housing and facilities by way of lighting, heating and cooling.  All of this is enshrined in other legislation dealing with cruelty to animals.  I wish to know if it is necessary to include it here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Subsection (1) (c) refers to housing, heating, air space and so on for animals.  All of us hope that farmers make such provision for animals and I am sure that is so in 99 per cent of cases.  However, in very intensive projects if something went wrong, if beasts and birds did not have enough air space, <Col N="2023" /> it was felt when the convention was being drawn up that it was important to have legislation to cover such a situation.  It is a normal clause in legislation.  I know what Deputy Noonan is concerned about.  One might argue that the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals could organise themselves on the basis of the powers they have but that is not strictly correct because there are many restrictions with regard to their access to various properties.  The Deputy need not worry about this point.  In my view it is a common-sense proposal and will not inhibit the progress of an owner of livestock.</P>

The statement on top of page four also seems to be fairly vague.  I take it the animals <Col N="2025" /> referred to are those that would be kept in intensive units.  The section is vague because paragraph (a) of subsection (4), states that animals must be inspected at least once per day.

Deputy Noonan is right that there would not be need to provide for daily inspection of animals not housed. Of course all farmers who are owners of cattle and sheep would look after them. The law would be lenient in this respect and the provision here is not a slight on farmers but to ensure that a small minority will not inflict suffering on livestock. It is required by convention.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> This relates to the keeping of records, and I am concerned because farmers have had to keep many records without keeping unnecessary ones and I believe the records provided for here are unnecessary. Surely if equipment breaks down it is the farmer's obligation to ensure that the defect will be remedied.  The Bill provides that records must be kept for two months during which they must be available for inspection by an authorised person.</P>

      <P>There is some basis for the Deputy's argument about keeping accounts.  Some farmers are notoriously bad at that kind of thing &mdash; they want to get on with their farming.  The spirit of the section is to provide against cases of animal hardship.  If records were not kept an authorised person would have great difficulty in ascertaining what had happened before he got there.  We could have cases in intensive units, such as the pig industry, where simple charts are kept in the animals' pens giving details of rations and so forth.  I assume that what is involved here is, for example, a diagram, just a matter of ticking off a date indicating <Col N="2027" /> that the animals were looked at on that date.

Farmers were never great people for keeping accounts but they had a fair idea at the end of the day which project was paying and which was not paying. We do not want to get farmers bogged down in paper work and if we make this provision that is precisely what will happen.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Wednesday I dealt with this matter in some detail.  Cancelling the local elections for another year is merely putting off the evil day.  As I said last week, we could have done that five years ago but I did not agree with such a move because one must face up to reality sooner or later and eventually the day will come when one has to face reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many ways to reform local government but the biggest problem facing local authorities today is money and where they will get it.  One can bring in any reforms one wishes but who will finance those reforms?  This is the type of problem that must be looked into.  When I was in O'Connell Bridge House I had a brief look at many of these problems and I was quick to realise that to introduce reforms I would have to provide additional finance.  It was not easy to go to the hard-pressed taxpayers and ask them to pay for these reforms.  Anyone lucky enough to have a job on 5 April <Col N="2038" /> next will be paying between £5 and £6 more per week income tax.</P>
    <P>Less than two weeks ago after three long meetings about estimates of expenditure for local authorities, the Offaly County Council had to make some very difficult decisions on the running of the county at local authority level for the coming year.  In towns and villages only a few public lights will be put on.  It will be three out of every nine.  The manager also pointed out that he could not guarantee full employment for road workers of whom there are approximately 200. Depending on what revenue he would receive from charges there would be a three day week in operation from 1 July.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister for the Environment's speech last Thursday when moving his Estimate.  He said that local authorities would have to seek more finance by way of charges.  In Laois-Offaly there has been great opposition to these charges.  The water charge in Offaly is £35.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Estimate for the Department of the Environment is before the House having been moved recently.  The Chair is of the opinion that the points now being made would be more relevant on the Estimate than on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be involved in controversy but the debate on the motion before us was wide-ranging. However, I accept the Chair's ruling. If the local elections were held this year the political parties, independants and others would have had an opportunity to go before the public and test the wind. Many times it was blowing in my face but I was able to stand up to it and I took it on.  Fine Gael and Labour are running away from the problem.  We could have done that five years ago and had a great excuse about reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reform which will take place will be a paper reform.  Reform means money and that is what it is all about.  It all hinges on important matters regarding the future of local authorities.  If the elections were held in June the people could have <Col N="2039" /> voiced their opinions on many matters affecting local authorities.  In Laois and Offaly we will not have enough money to fill the pot holes.  This is very serious. Many people have said that part of the £300 million extra being collected in PAYE could go towards funding local authorities.  I never agreed with the idea that urban areas should not pay for water. It was not right that people in the rural area had to do so.  I am glad there is now uniformity in the urban and rural areas regarding water charges.  This should have been done years ago.  People should pay for water where it is possible to do so.  There are many other matters which this election would have highlighted.  One is the collection of garbage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It all hinges on the local elections.  We would know how the public felt about many fundamental issues. They could judge how members of councils were performing.  Some public representatives portray themselves as the be all and end all, as if they had some magic wand to deliver the goods with no problems.  They too would have to go before the public and would realise what was thought of them.  Then there are what I call the mushroom people who come up two months before an election is due.  I would like to see them put to the test and find out what is thought about them.  They have elaborate programmes to put before the people, programmes which can be irresponsible.  We would like to get them into the ring to see what the people think of them.  Public representatives must be responsible today.</P>
      <P>I never agreed with a charge for sewerage. This is in the interest of public health.  The charge for garbage collection could not be administered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Three people would pay and the others would not.  The rubbish would be dumped outside the doors of the people who paid.  This election has <Col N="2040" /> been postponed because the Government want to initiate reform.  I believe this election will also be postponed next year.  There will be the usual Christmas gift to soften the blow and then we will be told that the reform is still in draft form.  Perhaps we will be obliged to seek the views of local authorities and corporations. Where I come from they call it a stalling exercise.</P>
      <P>What happens then?  There will be further postponement, perhaps for another year.  However, it will eventually have to be faced up to, and I never agreed with putting off local elections.  The Government should face up to their obligations, no matter what way the wind is blowing, because the people will soon know they are running away from their responsibilities. They will find it hard to believe in reform &mdash; switching of boundaries means very little to the public.  They will only be interested in what it will cost.  Sooner or later the Government will have to face up to their responsibilities and the people should have got an opportunity to cast their votes in June.  It would have been a great opportunity to test the popularity of people who are setting themselves up as God's gift to the nation.  There are always people who pop up a few months before local elections with cures for all our ills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many commentators and financial correspondents said that the Government were going to save the taxpayer money. Earlier in the year the Taoiseach said we could not have two elections on the same day as the public would be confused.  The public are very intelligent and well able to read the situation.  I cannot understand why they think the public would be confused as they are holding the by-election in Laois-Offaly on the same day as the European elections.  That is a very interesting fact which will take some explaining. Political correspondents were writing articles about financial rectitude and so on.  They said that the Exchequer would be saved something in the region of £2 million by holding these two elections on the same day.  Financial rectitude has now gone out the window and the Government have done a U-turn.  The press do not seem to want to see it either, <Col N="2041" /> and there are none so blind as those who will not see.  If Fianna Fáil had done what the Government are doing it would be headlined in every newspaper.  They would say that Fianna Fáil were putting another burden on the hard-pressed taxpayer. I expect journalists to be fair and to give balanced reporting because that is their duty.  In my younger days there was fair reporting but there has now been a change.  The press are trying to preempt decisions on many issues.  However, they will never lead me in any direction except where I want to go&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think a general discussion on the media is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant because the press were preaching about financial rectitude and saving money.  I want to make clear that they would have strongly criticised Fianna Fáil if they did the same thing.  They are silent now.</P>
      <P>The elections will be postponed for two years and there will possibly be paper reform.  Perhaps there will be switching of boundaries, maybe that is reform, but with regard to local government much will depend on the course of direction with regard to the financing of local authorities from now on.  The people will be watching very closely from now on to see what the position is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion before the House for a number of reasons.  I do not agree with much of what has been said by Opposition Deputies in this debate.  Their attitude appears to be one of deriving as much publicity as possible from the fact that the Government have chosen to postpone local elections. There is a good case to be made for the postponement of local elections.  There is no point in electing people to local authorities who by participating in decisions of a previous Government, made for political expediency, to remove domestic rates, led local authorities into a financial <i>cul-de-sac.</i>  They have no power because they lack the necessary finance to implement their policies.  Local <Col N="2042" /> authorities cannot survive without an assurance of reasonable financing.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil would like the public to feel that the Government are running away from facing the people.  People are fed up with elections yet Fianna Fáil for their own political advantage want to thrust another election upon them.  It would not be wise to hold an election in the very near future in Laois-Offaly to replace the late Deputy Cowen, particularly when we are facing the European elections.  People must recognise that they have a responsibility to exercise their franchise at the European elections because many of the decisions affecting us are being made at European level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am developing a point that the local elections should not be held on the same day as the European elections. On the previous occasion a high percentage of people voted at local level but did not think it worth their while to vote in the European elections.  We must show the European Parliament how interested we are in electing representatives.</P>
      <P>The Government have a responsibility to examine all aspects of local authorities. This has not been done for many years. Fianna Fáil postponed local elections on a number of occasions.  They were postponed on two occasions since I became involved in the local government scene. These postponements were not designed to give an advantage to the Opposition but were due to the fact that Fianna Fáil were afraid to face the electorate.  Politicians do not want one election after another and there are people on all sides of this House who are in favour of a postponement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local government needs significant reform in order to make it relevant and interesting to the people.  I hope the Minister in his promised report will not just redraw the boundaries in some areas of major population growth and bring in new members to the local authorities to do the same thing as has been done in the past.  Of course he should ensure that the <Col N="2043" /> major growth areas have sufficient representation at local authority level but he should also introduce legislation to enable local authorities to raise finance and make it mandatory that a certain measure of State funds be directed to local authorities. This would enable them to plan ahead for a number of valuable projects. There is an increasing demand for services but the finance is not available.</P>
    <P>The Government have made the right decision and the wisdom of that decision will be borne out in the next 12 months when we will see a programme of reform that will enable people to take a far greater interest in local authorities.  The Opposition are saying that the elections will be postponed for a further two years. If it is necessary to have a further postponement until a proper framework for local authorities is devised, then that must be done.  We must face up to our responsibilities in that respect.  I am happy to support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We sometimes get confused listening to debate in this House and I wish to put the record right.  I agree with the rulings the Chair has made several times during this debate.  It is not the policy of Fianna Fáil to prolong it unnecessarily, although I am sure the Minister of State must feel that he has heard enough of it.  It is an important decision and I know that a vociferous man like him would certainly be heard if he were on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now 13 March and I can understand the comments made by the last speaker and others that the local elections might have been called off following the recent estimates debates in the local authorities.  However, the decision on the local elections was made about three weeks after the by-election in my constituency. It was on the Cabinet agenda immediately following that by-election and this was admitted by the then Minister for the Environment.  The Government felt that they had hit a low in the opinion polls and that they could not face the electorate six months later.  They made the decision on 22 or 23 December. Perhaps there are merits in looking at some financial changes but this had nothing <Col N="2044" /> to do with the decision.  If there was a document put forward to the Cabinet it is most likely that it was from the Department of the Taoiseach indicating the latest opinion poll.  It is for that reason that the local elections were cancelled.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the year at the Fianna Fáil Youth Conference in Tralee I read from a letter which came into my hands sent out by a Senator of the Coalition parties stating that a survey was to be carried out and that county councillors were over-whelmingly in favour of a cancellation of the local elections.  He was asking them to sign a petition.  This was duly done and I understand that about 90 per cent of county councillors said that they did not want local elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>No councillor wants a local election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not mind.  The Taoiseach said both in the House and outside, as did other Government sources, that rumours of a cancellation of the local elections were all nonsense and that it was a hallucination by the mad Fianna Fáil Party.  The year progressed and the Dublin Central by-election was held.  It is nice to have some part to play since, as director of elections, I managed to get some decision out of the result, even if it was the cancellation of the local elections.  That was the reason for the decision.  It had nothing to do with anything else.</P>
      <P>There have been occasions in the past when both local elections and by-elections were postponed but such situations give rise to a good deal of unease on the part of many people.  For instance, there are many who would regard themselves as non-political&mdash;community groups and other action groups &mdash; who continually harass politicians about being denied the opportunity to put themselves forward for local elections and to test the support that is forthcoming for them on the basis of the issues on which they are putting themselves forward.  There is no question of the Opposition merely seeking another election.  In accordance with the law and with regulations local elections should be held in June this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2045" /> It is now almost five years since the last local elections were held.  In the meantime we have had three general elections. There have been changes of Government but there has been no change so far as local authorities are concerned.  During all of this time people have been preparing for the elections, organising themselves so that they can have their campaign ready for this year but this House which is an institution in which democracy is supposed to be sacrosanct not only decides that a by-election should be postponed but decide also to postpone the local elections.  Anyone who understands local politics will know that there are people whose lives revolve around organising themselves for participation in local elections, people who are anxious to fight for the issues they believe in.  Local elections provide for those people the only opportunity available to allow them participate in local politics.  Perhaps local groups are now stronger and play a far greater role in local issues than was the case in the past.</P>
    <P>I cannot think of any circumstances that would justify the postponing of local elections.  Therefore, the Government's decision in this regard is wrong.  However, I do not think that the holding of local elections this year would have made a great difference to the representation in Dublin.  The Coalition parties would not be likely to lose substantially.  There might be a swing from one to another of the two parties but it is unlikely that at the end of the day representation in terms of numbers from each party would have differed greatly.  Fianna Fáil would have increased their representation while Labour would have lost substantially but Fine Gael would have been likely to hold on fairly well.  In those circumstances there was no need for the Government to defer the elections.  It would be helpful if the parties in Government were to admit that there is some validity in the argument we are making instead of saying that it is only a matter of Fianna Fáil being anxious for elections.  Such childish assertions are hardly worthy of the Government.</P>
    <P>There may be some validity in the reasons being put forward even at this <Col N="2046" /> stage for postponing the elections.  I know it was not the decision of the Minister to review the situation of local authorities or their financing.  The Tánaiste had made that decision but then there was a change of Government and he found himself having to defend what was a rather hasty decision.  However, he seems now to have the will to examine the present local authority structure with a view to seeing what can be done about it.  I accept that the whole situation of the financing of local authorities has altered in the past five or six years.  The abolition of domestic rates resulted in a much greater reliance on central Government financing.  Obviously, that is why the situation has changed.  The rate limitations that were introduced have not kept pace with inflation, as the figures show clearly. Consequently, it became much more difficult for local authorities to maintain the necessary level of services.</P>
    <P>We find that between 1978 and 1982 the consumer price index average increase has been 76.5 per cent while the rate increase limit in respect of local authorities has been 58 per cent.  That is the reason for the financial difficulties of these bodies.  Now that the estimates meetings are in progress, it is recognised generally that the financing of local authorities needs to be considered carefully with a view to ascertaining what changes can be made to make the whole situation more acceptable in the long term.  I do not know how this question ought to be tackled.  One could argue about local charges, about whether people should be asked to pay more taxation. Deputy Connolly seems to regard the water rates as being a fair taxation. There may be a slight lack of knowledge on his part in this respect.  I do not think there is any objection on the part of people in Dublin city, for instance, to paying water charges that would be related in some way to the provision of that service.  The objection is that in the first quarter of 1983 a crude figure was arrived at and that figure manifested itself in the form of a demand for water rates. What happened was that there was a shortfall in the finances in terms of expenditure <i>vis-à-vis</i> revenue and that in <Col N="2047" /> order to make up that shortfall a demand was sent out in the guise of charges for water.  The overall figure was apparently divided among the number of householders concerned and simply labelled a water charge.  It could have been called anything. It was an effort to make up the shortfall in revenue which local authorities were suffering as a result of not receiving the required finances from the Department.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city there are in excess of 500,000 people and the population is increasing steadily.  The revenue for administering services in the city for this year is £250 million compared with £220 million for last year.  We are talking of services that are essential.  Last year expenditure in housing amounted to £83.5 million while the figure in respect of road transportation was £31 million. Twenty-nine million pounds was spent on environmental protection and £21 million on water supply and sewerage.  These are huge figures.  In so far as the city is concerned it is not a question of cutting back services.  We are talking about fixed charges.  In this city, remuneration including pensions, constitutes 37 per cent of total revenue expenditure while the figure in respect of loan charges is 26 per cent with machinery grants amounting to 28 per cent and mandatory charges constituting 9 per cent.  In these circumstances there is little scope for the city councillors to change the structure or to control expenditure.  There is little they can do to improve the system or to save money.  This is the sort of situation that is having a detrimental effect on local authorities throughout the country who are now beginning to regard themselves as superfluous.  They have lost their powers. They are given a figure for the year. This year they were given 1 per cent on top of their outturn for 1983.  Most of them have taken the easy way out, the only way out: to increase the commercial and industrial rate and to try to finance their expenditure on those figures.</P>
    <P>We saw some very irresponsible actions in Dublin City Council last week. Labour members wanted to impose further increases on the hard-pressed commercial <Col N="2048" /> and industrial interests in the city.  They wanted to impose further rate charges.  With 68,000 people unemployed we are bending over backwards to try to keep people in employment.  Surely it was counter-productive, negative and deplorable to try to get more blood out of a stone and thereby create more unemployment. That is the type of thing councillors are pushed into.  It is going on all over the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has until the end of the year to prepare a comprehensive paper on how local authorities can be restructured, financed, given back some self-respect and control over their own decisions. We in Fianna Fáil are using this debate to try to highlight some of the problems.  We disagree with the decision to postpone the elections.  I wish the Minister well and his officials who will be doing the work.  When the report comes to the Government I hope they will not say it is too radical and would change the <i>status quo.</i>  It would be easy for the Minister for the Environment to draw lines on the map of Ireland in an effort to win extra seats on the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In 1979 Fianna Fáil went to the people and got a clear message.  We were not afraid in 1979 and we got a clear message. We were decimated at the polls.  We lost seats in a majority of the local authorities. We had the guts to hold the elections. Obviously the Government have not.  If they are to be meaningful, the changes must be radical and fundamental.  It is probable that the proposed changes and charges will be horrific to the public.  If we get a commitment at the end of this debate, at least we will have achieved something.  If the Minister just says Fianna Fáil did not want the elections held that is the type of politics we should be trying to get away from and I hope the Minister does not fall into that trap.</P>
    <P>The local authority areas are far too big.  The average number of people per constituency is ridiculous.  This is meant to be local politics and local democracy with councillors, urban councillors, district councillors and members of corporations having an input in local decision. III-advised decisions were taken.  Previous Ministers drew up areas for political <Col N="2049" /> advantage.  The local authority areas are not related to the type of problems in the different areas.  Very often a councillor's area is bigger than his Dáil area which means effectively that we have no local democracy.  There is no proper consultation.</P>
    <P>Councillors do not know their areas, which was the whole idea behind all the Acts.  It was intended that councillors should have an input in their own areas. This is a glorious opportunity to deal with that problem.  In Dublin we have about 500,000 people and 45 councillors.  We should try to get rid of all the arguments with people fighting each other within constituencies, with five councillors going to a meeting about some water problem or the roots of trees growing under a wall. They spend three hours at a public meeting with 30 people.  At the other end of the constituency there is an active residents' committee.</P>
    <P>It would be a very simple exercise to have an experiment with single seat constituencies, to take the wards and divide the city into 45 single seat constituencies. Councillors would then have 10,000 people and 2,000 houses to deal with.  A councillor would have about ten to 15 roads to look after and he could do his job properly and give real representation to the people.  The Minister knows that would be far better than the present position which is far from being a good democratic way to run the constituencies. We could divide Dublin into 45 single seat constituencies and let everybody stand for election.  Whoever was elected could go to the city council and face up to the problems which have to be dealt with.  This would be a far better set-up than the present structure.  The Minister should consider it seriously.  The five seat areas with 50,000 or 60,000 people are so far removed from local democracy that we might as well not have them at all. There are councillors who would not know the other end of the constituency and would see it very rarely apart from at election times.  They cannot get around to it because of the pressures and demands made on them in their own areas.</P>
    <P>If we had single seat areas there would <Col N="2050" /> still be plenty of competition because the local groups, pressure groups and political parties would keep any councillor busy.  He would be able to do his job in a worth-while and useful way.  The best person would be elected.  This would be far more democratic than the present system of local elections where through the vagaries of the PR system the fifth seat often goes to somebody who started with a handful of votes.  I have seen people who would be called right wing candidates in Irish politics getting in on the 17th count on transfers from left wing politicians in Irish terms.  They get in on the 17th count on the No. 12 or No. 13 votes.  What that has to do with democracy or local politics I do not know.  I always like to try to get in on the first count instead of having my fate decided by that kind of system.</P>
    <P>The Minister now has an opportunity to do something really democratic.  He has done something which is totally undemocratic.  Perhaps when in his wisdom he regrets that decision, he will try to do something democratic in the future. I know the Minister supports some of the things I have said.  When the matter is brought before the House again &mdash; hopefully before Christmas &mdash; will the Minister give us a clear indication that the document dealing with the reorganisation of local authorities will be a meaningful one and not a smokescreen as Members on this side of the House believe it will be?  I trust the Minister will refer to this in the course of his reply to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice of regret that the elections will not be proceeded with.  We all admit that there is need for reform in regard to local authorities but that could have taken place in ordinary circumstances.  There is no doubt that the reason the elections will be postponed is because the Coalition parties are not prepared to face the electorate.  Of course, if one looked at the present position sensibly one could not blame them.  There is no doubt that following the last by-election they were aware of the feeling of the people and <Col N="2051" /> realised that the climate was not right for an election.  There is no reason to believe that, as a Member stated, the Government will not seek a further extension next year and hold the elections in 1986. It is true that Fianna Fáil postponed local elections but there were valid reasons for that action.  At that time general elections were pending and I am sure Members on the Government side will not give us to believe that there is one pending now.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance withdrew grants under the farm modernisation scheme to save between £10 million and £12 million in February 1983 and we were told that they were being reviewed.  We were told that the western drainage and disadvantaged areas schemes were to be reviewed also.  That was a great excuse to hold back progress and a similar excuse is being advanced now to deny the people an opportunity to vote in local elections. Bearing in mind the financial problems local authorities are facing, I believe June would be an opportune time for the Government to go to the country.  All parties would have to submit their plans for local authority reform to the people for consideration.  I have no doubt that we would meet the challenge and produce a positive policy on the structure of local authorities.  All political parties appealed to young people to enter politics and some able and articulate young people have joined.  They had hoped that they would get an opportunity of putting their names on the various tickets in a local election.  Fianna Fáil were eager to have such candidates in all areas to test the volume of support for them.  Those people have a lot to contribute and all Members who meet such people are aware of their potential.  The young people who have entered Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour have a commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any Government should be permitted to postpone local elections and I have strong views about postponing such contests.  The date for them should be statutory and they should be held on the appointed day.  It is unfortunate that the elections are being postponed at a time when local authorities are facing <Col N="2052" /> serious financial difficulties.  For the first time since I became a member of a local authority our council at its estimates meeting was unable to meet its commitments. In effect we will have a 10 per cent reduction in the allocation for roads. Our local authority is in a very weak position in regard to raising money through charges for services.  We do not have any regional water schemes in the county &mdash; they are all group schemes &mdash; and our refuse collection service is confined to urban areas.  Our ability to collect revenue is very limited.  There was a lot of diverting of traffic in our county because of the cratering and closing of Border roads to roads that did not have the pavement structure to carry heavy traffic.  As a result of that change there has been a heavy demand on the local authority to improve the condition of those roads.  Another problem for Monaghan is that there are very few commercial premises to meet the increased rate demand.  I realise that local authorities will face problems in the future if they are to provide the services people demand from them.  At our estimates meeting on Monday week we had to cut back on our commitment to ACOT, the VEC and the Office of Public Works in regard to the arterial drainage schemes. We also had to cut back on supplementary benefit payments and the contribution to the health board.</P>
    <P>I am a firm believer in paying one's way and I do not have any time for the use-now-pay-later concept, particularly at local authority level.  We have been told by ACOT that our decision to give them one-fifth of their demand would not affect the services in the county, but I find that hard to believe.  We were told that the regional ACOT office would suffer. I have no doubt that agriculture will suffer.  The VEC will suffer also.  I do not know if the Office of Public Works will permit us to pay our instalment later.  It will be difficult to persuade them to permit us to pay our 1984 shortfall in 1985.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the position in regard to malicious injury damage claims in Border counties which are recouped to local authorities.  I asked the Minister for Justice today if he would consider amending <Col N="2053" /> or abolishing the Act covering malicious damage in view of the serious burden the present system places on local authorities.  In the course of his reply the Minister said he was not in a position to make any statement on this matter except to say that if the Government decided there should be changes an announcement would be made in the normal course.  The Minister went on to say that meanwhile he felt he should place on record the fact that the Exchequer recoups to local authorities outlay on malicious damage in excess of the produce of a rate of 20p in the £.</P>
    <P>Very few local authorities have to go to the maximum of 20p in the £ but we have to do that every year because of the amount of damage done.  Admittedly there is some recoupment but the local authority have to carry responsibility so far as it concerns processing, investigating and contesting claims in court.  I will give the House one instance of a malicious injury claim to Monaghan County Council.  The amount was for £25,000 and it was received in 1978.  The people afterwards reduced their claim to £7,920.  The alleged damage was stated to have been caused by an explosion; the area is very close to the Border.  The council arranged to have the premises examined by technical experts whose reports revealed there were no good grounds for the claim. At the hearing in the Circuit Court the claimant was awarded £15 in respect of glass damage.  He appealed it to the High Court and the compensation was increased to £75 together with costs in the Circuit Court.  The case was appealed.  The cost to the council of examining and processing the claim and defending the action in court amounted to £4,491.60.  I made the point today to the Minister for Justice to amend the legislation in this area because local authorities are being put in a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>Our Army have carried out controlled explosions and there have been a number of instances where damage was caused&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is grouped under malicious injuries and the money has to be paid in the same way.  The major problem facing many local authorities deals with our roads structure.  We had a road development plan for the eighties which was welcomed and which if it were implemented even in a small way would be of great help.  However, the money for this is not forthcoming as we had anticipated. I ask the Minister to examine how best to use the money that is available from the EEC.  I travel on the Derry-Dublin road several times a week and I am not satisfied that the various local authorities are carrying out the necessary maintenance works.  The Department should monitor how local authorities use the money for maintenance of roads.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider the programme for western development where £750,000 is made available for local improvement schemes and the same amount is available each year for roads. The Department of the Environment did not give this money in addition to the normal allocations; in other words, they reduced their allocations according to the amount of money available from the EEC.  I notice that under the local improvement schemes the Department have not rectified a situation which I discussed here some time ago in an Adjournment debate.  I asked the then Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, to reconsider the matter before the allocations were made.  However, anomalies still exist in the allocations.  Regard has not been taken of the needs of the areas in question.</P>
      <P>The local elections would have been a good opportunity for the political parties to put forward their policies and programmes to the electorate for their decision but the Government have missed the chance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>With previous speakers on this side of the House I wish to voice my objection to the postponement of the local elections that were due to be held next June.  I shall talk about the current crises in local authorities and I hope the Minister will take note of some of the points and perhaps use them as <Col N="2055" /> material for the hoped-for reform of local government which the Government have said they will introduce.</P>
      <P>I am not at all impressed by the arguments put forward by the opposite side regarding the reason for the postponement of the local elections.  All of us in this House have gone through elections to have the right to stand up here and put our point of view.  One of the most important areas of democracy in Ireland or in any other country where true democracy is practised relates to local politics. People enter local councils and they endeavour through their services to represent the people who have elected them. We are too anxious to denigrate the role of the local politician, to dismiss that role as being of a parish pump nature.  We are inclined to dismiss too easily discussions on roads, sewerage, lights, refuse collection and sanitary services.  In my years on a local authority I have found that the real pulse of life is in the affairs and the matters discussed in that body.</P>
      <P>I am amused when I hear people say that politicians all the time should be in the Dáil or in the committee system debating the issues of the day and not be spending so much time in their constituencies, demeaning themselves dealing with local issues.  That is a silly argument. If a public representative is not busy with local issues, meeting the people and hearing their views, how can one understand these issues and be able to make a contribution to legislation?  We read that the Dáil should sit longer hours, that there should be more committees, that we should spend all day here in this rarified &mdash; I will not say refined &mdash; atmosphere, forgetting what real life is.  It is about local issues, it is about housing, food, roads, sanitary services, all of the things we discuss every week at local council level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course we can transfer that to a higher level when we come here to make our contributions to legislation.  As a councillor for some years I have been interested in housing particularly.  It is a subject that appeals to a woman.  I have many thoughts on special category cases, loans, mortgages, and I learned much <Col N="2056" /> from my dealings with men and women locally.  I value the work done by local councils and I value my experience on them and I hope I will spend many years on them, at the wishes of the electorate. I hope that some of the lessons I have learned locally can be of some benefit on another forum.</P>
    <P>Of course, I nail the general sort of feeling that local authorities are for local issues only.  Local authorities have another role as well, a very significant role, and I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has been very involved locally for many years because I have heard his views.  Therefore, I have no credit for people who say that Dáil representatives should not be bothered with local issues. I am available to meet my constituents at any time.  That is what it is all about.  Very often problems which are aired and discussed locally can be sorted out and solutions found.  It is laughable to hear people talking about Deputies and their role locally, particularly when one thinks about general elections with candidates knocking frenziedly on people's doors. Deputies should be more and more available to their constituents and more accountable to them at local level.</P>
    <P>I value my contact with constituents. Apart altogether from the human contact it is a way to break down bureaucracy.  I value it for the information and the feedback I get from my constituents.  They enable me to tackle my job in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>The reason given by the Government for postponing the local elections is the imminent introduction of reforms, the getting together of a package, financial and structural, of reforms in local government. The Government say they will be presenting this package.  We were told originally that the elections would be postponed from 1984 until next year.  I have a sizeable bet that they will not be held until 1986, but I hope I will not win it.  I listened to Deputy Dowling on the monitor this evening saying that if the local elections have to be postponed to 1986, so be it.  That is the first time I have heard this said by a Coalition Member. He is giving advance warning that the <Col N="2057" /> local elections will not be held before 1986.</P>
    <P>Recently when we had a motion to issue the writ for the by-election in Laois-Offaly to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Deputy Cowen I was amazed to hear that the main reason for opposing the motion was financial, the economic state of the country.  They said it would be better if the by-election and the European elections could be held on the one day.  To follow that to its logical conclusion, why not have the three elections on the one day?  Of course, the reason is economical one day and it is not the next day.  The argument that the three elections would not be held together for financial reasons does not hold water, therefore.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jimmy Leonard asked why not go to the country in June and ask all parties to put forward their packages for local government reform.  There is need for reform in local government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is rude and ungentlemanly and wrong of the Minister, a man in his position, to interrupt when I am making my contribution, which I am sure may be as valuable as that of anybody else.  It is highly reprehensible. The Minister is trying to bluff and bluster about the postponement of the local elections.  If he was a man he would hold them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local government needs reform.  Local authorities need finance.  I brought here this evening a copy of the estimate presented to Westmeath County Council last week.  I spoke with the county manager last week and told him I would do so and he said I was quite welcome.  It is a doomsday document.  It proves that if the financial structures of local authorities <Col N="2058" /> are not altered quickly there will be an end to local government as we know it. In Westmeath we got an allocation from the Government of 0.8 per cent more. That is the grant which came this year to each local authority.  The rate of inflation, no matter how kindly you look at it, will mean that we will be suffering a minus amount of 8, 9 or 10 per cent.  That is a most salient issue with which the Government will not go to the electorate. They have starved local authorities of finance.</P>
    <P>In Athlone it will cost £80 to get water out of your tap and to have your black bag taken away once a week.  The county manager told us that in 1983 &ldquo;I referred to the public debate on the financing of local authorities and it is regretted that nothing appears to have happened.  This council cannot maintain all the essential basic services after this year...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a bureaucrat speaking.  He stated in the yellow pages of this doomsday document that until some method of financing local authorities has been devised Westmeath cannot continue to provide services.  If these extra grants are not restored in 1985 the present level of activity cannot be financed and the choices will be drastic.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Leonard's remarks that they would have to cut down on the statutory demands from other agencies to them.  It is not that we must cut down; we have not been able to pay. The Ceann Comhairle as a member of a local authority will be amazed at this.  We owe ACOT £76,600, the Inny drainage scheme £82,719, the Brosna drainage scheme £27,000 and the supplementary welfare allowance scheme £387,000, and we cannot pay them.  The manager states here that he cannot pay what he owes because the central Exchequer grant to the local authorities has been diminished at the rate of 8, 9, 10 per cent this year. These facts are not being stated and they are the reason why the local elections are not to be held this year.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to do what we did in 1979 when we were not very much in favour, as I know from going from door to door.  The postal strike had continued for six months.  It was handled correctly <Col N="2059" /> by the then Minister, Deputy Faulkner, but because the public were aggrieved by it, because large numbers of people could not get their mail and terrible machinations had to be resorted to in order that social welfare benefits could reach the benificiaries, we bore the brunt of all that.  We bore the brunt of the local authority refuse strike in Dublin and many other issues.  We took our punishment and our medicine because we had to do so.  We held the elections in conjunction with the European elections. The main reason the Coalition are not going to the public is that they do not wish to subject themselves to local authority elections because they do not wish to see wrested from them their dominance their majority status which now obtains in many county councils.  If the local elections were to be held next June the two Coalition parties would lose the dominance they now enjoy within county councils.  Not alone that, subsequent Seanad elections would be affected in that Seanad nominees go to local councillors for their votes to the Seanad. Therefore, the Government will wait until this package is implemented before proceeding with the local elections.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea of local authority reform and reform of the financial structures of local authorities, but why not go to the people?  The people that the Minister will be dealing with in the next two years while going through these reforms will contain many councillors who will not be going forward again, who have given years of service or who for one reason or another do not intend to contest the polls again.  Why not deal with the people who in 1984 would have subjected themselves to the electorate, looking forward to their five-year or ten-year tenure, who would be full of vim and vigour for the job ahead of them?  Why not give them the chance to contribute meaningful to whatever reforms and structures are to be made, particularly in the financial area?  The deferral of the local elections is an evasion of responsibilities where they matter most, at ground level, at local level.</P>
    <P>As I suppose the Minister will be looking <Col N="2060" /> for some positive points from the Opposition, I would like to address myself to two or three matters pertaining to the by-pass in Athlone, if the Ceann Comhairle will pardon me for raising that under the heading of local authority reform and restructure.  I ask the Minister of State if he will expedite the issue of the CPO and also give the subsequent order for the bridge order which will enable the by-pass road at Athlone to go ahead.  The momentum which had been achieved in both political will and the supply of finances to enable the massive job &mdash; which in today's terms is of the order of £28 million and which is helped greatly by EEC moneys &mdash; to go ahead has, I am afraid, been diminished since Fianna Fáil went out of office.  I ask the Minister of State to see that the momentum comes back into what is not just an Athlone issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Environment, particularly in their reconstruction grants area and grants section generally, could be decentralised.  It is frustrating for inspectors, for the consumer, the politicians, for everybody concerned that everything concerning the payment or refusal of grants should be done on a county basis.  More efficiency than pertains at present would be achieved by <Col N="2061" /> decentralisation of this area, and I ask the Minister of State to consider that.</P>
    <P>The local elections have been deferred from 1984 to 1985 but a large question mark is over that now.  I understand from Deputy Dowling's statement here this evening that the deferral will not be just to 1985 but it may be to 1986.  It reminds of Scarlett O'Hara in <i>Gone With the Wind</i> who when faced with an unpleasant task would flounce off to bed saying, &ldquo;I will think about that tomorrow&rdquo;.  If the Government are faced with something unpleasant, if they are in bad odour and held in poor respect in local authorities, rather than deal with the problem as they should, they flounce off and say that they will think about that tomorrow.  When will that tomorrow be?  It should be today.  There is no greater opportunity of putting the hoped-for reforms before the electorate than having the local elections this year, 1984.  I condemn the Government for not doing so and I urge people to note that the present Coalition are cowardly in not wishing to face the electorate on both the local and by-election issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get an opportunity to say a few words on this Bill which proposes to defer the local elections.  Local elections are an important part of our democratic set-up and only under the most extreme circumstances should they be deferred.  The reasons given for their deferral on this occasion do not come within the scope of extreme urgency.  Local authorities are of great importance.  Unfortunately, over the years they have lost a great deal of their power and autonomy due to the centralisation of Government and the taking away of many of the powers that were originally with the local authorities.  I believe, as does everybody in this House, that reform is necessary.  The loss of autonomy has led to weaknesses at local level and an inability to respond to local needs and to the partial paralysis of local bodies, but I believe that reform is not the reason for the postponement of the local elections.  It is clear to all who see and accept the truth that reform is not the reason for the postponement.  Rather <Col N="2062" /> the reason is that those in power now and those who have control of the vast majority of the county councils are afraid that, should the elections be held in the present economic climate, Fianna Fáil would gain power in the vast majority of urban and county councils and corporations.  This is borne out by what I see and hear in my area, which has been badly hit by unemployment over the last year of so.  The area has five urban councils &mdash; Cobh, Midleton, Youghal, Fermoy and Mallow. In these towns there are over 1,200 unemployed. In Youghal, for example, over 1,000 are unemployed &mdash; 35 to 40 per cent of the population.</P>
      <P>Because of the negative policies on job creation being pursued at present, the people of that area would give an emphatic vote of support to Fianna Fáil and vote out the Fine Gael and Labour members if an election were held today. In the last few days in the town of Youghal it has been announced that another 100 people are to be put out of work.  This was a tremendous shock to the people of the town, because Youghal Carpets was one of the best known firms in the country, at one stage employing 800 to 900 people.</P>

Unless some goodwill is shown by the present Government in helping the people out of their dilemma, when the local elections are held there will be a resounding answer which will give the viewpoint of the people.</P>
      <P>For local authorities to operate efficiently and effectively, they must be financially independent.

      <P>Another false reason given for postponing the local elections was that they could not be held in conjunction with the European elections. However, the Government made another U-turn regarding the European elections when it suited them.  They turned down our moving of the writ for the by-election caused by the death of my late colleague and very good friend, Deputy Cowen.  How can they justify such a U-turn?  How can they say that it is not fitting to hold local and European elections on the same day and that it is all right to hold a by-election on that day? The real reason for postponing these local elections is that they would result in Fianna Fáil taking control of the majority of the county councils and, when the Seanad elections came up, Fianna Fáil would have a greater number of votes and would be able to increase their representation in the Seanad.  Everybody knows that that is the true reason.</P>
      <P>I am not a member of a local authority, but am well aware of their trojan work. Members of my family have been involved in local politics since the twenties. Many young Fianna Fáil people in Cork are waiting in the wings to take the seats of the impotent and sterile Coalition party members.  If the local elections had been held, there would not have been enough seats for Fianna Fáil members in the councils.  The Government decided to run and live to fight another day.  They have run from this contest as they have from attempting to solve our gravest problem &mdash; unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues on this side of the House, I express my gross dissatisfaction, disappointment and utter disgust at the decision of the Government to postpone the local elections which should be held this year.  Everybody interested in local authorities is asking today if these will be held in 1985 or <Col N="2065" /> postponed until 1986.  I do not think we have had a guarantee from any source in this regard.  I ask the Minister to tell us when exactly he proposes to hold these elections.  Is he just putting off the evil day?  The last local elections were held in June 1979 in conjunction with the European elections.  At that stage things were not very favourable for Fianna Fáil but they had the courage to go ahead and let the people decide.  Unfortunately the people on that occasion did not decide in favour of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>It is because things became so favourable for the Coalition parties in those local elections that they have decided to hold on to whatever advantage was gained from those elections.  Why are they not holding the local elections and the European elections on the same day this year?  We have heard much talk about book balancing and cutting costs. It was an opportunity to cut costs by holding both those elections on the same day.  It is a well known fact that the local elections will cost the taxpayer over £1 million.  The two elections could have been held on the same day and save this large sum of money.  The Government are not consistent in relation to what they have been saying over the past 14 months.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government must be aware of the difficulty of getting people out to vote in European elections. This is one of the main reasons the local elections and the European elections were held on the same day the last time. It is very difficult for people in county areas to identify with the European scene particularly if they have not a candidate. For obvious reasons every county will not have a candidate.  Everybody should have the opportunity of saying who should be elected to the vitally important forum of the European parliament but because of the proposal of the Government not to hold the local elections this year I feel we will not be able to generate enough interest to obtain a successful conclusion from the European elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recently proposed that the by-election in Laois-Offaly should be held in the near future but the Government took the <Col N="2066" /> despicable decision, in typical Government fashion, not to allow this by-election to be held soon but to have it on the same day as the European elections.  The Government did not treat the House with the normal traditions we were used to in relation to this matter.  The information was available in Laois-Offaly before it was conveyed to the Fianna Fáil Whip. This is not good for the constituents of any Deputy.  The Government used the new phenomenon they have become accustomed to of feeding information to the media.  The media are allowing themselves to be used by the Coalition parties.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said it would be very wrong to hold the local elections on the same day as the European elections because one would detract from the other.  How can it be acceptable to hold a by-election on the same day as the European elections?  Are the people in Laois-Offaly considered not to be as important as the people in the rest of the country?  Deputy Skelly about a fortnight ago said that if Fianna Fáil were on the Government benches they would have used the very same situation for their own expediency.  Deputy Skelly claimed afterwards he was being honest.  I believe he was and the reason the local elections are not being held this year is that the Government are afraid to face Fianna Fáil.  They have learned from recent experiences particularly in Donegal and Dublin Central.</P>
    <P>In Dublin Central the Fine Gael candidate was selected specifically for the task in hand.  That particular candidate was tabbed &ldquo;Garret's choice&rdquo;.  Fine Gael thought they would clean up on account of this wonderful tab but we all know that the Fine Gael vote dropped by 15 per cent on that occasion.  They have now decided because of the results in Donegal and Dublin Central, they will not hold the local elections this year.  They would be beaten badly if they did.</P>
    <P>When the last local elections were held the Fine Gael and Labour Parties achieved remarkable success.  On the General Council of County Councils and on the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture on which every county council and county committee of <Col N="2067" /> agriculture are represented the figures are in the region of 60 members for the Coalition parties and 30 members for Fianna Fáil.  These are vitally important bodies.  In the last three Seanad elections the General Council of County Councils and the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture were able to put forward candidates and they manipulated democracy to ensure that Fianna Fáil did not have any candidate.  They do not want to disturb this comfortable position they hold on those committees.</P>
    <P>Many county councils, urban councils, town commissioners and corporations have a majority of their members belonging to the Coalition parties and they want to retain this position.  The Government want the local councils on which they have a majority to push through the charges they are imposing on local authorities and on people expecting services from local authorities.  We now have charges for planning permission. Young people interested in building houses have to find money to pay for the planning charge.  There are charges for planning permission on agricultural buildings.  Those buildings are very large and it is quite obvious that the planning charges have become ridiculous.  Farmers used to be able to reclaim some of that charge through the farm modernisation scheme but this is now finished.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, alarmed by the ever-increasing rise in unemployment, condemns the Government for continuing to ignore this social disaster or to take any positive action to deal with the situation. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all recognise that this is the pressing issue by which we will all be judged.  This is the subject of relevance to the people, particularly our young people.  I want to make some preliminary observations. <Col N="2068" /> Over the last few weeks politicians have been preoccupied with a matter which does not appear to affect the lives of the ordinary citizen as much as this awesome problem of unemployment.  I am speaking of course of the questions, doubts and apprehensions raised about telephone tapping, bugging and other matters which rate importance in their own areas.  The public expect us to do something positive, to give them hope where there is no hope and to create opportunities which do not exist at present.  They do not want to be distracted and they do not want to see us distracted by continuing reports, leaks, observations and interviews relating to this matter.</P>
    <P>We put down this motion last week because we wanted to focus on this issue which is the common responsibility of all Members of this House.  Before the last general election we all gave commitments to reduce the numbers of unemployed and we also promised to set up a judicial inquiry into the matters I have referred to.  As Fianna Fáil spokesman on finance and economic planning may I plead with the Government to honour that commitment and take this subject out of the arena of political dissension?  Would they do what they said, and what we said, and set up the judicial inquiry to set the public mind at rest?  If they do that the public will realise that we are concerned about the problems they are facing.  Members on both sides recognise that this is our fundamental responsibility.  If that commitment is honoured I give an undertaking on behalf of this side of the House that we will focus on the fundamental issue &mdash; the need to create opportunities, hope and above all employment for our people.</P>
    <P>In November 1982 the Government promised to take firm and decisive action to deal with the growing problem of unemployment which at that time stood at 170,000.  Today, 18 months later, that number has increased by 40,000, and that number is still growing.  So far we have seen no evidence of any action, much less firm and decisive action, from the Government to deal with what we all acknowledge to be the most pressing issue facing Members who come here to <Col N="2069" /> discharge our obligations to the electorate. The problem has reached crisis proportions and thousands of people, especially young people, cannot see any Government plan, programme or central direction to which they can respond.</P>
    <P>There is a limit to what Government can do, or should pretend they can do, in terms of generating jobs.  We have seen the growth of public expenditure, representing 68 per cent of GNP, an increase of over 28 per cent, in a few years.  We must create a climate and encourage people to do for themselves, to create opportunities by offering incentives. People should know that once they put their hands to the plough they will not be discouraged from continuing to plough the furrow by way of tax burdens and impositions which have reached an unacceptably high level.  That is the subject on which we should focus this evening.</P>
    <P>We have exactly three hours to come up with a broad outline to solve this problem, Fianna Fáil will have 90 minutes to make their contributions and the Coalition will have 90 minutes.  We have deliberately decided to focus on this as the only issue which justifies our presence. This is the test on which the Government will stand or fall.  We all owe the public an apology because this Government did not order business in a way to enable us to have a comprehensive discussion on this issue.  We would like to put forward our plans and test them against the Government plans, even if we had to wait another month to hear the Government's plans.  But no, we have this three hour debate.  As I said, we all owe, particularly Government, the public an apology for constraining us from discussing this growing crisis.</P>
    <P>While this is a national crisis, it is a dangerous crisis in certain parts of this country, particularly in this city.  I heard a discussion on the radio about the problems facing the people of Tallaght, the sense of hopelessness that pervades that area and the inadequacy of this Government's attempts to help the young people.  We do not need to focus on the problems of the inner city, unfortunately. My colleague, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, will understandably refer to the crisis in <Col N="2070" /> our second city, Cork.  In Dublin, Cork and elsewhere we are seeing and tolerating an economic and social crisis and waiting for something from a Government who tell us that the National Planning Board may be coming up with proposals but when they do the Government will first have to consider them and a few months later we will be discussing them in the absence of firm and decisive Government action.  That is the background to this problem.</P>
    <P>I want to put a few facts on the record. It is not our intention to add further to the hopelessness, frustration or despair running through the country, but we must acknowledge the extent of the problem and then see how we should tackle it. The economic conditions of the rest of the world by which we are greatly influenced are already lifting.  We have a higher level of GNP in trading than any other country in the world.  We have an opportunity, if we had a plan and a programme, to avail of that lift.  By comparison with the rest of Europe, the trend of unemployment here last year was an average of just over 16 per cent, almost two-and-a-half times the growth of unemployment in the rest of the EEC.  There are problems in the other member states but unemployment is tapering off throughout the EEC.  However, that is not the case here.  There are factors which relate to the lack of economic policy and the dismal performance of the Government. It has to be acknowledged that we have a massive growth in population which is not a feature elsewhere.  Having said that, the fact is that conditions outside are not only benign but positive in America, Japan and Europe.  Yet we are still waiting for something.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that his first priority is to control and regulate tax revenue and seal off loopholes.  We are waiting for that priority to be realised.  I will name some of the major industries which have closed since the beginning of this year.  We have lost at least 2,000 jobs in manufacturing industry: Irish Biscuits, Blackwater, Youghal, Kelly's Portlaoise, Keenan's, Bagnelstown, Burlington, Fords, Cork, Warner Lambert, Stainless Steel, Roscommon, Westinghouse Dunleer, <Col N="2071" /> Youghal Carpets.  There are many more.  It was mentioned in the debate in relation to Fóir Teoranta that they were unable to cope with the growing number of job losses last year.</P>
    <P>In 1980 one out of every 14 people was unemployed.  As we speak, that figure is one out of six.  That demands action.  The numbers employed in manufacturing industry and those employed on the land, which is our greatest national resource, are outnumbered by the numbers unemployed. That is startling.  Is that any grounds for reassurance?  The number of those under the age of 25 who are unemployed is greater than the total number who were employed ten years ago.  Is that something to be proud of?  Do we just sit back and say we will have a report from the planning board soon or that we will concentrate on the priority of collecting tax?  Do we realise that out there is a seething bed of discontent?  People are concerned about their husband, son, wife or daughter.  What about the indignity the unemployed are suffering?  We hear about it on radio every day.  How long do we think we can sit back?  How long do we think they will confine their frustrations to talking on radio programmes? Not only is unemployment rising but employment is falling.  In the face of a Liverpool here, with a growing population of young people, in 1982 and 1983 the numbers employed fell by 45,000.</P>
    <P>I state these facts to highlight the problem we face.  The Government gave a commitment that they would take firm action to deal with this problem.  Behind the statistics is a human crisis which is threatening not only to undermine the economy but much more.  Let us look at some of the factors which are the background to the problem.</P>
    <P>One of our responsibilities is to create a climate in which people will invest and are satisfied that they are not being penalised by working.  The level of investment last year at 23 per cent of GDP was the lowest for 15 years.  The Public Capital Programme last year was slashed by 25 per cent.  That is the contribution from Government to create the environment for infrastructural development in which <Col N="2072" /> others can make plans for industrial and manufacturing activity.  Foreign investment in this country has dried up.  The IDA are talking about attracting 1,000 jobs this year.  Did we think we would reach a stage &mdash; I do not blame them &mdash; where one of our State agencies with the greatest degree of support and financial incentive would acknowledge that the climate for investment here was so poor that nothing, not even their expertise or contacts throughout the world, could attract more than 1,000 jobs at this stage?</P>
    <P>In case we think they are getting everything else right in terms of the budget deficit and so on, the Minister acknowledged as recently as 7 February that total foreign indebtedness at the end of 1983 is just short of £9,000 million.  At the end of 1982 it was just short of £7,000 million. That is an increase of £2,000 million in a year in which the Government told us they would reduce the level of debt.  The Minister has suggested that those of us who state these facts are undermining confidence but look at some of the hamfisted attempts made in the budget in relation to gilts.  If there is something to be done about them it should be done but there is a way to do it without undermining confidence.  If the Government and the Department of Finance expect to raise £1,000 million on the domestic market this year, which was the projection, they will not succeed because of the way they have undermined confidence by their handling of bond washing on the Stock Exchange.  There are people looking for some place to invest funds but if the Minister wants money he had better make up the shortfall elsewhere.  It will not be available to him at a time when we need to encourage investment.</P>
    <P>While all this is happening we have the emergence of what is being called the black hole, the unrecorded outflow of £1,000 million from the economy last year.  This has occurred to such an extent that we will probably have to revise our figures for growth last year and our projections for growth this year together with our balance of payments estimates. How can we plan when as a consequence of the clear indications this Government have given they are going to penalise <Col N="2073" /> investment, get in as much tax revenue as they can and levy charges on all kinds of activities?  That message is also going out to other countries which were formerly attracted here.</P>
    <P>We need a comprehensive plan for national development in all areas by which every action of Government will be informed, tested or judged.  If a budget is not part of a comprehensive national plan for development it is of no consequence. In the weeks before the budget the Minister for Finance managed to focus attention on the options and alternatives open to him.  Economic and other commentators were drawing up alternative budgets and not paying enough attention to the genuine one.  All the words that were written and the comments which were made do not matter in the face of the issue with which we are now dealing.  A budget which is only an instrument to implement a comprehensive plan is not just a neutral budget, it is a nonsensical budget.  This neutral budget followed the most deflationary budget in the history of the State the previous year. There were unprecedented levels of taxation and levies of all kinds.  We deflated the economy and penalised everyone who made an effort to improve things. We even succeeded, unfortunately, in dividing the community and created tensions between employers and employees and PAYE workers and others.  The Minister aggravated the situation by ignoring facts.</P>
    <P>There are ways of creating new hope and confidence in people.  We should take down all the signposts which are pointing backwards in our economy and which penalise effort and incentive.  We should clearly signal that if they take risks they will be rewarded whether they are self-employed, industrialists, agriculturalists or employees.  There is a whole range of areas where this can be done.  We welcomed the minimal effort announced in the budget that the Minister would grant tax concessions to venture capital for new manufacturing industry.  Remember, however, that the same Minister in his previous budget abolished the tax concessions which had existed here since the thirties.  We argued and pleaded with him <Col N="2074" /> not to do so, to no avail.  He abolished tax concessions for people investing in publicly quoted companies as if anyone would pretend that the dividends yield from investment in publicly quoted companies up to last year would measure up to the return in investment from the safe havens of gilts and building societies.</P>
    <P>The tax concessions should be expanded to include not just new manufacturing industries but jobs in existing industries because they are very clearly at risk.  It would be a sign to those who have committed themselves over the years that their efforts will be rewarded. Indeed, the Minister should not confine it to manufacturing industry only.  I am sure he is aware that the IDA or consultants in other organisations would tell him that the ratio in respect of new jobs is at best one to five in the manufacturing industry and the service sector.  Surely jobs that are created in the trade and services sector, where the real growth potential is, will pay dividends?  If one looks at the developing economies of America and Japan, particularly America, one can see they have precisely the same number of people employed today in manufacturing industry as they had about 20 years ago.  Nonetheless, there has been a 2 per cent growth in employment in real terms in the other sectors.  I hope the Minister is prepared to take account of that and make that proposal when he introduces the Finance Bill. Frankly, the revenue that might be lost as a consequence of this would be more than repaid by the investment, employment and activity which would follow. The tax yield would be much more considerable than the Minister would lose in making concessions of this sort.</P>
    <P>We want to promote common purpose and enterprise and to establish cohesion between employers and employees.  As a clear indication of that common purpose and ownership in all activities, including employer and employee relationships, we should promote motivation among employees by developing concepts of interrelationship and industrial democracy, sharing of information with employees, profit sharing and shareholding by employees.  For instance, to acquire <Col N="2075" /> shares for employees we could encourage shareholding through the allocation of shares at preferential rates through the acquisition of shares by employees on the Stock Exchange or through normal commercial channels.  We could also encourage it by giving signals to the industrial sector, who now, incidentally, seem to be moving in that direction and are prepared to acknowledge that disclosure is not necessarily bad, to promote a sense of common purpose.  We can do these things if we move in that direction.  The Government might also consider giving a lead by encouraging commercial State-sponsored bodies to seek a Stock Exchange quotation or to introduce profit sharing and shareholding schemes for employees. We need to take radical action because we do not want to confine our efforts to what has been done up to the present in terms of worker participation on boards.</P>
    <P>We should encourage people to move out of safe haven investments.  They are already moving out into risk-taking investments.  Apart from the undisclosed sum of £1 billion mentioned recently, a considerable amount of money is being invested abroad by Irish business, manufacturing and constructing companies.  I would not criticise them because in order to maintain even skeleton activity here they are going to a better climate.  Surely we should see the need to encourage that kind of investment here.  We must promote venture capital investment through tax incentives for employment-creating activities in industry, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, tourism, construction, the service sector and even community development programmes which are the nub of much that happens in rural Ireland.  We can encourage pension and life assurance funds managers to channel their funds to resource development for employment creation.  This must not be beyond the wit of Government.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge that the level of Government allocations for forestry and fisheries is actually falling in money terms, much less in real terms.  If the public purse cannot promote activity for employment in these areas the Minister <Col N="2076" /> must stir his imagination to attract pension funds and others to invest in these programmes.  They are waiting to do so but are being constrained by the out-moded thinking to which the Minister seems to be particularly prone.  Surely he is aware that people are waiting to invest, given the signal.  If the Government cannot provide funds they should at least encourage others to invest venture capital to generate employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Our industrial development programme has served us well but the IDA and CTT acknowledge that we are now dealing in a different world.  We are not able to attract investment in the same way through grants for fixed capital assets and so on.  The focus now is different and must be based on product development and marketing incentives.  Even a small share of the growing international market would deal with out problems and realise our potential and we must shift the emphasis in that direction.  Fixed capital assets are not of much consequence when the unit is failing.  We should encourage the IDA and CTT to combine together. Both have an international reputation and many contacts.  If we had a plan they would carry it out.  We must employ a research and development programme, sophisticated product development and an aggressive marketing strategy.  Those who have been most actively involved do not see much hope in the way things are being done and perhaps they are looking elsewhere to see how they can make their contribution other than through these agencies.</P>
    <P>Our first resource is our people and we must have a programme for investment in education.  We recently had a debate on education and I am glad to see our spokesman in the House.  Anything we have ever done has been based on a programme of investment in education.  This was particularly so during the sixties and seventies.  There is no point in having a nice academic discussion on a programme for education if it is not supported by the necessary investment funds.  Our first priority must be to develop the skills that will give added <Col N="2077" /> value at technological, marketing and every other level.</P>
    <P>Last year's nonsensical decision to cancel examinations in modern languages was evidence of blindness to the need to encourage our people to acquire these skills.  This decision was taken for the sake of a miserable £0.5 million, although as an afterthought they changed it.  We must invest in education to equip our young people.</P>
    <P>Agriculture needs a plan.  We are cutting back on farm modernisation.  Does anyone suggest that Irish agriculture is too modern?  The allocation for farm modernisation is now 50 per cent less than two years ago.  Marketing is needed to develop our agri-food industry.  The Germans and Dutch are using Irish-type names to market their products but we have no real marketing programme to make the most of what we have.  We must work through the co-op movement in every area to develop the strength and cohesion of Irish rural life, which was also a great characteristic of this city until it was undermined in recent times.</P>
    <P>Forestry, fisheries and tourism are our resources.  Tourism has been a growth are internationally for five or ten years. We have almost killed it here and we moan about what is going to Northern Ireland.  We should be getting our share but it is diminishing and the potential will not be realised until the Minister has second thoughts in relation to the level of indirect taxation which is crucifying this sector.</P>
    <P>The European Social Fund is ploughing money into this country.  Most of it is intended to promote employment in small and medium-sized enterprises.  By definition every Irish enterprise would qualify for assistance.  Management support in small and medium-sized industries for research and development and marketing is vitally important.  We must beware of using these funds for administrative growth, as has been happening.  I do not want to criticise agencies because many of them have played a considerable role but if we do not have co-ordination between the IDA, CTT and AnCO we will not be able to maximise the creation <Col N="2078" /> of real jobs and real targets in new enterprises.</P>
    <P>We must have strong and aggressive policies.  The Taoiseach should talk directly to Mrs. Thatcher and tell her that she cannot put a chain around our necks, using the false and specious arguments about the budget which she has been allowed to get away with.  He should tell her that what she claims to be her contribution to the European budget is as to 45 per cent the European own resources contribution.  We must use every possible means to achieve again what was achieved in the sixties when we generated a sense of confidence, patriotism and respect for what we are.  Following what the then Taoiseach acknowledged to be an era of depression and despair &mdash; the vanishing Irish &mdash; the Fianna Fáil Government realised this achievement. Nothing less than a comprehensive plan as a signpost to the people will achieve it now.  Let us have an end to the inertia and analysis; let us get on with the job.</P>

      <P>I oppose this motion, a motion which pretends to show that in some way the Government ignore unemployment or are not taking positive action to deal with that problem.  The wording of the motion is not very clear on this point but I note the drift of Deputy O'Kennedy's remarks.</P>
      <P>It is nonsensical for anyone to come here and pretend that anyone on this side of the House ignores unemployment.  It is nonsensical to come here and without making any attempt to identify priorities to suggest that we need not do anything in order to make available the resources that are necessary for the constructive action that is necessary to deal with the problem of unemployment.  It is down-right misleading to suggest that in some way we have at our disposal the kind of resources that we need to do, in an unlimited way, some of what Deputy O'Kennedy was talking about.  I intend going into those areas in some detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government regard as a major policy priority the creation of sustainable employment.  I use the phrase deliberately because it is one that we should <Col N="2079" /> keep in mind constantly in relation to the matter of job creation, a term which in itself is misleading.  When we talk about making new jobs available &mdash; and I consider that a better phrase than the phrase &ldquo;job creation&rdquo;&mdash; we are talking of the risk business.  As is held generally, we need to find ways of making it possible to employ more people in productive activity, in the manufacture of goods and in the production of services that are traded on an increasing scale.  The way to go about that is to manufacture the goods or to produce the services more competitively than is the situation elsewhere. That is the bottom line.  Unless and until we do that we will not have the kind of success we would wish for in making headway against the level of unemployment we are now suffering.  I am not at all concerned that the proper priority is being attached by Deputy O'Kennedy and by his colleagues to what the implications of that are in terms of the selectivity of our actions or even in terms of the judgment of how we go about stimulating this kind of employment generation.</P>
    <P>There has been an easing in the unemployment trend since the Government took office.  Unemployment in that time has not accelerated at anything like as fast a rate as was the case in the previous two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If we can get the kind of response which the Government believe is required from the social partners, Government measures and plans already in operation or yet to be put into operation can make an effective contribution to reducing unemployment.  Such a response is needed, too, in this House in terms of the analysis and the judgments of the kinds of measures we need to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the numbers unemployed in the past four years reflects the impact of the international recession, of technological change and of a failure on our own part to maintain competitiveness. Few countries have been able to avoid a pronounced increase in unemployment <Col N="2080" /> in the face of depressed world demand following the second oil price shock.  This year there will be almost 34 million unemployed in the OECD area compared with 21 million in 1980.  Even in traditionally stronger economies such as Germany and the Netherlands which have enjoyed full employment for much of the post-war era, there has been a sharp increase in unemployment during the past four years.  Therefore, we are not isolated in the sense that unemployment here has increased during that time. This is the result in part of factors that have had a wider effect on countries that have been stronger than ours and which have had higher rates of overall employment.</P>
    <P>Unemployment here has been on a strong upward trend since the end of 1979.  Apart from a steep rise in job losses, particularly in manufacturing and in building and construction, the continued expansion of the labour force has added significantly to the numbers out of work.  In recent years our labour force has been increasing annually by some 21,000, a rate of increase which is almost twice the average for the European Community. We have the fastest expanding labour force of any of the EEC countries.</P>
    <P>At any time coping with a labour force growth of this size would have represented a formidable task; indeed, in a time of world recession it might have been considered impossible.  However, despite the downturn in international mobile investment associated with the recession, more than 70,000 gross new jobs were created in the manufacturing sector alone in the past four years.  If we had managed during that time to retain existing employment, we would have gone a long way towards absorbing the labour force increase.  The reality is that, despite attempts to ride out the effects of the international recession by recourse to foreign borrowing at an unsustainable rate, jobs were lost on a substantial scale. Depressed world demand undoubtedly caused many job losses but many others disappeared because of an overall decline in competitiveness.  As a result, we have ended up with the worst of both worlds &mdash; an unprecedented rate of unemployment, <Col N="2081" /> and foreign debt &mdash; now equivalent to more than half of total national output &mdash; the servicing of which is pre-empting an ever-increasing proportion of our domestic resources.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputy O'Kennedy to come here and to deprecate the concern which the Government show rightly with the cost of debt servicing in terms of our financial position.  The fact is that it is that very financial situation with which he accuses the Government of being too concerned that is tying up a large proportion of our resources.  This means that a substantial proportion of the resources we are making available each year is not available to us to deal with the problem of unemployment or with any of the other problems we would wish to deal with during the course of this year.</P>

      <P>In so far as I can discern what Deputy O'Kennedy was saying, he is advocating that we let the financial side rip and thereby produce a situation in which it would not be 36½ per cent of our tax revenue that would go towards debt servicing but in which we would reach the point rapidly where 40 or even 50 per cent of the tax revenue that we as a community make available would be pre-empted and would not be available to us to enable us to deal with the problems facing us.</P>

      <P>The Deputy never goes to the trouble of saying it, but he always <Col N="2082" /> draws that nice distinction between financing and employment which, if he really means it, shows that he has totally missed the point.  If we are to promote economic growth, investment and a satisfactory rate of increase in employment, it is vital that we restore order to the public finances and improve the competitive base of the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The inescapable truth is that the longer the imbalance in the public finances remains the greater will be the real loss of resources through debt servicing and consequently the more restricted will be the ability of the Government to respond to the needs of the economy.  That is not something I want to perpetuate.  That is not something the Government will perpetuate.  It does not accord with the real needs of those in our society who have not got jobs and those who will be on the labour market next year and in following years looking for jobs.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Government's corrective measures considerable progress was made in 1983 towards improving the economic environment: Exchequer reliance on foreign borrowing was reduced from over £1,300 million in 1981 to some £800 million last year; the balance of payments constraint was eased; there was a remarkable turnaround in manufacturing output; and there was a significant cut in the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most encouraging features of last year's economic performance was the major improvement in Ireland's external trading position.  The merchandise trade deficit for 1983 was less than a quarter of the 1981 deficit.  This reduction largely reflects the essential dynamism of the manufacturing sector.  Other notable features were the containment of imports, an improvement in the terms of trade and an upturn in agricultural <Col N="2084" /> exports.  The most striking feature of the trade performance was the buoyancy of industrial exports.  Compared with a volume increase of almost 11 per cent in 1982, industrial exports accelerated to over 14 per cent last year.  This was a very creditable performance in the face of very difficult trading conditions prevailing on world markets.</P>
    <P>As I said before, in itself it is a remarkable tribute to what Irish industry can achieve when it sets its mind to trading and expanding its activities even in the face of the very difficult market conditions of last year.  We are now in a position where our exports of goods and services almost pay for our corresponding imports.  Another strong export performance is anticipated this year which should yield a further improvement in our external position.  While there may be certain revisions to the external accounts, they are unlikely to alter the dramatic improvement in the trend evident over the recent period.</P>
    <P>Associated with last year's remarkable export performance was a turnaround in manufacturing output.  Output data for December 1983 published earlier today by the Central Statistics Office confirm that the recovery in manufacturing output is now proceeding apace.  In December industrial output rose year-on-year by 20 per cent in real terms.  This result, which exceeded even the most optimistic expectations &mdash; even my own expectations earlier during the course of last year with which Deputy O'Kennedy chose to disagree &mdash; brought the growth in output for 1983 as a whole to over 7 per cent, compared with a 1 per cent fall in 1982. While the high technology, chemicals and electronics sectors again led the way, the more established sectors performed very well with, for example, the food sector recording a volume growth of over 3 per cent.  There is every indication that output prospects for many of the traditional sectors are improving.  Given the relatively high employment content of these sectors, this is a very encouraging development.</P>
    <P>A further notable feature of last year's economic performance was the fact that we secured a further cut in inflation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2085" /> Compared with an average inflation rate of over 20 per cent in 1981, inflation last year averaged 10½ per cent.  Discounting the effects of the unavoidable tax increases imposed last year, the underlying rate of inflation was well into single figures.  We are now at a stage where we can envisage our price rises coming down much closer to those prevailing in the economies of our main trading partners. That has major significance for employment prospects.</P>
    <P>The economic improvements achieved to date will have a favourable impact on the trend in job losses and employment during the course of the year as the world economic recovery gathers momentum. To gain maximum advantage from the economic recovery, goods and services must be made more competitive and investment realised in additional productive capacity.  This requires the co-operation of both employers and workers, and the Government have laid before the social partners a paper seeking consensus on how maximum advantage can be gained from the recovery.  In this paper, the Government set out the requirements necessary to stem the high number of redundancies and to increase the number of jobs available.  The paper provides an analysis of these requirements and reflects a responsible and constructive approach by the Government to what they recognise as a major jobs crisis.  A correspondingly responsible and constructive response is expected from the social partners.</P>
    <P>The major points made by the paper are: the key to a lasting solution to our employment problem lies in ensuring the restoration and maintenance of competitiveness in the production of traded goods and services; the prospects for the immediate future are dominated by considerations of preventing further job losses and creating the competitiveness required to secure a recovery in employment; developments in pay are crucial to improving competitiveness and reducing inflation.  By keeping unit costs down, pay moderation would allow struggling firms to maintain employment, to continue <Col N="2086" /> producing and selling their output at a price which covers costs.  Similarly, existing firms would be enabled to seize the opportunity provided by the expected growth in demand to expand output to meet this demand.  A realistic level of pay here would also help the efforts of the IDA to attract new foreign industries to Ireland and would discourage the search for labour-saving capital equipment which has jeopardised many Irish jobs; the objective for 1984 and subsequent years must be to ensure that the evolution of earnings in Irish industry is such that no further deterioration occurs in the competitiveness of Irish labour, and subsequently of Irish products; the rate of inflation has already declined significantly in the past three years and is expected to decline further this year.  If there were no further wage increases in 1984 inflation in the year to February 1985 could be below 5 per cent.  This in itself would create an exceptionally favourable environment for wage moderation and, above all, for employment expansion; pay, however, is by no means the only or even the most important aspect of the overall employment situation. The dynamism of management and its capacity to generate a healthy management employee relationship, technical and innovative capacity in production, high quality of design and skilful marketing and containment of non-pay costs are just as important.  To the extent that this is possible, the Government are taking steps to secure improved management performance in Irish firms.  The series of sectoral studies which the Government have undertaken with employer bodies and trade unions are identifying specific policy measures in this area.  The forthcoming White Paper on Industrial Policy will set out Government measures aimed at pursuing and supporting better management performance. These measures will be guided by the principle that State financial assistance for industrial development would be payable only where firms have adopted adequate business development plans and where the overall management capacity of a firm is judged to be competent and progressive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2087" /> The Government have embarked on discussions with the social partners aimed at achieving a consensus on these requirements as far as is practicable.  In their statement on 5 March 1984 the Government requested employers and unions, in the face of growing unemployment, to refrain from making 24th round pay settlements until the present talks have established whether a consensus can be reached on the best course to adopt that will reflect the commitment of all concerned to protect existing jobs and provide new jobs.  That, I submit, in the immediate sense is an extremely constructive and active approach by the Government to the problem of unemployment facing us today.</P>
    <P>The Government are not content merely to concentrate on getting the appropriate macro-economic conditions for an improvement in the labour market. In addition to that they are striving to promote measures to combat unemployment. It is expected that this year in the region of 11,000-12,000 new manufacturing jobs will be created in IDA assisted projects.  The IDA are facing intensified competition for internationally mobile industrial investment: more countries are entering the market and offering more attractive incentive packages.  In order to meet this increased competition the IDA have stepped up their overseas marketing activity.  New overseas offices have been opened in Hong Kong, Germany and the United States.  There has been an upturn in the level of interest shown by companies, particularly from the US and the Far East, in locating new investment projects in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In looking at measures to improve employment prospects we should not lose sight of the fact that Irish firms, mainly small firms, contributed half of the new jobs created in 1983.  Indeed, investment activity in this area is expected to show an increase this year.  The Government recognise the central role small businesses play in job creation.</P>

      <P>When we see the Finance Bill I wonder how active the Deputy will be.  Through the Task Force on Unemployment the Government have taken a number of initiatives designed to alleviate the unemployment problem.  An enterprise allowance scheme has been introduced to encourage unemployed <Col N="2089" /> people to undertake entrepreneurial activities.  A scheme of voluntary work-sharing has been introduced.  A scheme permitting the taking of unpaid leave within the Civil Service has been approved and vacancies arising under this scheme will be exempted from the present conditions of restrictive replacement of vacancies arising from the embargo. This is something which will be especially beneficial to labour market entrants.  The Government have also introduced and extended tax incentives designed to encourage profit-sharing by individual firms.</P>
      <P>The level of activity organised under the aegis of the Youth Employment Agency has reached the point where this year some 50,000 young people will benefit for periods averaging somewhat less than six months from training and work experience programmes.  Such is the scale of overall activity designed to assist young people that Ireland is now nearer to being in a position to adopt the EEC Social Guarantee for young people than any other member state of the Community, despite the fact that total resources per head in Ireland are much lower than in any other member state except Greece.</P>
      <P>In response to the international economic upturn, there are signs of improvement in the labour markets of many countries. Unemployment has already fallen sharply in the United States and has broadly stabilised in the European Community. Although still rising in Ireland, the rate of increase in unemployment has slackened considerably.</P>

It should be about giving priority to employment, particularly to our young people, over the acquisition by ourselves <Col N="2092" /> individually and as a community of extra services being made available.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My greatest problem in contributing to the debate is that obviously the Minister and I live in different worlds.  In fact, the Minister and the majority of ordinary people live in different worlds.  When a Minister for Finance is not aware of the major problems facing the country, then we need a change of Government urgently.  I will quote from the Minister's speech in support of what I am saying.  In the third line of his speech he stated: &ldquo;There has been an easing in the unemployment trend since the Government took office&rdquo;.  I take it he is saying that the percentage of growth in the unemployment figures has been dropping but he is taking a percentage of a bigger figure.  The Government are falling down-hill and that is the danger facing the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not hear one new idea from the Minister for Finance.  He is the person saddled with the responsibility of directing our economy but he had nothing new to offer.  Instead we had a recital of what he regarded as successful progress in the past 15 months.  Where can the ordinary people see that progress?  Where can those people in the Labour Party &mdash; whose benches are empty tonight &mdash; see that progress?  They are absent because they were ashamed to sit behind the Minister <Col N="2093" /> and hear what he had to say in this House tonight.</P>
    <P>This righteous Minister has lectured us for a long time on what should and must be done.  He was regarded as Garret's favourite son, as Garret's answer to solve all our problems.  He was thrown into press conferences and public debates on many occasions in the euphoric, halcyon days of the latter part of 1982 when a Government had been brought down by whatever devious means &mdash; and I am sure we will be hearing more about that &mdash; and he presided over a joint programme drawn up by Fine Gael and Labour.  I will quote from the second paragraph of that joint programme under the heading &ldquo;Planning for Economic Recovery&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Permanent structures will be established by the Government to ensure effective economic and social planning. (1) The new Government will set up an employment task force of three economic Ministers led by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste through which the two parties in Government will share responsibility for initiating the immediate employment-generating process. </P>
    <P>That was 18 months ago.  Tonight it would be hard to find three Government Ministers in the country &mdash; one would have to go to Australia and the western shores of the United States to contact them. That is the kind of immediate urgency this Government are applying to solve the unemployment problem.  This is the kind of bluff we had from the Minister tonight when he tried, line after line in his speech, to say he was offering something new.  The only worthwhile reference in his speech was with regard to improved industrial exports.  It may be asked where these exports are emanating from: the answer is, they are coming from the new industries attracted here by Fianna Fáil Governments and Fianna Fáil Ministers and the various agencies working under those Governments.  That is why there has been an improvement with regard to exports.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the provision of 10,000 or 11,000 new jobs by the IDA this year.  I ask him to have open <Col N="2094" /> debate and discussion with the IDA on that figure.  I was of the opinion that in this Minister we had an upright, righteous person who was not really a politician at all.  I thought he had come through the bureaucratic system, and was a different animal to all of us over here and to people over there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This Minister was going to be very different.  He would not use slightly inaccurate comments in his contributions in this House.  Yet, in his speech he stated:</P>
      <P>The level of activity organised under the aegis of the Youth Employment Agency has reached the point where this year some 50,000 young people will benefit for periods averaging somewhat less than six months from training and work experience programmes. Such is the scale of overall activity designed to assist young people that Ireland is now nearer to being in a position to adopt the EEC social guarantee for young people than any other member state of the Community. </P>
      <P>The Minister is not bluffing this side of the House, although he may try to bluff some people.  I welcome what will be done for these young people but this 50,000 figure is not a magic figure pulled out of the hat by the Youth Employment Agency.  What is being done is the product of the work of AnCO for many years in building up their resources and expertise. It is due to the work of CERT and of the Youth Employment Agency and some of their schemes.  The Minister is trying to mislead the House that what is being proposed now is something new and different.  The Minister's provocation in the early part of his speech was designed to attract interruptions from this side of the House because his case was so weak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great difficulty I face tonight is to try to convince the Minister and the Government that something needs to be done urgently.  The Minister told us that there has been an easing of the unemployment trend since the Government <Col N="2095" /> took office.  Let me put on record something about that trend, in case the Minister does not know.  The overall unemployment figure is now something more than 216,000.  The figure was 170,000 when the Government first took office, when they referred to it as being disastrous. We are a little more than two months from the June examinations, after which a net 30,000 more will come on the employment market looking for jobs.  Facing that, the trend in February has been frightening.</P>
    <P>I will take the cities and their hinterlands first and show the unemployment increase in the last year.  At the end of February 1983 Dublin city had 50,437 unemployed, but by the end of last February the figure was 61,183, an increase of more than 20 per cent.  That does not show much of an easing in the unemployment trend.  In February 1983, Cork city had 10,100 people unemployed but by the end of last February the figure had risen to 12,782, an increase of more than 25 per cent.  The figures for the city and county of Cork in the same period are 17,844 increasing to 22,181 in February last, a worsening of the unemployment trend by 25 per cent.  How can we reconcile these figures with the statement that there has been an improving trend in the unemployment figures? How can we call this good Government if a Minister is prepared to come in here and say there has been an easing in the trend?  I have figures for Limerick, Waterford and Galway which are equally bad.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at the Cork region. Dunlop's have closed and we are threatened with the loss of Ford.  There is a threat over Youghal Carpets, we have lost Metal Products.  Avair have been closed with consequential job losses that will be disastrous to Cork Airport activities and for the industrial and tourist life of the Cork region.  No efforts have been made to date to restore that service or to provide an alternative.  That airline provided an excellent service for Cork and it represented more than 9 per cent of the total through-put of passengers at Cork Airport, somewhere in the region of 25,000, and about 30 per cent of the total <Col N="2096" /> tourist traffic through Cork Airport. There is worse news tonight.  I understand that ICL informed the Minister for Communications today &mdash; of course the Minister is about to depart for some continental capital; Paris I think &mdash; that they are not interested in running the Cork to Swansea ferry next summer.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy put many points to the Minister tonight but the Minister and his colleagues seem to decry everything said on this side &mdash; they do not want to hear it because they are too interested in defending their indefensible position. That ferry service, which we had hoped would continue to operate at least during the summer, is so important that I call on the Minister to call on his colleagues before the night has passed in an effort to restore that link.  That link is not confined to helping the Cork region.  It extends to the entire Munster region, particularly the south west, covering Cork and Kerry.  The employment in the tourism industry in that region, to which Deputy O'Kennedy referred as being really developed, is 2,000 people.  It has been allowed to run down and hence the danger of the link with Wales being broken. There have been tensions between B and I and ICL.  We cannot be blamed for that, but a cartel of people were genuinely interested, including Cork Harbour Commissioners, ICL, Cork County Council, Cork Corporation and involvement by the Swansea Harbour Authority. All those people were prepared to come together provided the Government gave some sort of guarantee.  That guarantee was not forthcoming.  As I have siad, 2,000 people were involved directly with many others indirectly involved.</P>
    <P>This adds to the dreadful unemployment position in that region.  It means the Government have no commitment to solving unemployment.  The Minister knows that the greater the downturn in activity the less income the State will earn and therefore the greater the cost to the State.</P>
    <P>I live in a city and the Minister is probably a bit luckier living in a county town where the impact of unemployment may not be so severe.  Where I live unemployment is worsening daily, confidence is <Col N="2097" /> sinking, young people are seriously concerned about their future, the crime rate is increasing.  We talk about youth employment.  Adult employment today is equally serious.  How many of us in our weekly clinics meet fathers of families whose stamps have run out, who no longer can receive pay-related or unemployment benefit, who are back to unemployment assistance of £28.50 for a single man or a married man with a wife and two children on £65.15 per week.  That is what we are faced with this year and no effort being made by the Government except to tell us that they are meeting the social partners, that they are looking for a concensus.  This is a way to postpone what they told us would be immediate action a year and a half ago.  That immediate action has been slowed considerably and unemployment has continued to grow.  Hence the empty Labour benches and the embarrassment and disappointment of the Labour Party with the performance of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this problem here.  It is appropriate that we have a discussion on it now because I understand that it was announced on the news today that the pig farmers propose to take certain action tomorrow to highlight their plight.  Before they are driven to that it is appropriate that we in this House take note of the difficulties facing the industry and the possible results not only for those engaged in it but also on the economy of their failure to achieve success in having their situation improved.</P>
      <P>We are not here to talk about an industry that has been subsidised heavily in the past, that has been carried on or nursed by anybody except those engaged in it. We are not talking about a second-rate industry that has already consumed taxpayers' money.  Somebody told me recently that a report carried out on behalf of the European Commission stated that the Irish pig farming industry was the most efficient in Europe.  I understand that <i>Pig International</i> stated recently that the Irish pig industry was among the most efficient to be found in any part of the world.  Therefore we need not apologise to anybody for standing up at a time of crisis in the industry and asking the Government, the State and everybody concerned to take note of that serious crisis and to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One problem of immediate concern to the industry is the number of pigs being imported from Northern Ireland weekly. This importation is quite legal.  The pigs are being imported into the South, with the assistance of an MCA payment, in numbers something like 10,000 per week. The pig industry takes responsibility within itself for its own surpluses and the <Col N="2099" /> cost of exporting pigs is collected from every producer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the crubeens? We are exporting truck loads of crubeens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an interesting question and I am waiting to hear more about it.  It is not the first time that such cases have come to light.  I am amazed that, it having been mentioned publicly, we seem never to hear any more about it.  I would like to get more information on that.</P>
      <P>The cost to Irish pig producers to get those pigs out of the country is something like £3 per animal and the cost of every pig exported dead may be about £10.  If we had only our own surpluses to export, then that cost would be reduced to something like £1 instead of £3.  That would not bridge the gap between breaking even and losing, but at least it would be an improvement on the present situation. Those involved in the industry have an obligation to consider the present plight of the producers and voluntarily to make a decision to cease importing pigs while the market is in its present condition.  It would serve nobody's purpose in the long run if we pursue policies within any sector which are to the detriment of another sector and will eventually create a disaster for the entire industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been debating jobs here. Consider the number of pigs produced and the size of the breeding herds.  It has been stated that something like 1,000 farmers are involved in the industry and the number of labour units involved is something around 2,000 which is a considerable number of full-time very productive labour units.  It is fair to say that we could expect that at least four other jobs would depend on every job in the various industries connected with the pig industry, in milling, processing, maintenance and other sectors, and the number might well be higher.  We are talking about probably 6,000 or 7,000 jobs and about an industry which cannot survive for very long.  Years ago we had the notorious pig cycles when prices <Col N="2100" /> dropped, profits became small and herds were reduced fairly rapidly.</P>
    <P>Farmers in those years were less professional that they are today.  We had a large number of part-time farmers to whom the production of pigs was of marginal importance and they got rid of their herd quickly in times of crisis.  Those involved today are far more professional, as they must be if they are running an industry which competes with the best in the world, and is recognised as doing so. They have made their investment and must stick with it.  Very few people involved in the industry today can opt to get out at short notice.  They must either stay or go entirely bankrupt.  Most of them have modern houses, equipment and facilities.  Most of them have borrowed heavily and to break the line of production at this stage would mean probably absolute disaster for themselves and their families.  Therefore, everybody is holding on even if everybody is losing money.  If at some stage the industry breaks under the pressure, which must occur before very long, it is not the more inefficient people who will go to the wall. People will go depending on what stage they came in, on their interest rates and the repayments they have put behind them.  A very large proportion of the people involved in that industry have heavy repayments and if the present situation goes on much longer they will not survive.  As I pointed out in another parliament some weeks ago, if that happens we can be asssured that the people who will pay to rebuild a similar industry in Ireland will be the consumers.  Regardless of how we look at it, the demand for pork products will be there and will be filled from abroad or from the home market. If we have a total disaster in the industry then eventually the consumer, through higher prices, will create an environment in which that industry can return and investment in it be encouraged again.  The importation of pigs from Northern Ireland is part of the problem. We have also the importation of pork and bacon which probably is not nearly so detrimental, perhaps about 20 per cent of what comes in as live animals.  This is borne out by the fact that in recent years <Col N="2101" /> the breeding herd in Northern Ireland has increased.</P>

      <P>In volume, pig numbers. It is estimated that slaughterings in Southern Ireland increased by 13 per cent and our breeding herd decreased by perhaps something like 1.8 per cent.  On the other hand, slaughterings in Northern Ireland increased by 18 per cent.  That clearly indicates that they have been producing the breeding herd and we have been accepting their pigs.  In addition, our producers have been subsidising the export of these animals to other markets. The industry would be patient with and would tolerate being forced to subsidise or assist export of their own surplus, but one should not expect beleaguered farmers to export the surpluses of another State.</P>
      <P>This year higher prices of feedstuffs is an important element in the cost of producing animals.  The European Community policy is to have intervention prices for cereals and to maintain those prices which are considerably higher than world prices, at the same time not expending any protection to the pig industry which is thereby adversely affected.  This also affects the poultry industry.  The part of the country from which the Minister and I come suffers as a result because we have to import feedstuffs which are more expensive than they would otherwise be because of that Community policy, without protection for the poultry and pig industry.  This anomaly will have to be rectified.</P>
      <P>Our Minister and those of us who represent Ireland in the European Parliament should keep this matter under consideration and seek a suitable policy to assist the pig and poultry industries and the areas which do not grow grain, to correct this imbalance.</P>

If our costs were as low as those in Northern Ireland, we would have that extra £1 advantage.  Furthermore, the dairy industry could go some way to help.

      <P>I am trying to identify a number of areas in which pig farmers can be helped.  One is through better co-operation from the dairy industry, another by reducing charges at bacon factory level, another concerns the problems of pollution in areas where farmers have built up large herds and where it is quite obvious that pressure is being put on them &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; to restrict effluent from getting into waterways and fishery areas.  These measures are important, but if the consumer and the public want the co-operation of the agriculture industry in preventing pollution, farmers must be given the assistance that manufacturing industries have been getting through the years &mdash; grants of 50 to 60 per cent at times &mdash; for methods of preventing <Col N="2104" /> pollution.  Pig farmers, who have a particular problem at present and are finding it difficult to make the sort of investment required to improve our waterways and fisheries, need this assistance and should get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to sit down with all the interests involved.  I cannot &mdash; as some of the Deputies opposite, I have no doubt, would &mdash; propose an instant solution to the problem which will not impose charges on the taxpayer and create problems in other areas.  If we propose a fully fledged intervention system, this industry is such that there would be overproduction for evermore and Governments would be buying pig meat and storing it until we encountered the same problems as with dairy surpluses.  I would not propose that as a solution. However, in the interim we should act, for our own sake. The French Government have made interest-free money available on an informal basis to those involved in this industry in France.  I have no doubt but that under the table assistance will be given to the British industry. This has always been the case.  The Minister should combine with the dairy industry, the pig farmers and those in the processing and exporting end to work out some solution to this crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This industry has been very self-sufficient, self-financing itself with very expensive money.  It has made itself the most efficient in the world, employing something like 6,000 people, earning at least £60 million in exports and producing £150 million of wealth here.  This is an important industry and before it is too late everybody concerned should calmly discuss all the options open and the banks and lending institutions should take part as well.  They say that they would treat such people with sympathy, but sympathy will not resolve the problem.  They will have to put on the table what they propose as their contribution to an industry which has given them good business and plenty of profits over the years.  The <Col N="2105" /> banking institutions will have to make their contribution, like everybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Outlined by Deputy McCartin.  A number of factors to which I would like to refer briefly has caused this situation to develop.  Like all other areas of farming, this industry has its ups and downs.  However, some of the aspects of the pig industry produce difficulties and the Deputy referred to the famous cycle over the years.  That is one of the reasons, but not the most obvious at present.  We had a huge increase in the cost of pig compound feedstuffs, something that has not happened here for a number of years.  There has been an increase in the cost of feedstuffs generally, but this one has had a greater effect on profitability in the pig business.  We had a massive 20 per cent increase last springtime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This was because the United States and Europe had a very bad harvest, with low yields, compounded by high transport costs because <Col N="2106" /> of the great distances involved.  This increase was very difficult to take on board.  It is something we have to live with.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other side of the coin, as if that was not enough trouble for our pig producers, the consumer demand, particularly in the UK, remains stagnant.  This is due to the recession. For a strange reason, in the UK in 1983 we had great competition for bacon and pork, as far as the housewife is concerned, with the cost of lamb.  This obviously had a great bearing because producers were being hit by a 20 per cent increase in foodstuff prices and their product was losing ground in a very important market.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer the House to the great changes that can come in the pig industry in a very short time.  Most pig producers admit that 1982 was quite a good year for them because the factors I talked about worked in their favour. Within a few short months they found themselves in a deficit position.  There is one other very important factor, and it is important that we remember this at all times.  The EEC was 102 per cent self-sufficient in pigmeat last year.  That is a fairly major change from what we were used to.  As every pig producer knows to his cost, the minute you have an oversupply on the market, irrespective of where it is, you have problems.</P>

      <P>It is a well-known fact in marketing circles that one lorry load too many, no matter how many lorry loads are required on the market, creates a surplus.  This is obviously what is happening. It appears from the best information I have that self-sufficiency will not be any greater in 1984.  We have to be thankful for small mercies.  As the House is no doubt aware, about 25 per cent of our total production has to be exported. The home market takes 75 per cent. During last year Denmark had the misfortune <Col N="2107" /> to have foot and mouth disease. Because of that we got a very useful foothold in the Japanese market.  I understand that we exported about 10,000 tonnes of pork to Japan last year.</P>

If it was not for that and for the misfortune in Denmark we would be a lot worse off.</P>
      <P>We have got a very good name in the Japanese market and we should be able to get more pork into that market in the future.  We have another great problem, as Deputy McCartin pointed out, of pig imports from Northern Ireland.  It amounts, because of the MCAs and the way they work, to a subsidy of about £5 per pig.  The kernel of the matter is that many of the live pigs imported are Irish and they are doing a U-turn.  It has been estimated that the figure is as high as 60 per cent.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartin referred to intervention. We have a type of intervention which has worked reasonably well.  It is not an EEC-aided intervention but a private storage aid whereby factories are paid a subsidy by the EEC to help to get over the glut period.  There is about 1,000 tonnes of pigmeat in this category at the moment.  If private storage aid was not available this year we would have many problems.</P>

The lessons to be learned in the EEC in five or six years show that this is not the best marketing strategy.  I believe that if we can arrive at a situation through negotiation we can dismantle the MCAs and, even if we get a 50 per cent reduction and because it appears that the feeding situation in relation to cost is beginning to right itself, at the end of this year there will be reasonable hope for our pig producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to what Deputy McCartin said about the importance of the pig industry.  It is very important because of the number employed in it not to allow a situation to develop where many people would have to ease themselves <Col N="2109" /> out of this production.  It takes a lot of very expensive capital to get back into the business.  We hope as a result of the negotiations taking place that there will be a reasonably bright future during this year.

The employment is pensionable, remuneration is on a weekly basis &mdash; present rate £106.61 per week &mdash; and normal attendance is 30 hours per week.</P>
      <P>Cleaners are also employed directly as civilian employees under the authority of the Defence Act, 1954 for full-time and part-time work in certain military locations.

Part-time cleaners are remunerated at the rate of £2.79 per hour and attendance varies between six and 18 hours per week.</P>

      <Col N="1948" /> This is £13 million below the comparable figure in the Table headed &ldquo;Summary of Non-Capital Estimates&rdquo; page viii of the 1983 Revised Estimates Volume.  No separate figure for non-capital supply services expenditure was published in July 1983.</P>
    <P>The published current budget deficit for 1983 is based on Exchequer issues to the end of the year for the non-capital Supply Services, rather than on Departmental expenditure, and does not therefore, fall to be revised.</P>
    <P>Departmental balances arise where total Exchequer issues to Departments in any given year exceed their actual expenditure in that year.  These balances are then taken into account in the following year's budgetary arithmetic.  For instance the 1984 Budget took account of an estimated £25 million Departmental balances carried forward from 1983; the actual balances, which will not be known until audited accounts are published, will be deducted from Exchequer issues in 1984.</P>

Arrears of unemployment assistance from 23 December 1983 will be paid to her when the amount of supplementary welfare allowance paid by the health board is determined.</P>

      <P>The conditions for receipt of retirement pension require him to have entered into insurance before he reached age 55 and to have contributions paid in respect of at least 156 weeks of insurable employment since his entry into insurance.

      <P>Following the completion of extensive inquiries, the person concerned was assessed with means at £50.75 weekly derived from the profit from land and from capital with effect from 6 September 1983 on which date he last claimed unemployment assistance.  He is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at £4.80 weekly, being the maximum rate payable to him £55.55 less £50.75, and arrangements have been made to pay all arrears due this week.  Further weekly payments will follow as they become due. If he is dissatisfied with the amount of means assessed against him it is open to him to appeal and to have his means determined by an appeals officer.  A form for this purpose may be obtained at his local office.</P>

    <P>The Department of Agriculture employ permanent veterinary and lay staff to carry out meat inspection duties. The total number of permanent staff so employed in all meat export plants amounts to 226.  This staff is supplemented by a core of temporary veterinary inspectors who are drawn from a panel of up to 600 authorised veterinary practitioners and engaged on a daily fee paid basis as and when required.  The number employed on this basis may vary, daily or seasonally, having regard to the level of slaughterings in individual plants.  Moreover, some plants deal not only with cattle but also with sheep and pigs.  The level or rate of inspection varies from plant to <Col N="1991" /> plant having regard to the facilities available and the speed with which the slaughter line may be operated.  For the foregoing reasons it would be almost impossible to give a realistic national ratio of cattle slaughtered to staff employed for inspection purposes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the reason for the delay in payment of six weeks' wages in October-November 1983 to a person (details supplied) in County Dublin who is a prison officer; if he will arrange for payment to be made to him now having regard to the fact that any delay of a few days on his part in furnishing the necessary medical certificates was due to matters beyond his control and that it would be inequitable to deprive this officer of his entire wages for the relevant period.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): During the course of his sick absence in October-November 1983 the prison officer concerned was in breach of the sick leave regulations on several occasions by gross neglect of the requirement to get word to the institution or to send in the medical certificates within the specified periods.  He had been warned on a number of occasions about his repeated failure to send in certificates on time.  The officer was informed in December 1983 that he was forfeiting pay for the periods concerned in October and November 1983.  The officer has since been in further breach of the regulations in respect of an absence in February-March 1984.  Since the officer joined the service in July 1981 he has been absent from duty on sick leave on 128 days.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): My Department employs cleaning staff in the general Civil Service <Col N="2002" /> grade of cleaner.  This grade is conditioned to a five day week and has sick leave, annual leave and superannuation conditions similar to those of other unestablished officers.  Cleaners normally work 30 hours but may be required to work up to 42 hours per week.  Their rate of pay is £106.61 per week.</P>
      <P>In addition, some offices are cleaned by outside contractors who employ their own cleaning staff.  Information is not available about the specific current conditions and rates of pay of these personnel but normal procedures in my Department provide that, on the placing or renewal of each cleaning contract, checks must be carried out to ensure that the only firms to be considered for the contracts are those which apply minimum trade union conditions and rates of pay to their employees.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Sixty-seven full-time and 28 part-time traffic wardens were employed in Dublin city on 31 December 1982.  The numbers on 31 December 1983 were 83 full-time and 25 part-time wardens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expenditure in 1983 on pay, allowances and equipment of traffic wardens in Dublin was approximately £665,000. On the basis that the other ancillary related services mentioned in the question refer to the services provided in connection with the processing of fines-on-the-spot notices in the Central Fines-on-the-Spot Office at Coleraine House, Dublin 7, the expenditure in 1983 on the pay and allowances of staff concerned was approximately £423,000.  This figure does not, however, include any sum in respect of pension liability or overhead costs; neither does it include the cost of related services such as services provided <Col N="2003" /> by the motor taxation offices in the processing of fines-on-the-spot notices, or the cost of the service of summons or court time involved.  These costs are not readily available.</P>
    <P>The total amount of fines-on-the-spot paid in Dublin in 1983 was £1,179,000. The total amount of fines imposed by the courts throughout the country under the Road Traffic Acts which was lodged in 1983 to the Motor Tax Account of the Department of the Environment was £2,757,000.  Records are not kept in such a way as to isolate the amount included in this figure which related to court fines for parking offences in Dublin.</P>

As was stated then, the problem admits of no easy solution.
