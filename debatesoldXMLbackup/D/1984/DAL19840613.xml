      <Col N="846" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 29:</P>
    <P>In page 8, before section 12, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;12.  &mdash;Section 29 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, is amended by the addition of the following sub-paragraph (g) to subsection (1) of the said section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(g)  an offence under section 15, of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, and an offence of conspiring or attempting to commit any such offence under the said Act&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Woods.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that those involved in the trafficking, dealing and selling of drugs will have to go to the High Court to get bail.  We want to ensure that bail will not be got too easily.  We want section 29 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, amended to include an offence under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  Section 29 of the 1967 Act deals with bail in the case of treason, murder and certain other very serious offences. My argument is that the trafficking, dealing and selling of drugs is a very serious offence and, likewise, should be treated in a way similar to the offences I have outlined.  The Minister has said that the definition in section 15 of the 1977 Act is too broad.  He appeared to accept the spirit of my amendment but he said it was the type of definition he would propose. Section 15 of the 1977 Act states:</P>
      <P>Any person who has in his possession, whether lawfully or not, a controlled drug for the purpose of selling or otherwise supplying it to another in contravention of regulations under section 5 of this Act, shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to section 29 (3) of this Act, <Col N="847" /> in any proceedings for an offence under subsection (1) of this section, where it is proved that a person was in possession of a controlled drug and the court, having regard to the quantity of the controlled drug which the person possessed or to such other matter as the court considers relevant, is satisfied that it is reasonable to assume that the controlled drug was not intended for the immediate personal use of the person, he shall be presumed, until the court is satisfied to the contrary, to have been in possession of the controlled drug for the purpose of selling or otherwise supplying it to another in contravention of regulations under section 5 of this Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the subsection I have quoted is the appropriate one to deal with the problem I have raised.  He maintains that it includes the supply from one person to another of cannabis, heroin or other drugs.  My intention is to get at those involved in trafficking and dealing in a better way.  It may be difficult to differentiate between these two and it may be a matter for the court to decide. In any event we are only concerned about the High Court having the function reserved to it over a lower court of granting an application for bail.  We are trying to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the facts of the case.  The Minister disagreed with the use of the definition but undertook to have another look at the matter.  He felt it was too wide for reference to the High Court of an application for bail.  However, if we look at the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1984, which was introduced this morning and will be dealt with next week, we find that the Minister for Health hopes to introduce life imprisonment for offences under section 15 of the 1977 Act.  How is it that the Minister for Justice regards section 15 of the 1977 Act as too loose and wide a category to insist that bail applications be considered by the High Court?  There appears to be a conflict between the two Ministers.</P>
    <P>I would be open to a definition which would specify more clearly the people we are trying to get at but that may not be <Col N="848" /> feasible and it may be the reason why the Government, through the Minister for Health, have decided to use section 15 of the 1977 Act to impose a life sentence.  I hope the Minister will give his views on what appears to be a contradiction in the approach of the Government to these matters.  It appears that the Government consider section 15 of the 1977 Act adequate to deal with the matter and if that is the case it must be adequate to be used as a definition in referring cases to the High Court before bail is granted.  I feel strongly about this.  People known to be substantial traffickers and dealers in drugs have been granted bail and we do not want that to happen if it can be avoided.  The supply of drugs such as heroin is such a serious offence that a measure is needed to help clear up some of the problems that have been arising in practice in dealing with people involved in that crime.  The Government's approach to it in the new Misuse of Drugs Bill is that it is a very serious offence and life imprisonment is suggested for those involved in the supply, sale and possession of such drugs.  I would classify those offences as being in the same category as murder, treason and other serious offences. Our proposal is reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> As I said yesterday there is some merit in the Deputy's proposal. It was thought proper in the past that certain very serious offences should be referred to the High Court before bail was granted.  Yesterday I expressed the view that there might be a difficulty in the definition in that we would be aiming at a very wide target if everything which could be construed as drug pushing was referred to the High Court.  There is no conflict between myself and the Minister for Health.  The question about bail is that a person is innocent until proved quilty.  Most people who are brought before our courts get bail.  The Deputy's argument proceeds on the basis that if a person is accused of drug-pushing they will automatically be found guilty subsequently. I do not think we can proceed on that basis.  I am willing to look at this. There is the basis of a good idea in the <Col N="849" /> Deputy's amendment but now that the Misuse of Drugs Bill has been published I believe the amendment would be far more appropriate to it than to this Bill. We do not have sections of the Criminal Justice Bill dealing with drugs offences because it was intended that these would be dealt with in the amendments being proposed to the Misuse of Drugs Act. The Minister for Health has now published that Bill, and I think an amendment such as this would be more appropriate in that legislation, which is ordered for next Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that there is no conflict between himself and the Minister for Health in this respect, but there is a basic conflict.  I am not talking about the presumption of innocence of an individual.  That is there all the time until the person is found guilty. It is a question of who gives bail in the first instance.  I do not want to be put in a position where I am in advance presuming people to be guilty.  I am not doing that.  We had discussions here in relation to who makes the decisions and the kind of criteria they use in taking these decisions in relation to bail.  Where so many options are open to the court in making such a decision, we feel that the High Court should be the forum which makes such a serious decision in all cases related to section 15.  This is where the conflict comes in between the approach of the Minister for Health and the response of the Minister for Justice here.  The use of section 15 as a definition of such supply and sale of drugs was questioned here yesterday evening by the Minister for Justice, and he agrees with that.  He has reservations about it.  I accept that there is a question mark in relation to very small quantities passed between individuals and that that could be construed under section 15 as supplying even if not selling.  The problem would appear to be that once you depart from that it may be difficult to define it otherwise.  It would appear that in the Misuse of Drugs Act section 15 is considered adequate for such a serious sentence as life imprisonment, and I mean the whole of section 15.  It is not cut down or a part taken or the most <Col N="850" /> serious elements taken out.  If the whole of the section is considered adequate for that purpose then surely it would be an adequate definition for the purpose for which we are proposing it here.  If the Minister can produce an improved definition which isolates the major traffickers and dealers, that would be all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> My position is being misunderstood.  I do not see anything wrong with section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.  Somebody is charged with pushing and the courts can decide on the merits of the case what the appropriate sentence is or whether a custodial sentence should be imposed at all. On the question of bail a different question arises and very serious offences are referred to the High Court.  That is not the same as having any objection to the definitions under section 15.  There is merit in what the Deputy is saying.  I will have the matter examined.  I will talk again to the Attorney General about it to see if we can incorporate an amendment such as this in the Bill.  However, now that the Misuse of Drugs Bill has been published, this amendment which he is proposing to the Criminal Justice Bill might be more appropriately set down to the Misuse of Drugs Bill next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We will end up with a number of these.  The amendment we are talking about refers to section 12 and there is the question now of referring that section to somewhere else where it will come up for discussion later, and of referring this amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Bill.  That is another possible alternative, but it deals with the case of bail. We are talking about cases of bail and this as an extension or modification of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967 which deals with bail.  In that sense it is quite reasonable to include it in this Bill as an amendment of that Act.  The courts are deciding in the case of the Misuse of Drugs Bill and the question of bail.  We are saying that the courts should decide the question of bail but that the court <Col N="851" /> which would decide should be at the level of the High Court.  That is not taking away anybody's rights, it is saying that this kind of offence is so serious that when bail is given in that instance a consideration of the giving of bail should be reserved to the High Court.  I accept the Minister's undertaking that he will examine that for Report Stage. Obviously he wants to consider whether it should be transferred to the Misuse of Drugs Bill.  I am not too sure about that because then consideration of it would probably be put back for some time.  We are talking about cases where bail is reserved.  Section 29 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967 provides that:</P>
      <P>A person charged with an offence to which this section applies shall not be admitted to bail except by order of the High Court.</P>
      <P>To bring it within that category and definition it would seem legitimate to put it in as an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  At that I must leave it to the Minister to decide what he wants to do and we can discuss it again on Report Stage.  This is important and has been seen to be important.  We should deal with it now and within this Bill before us for the reasons I have given.</P>

      <P>The Minister will not mind my saying this.  He has been extremely open-minded about this whole Bill. There is a great deal of substance in Deputy Woods's submission and I could see no reason why the amendment he wants, if the Minister has no objection to the principle of it, ought not to be made in this Bill rather than in the forthcoming Misuse of Drugs Bill.  This Bill purports to make very sweeping changes in the whole criminal process and the amendment, if the Minister is willing to accept the spirit of it, would be more appropriate here than in a Bill related to the misuse of drugs which has other aspects than merely criminal ones.</P>

      <P>I object to the deletion of this section, a very urgent provision which is badly needed.  This section proposes to deal with the unauthorised taking of vehicles, and the public were led to believe that in this Bill we would tackle this major problem in a serious way.  The Minister proposed in the section that the sentence for such an offence would be increased to five years, or a fine not exceeding £2,000, or both.  It would mean that persons arrested under subsection <Col N="853" /> (2) (b) would be liable to detention under section 3.</P>
      <P>This problem has taken on major proportions in Dublin and throughout the country.  Last night on the way home I was listening to a programme on which young people from the North said they came down here regularly to take cars from as far south as Greystones &mdash; they regarded themselves as joyriders.  That indicates how serious this problem is and the need to tackle it urgently.  That is why we welcomed the section and the proposal to increase the penalties.  It is therefore disappointing that the Minister should decide to set aside the section and to have a similar provision inserted in another Bill being handled by another Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I have received many submissions in regard to the unauthorised taking of cars and joyriding.  Various kinds of punishments have been suggested, many of them not as severe as those proposed in section 12.  One submission was from a Mr. Noel Kennelly, whose brother-in-law was killed by a stolen car.  He proposed a series of punishments ranging up to five years imprisonment when the death of a person was involved.  The Minister has that submission and I hope that at Cabinet level he will draw it to the attention of the Minister responsible for the road traffic legislation.</P>
      <P>That submission proposed reasonable penalties, including a mandatory minimum fine of £20 for interfering with the mechanism of a car, and the penalties were graded upwards through different levels.  I note that the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors stated that section 12 needed clarification on the question of detention of people on suspicion. They regarded such a provision as being a major help to the Garda in the pursuit of such offenders.  The five-year provision might appear to be fairly stiff. Imprisonment from two to five years might have been more reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I hope the Minister who will be dealing with this in the road traffic legislation will have the submissions I have referred to brought to his attention and that he will give them serious <Col N="854" /> consideration.  There is not much I can say on this now.  We accept reluctantly that it is being deleted and we will look forward to a provision along its lines being included in the other Bill.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Among the amendments to the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill will be amendment No. 4, which is section 12 of this Bill. When the Criminal Justice Bill was being published in October the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill was still at drafting stage but it appears that it will now become law before the Criminal Justice Bill.  Rather than delaying the proposals in regard to unauthorised taking of cars it appeared to us that the section should be moved as an amendment to the Traffic Bill.  Apart from that, it is proper that the road traffic code would be one corpus of legislation.  It was because of the urgency of this matter that such offences were included in the Criminal Justice Bill when it was published in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be creating a sort of bus lane on the inside so that urgent parts of the Bill can be put through quicker by including them in another Bill.  It may seem inconsistent for me to agree with the Minister on a point on which a few moments ago I agreed there was more substance in what Deputy Woods was saying but there is an advantage in having all the substantive offences relating to road traffic in the same code. If the provision makes sense, there is a case for transferring it to the pending Road Traffic Bill.  One could argue in favour of that along lines which would not be available to one in the same way for the Minister's point of view in regard to drug-related offences and the question of bail.  My attitude to the substance of this section relates also to the question in general of whether a lot is gained by increasing penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a general rule, when a Minister is promoting legislation to increase penalties for certain offences there is an onus on the Government side to produce at least rough statistics from which can be ascertained such information as the scale of the incidence of the offences.  For <Col N="855" /> instance, how many cases of cars having been taken without permission were reported in the last year for which we have figures?  Secondly, how many prosecutions resulted from those cases? Thirdly, how many convictions were recorded?  Fourthly what was the average terms of the sentences imposed and, last, what was the pattern of the sentences served?  It is only in circumstances in which the Government could show that the level of the sentences and the severity with which they were carried through were pushing up against the ceiling of the present statutory maximum that they could argue plausibly for increasing the paper penalty, as it were.  If, as is the case frequently, the detection rate is lamentably low, if the usual sentences imposed do not come anywhere near the existing statutory maximum and if even when they do, the person sentenced is released for one reason or another, perhaps because of inadequate prison accommodation, there is no great point in increasing the penalties.  More would be gained by taking measures which would increase the certainty of detection.  That might not be so cosmetic but it would be more effective though I do not pretend to know what such measures might be.</P>
    <P>It is a bad principle for any Government to go into the business of erecting bigger and more terrifying scarecrows which the experienced joyrider, shoplifter or any other kind of criminal knows cannot root themselves out of the ground to pursue the criminal.  We are not in the business of erecting scarecrows which perhaps would flatter our sense of how serious or prevalent a certain offence might be and which would not have any real effect in reducing the incidence of the crime concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the section is more appropriate to the road traffic legislation.  In regard to the section, the Association of Criminal Lawyers said that the vast majority of those who steal cars, are young, unemployed, inarticulate and delinquent.  From my experience that is a fair and accurate statement.  In these circumstances we <Col N="856" /> must ask ourselves how many people in that category will be in a position to pay fines of £1,000 or should those charged opt for trial by jury, how many would be in a position to pay fines of £2,000?  We know that very few of those who engage in such activities would be in a position to pay such fines.  Consequently, the provisions of the section will not apply to many people.  We may take it that most of those charged will opt for trial in the District Court because of the sentencing policy there.</P>
      <P>There is a very serious problem in regard to the stealing of cars.  One network of roads in my constituency has been renamed &ldquo;Mondello&rdquo; by the local people.  The situation there is so bad that residents of the area are asking that bollards be erected but to take such a step would be to create ghetto-like areas. However, something must be done in an effort to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>I contend that the manufacturers of high-powered cars such as BMWs and Mercedes have a responsibility to ensure that those vehicles are not as easy to steal as are the smaller cars.  There is no point in fixing what amount to toy locks on cars.  There are probably more car assemblers in my constituency than in any other but that does not prevent me from submitting that these people should fit proper locking devices to cars.  I would go so far as to suggest that the road traffic legislation should include a section compelling car manufacturers to instal adequate locking devices on these heavier vehicles because they are the ones that are most often stolen.  The joyriders involved are usually only waiting for the opportunity of a chase involving Garda cars but the Garda cars are not adequate to keep pace with these bigger cars.</P>

      <P>I do not propose going into detail on this section except to make the point that the sections we have dealt with already would apply to this section which is now being transferred to the Road Traffic Bill.  Therefore, the people Deputy Mitchell speaks of, the young and inarticulate who steal cars, will be liable to the consecutive sentencing policy in the District Court as it is most likely they will opt for trial in that court.  Therefore, it is hardly unreasonable for Deputies to refer to the section.</P>
      <P>The amendment, which I am not moving because the Minister is withdrawing the section, sought to ensure that because of the severity of the sentences young people could face if they were accused of stealing cars, they would have a right to opt for trial by jury.  I hope the Minister will take that into account when dealing with it in the Road Traffic Bill.</P>

I agree with Deputy Kelly's comments about the kind of questions we should be asking because there is a story behind all the statistics.  It might help towards a final solution of the problem if we could break down the statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are important questions to be asked in this area particularly when most of this type of crime is committed by young people.  Who steals cars?  Deputy Mitchell quoted from the Association of Criminal Lawyers who said they were young, unemployed, uneducated and delinquent.  Do young people who steal cars go on to become involved in more serious crime such as housebreaking, larceny <Col N="858" /> or more violent crime or is it something that they get out of their system and stop after a few years?  Without discussing the merits of the £2,000 and five years maximum sentences, it is very severe if a person steals only one or two cars for the thrill of doing so.  It seems very severe that their life should be damaged to such an extent that they spend five years in jail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that and I know it is unusual for the maximum sentence to be imposed.  If the reason for these measures was to put the fear of God into young people it will not work because one thing they have in abundance is raw nerve. They have no fear.  People of this makeup are not inclined to be put off regardless of how long a sentence is for.  It is important to consider the contribution made by Deputy Kelly in that regard.</P>
      <P>I will reserve discussion on these aspects of the section for the Road Traffic Bill.  We would all like to see the problem solved but it is not necessarily the case that if we increase sentences we will contribute to the reduction of crime.  We must consider the life span of criminals. If we are talking about young people aged from 15 to 35 years we would need to have good reasons for deciding on sentences which could result in their spending almost one-third of those years in jail. This is something I often thought about and wondered how these sentences are arrived at.  Do people seriously think about them and about the effect a figure of one year, two years, three years and so on can have on a person's life?  I am not advocating a reduction if this cannot be justified.  It may be that it they were increased they would work just as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the experience of taking a 15 year old fellow out of a car after he had killed a pedestrian crossing a road.  He had to wait to reach the age of 16 so that he could be sent somewhere.  In the meantime he stole more cars.  He told me that he did not care because he would be sentenced anyway and that he had killed somebody the previous week.  It is a <Col N="859" /> frightening experience.  Apart from the measures we introduce in legislation we must tackle this in another way.  I will reserve my in-depth comments on this section as it will come up under the Road Traffic Bill.</P>

      <P>We have to bear in mind in the context of this Bill that if a sentence of five years is imposed, it is no longer a minor offence; this will be a major offence with all the connotations that go with it.  A sentence of five years brings it within the context of section 3 which covers arrest on suspicion and detention for six hours followed by another six hours if necessary.  This is something we will have to watch in future because when the increased sentence is being imposed &mdash; an increase to three years from the present six months plus six months &mdash;<Col N="861" /> there might be a temptation on the part of the Government of the day to increase the sentence to five years because this move would bring all these offences under section 3.</P>
      <P>I think this is a very relevant point and I hope this and the other points I have made will be borne in mind by those Deputies who will be discussing the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill.  We have a duty to consider all Bills, but if the Minister wants this Bill passed quickly, he can arrange more sitting days and we will be happy to facilitate him.

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 25 to 30, to delete subsection (1).</P>
      <P>Section 13 deals with the increase of penalties for certain firearms offences.  Subsection (1) reads:</P>
      <P>Section 15 of the Firearms Act, 1925, as amended by section 21 (4) of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 (possessing firearm or ammunition with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property) is hereby amended by the substitution, for &ldquo;imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years&rdquo;, of &ldquo;imprisonment for life&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 32 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> In page 8, lines 35 to 39, to delete subsection (3).</P>
    <P>Subsection 3 reads:</P>
    <P>Section 27 (2) of the Firearms Act, 1964, as amended by section 21 (6) (c) of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 (use of firearm to resist arrest or aid escape) is hereby amended by the substitution, for &ldquo;imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years&rdquo;, of &ldquo;imprisonment for life&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In both cases the Minister is proposing that a term of 14 years be replaced by imprisonment for life.  When this is broadcast to the media it sounds great because a life sentence will act as a deterrent. I found this very hard to understand because I know that a sentence of life can work out at eight to 12 years.  If we have a sentence of 14 years, why sentence a person to eight to 12 years?  There cannot be very much difference, unless it is that we want to impress people of the seriousness we give to certain types of crimes or offences.  We support the increased sentences, but is a sentences of 14 years to life an increase?  Should the Minister not say &ldquo;14 years or life&rdquo;?  In these circumstances will it be more difficult to get a jury to find a person guilty?  Where there are drug and other serious offences, for which a 14 years sentence can be imposed, the problem is to get the courts and the juries to impose sentences of seven, eight or nine years.  Too often the public have been scandalised that people found guilty of very serious offences were sentenced to two or three years, or even got suspended sentences.</P>
    <P>I can see the Minister's reaction to the public outcry in these areas.  We did exactly the same thing with the Misuse of Drugs Act.  We got tremendous publicity, great public relations and everybody was impressed but in reality we are talking about a shorter sentence.  There is another problem: how does one impose an intermediate sentence if the Bill says &ldquo;imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years&rdquo; or &ldquo;imprisonment for life&rdquo;?  A jury will be reluctant to send somebody away for life because they possess a firearm or ammunition with intent to endanger <Col N="863" /> life.  A jury might not be inclined to impose a life sentence but they might agree to a sentence of three, five or seven years.  I would like the Minister to clear up this point because this is a difficulty. That is why I put down this amendment. I suggest that the Minister consider on Report Stage inserting the words &ldquo;fourteen years or life&rdquo; if he wishes to have a life sentence included.  There must be intermediate sentences.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy Woods opposes raising the penalty for the offences under subsections (1) and (3), which are possession of firearms with intent to endanger life and the use of firearms to resist arrest, from 14 years in each case to life imprisonment.  The Deputy misunderstands the situation. What is being proposed is not a mandatory life sentence as for murder, but the imposition of a maximum sentence of life.  At present the maximum sentence is 14 years.  The judge can impose any length of imprisonment up to life and life is an indeterminate number of years.  In effect, the discretion is being given to the judge of imposing a sentence of 20 or 25 years whereas up to now his discretion has been up to 14 years.  This is certainly making the penalty stronger and, because it is a maximum sentence, the discretion is being left to the judge to pick an intermediate sentence, as the Deputy suggests, if he sees fit.  Deputy Woods' amendments are based on a misunderstanding of what is being proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, does it not mean that the maximum sentence becomes life and how can the judge impose 20 years? Life, in practice, would seem to work out at eight to 12 years.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is not mandatory; it is a maximum sentence.  In imposing a maximum sentence of life, the judge has a discretion in fixing on any number of years.  He is quite at liberty to give a very severe sentence while at present he cannot give more than 14 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true to say that a life sentence is less of a sentence than the present 14 <Col N="864" /> years.  It is a more severe penalty.  If in practice it works out at less than 14 years &mdash; and it has on occasions up to now &mdash; it is the practice of early release and remission which is wrong, not the 14 years or the life sentence.  It is not a mandatory sentence which is being proposed, it is an increasing of the maximum sentence from 14 years to life and that gives the judge the discretion to impose any sentence which he thinks fit in the particular case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has cleared up some of the confusion which arises.  People have the impression that life is a shorter sentence than 14 years. Nonetheless, if the judge has the power to sentence up to all one's life, say ten to 30 years, suppose that he simply says &lsquo;for life&rsquo;.  Does it not then rest on the prison authorities and welfare people to decide what that life sentence means?  In effect, it could mean a much less severe sentence. If someone was sentenced to 14 years at present, these authorities might not be so free to decide the extent of the service in prison.  Perhaps on Report Stage the Minister might try to spell this out a little better.  A specified sentence of, for example, 14 years may be a greater deterrent than a term of life imprisonment. Life does not seem to many to mean more than seven years.</P>
      <P>The amendments proposed by Deputy Woods do not enhance the Bill or deal with the problem which the Deputy says exists.  His amendments delete the reference to life imprisonment but do not propose anything in substitution.  Other sections in this Bill have the effect of increasing the penalty from seven to 14 years in the case of taking a vehicle without authority, from five to ten years for possession of firearms or ammunition in suspicious circumstances and from ten to 14 years for the carrying of a firearm with criminal intent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of this section, regrettably, is necessary.  The regular reference to certain parts of the city is &ldquo;Gunsville&rdquo;.  One hears regular stories of guns for hire for a specific job.  It is suggested that north and south side gangs regularly lend each other guns for this purpose.  To suggest <Col N="865" /> that we delete two subsections to deal with the problem is a little naive.  We will certainly need to tighten up on the definition of &ldquo;life&rdquo;.  The Minister might help by clarifying the position on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The reason for the use of all these guns is that the Official and Provisional IRA and many now holding themselves out to be social workers, do-gooders and anti-drug organisers in the community are those who showed the way in the use of guns in the city and country.  Of that there is no doubt.  They gave the lead in the use of guns and now hold themselves out to be the protectors of the community &mdash; the knee-cappers and supposed anti-criminals. They set this action in train.  I suggest that the Minister consider inserting a specific section in relation to kidnapping where guns are used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  These are the amendments which Deputy Woods put down in order to delete subsection (1) and (3).  Obviously what is in the Deputy's mind is the apparent or supposed lesser efficacy of a life sentence than of a specified term of years.  The point which I made a short while ago is applicable here.  It would be useful if the Minister could tell us, in considering these amenements &mdash; or, for that matter, in dealing with this section as a whole and <Col N="866" /> looking at, for example, the first subsection which Deputy Woods wants to remove.  How many recent cases have have there been of the imposition of the maximum sentence of 14 years for an offence under section 15 of the 1925 Act? I realise that 14 years is such a long time that the whole period could not have expired since the present paroxysm of violence began, but is there any indication of how many times the maximum sentence was imposed and anything like that number of years actually served?  Is there any suggestion, from the police or anybody else, that the efficacy of the general firearms law is reduced by reason of the fact that 14 years is not a sufficient term of imprisonment, when reckoning the allowance for good behaviour or whatever else might be taken into account?</P>
      <P>This whole area, including Deputy Woods's amendments, would be illuminated by some statistical, not exact but general, information of this kind.  Even if the Minister were able to say that the police have given it as their serious and considered opinion that the repression of firearms offences would be facilitiated by increasing the sentences which the law threatens, I would need to be convinced that that were so.  If the Minister were to assure us in general terms that this was the police view that would at least give the matter some weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Woods' concern and the reason he put down his amendment.  Life is a terrifying sentence if for nothing other than the uncertainty of it.  There is no certainty that it will be eight to 12 years even if that has turned out to be the practice, even if it is the case that most people convicted of murder are now walking the streets and that other considerations were taken into account during the period the sentence was being served, when these people were under observation by the authorities and decisions were made perhaps to release them after a certain number of years.  Probably the objective of this section is to bring it home to people that under no circumstances should one even dare think about picking up a firearm <Col N="867" /> or getting involved in firearms in any way.  It is not too long ago when the country was virtually free of firearms.  It was only on rare occasions they cropped up.  As Deputy Mitchell has said, they are all too frequent now and you can even hire them.  It is becoming part and parcel of most hold-ups and robberies.</P>
      <P>It should be made clear that it is a most serious offence; and when somebody decides to commit a crime we should if possible make that person stop and think that, while he might commit the crime, if he brings a firearm along there is the possibility of a life sentence.  In that respect I have not anything against the section, although I consider that 14 years should be a deterrent, if one can have a deterrent and if people worry at all about how many years they will get in jail if they commit a very serious offence like this.  For that very reason I would like to see behind the figures, because I have doubts sometimes whether deterrent results because of the number of years that will be imposed.  I do not believe criminals sit down and try to work out how many years they will get for a crime they commit.  I am sure a judge is caused great anxiety if he increases the term of imprisonment by one, two or three years, from five years to eight years.  Does he just take a figure out of the air between one and 14 or, depending on the age of the criminal coming before the court, whether it will be a ten year span or a 20 year span in jail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must make a very strong stand in relation to any crime involving firearms. We must try to discourage people as far as possible from using firearms.  This is only one way of doing it and we have to look at different areas to try to reduce the crime rate, especially the armed crime rate.  I do not believe there is any great improvement in the section by keeping it at 14 years.  It is a misconception to believe that life imprisonment is eight to 12 years, for the reasons I have given earlier.  Admittedly, as far as my research into the matter is concerned, there are very few people who have received life sentences except for very special considerations and who are still <Col N="868" /> behind bars.  Most of them are out.  The authorities may think they have been rehabilitated.  The general tone of the Bill is that we have decided that it is not possible under any circumstances to rehabilitate criminals by imposing prison sentences.  By the measures we are taking in this section and throughout the Bill we have thrown in the towel in that area; we have thrown our hat at it and we know that rehabilitation cannot take place within out system.  We should bear that in mind because we depend on other people in our society, volunteers and others, to pick up the pieces.  This is the approach we are taking, although unfortunately we are not listening to those people and we are not heeding the advice they have given us on many sections of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Everybody knows that the section increases the penalties for certain firearms offences. These are the most serious offences known to our law.  The penalty for possessing a firearm or ammunition with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property is going up from 14 years to life imprisonment as is also the penalty for using a firearm to resist arrest, for aiding an escape.  We are increasing from seven years to 14 years the penalty for possessing a firearm while taking a vehicle without authority and from ten years to 14 years the penalty for carrying a firearm with criminal intent.  These are all maximum sentences and not mandatory ones.  In those cases where the maximum sentence is a life sentence it will be open to the courts to impose a sentence of 20 to 25 years in the appropriate case or a lesser sentence in the appropriate case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea here from the Government's point of view is that, first of all, the use of guns in our society on the criminal side and on the criminal terrorist side has reached epidemic proportions.  Guns have become a part of ordinary life to a degree which was unimaginable ten years ago.  There is no doubt that ordinary criminals have learned their lesson well from the Official IRA, the Provisional IRA, the INLA and the various other subversive groups in society.  Life has become cheaper with the spread of guns. This section and the next section is an attempt by the Government to respond to what is a deteriorating situation.  The intent here is, first of all, to show by the increase of sentence that the Government are unhappy about the situation. We believe there is a deterrent effect with the concept of a life sentence.  It is also an indication to the Judiciary that in this and in the other Bill referred to this morning longer sentences will be welcome for these particular offences <Col N="870" /> because the length of sentence has a deterrent effect.</P>
    <P>Another point which is worth bearing in mind is that our sentences for these particular offences are out of line with the sentences in Northern Ireland.  The proposals in section 13 will bring the maximum sentence up to the level of the sentences in Northern Ireland.  That is not just for the sake of neatness.  Under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, which is not used very much but which could conceivably be used to a great extent, the accused has the right to opt for the jurisdiction where he will be tried.  If somebody is arrested and charged in the North of Ireland under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, he can opt to be tried in the Republic of Ireland or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>In this area of firearms offences where, when we are dealing with terrorists whatever the charge is, there is a firearms element in it in almost all cases, even if the major charge is not a firearms charge, there is merit in having the same maxima North and South specifically for that reason.  How effective will this provision be?  It is very difficult to predict what will happen ultimately.  This section, taken with section 14, will make a fairly major impact in preventing what is happening at the moment.  There is an onus on us to take on the dealers in death, people who use guns quite frequently, people who have no respect for life and who use guns in all the ways outlined here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that we support the increases.  We are concerned about whether life represents an increase.  The Minister said that in practice it is not an increase for a different reason.  The Minister said that in practice it works out at less because of the remissions.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> No, I did not.  I said the Deputy was confused, and obviously he still is.  A mandatory life sentence for murder works out at less in practice on many occasions.  We are not taking about a mandatory life sentence here.  We are talking about a maximum <Col N="871" /> sentence of life and the court can impose any length of sentence it wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>What does it matter once a sentence of life is given?  We want to be clear on this.  It is interesting to look at the previous modifications.  The original 1925 Act provided in section 15, which is the section this relates to, for penal servitude for a term not exceeding 20 years. In the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, the section provided for imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years. Now the Minister is saying we will get the right result by providing for a life sentence. If a judge decides to give the maximum sentence and imposes imprisonment for life, we know from what the Minister has said, and from what we were told outside, that will work out at less because of the remissions which apply. That is the question we are concerned about.  This does not say a maximum sentence of life.  It just says imprisonment for life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister absolutely happy that that will be interpreted and seen as any number of years up to life?  If so, that aspect is satisfactory.  The word &ldquo;life&rdquo; standing on its own in the Bill would seem to indicate that we are talking about life generally in those instances and that, if a life sentence is imposed, it will work out at less than 14 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down the amendment so that that aspect could be discussed fully before we pass this section.  In case anybody gets a confused version of it, I want to make it quite clear that we are fully in favour of the increased sentences.  We appreciate all the points the Minister is making.  We <Col N="872" /> appreciate the seriousness of armed robberies and the increasing use of arms in relation to offences of various kinds.  Like Deputy Skelly I know that people can hire guns for £1,000.  I am told that is a reality, that you can hire a gun for £1,000 and get somebody to do a job for you.  I know of cases where constituents of mine have had a job done on them.  That is another question.  All that has to be dealt with.  We want to deal with the increasing use of firearms.  We are not at variance with the Minister on this matter.  We are totally in agreement with him if we can be satisfied that his interpretation of imprisonment for life means what he says it does.  How it will be applied in practice is still a problem because, if a life sentence is imposed, it will work out at less.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given the statistics, for which a number of Deputies asked, about what is happening in practice. If a sentence of ten, 12 or 14 years is being applied at present, that would seem to be more than adequate.  It may be that these sentences are not being applied.  Therefore we will be back in the same position.  The Minister said a judge can impose any number of years up to life.  Presumably life can mean any number of years on that definition.  If the Judiciary are not imposing more than three or five years the exercise seems to be pointless.  We have to assure everybody that we are taking this seriously.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made my position clear. I am accepting what the Minister said about imprisonment for life.  I will look at it again before Report Stage to see whether I can be quite happy about it.  It may be that in practice it is not a wise thing for us to do if a life sentence will be less than a certain number of years.  It was 20 years and it came down to 14 years.  Now we are going back to life, and saying life can mean 20 years or any other number of years.  The offence does not only cover subversives and those who are involved in armed robberies.  That is why it is important to have available a scale of years up to a life sentence.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (1) of the Firearms Act, 1925, states that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;firearm&rdquo; means a lethal firearm or <Col N="873" /> other lethal weapon of any description from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged;</P>
    <P>It includes any ingredient or component part of any such firearm.  It also includes an air gun, an air rifle or an air pistol. The subsection states that:</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;prohibited weapon&rdquo; means and includes any weapon of whatever description designed for the discharge of any noxious liquid, noxious gas, or other noxious thing,...</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Firearms Act, 1925, states:</P>
    <P>Any person who after the passing of this Act has in his possession or under his control any firearms or ammunition&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, or</P>
    <P>(b)  with intent to enable any other person by means of such firearm or ammunition to endanger life or cause serious injury to property,</P>
    <P>shall, whether any injury to person or property has or has not been caused thereby,...</P>
    <P>For instance, in the case of an elderly man in his seventies who is persuaded by the IRA to store guns in a hayshed, up to now he would get a short sentence of one or two years.  It is very important that the sentence of life should be capable of interpretation on a sliding scale because that person might not have had much option.  In another case a suspended sentence was applied.  We should be quite clear that this sliding scale would apply in such cases.  Apart from the concern we have expressed with regard to that aspect, we support the increases proposed. However, they should allow for all the intermediate kinds of offences as they are defined in the Act and which will apply in this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the deterrent is to have a maximum sentence of life and the Government consider this would have some effect.  There is the view that a minimum mandatory sentence would have some effect.  If a person knew <Col N="874" /> that a mandatory sentence of three or five years would apply for the use of firearms in violent crime&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet finished. Minimum mandatory sentences for the use of firearms in violent crime, such as robbery, rape or aggravated assault where a crime is actually done might prove a deterrent but I doubt if the change from 14 years to a life sentence will have much effect on the statistics. Incidentally, I would be interested to know the statistics in relation to sentencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we talk about mandatory sentences from time to time, we are very reluctant to do anything about them.  An article by Reid Andrews in the <i>Washington Report</i> of January 1984 dealt with the matter of guns and the problems they are having in the United States in that respect.  He dealt with the kind of Federal and State laws that were appropriate.  In the studies that were carried out it is indicated that the answer clearly seems to be mandatory penalties for the use of firearms in violent crime and, combined with that, increased citizen participation in neighbourhood crime prevention programmes. It was also pointed out that 13 States now have mandatory sentences for violent gun crimes and most have seen noticeable reductions in their crime rates. The author states that Arizona, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and South Carolina have enacted tough mandatory penalties and all have seen a sharp drop in violent crime.  Michigan saw its gun-related crime drop approximately 60 per cent between 1976 and 1982.  It would appear that we should look more closely at the matter of mandatory sentences in relation to violent crimes and we should have more information about how they are being applied elsewhere and the effect they are having.  It may be that in practice they would have more effect than what we are doing here because people would know they are facing a mandatory sentence. I should like to hear from the Minister about the current practice in <Col N="875" /> relation to the number of offences and the length of sentences passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that it is of the utmost importance that steps be taken to deal with the increasing use of firearms and guns in our community. It is most important that new steps be taken to cope with that situation.  I do not think that simply increasing the maximum sentences, as is proposed here, will make any difference to the situation.  It will not make any difference to the level of sentences normally imposed by the courts and, secondly, I do not believe it will alter its force as a deterrent.  For a criminal the change from 14 years to a potential life sentence will have little effect in deterring him from committing a crime.</P>
      <P>The courts go nowhere near imposing maximum sentences for this or any other crime and if and when the statistics are produced by the Minister I have no doubt they will show that across the whole spectrum of criminal sentencing the sentences on average imposed are much below the maxima provided.  It is rare, if ever, that a maximum sentence is imposed.  That arises from the fact that for virtually all crimes the maximum sentences would be regarded as extraordinarily long.  As far as I can recall, for larceny and robbery maximum sentences of 20 years are available under the law but I do not think such sentences have been imposed in living memory.  More often than not, in the case of larceny and robbery charges, the Probation Act is applied or else a sentence of from three to 12 months' imprisonment is imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is to be any meaningful attempt here to change the present position regarding firearms offences, which I agree are in a separate and distinct category from other fields of criminal activity, a different approach will have to be adopted.  I agree with the suggestion of Deputy Woods that we should be looking at minimum sentences.  The idea of having mandatory minimum sentences is something I am very unhappy about except in a very small, rarefied category of offences, and those involving firearms <Col N="876" /> certainly would come into that area. Cases involving the use of firearms with intent to endanger life and to commit crime warrant mandatory minimum sentences.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he thought increasing maximum sentences would be seen by the Judiciary as an invitation to increase the sentence they would otherwise normally have applied.  I do not agree; I do not think the Judiciary look at their sentencing policies in that way. They look at the case before them, at the criminal and his record and then they pass sentence.  I do not think any judge would be influenced by increased sentences.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects of custodial sentences. One, the most crucial and important, is rehabilitation of the criminal which must be paramount but, with certain types of criminals, there is the second aspect of preventative detention as protection for the public.  It has never been a dominant factor here in sentences although it has been in the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions.  When one comes to the category of firearms offences, the question of the protection of life and limb of innocent members of the public must be taken into account to some degree also.  In this context I ask the Minister to look at the question of mandatory sentences and, for a repeated offence, there should be a substantial mandatory minimum sentence.</P>
    <P>The man in the street, rightly or wrongly, takes the view that the level of sentences imposed by the courts is ridiculous and outrageously low and that no attempt is being made by the Judiciary to crack down on crime.  In some cases certainly the level of sentencing gives rise to reservations.  This category, however, is exceptional and requires a degree of attention quite apart from the general run of other criminal activity.  When there is a conviction for a serious crime, for example, having a gun with intent to endanger life, it warrants a minumun sentence and that would be taken as a guideline by the Judiciary.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to disagree with Deputy Taylor.  I agree with the sentiments <Col N="877" /> underlying his suggestion but the suggestion itself would not work very well and I prefer the Minister's approach.  I do not know whether I am repeating something which the Minister has said but the problem which originally preoccupied Deputy Woods is very simply dealt with and was explained by the Minister in terms of the distinction between a mandatory life sentence and a maximum life sentence.  The problem with a mandatory life sentence is that there is no way of varying it just as you could not vary the severity of the death sentence which it replaced in murder cases.  Death was death and there were no gradations.  In order to make the very proper abolition of the death penalty acceptable to people who regret its abolition, the practice has been to replace it with a mandatory life sentence.  That mandatory sentence means that a judge has no option, when a jury convicts somebody of murder, but to impose this sentence and no other. That means that no shades of guilt are recognisable in the simple case of the mandatory life sentence.  Somebody who is the most cold blooded and callous killer imaginable gets the very same sentence as somebody who, possibly through an unfortunate conjuncture of factors together with perhaps a weak character, is pushed into a position where he criminally and wrongly takes another human life but in circumstances perhaps which will not be repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would probably not apply to subversive crime but, as a general rule, you have a much better chance of being murdered by someone who is related to you by blood or marriage than by anybody else.  Most murders, except for conditions which are, unfortunately, becoming common here where political subversion plays a strong part, result from awful, unspeakable domestic conditions or situations. Naturally, I am not trying to palliate them in saying that but there is an element of very bad luck in certain crimes.  We need not start comparing one murder with another but I am making the point that a jury which, after long consideration finds that a set of facts will not justify the relatively lenient finding of manslaughter but is just over the borderline <Col N="878" /> into murder but is a case nevertheless where you or I might be disposed to have strong sympathy with or understanding for the criminal, leaves the judge no option but to impose a mandatory life sentence.  Of course, it still leaves the executive with the power to remit a very large part of the sentence by letting the person out after a relatively short time and that is what Deputy Woods has in mind.  That is the reason for the misconception which the Minister has explained.  Very often a life sentence is less severe than a specified term of years.</P>
    <P>The question of a minimum mandatory sentence to which Deputy Taylor referred, is a different kettle of fish and, in that connection, problems arise which are very difficult to grasp.  If a jury or a judge sitting without a jury is made to realise that convicting a prisoner must, under the law, result in a mandatory minimum sentence, that creates an inbuilt temptation for the jury, or perhaps the judge, to avoid conviction if they possibly can in the same way as in instances where a mandatory statutory consequence follows conviction of a particular offence, to take the simplest instance, forfeiture of a driving licence or loss of a particular kind of employment.  That creates a humane anxiety on the part of judge or jury to lean over backwards not to convict a person if there is any way to avoid doing so.  Anyone who has practised or even been in court will know that advocates, rightly doing their best for their clients, will insinuate the point even though it is not relevant to the issue of guilt in the course of the hearing that conviction for the accused person will mean the loss of his livelihood because, perhaps, he is a commercial traveller who has to drive or if he is in public employment and the charge is under the Offences Against the State Act will mandatorily lose his job. Deputy Taylor's anxieties are understandable with regard to the mandatory factor but, for the reasons I have given, they may be counter-productive and lead to a lower rate of convictions.  The Minister, in a disorderly interjection in reply to Deputy Woods, mentioned the case of the silly old man who had permitted himself to be blackguarded into sheltering <Col N="879" /> things which he should not have sheltered. That sort of person cannot be leniently treated under any sort of minimum mandatory sentence, although there appeared to be agreement on the far side of the House that he should be.</P>

      <P>Anything to do with a minimum mandatory sentence runs into this problem.  Anything which is mandatory on a court, which reduces a court's discretion to try to make the punishment fit the crime, tends either to create injustice because of somebody being subjected to an improperly severe penalty or to create injustice <i>vis-à-vis</i> the people of Ireland in as much as reluctance to convict emerges.</P>
      <P>Although I have a great respect and admiration for the United States, one of the less admirable dimensions of their system appears to be their criminal process. I consider that the spectacle of somebody left on death row for four, five or six years and then dragged out and gassed or electrocuted is absolutely disgusting. I could not take lessons from a country, no matter how great its merits &mdash; and the merits of the United States are very great indeed &mdash; in the matter of the criminal process when their public opinion is such as to tolerate that sequence of events. There are well over 1,000 people with death sentences hanging over them, which are now being carried out, although they were imposed in the seventies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was simply trying to rebut the idea that one gets anywhere with mandatory sentences.  The Minister is correct in trying to leave as much leeway as possible for the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general matter of the severity of penalty, I do not think it ever happened in this House that I drew from another branch of academic experience than our own legal system.  However, I remember giving a lecture in the University of Paris during the sixties on the subject of the Roman quadruple penalty. I was able to show, to my own satisfaction <Col N="881" /> anyway, that when you found in a Roman statute a penalty of four times the value of the property or interest concerned it was a sure sign that the law was impotent and that this extravagantly high penalty was intended as a kind of scarecrow.  Such a penalty in a law was nearly an infallible sign that the law was never enforced, for reasons which I tried then to explore. That is not a bad rule of thumb to follow, even in the present day.  Where you find sentences being increased and made more severe, it is a fair index that the rate of repression of the offence concerned with the penalties now available is pretty low.  The Minister is correct in his general approach, but I have not been convinced by anything I have heard here that we are going to get anywhere in terms of reducing the incidence of firearms or other offences merely by souping up the penalties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the section is to act as a deterrent to serious offences of possession with intent, resisting arrest with arms and so forth.  It is a good intention and I do not quibble with it, other than to say that there is no evidence to show that the section will have the desired effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the discussion a number of people referred to armed robberies. I have been looking up the Garda report for 1982.  In the case of possession of firearms with intent to endanger life, the number of offences reported or known in 1982 was 23 and the number of offences in which criminal proceedings were commenced was 22.  In the case of possession of firearms while taking a vehicle without authority, the number of offences reported or known was 11 and criminal proceedings were commenced in three of those cases.  In relation to the use of firearms to resist arrest or aid escape, the number of offences reported or known was three and criminal proceedings were commenced in one case. In the case of possession of firearms or ammunition in suspicious circumstances, the number of offences known or reported was 31 and criminal proceedings commenced in 28 cases.  There were eight cases reported or known of carrying firearms <Col N="882" /> with criminal intent and proceedings commenced in five cases.  The total number of such offences in 1982 was 76. These are the offences to which this section relates.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the number of armed robberies was 158 and the number of aggravated burglaries in which arms were used was 232.  There were 390 serious offences involving firearms which I understand this section would not affect. It would affect 76 offences committed in 1982.  The point I am endeavouring to make in relation to that is that the Minister must feel that the sentencing obtaining for armed robbery or burglary is adequate because he has not introduced any amendment to change that.  If that is true, then one might well pose the question: why do these offences continue to escalate?  On the other hand, the number of offences with which we are dealing for 1982 is 76.  We are proposing to increase the sentence from 14 years in some cases to life in others &mdash; from five years to ten years in some cases and from seven years to 14 years in others.</P>
    <P>I would argue that the rationale behind whether a potential criminal, political or otherwise, commits an offence does not lead him to consider in the first place the length of sentence that might be imposed. The first thing about which they will think is whether they will be caught.  If they are going to be caught then clearly the length of sentence will have a bearing on whether they commit the crime in which they propose to become involved.  If one might take it to its very lowest level, if I or some other Deputy parks out in Kildare Street the possibility is that we will receive a £5 parking fine.  If we think it worth the £5 we will go ahead and park there.  However, if we fear that our car will be towed away and that we shall have to pay £20 or £30 in order to retrieve it we will think twice about it.  But, by and large, we know the likelihood is that our car will not be towed away.  Therefore the question of whether one will be caught and will have to pay the penalty imposed under the law is what will primarily concern a prospective criminal.</P>
    <P>The Minister and a number of other speakers made reference to the political <Col N="883" /> criminal, the terrorist and so on.  We must recognise that the penalty has very little to do with whether a person proposing to engage in a political crime decides to commit it.  Such people will be motivated by a completely different set of considerations &mdash; the political climate and the acceptability of a given crime will have much more bearing on whether a person becomes involved in the commission of such a political crime.</P>
    <P>I am not opposing this section but, if nothing else, I feel we should be seen to be doing something in relation to that type of crime.  I am not at all convinced that the replacement of a seven year sentence by a 14 year one, ten years for five years or life instead of 14 years will act as a deterrent.  Take the example of a person who faces a maximum sentence of 14 years for a given crime &mdash; and the possibility under the provisions of this section if passed will be that they would face a penalty of up to 20 years &mdash; it will make practically no difference whatsoever to such a person because he or she will feel, on the balance of probability, that they will get away with it or that the crime they intend committing will be so beneficial to them or to the cause they wish to serve that it will be worth spending 14 years in jail.  Whether the sentence be 14 years or 20 years will not make much difference to such a person.  I do see the need for us to do something but I do not feel that will meet the need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the possibility of introducing minimum mandatory sentences, I would emphasise that that is a course that should be adopted with caution and should be confined to a very specialised category of serious offence. I believe that certainly the more serious crimes involving the use of firearms would come into that category, for example, possessing firearms or ammunition with intent to endanger life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly made the point that he thought that such an imposition might be counter-productive because it might have an effect on the minds of a judge or jury &mdash; the fact that if there was to be a mandatory sentence they might thereby be <Col N="884" /> concerned about convicting such a person. Perhaps Deputy Kelly is being somewhat oversuspicious or overcritical of how our judges and juries react.  I believe that they set about their tasks in our courts with objectivity within the parameters laid down for them, that by and large they reach their decision in a proper manner and that it is not a question of having any interest in increasing the rate of conviction.  We are not interested in increasing the rate of conviction unless a conviction is properly warranted. Though they be aware that there will be a mandatory prison sentence in the event of conviction, and they bear that in mind, if they have a doubt as to the person's guilt, then I contend it is better that they acquit the person.  The person should be convicted only if their guilt is quite clear, sentence apart, beyond a reasonable doubt, as the law requires.  If they have a reasonable doubt then I would contend it is better that they be acquitted.  That line of argument is not of great substance. If there is a wish to introduce an effective deterrent, one that would have any meaning at all for this category of offence, then if it is to be achieved it will be done through the method of a minimum sentence rather than increasing the maximum sentences.</P>
    <P>As I said in my initial contribution, this provision here will not affect two vital criteria, first, the operation of a deterrent or, second, the actual level of sentencing imposed in practice by the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I might make a few brief comments on some points raised.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods read out a definition of a firearm which is not correct.  The definition he read out applies to a prohibited weapon and not to a firearm, as defined, and to which the provisions of these sections would apply.  Therefore things like mechanisms for the emissions of gas, air guns and so on would not apply here. It would apply strictly to lethal weapons which had the capacity to fire a bullet or shot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not quite understand Deputy Woods' point because for half of his intervention he was asking me for guarantees <Col N="885" /> that a maximum life sentence was not to be interpreted as a mandatory life sentence, that a judge would have discretion not alone to impose a prison sentence of something like 20 to 25 years but also that he could examine cases on their merits and if the merits of a case indicated that a less severe sentence should be imposed then a judge should be free to do so.  He talked in terms of our having a sliding scale, that there should be no question of life sentences being imposed automatically.  He talked, I thought, in terms of approval of a situation in which an old man who had been encouraged forcibly to conceal weapons in a haybarn had been dealt with generously.  He seemed to approve of that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods mentioned another case also, of which I am not aware, in which he said there had been a suspended sentence imposed and he seemed to approve of that as well.  Then suddenly, with one great leap, he was on the other side of the argument, arguing for mandatory, minimum sentences.  Therefore I am not sure which position he has taken up on it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not clear whether the Deputy wants to allow discretion to the Judiciary to sentence a person to a suspended sentence or to impose any level of imprisonment which they think would be appropriate for the crime or whether he now wants mandatory minimum sentences.  I am not sure <Col N="886" /> which side of the argument he favours at this stage.  Deputy Taylor argued for mandatory sentences and stated that the sentence imposed was nearly always below the maxima provided.  I suppose that is logical.  One provides the maximum sentence to fit the most extreme case and, since almost all cases are not the most extreme cases, it is only logical that sentences imposed will be less than the maxima provided.  Deputy Kelly also dealt with mandatory sentences.  I share his views.  I am opposed to mandatory minimum sentences for the reasons Deputy Kelly outlined.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa dealt with the number of offences in the 1982 crime report relating to these provisions.  I am not sure that the figures quoted give the full picture. In the case of armed robbery and aggravated burglary the maximum sentence already is a life sentence.  It seems to be the practice to charge a person with armed robbery, which carries a maximum life sentence, and not continue to charge that person with specific offences under the Firearms Act unless there is a doubt about not getting a conviction in what would be considered the major offence. Since the sentence for armed robbery and aggravated burglary are already at the maximum there was no initiative I could take there and I concentrated on the specific firearms offences which are now being brought up to the same level.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The statistics which will be issued shortly will show a reduction.  I am not making a case about that and I would like to see the trend continuing for a longer period.  The next section we will be discussing will be a far more effective one to bring about a downturn in the incidents of the use of guns, terrorist crimes and ordinary crimes.  One of the things that weighed on the Government in considering this was the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act. Firearms penalties in that Act were changed in 1976 to bring them into line <Col N="887" /> with the penalties imposed in Northern Ireland.  We are talking about those penalties again in section 13.</P>
      <P>Under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act the accused person has the right to opt for the jurisdiction where he desires to be tried.  Since 1976 the sentences in Northern Ireland have been increased and that was a consideration here.  The new maxima I am proposing here will bring our penalties into line with the position in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with the general points made by Deputies.  Obviously, it is a very serious situation and we should do what we can.  I believe the Judiciary would take into account the intent of the Legislature and if we indicate by raising the maxima that we feel that more severe sentences should be imposed I believe the Judiciary will act accordingly and impose more severe sentences.  We should legislate but should not attempt to tie the hands of the Judiciary.  A movement towards mandatory sentences would tie their hands.  I am aware that in drug-related offences in particular there has been quite an amount of adverse comment about the low level of sentences imposed in a number of high profile cases.  I do not think there is the same level of concern about the adequacy, or inadequacy, of the sentences being imposed for firearms offences.  However, I believe that, as a minimum, we should indicate how seriously we consider these offences and indicate to the Judiciary that more severe sentences might be appropriate in specific cases, after they have considered the merits of those cases.</P>

      <P>The 1925 Act provided a sentence of 20 years while the 1976 Act specified 14 years but now we are changeing that to a life sentence.  My questions related to the reason for changing the sentence to one of life in practical terms. The Minister has explained that in his view life can be taken as any number of years up to life.  He has told us that it can mean 20 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In his explanation the Minister said that life can mean any number of years which can mean 20 years or life. In practice a life sentence will mean a sentence of eight or ten years and that is what we have to fix.  We asked the Minister to give statistics on what is happening to the House but he has not done so. Deputy De Rossa had to dig out statistics on the number of people convicted and I wonder why the Minister does not tell the House the type of sentences they are getting.  The Minister was happy to give the House information about bail because it supported his case.  We are all in agreement with the Minister but we are questioning the practicality of what the Minister intends and how it will work in practice.  The Minister has referred to the sliding scale and on the basis he has put the matter a judge will be in a position to take a sliding scale.  In effect, there will be a scale to deal with any circumstances. Since that is the case we will be back to where we were in the first instance.  Up <Col N="889" /> to now a person could be sentenced for up to 14 years and the change proposes a life sentence which means, in effect, that there will not be any great change in practice unless judges adopt the attitude that because the term was changed from 14 years to life they will have to look at a life sentence in a different way and apply 20 years.</P>
      <P>I introduced the question of mandatory sentences as another aspect that has not been covered in the Bill.  Deputy Kelly apparently does not like to hear about the Americans, their statistics or legal system but that is irrelevant.  I appreciate that circumstances there are different but we should take cognisance of the fact that the introduction of mandatory minimum sentences had a dramatic affect in a number of States.  If that is the case it is worth investigating.  It is also worth looking at other countries who adopted a similar procedure.  Deputy Taylor adopted a similar view.  I am not recommending that the Minister should go for mandatory minimum sentences but I am suggesting to him that it may be one of the measures we will have to consider seriously if we are concerned about a deterrent.  We do not have any information whether a mandatory sentence will represent a deterrent.</P>
      <P>People in the House confuse what I say.  Deputy Taylor picked it up quite clearly.  The Minister was not prepared to follow the reasoning that I pursued; neither was Deputy Kelly.  I said that they should be related to specific crimes which have been committed and that we should examine this area.  Now the Minister has said that he is opposed to mandatory minimum sentences in any event.  If that is the position and he is not open to considering them, that closes that argument as far as the House is concerned. However, it allows Members of the House to make the point in relation to this area that there may be a mechanism which we are not using.  The mechanism may be mandatory minimum sentences for selected crimes or offences under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 13 (5) we find that for carrying a firearm with criminal intent <Col N="890" /> the sentence is altered from ten years to 14 years.  That gives a very direct message to anyone who carries a firearm with criminal intent.  The sentence for carrying a firearm or ammunition in suspicious circumstances is being increased from five to ten years.  That also very clearly indicates the intention of the section.  For possessing a firearm or ammunition with intent to endanger life the sentence is going from 14 years to life imprisonment which in practice probably means going downwards rather than upwards.  In practice the outcome of what we are doing may be that carrying a firearm with criminal intent will incur a more severe sentence in practice than the life sentence. That is the only concern I have about the area.  We support the increased sentences. I still would like to hear from the Minister what the statistics are in relation to the sentences under 14 years at present passed.  What happens in the 14 years? Surely the Minister has these statistics available to him.  Why does he not make them available to the House so that we can see what is happening in practice? Then we would be in a better position to judge what we are doing here.</P>

      <P>In the discussion of this section and the increases in sentencing the effectiveness of the section has come under question.  We are into the numbers game again.  Without the back-up of statistics on the increase in sentencing the case is not proved.  I accept that it is desirable from the point of view of the public that we should be seen to be doing something to tackle this phenomenon of firearms-related crimes, but we should do it properly.  I find nothing untoward about the contributions people have made to the debate on this section.  This is another example of discovering during the course of a Bill why sections are put in and changes made.  Our request for statistics was resisted very testily yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the sentences may not have the effect that we think it will have. I have two questions in that area.  Will it affect the level of sentencing pertaining at the moment?  Will it affect the criminal in his intention to commit crime?  I support <Col N="891" /> Deputy Taylor's submission when I say that I do not think that either of those two situations will be affected, but I agree with the Minister that sentencing should not be mandatory.  If and when the level of armed crime drops it will be important and more than useful to have non-mandatory senteces.  We hope to return to a situation where the only time a full term would be imposed would be to make an example of a case.  If we reach a low level of crime and then matters start to get out of hand again and somebody does something drastic, the judge has the discretion to impose the maximum sentence.  For that reason this approach is right although I do not think it will have any real effect because with the change from 14 years to life and so on we are merely playing around with figures.  I disagree also with mandatory minimum sentences. We should not rule out the very important discretion that the judge has in certain circumstances.  We are legislating here; we are not present in court and cannot go into the details of each case. That is why we appoint judges, and they should be totally independent.  We should give them the greatest possible latitude, and the section achieves that.  I do not find any flaw in the section merely because the lengths of sentences have been changed.  It will make no great difference. As Deputy Kelly said, if you have mandatory minimum sentences shades of guilt are not recognised.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the US and how the criminal law applies there and the effect of the sentencing.  In passing let me mention Canada where little, if any, subversive activity occurs and access to firearms is nothing like it is in the US. Canada has a population of approximately 25 million and about 600 homicides per year, most of them the result of or allied to family squabbles and interrelationships. Whereas they have about 5,000 road accidents due to drunken driving. In those circumstances and considering the tortuous nature of some cases, the retention of the freedom of the judges there to act in a maximum sentencing situation is very important.</P>
    <P>Apart from those few points, without <Col N="892" /> statistics to back up this section I cannot see merit in making the changes at all, but I have no objection to the section because the discretion is still with the judges to impose whatever sentence they think fits a case and the likelihood of justice being meted out is the greater for that.</P>

Statistics on the incidence of crime are available in the published crime reports referred to by Deputy De Rossa.  I have not got statistics on the level of sentences but if I can get them I will give them to Deputy Woods. Of course there are other ways to get information.  There is the parliamentary question for written reply.  I do not think there are any other new points which I have not dealt with.  I think the section will be effective.  There will be great benefit from lining it up with the Northern Ireland situation.  It is up to the Judiciary to interpret the legislation and impose longer sentences as they see fit, and if they impose longer sentences it will have a deterrent effect.  Other points made are matters of opinion on either side, and Deputies are entitled to their opinions.</P>

Section 26 of the 1964 Act provides that a person who contravenes subsection (1) of section 112 of the 1961 Road Traffic Act and who, at the time of such contravention, has with him a firearm or an imitation firearm shall be guilty of an offence.  It is worth bearing in mind that an imitation firearm is included.  Because the sentence is being doubled, those involved should be made aware that this includes an imitation firearm.</P>
      <P>The section has been well discussed. We put down two amendments to convenience the House in having the section debated fully.  We appreciate what the Minister intends to do.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The section makes it an offence to withhold information about the source of supply of illegally held firearms or ammunition. The principal object of the section is to discourage the use of firearms by criminals and to trace the suppliers of guns for particular crimes.  Many of the points made on the previous section are relevant here.  We all object to the use of firearms in crime of any sort and we are all worried about the increasing incidence of their use and how they have become almost part of life in many parts of the country and in Dublin.  We heard Deputies speak about how easy it is to obtain guns, to hire or to purchase them, and how frequently guns are used not alone in terrorist crimes but in the commission of ordinary crimes.  We have had statistics on firearms offences, on aggravated burglaries and armed robberies.  We all know from contact with constituents and from reading the newspapers or watching the television, that gun-related offences have reached a level which is intolerable and which the Government must do something about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems is to trace the source of these weapons.  If we could cut off supplies, or attempt to do so, we would be working effectively towards reducing the use of firearms by criminals. Under subsection (1) a number of conditions must be satisfied.  A garda must find a person in possession of a firearm or ammunition.  He must have reasonable grounds for believing that the firearm or ammunition is illegally held; he must <Col N="895" /> inform the person of his belief and require the person to give him information as to how he came into possession of the firearm.  Under subsection (2) it will be an offence to fail or to refuse, without reasonable excuse, to give required information, or to give false or misleading information, such offence to be punishable with up to five years imprisonment on conviction or indictment.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that a person must be told in ordinary language what the effect of failure or refusal might be. In the absence of such a caution, the section does not take effect.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that any information given by a person under the section will not be used against him or against his spouse except in proceedings relating to an offence under the section, that would be giving false or misleading information.  The need for the section is fairly obvious.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically we welcome the principle and the intent of the section.  It deals with withholding information in regard to firearms or ammunition.  It is only the information that an informant will give that can not be used in evidence against him.  The fact of his having a gun in his possession can still be used in evidence against him.  One aspect of the section that is disturbing is that under subsection (4) a husband is being required under penalty of jail to inform on his wife.  There is a similar type of provision in subsection (4) of section 15.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) of section 14 provides that:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  finds a person in possession of any firearm or ammunition,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is in possession <Col N="896" /> of the firearm or ammunition in contravention of the criminal law, and</P>
    <P>(c)  informs that person of his belief,</P>
    <P>he may require that person to give him any information which is in his possession, or which he can obtain by taking reasonable steps, as to how he came by the firearm or ammunition and as to any previous dealings with it, whether by himself or by any other person.</P>
    <P>The purpose of subsection (4) is to ensure that if and when a person gives such information against his spouse, the information will not be admissible in evidence against the spouse in any subsequent proceedings.  There seems to be the specific requirement in regard to a spouse giving information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> He would be required to give information but not against his spouse.  A spouse is not a compellable witness.  Subsection (4) provides that information given by a person in compliance with a requirement under subsection (1) shall not be admissible in evidence against that person or his spouse in any proceedings other than proceedings for an offence under subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appreciated that the common law and the Statute law is that a person cannot be called on to give evidence against his or her spouse except where the offence might be committed by one against the other, but now by reason of this legislation will it not be the case that one can be compelled to inform regardless of whether the information relates to a spouse or any other person? Is that not the reason for the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; being mentioned specifically in subsection (4)?  Will it not be the position that although the information cannot be used in evidence it can be used to find evidence?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes.  The intent of the section is to get information as to the source of firearms.  It will compel <Col N="897" /> a person to give information <i>simpliciter,</i> to give an account of where they got the firearms.  That would extend to a spouse, but the information could not be used subsequently to proceed against the person or the spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the clarification but in effect a husband will be required under penalty of jail to inform on his wife.  The information may not be used subsequently as evidence in court but the compulsion and the offence will still apply.  That provision will apply both to firearms under this section and to larceny under section 15.  If, for instance, a wife steals butter and her husband becomes aware of the fact, he will be compelled to inform on her.  In that sense this represents a new development.  I accept what the Minister says about a spouse not being called on to give evidence but we are providing here that spouses can be called upon to inform on each other.  This is a development that would seem to undermine the traditional regard the law has had for the traditional privacy and the general bond between husband and wife.  We could expect difficulty in implementing that provision in practice.  In that sense it is very unhappy development.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to confirm that this is the case in relation to getting information and to the offence that is created in that situation.  That would be bad law.  It is probably an unprecedented intrusion by the State into the marriage situation. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about that.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Under the terms of subsection (1), a garda must find a person in possession of firearms or ammunition and must then have reasonable grounds for believing that the firearms or ammunition are held illegally. He must inform the person of his belief and then require that person to give information as to how he came by the firearms.  That requirement arises only when the first three requirements are fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person is found in possession of a gun there will be an obligation on him to <Col N="898" /> give an account of where he obtained that gun.  On the question of whether, under subsection (2), it is an offence to fail or to refuse without reasonable excuse to give information, I could envisage a situation in which a court might decide that it was a reasonable excuse not to give information which would implicate a wife or husband as the case may be.  In any case the information would not be admissible in evidence in any proceedings against the spouse concerned.  I do not see the difficulty or the intrusion the Deputy speaks of.  I would not like the provision to be part of general practice in law but we are talking specifically about firearms or, as in the next section, of the fencing or receiving of stolen goods. These are special cases that we should try to deal with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are creating a penalty if a person fails or refuses, without reasonable excuse, to give the information or gives information that he knows to be false or misleading.  The subsection states:</P>
      <P>... he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £800 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or to both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both.</P>

    <P>3.  The estimated cost of collection is as included in the relevant county council's estimates for 1983 and includes costs associated with the administration of the grants in lieu of rates (the grants amounted to £277.5 million in 1983).</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the estimated population of the new town of Tallaght, County Dublin; if he will agree that urban status is now urgently appropriate for Tallaght; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Tallaght does not at present constitute an identifiable unit for census purposes and an exact population figure is not available.  Other indicators would, however, suggest that the population in the general area may now be in the region of 60,000.</P>
      <P>I have received an application for town commission status for Tallaght from a group of residents under the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854.  The application is being considered in accordance with the statutory procedure laid down for this purpose.  An examination of local government structures generally is being carried out in my Department at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that Tallaght is a scheduled town under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, that it is an identifiable urban area and that as a town with its own town centre and densely populated area, it requires its own planning authority and its own urban authority if its needs as a town are to be adequately catered for, and that its present situation is unsatisfactory and inadequate coming under the aegis of Dublin County Council, an authority which goes as far as Balbriggan, which is many miles away, an area with completely different local needs?  Would the Minister make arrangements to deal with the application for town commission status in the first instance and take a favourable look at the necessity for legislation for urban status for Tallaght?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, when one has an identifiable town such as Tallaght with a high population &mdash; I think the figure is considerably higher than 60,000 &mdash; it would be good practice from a local government and local authority environmental point of view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister if he would agree that it would be good practice from a local government point of view that such a cohesive unit should be in charge of its own affairs locally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>With a population of that size, obviously this area should have its own local authority.  That is why we want to undertake this review as quickly as possible rather than in a piecemeal fashion.  In that context we have Clondalkin, Blanchardstown and a number of new areas which have to be looked at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if financial provision has been made in 1984 to enable local authorities to undertake a programme of dog control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1984 a provision of £89,000 has been made for the scheme of grants under which my Department recoup 50 per cent of the expenditure of planning authorities on approved projects for the provision of dog shelters, or in assisting others in their provision and operation.  The scheme is intended to <Col N="909" /> encourage planning authorities to avail of their discretionary statutory powers under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976, to provide such facilities.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have no powers to control dogs, the existing powers in this regard being vested in the Garda.  An interdepartmental committee was set up by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, to look into the stray dogs problem and to make recommendations on any new legislation required, the financial and personnel resources necessary for implementation of a dog control scheme, and the method of funding.  This committee presented their report recently and the action to be taken on their recommendations is now being considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that in Dublin county it is practically impossible to rear sheep any more. Unfortunately sheep rearing is a thing of the past even in the Dublin mountains because stray dogs make their way out there from the Dublin sprawl.  The Minister will also be aware of the need for urgent action in the area of dog control. When does the Minister anticipate that action will be taken in the light of this report?  Will it be in time for next year's lambing season?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will.  Deputy Power put down this question and we asked the IFA to make some contribution towards the running and operation of this scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 7 to 11, inclusive together.</P>
      <P>The Government decided when settling the Estimates for 1984 to make a sum of £5.6 million available for environment improvement works.  This sum was sufficient to meet commitments on special projects approved in 1983 and to make a special grant of £1.6 million to Dublin Corporation towards the labour costs arising from the retention by the corporation of workers who had been employed on a temporary basis on environmental works.</P>
      <P>This grant was designed to facilitate the phased transfer of the workers to other areas of the corporation in assuming full responsibility for the costs involved.  It has been made clear to the corporation on a number of occasions during the past year that my Department could not be expected to finance, indefinitely, the retention by one local authority of workers who had been engaged on a temporary basis and that appropriate provision should be made by the corporation to regularise the situation.  The special grant of £1.6 million already allocated to the corporation is the full amount available in my Department's Vote for environment works schemes and there are no further funds available to me for allocation to Dublin Corporation.  I am concerned that every effort should be made to resolve the problem of the workers' future as smoothly as possible and I have conveyed this concern to the corporation in whose hands responsibility now lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision made in 1984 for special projects relates only to those projects approved in 1983 under the Environment Works (Special Projects) Scheme.  Laois County Council did not submit any projects last year for consideration under this scheme and accordingly I cannot <Col N="912" /> make an allocation to the council this year.</P>
    <P>The total amount provided by Government this year in the Labour Vote for the training and employment of young persons amounts to £84 million, compared with an expenditure of about £75.8 million last year and, while the environment improvement scheme has been discontinued, local authorities may participate in other youth employment schemes, details of which were sent to them on 4 April 1984.</P>

Does the Minister accept the responsibility, as the scheme was set up by the <Col N="913" /> Government, of ensuring that the men are not put on the dole queue this year? There are more than 250 jobs at stake and this is a very important issue.  That is why I was trying to explain the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government saw that they had a responsibility because they allocated £1.6 million this year. They originated a temporary environment employment scheme, with the emphasis on temporary.  This scheme has been discontinued by other local authorities but continued by Dublin Corporation. To allow an orderly assimilation of workers into the workforce, this £1.6 million was made available.  Taking into account that in any organisation as large as Dublin Corporation there would be wastage, with the wastage and people taken on and the retaining of people we felt that that sum would be a help.  The responsibility, of course, rests with the local authorities, as they are the employers.</P>

Over the last few years some of the best buildings in the country have been demolished to make room for grant-aided buildings by various Departments, for instance, in my own county by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Department of Education.

As the Deputy is probably aware, we encourage local authorities to maximise the use of older buildings or encourage within their own communities and local authority areas the protection of such buildings.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 4(1) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, which came into operation on 20 March 1984 it is the general duty of An Bord Pleanála to secure that planning appeals are dealt with as quickly as possible.  To this end, the board are required to carry out reviews of their organisation and of their systems and procedures and I am empowered to direct that such reviews be carried out.  Where such a direction is given, I may, after consultation with the board as to the results of the review, give directives to the board in relation to the matters which were the subject of the review.</P>
      <P>In an address to the board on 20 March 1984 the Minister asked that a determined effort be made to eliminate the backlog of appeals as quickly as possible so that all appeals are dealt with within a reasonable period.  He also asked the board to consider whether it might be possible, at a later stage, to set targets involving the disposal of all, or particular categories of appeals within set periods. I am satisfied that the board will consider these matters fully and that, in doing so, they can also be expected to consider the matter referred to in the question.  In these circumstances, I do not propose at this stage to intervene formally under section 4 of the 1983 Act.</P>

It is all right to say X or Y should get priority, but these things should be taken in order.  The important thing is to dispose of the backlog.  The Minister indicated that to the board.  The board have been in operation since March only and after about six months we will see how they are operating.  I believe they will operate to meet the needs the Deputy is talking about.  I am anxious to ensure that large applications will not be held up.  I do not want to state that only large applications should get priority and small ones should not.  That would be unfair.  I take the point.  It is important that appeals should not be held up for longer than is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of lead in petrol to be sold at a proposed petrol filling station would not be a consideration which could properly be taken into account in dealing with a planning application. In addition, the 1978 EEC directive on the lead content of petrol prohibits member states from establishing lead in petrol levels lower than 0.15 grammes per litre.</P>
      <P>The European Communities (Lead Content of Petrol) (Amendment) Regulations, 1982, provide for a maximum permissible lead level in petrol marketed in this country of 0.40 grammes per litre, bringing us into line with EEC requirements.  The extent to which lead levels in petrol can be further reduced or totally eliminated in Ireland depends mainly on action taken at international level.</P>
      <P>In June 1983 the Council of Ministers (Environment) of the European Communities discussed the matter and indicated its willingness to try to reduce, as much as possible, the level of lead in petrol ending up, perhaps, with the use of leadless petrol.  Since then, the Commission, together with a panel of experts, have completed a study of the matter and are due to put forward proposals resulting from that study in the near future.</P>

Would he agree that the question of putting a planning condition for new petrol stations would be appropriate having regard to the fact that the criterion is the proper planning, development and environment of the area? Surely a lead free environment is something which he as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment would have very close to his heart?</P>

We are making progress at the Council of Ministers.  We will be having meetings in June, and further meetings when we have the Presidency.  I am optimistic about the matter.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. Firstly, I should explain that since the sixties, rules of conduct for local authority officers have contained a provision that wholetime professional officers shall not engage in private practice in their respective or related professions.  A similar provision was also embodied in the 1978 Engineers Working Party Report which was implemented by a conciliation agreement in April 1979.  Non-engagement in private practice work is no more than a minimum requirement for officers who are required by virtue of their conditions of service to devote the whole of their time to the service of their employing local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> In practice, the nature of local authority work is such that there is bound, in most cases, to be a conflict of interest in engaging in private practice.  To put the matter on a formal basis I have recently made the Local Government (Officers) Regulations, 1984, which prohibit wholetime local authority professional officers from engaging in private practice.  Copies of the regulations were circulated to all local authorities and the staff interests concerned.</P>
    <P>It cannot be accepted that these necessary restrictions will have the effects mentioned in the question.  They will, if anything, help to reduce the &ldquo;black economy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that there is considerable unemployment at present amongst engineers in the private sector and the non-engagement of full-time officers in private works should leave more opportunities for employment available to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment of local housing needs is a function of individual housing authorities.  The most recent assessments carried out by the authorities, including Dublin County Council, were in respect of the five-year period to 31 March 1985 and no formal assessments covering the period beyond that date are available at present.  As regards the final part of the question, the position is that the level of housing output in any area is determined by a wide range of economic, social and demographic factors, the relative impact of which may vary from area to area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances, it would not be <Col N="928" /> appropriate for me to speculate as to how the level of output in a particular area might compare in the future with the level of needs arising.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 22, 23 and 24 together.  Examination of local government reform is proceeding in accordance with the commitment in the <i>Programme <Col N="932" /> for Government 1981-86</i> and the statement made in December 1983 announcing the intended postponement of the local elections for a year to facilitate the process.  Reform in Dublin is particularly important and raises particularly complex issues.  The various options that have been put forward over the years have to be assessed in all their implications and this is going on together with consultations with the associations representing the members of local authorities.</P>
      <P>As is made clear in the report referred to by Deputy Molloy, decisions have not yet been taken by the Government.  It is not possible, therefore, to make a more definitive statement at this stage regarding the proposals on the form of publication. It remains the aim of the Government in relation to the review that everything possible will be done to bring matters to a conclusion in the time allowed by the postponement of the local elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is related to section 15.  Under this section a husband will be required, under penalty in the inform on his wife.  The penalty in the section is five years, which clears the way for section 3, which is arrest on suspicion. Presumably if the husband tells the Garda about his wife they then have a reasonable basis for suspicion and can detain the wife under section 3.  We have to be careful of the inter-relationship of these sections as new powers and situations will arise.  I consider the effect of this section to be most undesirable.  At first the Minister did not seem to think that this would be the case but then he confirmed that it is so only in relation to information and that failure to supply information is an offence.  This is a new offence.</P>
      <P>The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors are not clear on how this section will work and what will be required.  In their statement they say that sections 14(1) and 15(1) need to be clarified to determine precisely what information a person is required to give. Sections 14(4) and 15(4) need to be clarified to determine what information, if any, can subsequently be used against that person.  There seems to be a considerable amount of confusion about the effect and impact of the section and how it will be applied in practice.  While we support the Minister in his intentions and the principle of the section, the ramifications need to be teased out to ensure that undesirable changes do not take place.  Perhaps those changes are there because the Minister wants this information, even if a husband has to inform on his wife, and that he does not regard that as a major change in the relationship between a husband and wife.  I have pointed out that it is a new development and the common and statute law is that a spouse cannot be called to give evidence against his or her spouse except where the offence is against the wife.  The fact that they can now inform on one another is a major development in relation to the marital relationship.  I should like the Minister to consider what the implications of that will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criminal lawyers are also concerned <Col N="970" /> about this section.  They have said that this section, along with sections 15, 16, 17 and 18, provide for a situation in which it is made compulsory for a citizen to speak to the police.  This is a change and the question that must concern us is how we go about this change.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that where a garda finds a person in possession of a firearm or ammunition, has a reasonable ground for believing him to be unlawfully possessed thereof and tells him so, he may require that person to give him information in his possession, or information which he can by reasonable steps obtain, as to how he came by the firearm or ammunition.  If he fails or refuses to give such information or gives information which he knows to be false or misleading he will be guilty of the offence which carries on conviction on indictment a sentence of five years' imprisonment or a fine of £10,000 or both.  We know that the information will not be admissible either in civil or criminal proceedings but it raises the question of what sort of reasonable steps one must be prepared to take.  The same arises in relation to section 15 where a person is found in possession of property which is believed to be part of the proceeds of a number of listed crimes.  The garda may require such a person to give an account of how he came by it.  It is the same principle in both cases.  A failure or refusal to comply, without reasonable excuse, or the giving of information known to be false or misleading, is an offence and such information cannot be used against the informant or a spouse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 14 and 15 are extensions of the power to compel citizens to speak.  It is claimed that failure to <Col N="971" /> speak will or may result in criminal prosecution of the person in question.  Therefore it is of the utmost value to the person questioned to give information, perhaps any information based on rumour, speculation, whims or grudges, to be seen to be co-operating with the Garda.  This not only relieves such persons of the threat of prosecution for failing or refusing to furnish information but may well leave innocent persons open to Garda suspicion and prosecution based on information passed by the informant which is not necessarily true.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a complication in that there are two amendments to section 15.  Amendments Nos. 25 and 45 are related and should be taken together.  I take it that we are discussing together, by agreement, section 14, section 15, amendment No. 35 and amendment No. 45.  Amendment No. 34 has already been discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I hope the Chair recognises how helpful we are being to the Chair and the Minister.  Innocent persons may be left open to Garda suspicion. Presumably the Garda would have reasonable grounds for pursuing a person under section 3 because the offence carries a penalty of five years' imprisonment. Presumably there would also be grounds for detention under section 3.  The fact that such information is supplied in this fashion and may be used in a prosecution against another party raises the issue of its reliability.  It is a rule of law that if the sole or substantial evidence against the accused is the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice then a jury in a criminal trial ought to be warned of the danger of convicting an accused on such information. These sections not only seem to compel the giving of the type of information which often emanates from an accomplice but provide the additional enticement to implicate another by offering immunity from prosecution in respect of whatever matter is divulged in such information.  No matter how great the person's part in such offence or how serious the crime which may have been <Col N="972" /> committed, the effect of the sections is to compel a person to make statements under pain of prosecution in circumstances where the person may have an interest in implicating an innocent party, either from simple malice towards him or in preference to revealing the name of the true culprit.  A culprit might be in a position to extract revenge for any co-operation with the police against him.  In addition, such information may well be that of an accomplice and may be used in a later prosecution against the person in respect of whom the information was given.</P>
      <P>The discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions to grant immunity from suit is taken away.  This is the view expressed by the Association of Criminal Lawyers. Such immunity is conferred on all accused of whom request is made under sections 14 and 15 and who have given information concerning materials in their possession.  This would be in contrast to what the Judiciary have stated concerning the granting of immunity from prosecution, that it should be granted by the DPP and never by police officers without reference to the law officer of the State. The section would appear to grant to the Garda direct the ability to grant immunity whereas the traditional position has been that it should be granted by the DPP and never by the police without reference to the law officer of the State.  The immunity conferred by subsection (4) would also appear to mean that a full confession volunteered in an unobjectionable manner in answer to a requisition might be excluded from evidence and leave the police with no other resource.  This appears to reflect the way in which the Bill was drafted and the lack of attention to its practical effect.</P>

    <P>The view of the Association of Criminal Lawyers is that the effects of sections 14 and 15 would be to compel persons questioned to speak under threat of prosecution and to confer immunity from prosecution on such persons when they speak.  This contains the risk that the persons may seek to minimise their involvement in the series of events under investigation by implicating others from impure motives.  The immunity is conferred <Col N="973" /> by a police officer requesting information of the informant.  This is a complete departure from the exercise of the power to confer immunity by the DPP, which is very selective and rarely used.  On the grounds of these comments, the association were opposed to the sections and were very concerned about the effects.  They said that the sections are opposed on the serious ground that both sections grant immunity to a person in possession of firearms or stolen property in so far as statements of his are not admissible against him.  Because of this section an accessory to an offence merely by giving information may become virtually immune from prosecution.  The evidence given by such a person must be suspect as it will be the result of an award held out.  It has a striking resemblance to granting immunity from prosecution to a witness in exchange for incriminating evidence against third parties.  The President of the Law Society has said that it is an attempt to compulsorily require members of the public to co-operate with the police.  In his address to a seminar held by the Incorporated Law Society he says it is his belief that the possibility of persons pleading guilty to offences that have never been committed cannot be ruled out.  They also have reservations about the constitutionality of the sections, particularly in relation to Articles 38 and 40 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Garda on the one hand have reservations about how these sections will operate, particularly in regard to section 14 (4) which says:</P>
    <P>Any information given by a person in compliance with a requirement under subsection (1) shall not be admissible in evidence against that person or his spouse in any proceedings, civil or criminal, other than proceedings for an offence under subsection (2).</P>
    <P>The same applies to section 15 (4) which says:</P>
    <P>Any information given by a person in compliance with a requirement under subsection (1) shall not be admissible in evidence against that person <Col N="974" /> or his spouse in any proceedings, civil or criminal, other than proceedings for an offence under subsection (2).</P>
    <P>They do not appear to be clear as to what information would be involved in that case.  Might I ask the Minister, in relation to section 14 (1), if he can say whether it is intended that the phrase &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; should be interpreted subjectively or objectively.  If the Minister says it is to be subjective, how is it to be done?  The section creates an entirely new offence. How will the courts know what criteria should be applied in determining whether an accused person has taken &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; as to any previous dealings with the firearm or ammunition?  For example, 14 (1) says:</P>
    <P>...he may require that person to give him any information which is in his possession, or which he can obtain by taking reasonable steps,......</P>
    <P>What &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; is he supposed to take?  How far is he supposed to go in taking any reasonable steps?  Will he be exposed to prosecution under the provisions of the section if he fails to take every reasonable step to trace back every dealing with the firearm or ammunition, and for what length of time?  For example, is the person concerned expected to carry out his own private investigation, to follow up and investigate every piece of information he obtains with a view to detecting all the previous dealings in relation to the firearm or ammunition, or all the recent previous dealings, or what dealings?  For instance, there could be a situation in which a wife's brother stayed in the house and left a gun or ammunition there.  If there is a limit to the time within which a person is obliged to carry out the investigation then that would be different, but as it stands there does not appear to be any limit.  The provisions appear to be wide open as to what reasonable steps he is supposed to take and indeed in relation to any previous dealings with them.  It involves not merely taking reasonable steps as to how he came by the firearm or ammunition but also as to any previous dealings with them.  That <Col N="975" /> part of the subsection is very loosely worded.</P>
    <P>Again, on the question of any previous dealing, how will the Director of Public Prosecutions in the first instance, and ultimately the courts, know what criteria to apply in determining whether a person is guilty or innocent of an offence under the provisions of the section &mdash; for example, in not having taken sufficient reasonable steps or whatever level of steps should be taken?  What criteria can the prosecuting authority or the courts apply to determine what would constitute reasonable steps in obtaining such information?</P>
    <P>The requirement in section 16 that the person concerned should give information which is in his possession or which he can obtain by taking reasonable steps as to how he came by the firearm or ammunition or indeed by goods is relatively straightforward in itself because the information is required in respect of one transaction only and is therefore self-limiting.  The term &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; does give rise to difficulty.  For example, what is to happen in the case of a person who genuinely fears retaliation against him or members of his family if he is found to be seeking information as to how he came by the firearm?  What will be the position of a person who genuinely fears retaliation in such circumstances even though such fears might prove to be groundless?  In one instance they might be well founded and in another groundless. This raises the question of whether the phrase &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; is to be subjected to a subjective or objective test.  The same considerations would appear to apply to the term &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo;.  What criteria are to be applied by the prosecuting authority or the courts in determining what constitutes a reasonable excuse in the context of this section? I should like clarification from the Minister and, if he considers it necessary, clarification of the subsections.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 15 a person is required only to give an account of how he came by the property in question and is not required to give information about any previous dealings in the <Col N="976" /> property in contrast to the provisions of the previous section.  Under the provisions of section 15 a person is required only to say how he came by the property in question; he is not being required to go back on previous dealings in the property. Therefore, there is a distinction being drawn here between the two sections, the one in relation to firearms or ammunition, where a person is obliged to go back into the previous dealings in relation to the firearm, ammunition or whatever, whereas in the second case the information regarding stolen property does not specify the same requirement. Section 15 (1) says:</P>
    <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence consisting of the stealing, fraudulent conversion, embezzlement or unlawful obtaining or receiving of money or other property has been committed,</P>
    <P>(b)  finds any person in possession of any property,</P>
    <P>(c)  has reasonable grounds for believing that the property referred to in paragraph (b) includes, or may include, the property referred to in paragraph (a) or part of it, or the whole or any part of the proceeds (direct or indirect) of that property or part, and</P>
    <P>(d)  informs that person of his belief,</P>
    <P>he may require that person to give him an account of how he came by the property.</P>
    <P>Regarding stolen property the sentence, of course, is five years and the same questions would arise in relation to the husband and wife, the husband informing on the wife or the wife informing on the husband. It also carries a sentence of five years and so, presumably, it will come under section 3.  Therefore, it will bring the withholding of information regarding stolen property under the detention powers of section 3 and the interrogation for the six, 12 or 20 hours as the case may be.  That could be abused by people who <Col N="977" /> may innocently think that a person has some knowledge.</P>
    <P>I have had a spate of such occurrences recently in my constituency where people believed that other citizens were involved in some way, through their children or otherwise, in drugs.  It was because of their concern and fears that reports were made to the Garda and house searches followed.  Most of the people were highly indignant because they did not have any involvement whatever.  Presumably some members of the community genuinely thought on rumour or something else that those people might be involved or that the children might have had a small quantity of drugs in the house or had been dealing with others who were taking drugs.  Most of the seaches were carried out courteously but, unfortunately, not in all cases.  The problem that arises then is why those people were selected and who put the Garda on to the houses that were searched.  It is not very pleasant having to decide to search a house on information supplied like that.  It is not pleasant, particularly if the information is false, to have gardaí arrive at the front and back of a house to carry out a detailed search.</P>
    <P>I presume the same thing can arise now in regard to stolen property if it is suggested to the Garda that a certain person may have information or some property in the house.  Not only will a search be carried out but the people concerned will be liable for detention under section 3. Although any information given to the Garda pursuant to section 14 in respect of firearms and section 15 in respect of property will not be admissible against the person's spouse, it does, in fact, require the person concerned to give information incriminating his or her spouse in a criminal offence which could lead to their being prosecuted for such an offence on foot of other evidence obtained as a result of information given under this section, information we will now be compelling people to give.  Traditionally, it has been regarded as being contrary to public policy, as well as being unrealistic, to require a person to give information in respect of a spouse to the Garda and thus inform on a wife or husband. <Col N="978" /> Ultimately this is purely a policy matter.  It is a matter of how far we wish to go at this stage.  Does the Minister intend that a person may be prosecuted for an offence under these sections because he or she fails to give information which would specify a husband or wife was guilty of a criminal offence or would that be regarded as reasonable grounds for not giving the information?  I do not think that is specified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We support the Minister's intention in these sections in terms of tightening up the position in regard to information concerning firearms or ammunition and withholding information regarding stolen property.  Various reservations have been raised about the sections as drafted and I trust the Minister will answer some of the questions I have raised when replying. Will the Minister tell the House how &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; should be interpreted and how the courts will know what criteria should be applied in determining whether an accused person has taken &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo;, particularly as to any previous dealings which occurred in relation to firearms or ammunition?  Will such a person be exposed to prosecution under the section if he or she fails to take &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; to trace every dealing with the firearm or ammunition back to its sale by a manufacturer or what period will a person have to deal with?  Is a person to carry out a private investigation, limited though that may be?  Will there be a limitation on the length of time to be covered by any such investigation? How far will an individual be expected to go?  The requirement that the person give the information in his or her possession is fairly straightforward but there is the question of having to get information beyond that and the problem of giving information, particularly about a spouse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods has made a reasonable inquiry of the Minister, what the Minister has in mind in regard to the obligation which section 14 would appear to impose on somebody who has been interrogated in this way to take reasonable steps to obtain information which was not in his possession.  It may be that the Minister and the Department have <Col N="979" /> something particular in their minds and it may be that when we hear it it will cut the ground from under the misgivings I have about a form like that.  Those misgivings relate to the relative rarity &mdash; I am not so sure that it is not quite unprecedented but at any rate it is extremely rare &mdash; for a Bill like this to impose in certain conditions a duty on somebody or an inchoate or incipient criminal liability which that person can discharge by future action, as Deputy Woods says, to which no time limit is attached.</P>
      <P>That is a fairly rare bird in criminal measures although off the top of my head I would not like to say it is absolutely unprecedented.  I believe there are provisions in company law which attach penal sanctions to failure to comply with demands to supply information.  In what I might describe as straight criminal law like this it is pretty rare, if not unique.  I offer that guess off the top of my head and I am sorry if I am wrong about it but if it is rare, the Minister and his advisers might like to consider why it is rare, why it has not been resorted to before &mdash; at any rate very little &mdash; and whether they regard it as workable.  I am not trying to make imaginary or spurious difficulties or hypotheses but suppose the person interrogated under section 14 says he does not have the information but he would be willing to play along with the gang he hired the gun from to see if he could get it that way.  A police officer may feel that the section authorised him to agree to that course of action but by doing so he may be setting off a chain of events which may end in murder or he may set up a chain of events which will lead the interrogated person to further criminality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only an amateur at this sort of thing and I do not wish to waste the time of the Minister or his advisers, but I would take a bit of convincing that this was a workable provision, apart from the question mentioned by Deputy Woods, the fact that in point of time the provision seems to be open-ended.  He suggested that it would be open to the person interrogated to defeat the intent of the section by saying: &ldquo;Yes, I can take a few reasonable <Col N="980" /> steps which will give me this information but I cannot take them until July 12 months&rdquo; or &ldquo;I propose to wait until then because it will suit my book better to do so&rdquo; or &ldquo;that is the only moment when I will be able to do it with impunity.&rdquo;  I am not suggesting that the Minister should tie himself down like a legislative Gulliver with every little strand so nailed into place that he cannot stir a hand or a foot. I would like him to look with the open-mindedness which he shows every hour that he spends in the House at the practical problem of making this provision work.</P>
    <P>The problem which Deputy Woods mentioned in sections 14 (2) and 15 (2) about the reasonable excuse is not so serious.  That kind of formula is not unprecedented in our law.  It really means that the court has a pretty wide discretion to say what is and is not reasonable.  A person who fails or refuses to give information if, for example, he knows that, unbeknown to the police officer, a conspirator is hidden behind the curtain who will shoot him if he opens his mouth has what I would call a reasonable excuse. Perhaps that example is an excessively graphic instance and that excuse would not be reasonable in some other context such as taxes and so on, but when you are dealing with the underworld or somebody on the fringe of it at best, there may be all kinds of excuses which on the human plane would seem reasonable to a judge and most particularly to a jury. Even in summary trials and offences that is supposed to be the standard which judges try to apply to themselves.</P>
    <P>I have two other points about both of these sections.  The simpler one is that under sections 14 (3) and 15 (3) the police officer is, very properly, expected to give the person he is interrogating a chance by letting him know that he is going to get into trouble if he fails to answer the question. The Minister might be well advised, however, to examine the way the sections are drafted and what the effect of his failure or refusal might be.  If I were appearing for an accused person who was trying to get out from the application of section 14 (2) which creates an offence and imposes a penalty I would concentrate <Col N="981" /> very heavily as an advocate on sections 14 (3) and 15 (3) and try to see if there was any possible way that I could fault the police officer concerned on the grounds that he had not told me in ordinary language what the effect of my failure or refusal might be.  The only way that this requirement &mdash; absolutely legitimate and proper as I recognise its object to be &mdash; could be impeccably fulfilled would be by the police officer reading the subsection and then glossing it or paraphrasing it in simple language.  However, a police officer may not have so much leisure.  He may have a million other things on his mind connected with the offence or series of offences which he is investigating and he may forget or omit to provide the person he is interrogating with the guts of section 14 (2), which is difficult to put in language any more ordinary or plain than the subsection itself contains, that is a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or, if sent for trial by jury, to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.  That is quite a mouthful.</P>
    <P>I support the intent and object of this subsection but I wonder if the Minister will examine the potential which the present phrasing offers to an advocate to make the conviction of an interrogated person difficult on the grounds allegedly that section 14 (3) has not been complied with.  Is it complied with if the garda says: &ldquo;The effect of your not answering my question is that you will be in very serious trouble&rdquo;?  Is it enough if he says, &ldquo;The effect of it is that you are going to be in breach of section 14 (2) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984&rdquo; or possibly 1985 by the time it is enacted?  Is that duty then discharged? I repeat that I do not want to make difficulties.  I am merely trying to look at the thing from a practical point of view of busy gardaí who are under pressure and may perhaps even endanger themselves at the moment when this interrogation becomes appropriate.  The Minister might think of putting in another sentence to the effect that section 14 (3) would be deemed to have been sufficiently complied with if he informs the <Col N="982" /> person he is interrogating that it is a serious offence under this section of this Bill.  I am not recommending that formula. All I am saying is that the Minister might try to make the thing simpler to administer for the Garda for whom he is responsible in this House.</P>
    <P>The last problem I have with these sections seems so obvious that I wonder if I have overlooked something in the sections.  If so, I am sorry to waste the time of the House.  Sections 14 (4) and 15 (4) appear to provide a sort of general immunity for a person who has complied with a requirement under section 14 (1), in other words, he has given the information and it appears to confer on him a general immunity, so far at least as the prosecution are concerned, for having the gun or the stolen property in unlawful circumstances.  Maybe I do not understand this properly.  Suppose somebody under section 15, no doubt in the more common case of stolen property, is asked how he came by this video equipment, for instance, and says that he stole it; if I understand the subsection correctly, he has then donned a mantle of immunity so far as the prosecution for stealing is concerned. At any rate, if the police have no other evidence to go on than his own admission, as is frequently the case, the only way that information which he gives can be made admissible in a prosecution is if he gives information which is misleading. If he gives information which is true, obviously he has not committed an offence under section 14 (2) but that very information is not admissible in any other proceedings whatever.  In other words, suppose the only information the Garda have, as is frequently the case, consists of a man's own admission extracted after questioning, they might as well have saved themselves the trouble of collecting the information, of extracting that admission since it is not now usable, since at the moment it is extracted it becomes infected with unusability so far as bringing a prosecution for stealing, receiving or being in possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life is concerned. Regarding section 14, the same effect seems to arise where a person found in possession of a sawn-off shotgun says, <Col N="983" />&ldquo;I hired it this morning from one of the gang Deputy Kelly and Deputy Woods were talking about over on the south side or the north side or wherever it is.  I hired it for £1,000 to do a job&rdquo;.  Perhaps there is no other evidence against the man than that, but since that is the true information of how he has come to be in possession of the article and since that is the only information the police may have, by that very statement he has immunised himself against prosecution for the act which is the one that interests the police, namely, being in possession of or having stolen the goods, having hired the gun or whatever it is.  I am sorry if I have mistaken the sense of both sections.  I would like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are discussing section 15 in addition to section 14 the whole area is widened.  Bearing in mind what the Minister said this morning about what he would not like as a general practice in relation to section 14 regarding firearms, I would like to ask him a couple of questions and perhaps get some clarification. Under section 14 a person is arrested under suspicion and the provisions of section 3 would then be applied. If the Garda question somebody under the section and the person refuses to answer, that is a new offence.  If such a person is released under section 3, can he be re-arrested and the process be started all over again?  This puts me in mind of the Offences Against the State Act, 1972, which obliges a person to account for his movements.  During the passage of that Bill, in Volume 264, columns 340 and 341 of the Dáil Official Report, the then Taoiseach is reported, having referred to the 1939 Offences Against the State Act as saying:</P>
      <P>We are advised now that this section is contrary to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights and that if we acted on it, any person who was convicted under it and sent to prison or in any way disadvantaged would have a right of action before the Court of Human Rights against us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to be similar to provisions in <Col N="984" /> sections 14 and 15 of the Bill.  Would the Government be liable in the same way? I should like clarification on those two points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>These two sections give cause for particular concern.  Though we are taking both together, the wording is not the same.  Section 14 requires that a person takes reasonable steps to provide certain information to the Garda, whereas section 15 simply requires a person to give an account of how he came into possession of property.  When the person concerned is asked to give an account, what criteria do the Garda use, or who decides whether the account is accurate or adequate?  Could we have a definition of &ldquo;reasonable account&rdquo; or of the expression &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>What are the reasonable steps a person must take to satisfy the Garda?  Another point that concerns me in these two sections is that they will not come into effect only if a person is detained &mdash; they could be applied to a person walking the street or coming out of his house.  There is nothing here in regard to a person being detained under section 3 in order that these sections could be applied.  A young person could be walking along a road with a radio or a bicycle in his possession and a garda might ask him where he got it.  If the garda is not satisfied, that person automatically is liable for detention under section 3.</P>
      <P>This could mean abuse of section 3 and it is no use saying that it will not happen. I know of a recent instance where a young person is being systematically victimised. I have reported the matter and it is being investigated.  This happens and I am concerned that section 15, which applies to property &mdash; the person has not to be found in possession of the property &mdash; could provide the Garda with wide powers. It is restrictive on a person's right to remain silent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point relates to the reliability of the information which can be elicited from a person.  A person does not have to be guilty of an offence to be taken in by a garda and detained.  There will be pressure on a person to give some form of information, no matter how unreliable <Col N="985" /> it is, to give some person's name at random, based possibly on rumour or to protect a person.  There would be a strong inclination for a person detained to do that.  I oppose these two sections for those reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We have been discussing the amendments and the two sections together and, for the benefit of the House, I will first refer to the amendments.  They are merely technical amendments found to be necessary to correct errors during proofing of the Bill. It is normal to give the courts discretion to impose both a fine and imprisonment, as in section 14 (2).  The two sections are not quite the same, though similar in principle.  Both are aimed to get at the source of illegally held firearms and to try to establish how stolen property is disposed of.  Both are to enable the Garda to get information.  The sections are not particularly directed against the people who are in possession of stolen firearms or property.</P>
      <P>I will deal first with firearms.  The case of firearms is very specific.  Firearms kill. If they are held unlawfully by terrorists or by criminals there is an obligation on us to find out where they came from. Although there have been many convictions in the courts in respect of armed robbery or aggravated burglary or for the possession of firearms or the various other firearms offences that we discussed before lunch, there have not been convictions in respect of the supply of firearms. Obviously these guns come from somewhere and people are making money by supplying them.  There is a trade in these weapons, weapons that endanger life.  Section 14 is an attempt to get at the source of supply, at the people who trade in weapons, and I am glad that Deputy Woods and his party are supporting the principle involved here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could say the same in relation to section 15.  It is difficult to amaze those of us who are in politics but it is a source of amazement to me personally that each year property to the value of millions of pounds is stolen and much of it is never recovered.  Where does all this property go to?  I do not believe that the people <Col N="986" /> who steal cars or videos or TV sets or anything else use these goods for their own pleasure.  I do not believe that all this stolen property ends up in the kitchens or the bedrooms or living rooms of the criminals who have stolen it. Obviously, than, there is a trade in stolen goods.  There are people who are making money from that trade and who act as receivers, on a large scale, from a number of people who steal.  There must be some mechanism whereby these goods are distributed back on to the market where their sale would appear legitimate. Section 15 is an attempt to get at those who fence and who recycle stolen goods. Both in the case of firearms and of other stolen goods very little progress has been made in establishing the source of supply or of the method of distribution.  To put it bluntly, there has been little progress in arresting or bringing to justice those who are making profits from the crimes of others or from the victims of those criminals.</P>
    <P>Obviously we would be concerned that sections 14 and 15 would fulfil the intent without encroaching on the liberties of people.  Among the points raised by Deputy Woods was the point that we are creating a new concept in law but this is not a new concept.  Section 17 of the Official Secrets Act, for instance, has a similar provision, as has section 2 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972.  In the latter case a member of the Garda Síochána may demand that a person give his name and address and an account of his recent movements and that in the event of failure or refusal to give such information or to give false or misleading information he shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £200 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or to both such fine and imprisonment.</P>
    <P>More to the point and more in the context of everyday life, section 107, subsection (4) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, provides that:</P>
    <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for <Col N="987" /> believing that there has been an offence under this Act involving the use of a mechanically propelled vehicle:</P>
    <P>(a)  the owner of the vehicle shall, if required by the member, state whether he was or was not actually using the vehicle at the material time and, if he fails to do so, shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(b) If the owner of the vehicle states that he was not actually using it at the material time, he shall give such information as he may be required by the member to give as to the identity of the person who was actually using it at that time and, if he fails to do so, shall be guilty of an offence unless he shows to the satisfaction of the court that he did not know and could not with reasonable diligence have ascertained who that person was.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a similar provision there already in the Road Traffic Act.  It may not be an everyday occurrence but it is frequently used.  There is no immunity in respect of withholding information about one's wife.  For example, if there was a traffic accident in which someone was killed and if the licence number of the car involved was fed into the Garda computer and the Garda, having established the identity of the owner of the car, approached that person only to be told that he had not been driving the car at the time, that he was elsewhere, there is an obligation on the owner to say who was driving it even if that person was his wife.</P>
    <P>One might say that the penalties under the Road Traffic Act are not very great but in the sort of situation I have outlined there could ultimately be a charge of manslaughter against the driver of the car and the obligation remains in relation to giving information about who was driving the car at the material time.  There is no exception or immunity in so far as a spouse is concerned.  That concept has worked reasonably well.</P>
    <P>The section here is not directed specifically at a spouse.  The obligation in section 14 is for a person to give any <Col N="988" /> information in his possession or any information he can obtain by taking reasonable steps to obtain it.  The obligation in section 15 relates to giving an account of how one came by property. The provision is not quite the same in both cases.</P>
    <P>The obligation here is to give information <i>simpliciter.</i>  If that information involves a spouse there is nothing in the section about making an exception in such a situation but subsection (4) provides that any information given by a person in compliance with the requirement shall not be admissible in evidence against that person or against his or her spouse in any proceedings.  The exclusion on the admissibility of evidence applies both to the person giving the information and to the spouse of that person.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of immunity from prosecution.  There is no immunity from prosecution here. What is being provided in subsection (4) is that the statement made giving the information shall not be admissible in evidence against the person who provides the information or against the spouse of that person but other evidence would be admissible.  If the Garda have other material evidence it can be used in bringing a prosecution.</P>
    <P>I have included subsection (4) in this section and an identical provision in section 15 in order to make it clear that people would not be incriminating themselves or their spouses by giving the required information.  I do not think anyone wishes that provision to be dropped but it gives rise to two concerns.  There is the concern first from the Garda that this was giving an immunity from prosecution in a number of ways.  That is not so.  It does not give immunity from prosecution in providing that a particular statement shall not be admitted in evidence.  Any other statement made by a person could be admitted in evidence in the normal way.  It would be only when sections 14 or 15 had been invoked by the Garda that the question of the inadmissibility of a statement made under the requirements of either section would arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods asked about the phrase taking &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; and the question <Col N="989" /> of whether it would be an objective test.  It would be an objective test and the courts are familiar with deciding what is reasonable and what is not.</P>
    <P>Section 107(4)(b) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, states:</P>
    <P>if the owner of the vehicle states that he was not actually using it at the material time, he shall give such information as may be required by the member to give as to the identity of the person who is actually using it at that time and, if he fails to do so, shall be guilty of an offence unless he shows to the satisfaction of the court that he did not know and could not with reasonable diligence have ascertained who that person was,</P>
    <P>It is the same concept as &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo;.  If a garda thinks a person is in unlawful possession of a firearm it would be reasonable to ask the person to produce a licence if they said they had one. If they said they bought the gun it would be reasonable to ask them to produce a receipt.  To take Deputy Kelly's point, if they became involved by infiltrating a criminal or subversive group to establish the source, it would appear to me that would clearly not be reasonable.  It is for the courts to decide and it will be objective.</P>
    <P>The same would apply to &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo;.  It will be an objective test and the courts will have to decide what is reasonable and what is not.  It is possible that the court could decide that it was reasonable if somebody said they could not give an account of something because it would incriminate their spouse.  I cannot say categorically that &ldquo;without reasonable excuse&rdquo; would cover that eventuality but I am conscious of the fact that the courts could decide &ldquo;without reasonable excuse&rdquo; would cover that point.  If that happened it would not apply in the way in which it was intended.  The intention is that the requirement is to give information <i>simpliciter</i> and there would not be an exception made in the case of spouses.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of people trying to get out of trouble by implicating other people, that can happen at present. <Col N="990" /> For example, if a person did not like his neighbours he could go to the Garda and tell them there are drugs in their house. If he was convincing enough there is a possibility the Garda would use their powers under the Misuse of Drugs Act. We know from cases brought to our notice that malicious people do that. There are malicious people in society and if a person wants to exercise malice there are many opportunities for doing so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly made the point that it was open as to point of time.  I will look at that.  He made the point that somebody could say they would comply with what they were being asked and would give an account of where they had, for example, the stolen video, but not just yet; they would give it in 12 months' time.  The question of reasonable steps and the objectivity of the test was also raised.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of the Garda having to tell somebody in ordinary language or quoting the section or saying that under section 14 or 15 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1985, they will be given a formula of words, this will be examined by officials in my Department to see that it complies with the requirement of ordinary language.  The fact that a garda had or had not informed a person about the likelihood of committing an offence under sections 14 or 15 in ordinary language would be a crucial point in the proofs of any prosecution taken under this section.  The mechanism I suggest would be helpful there.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa asked what would a reasonable account be.  The courts are familiar with the concept of what is reasonable and what is not.  The Deputy was correct when he said these sections did not apply exclusively to people detained under section 3.  People could be approached by the Garda and asked to give an account of where they got a firearm which was in their possession. They could be asked to give information about the possession of the weapon. The same applies to stolen goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We are back to the old argument of a young <Col N="991" /> person having a bicycle, transistor or whatever.  At present if the Garda have reasonable suspicion that the goods are stolen they can arrest the person under existing law on reasonable suspicion.  If this Bill becomes law, they will be able, under section 3, if they have reasonable suspicion that someone stole a radio, bicycle, video or whatever to detain that person for questioning.  It is one of the offences to which section 3 will apply.</P>
      <P>The argument about the likelihood of the section being abused is no stronger when we go to sections 14 or 15.  We argued this under section 3, but the requirements of these sections do not strengthen the case further.  What is being said is that it could provide a mechanism for abuse.  The mechanisms for abuse are in existing law and it is very hard to rule them out.  There is always the possibility of people overstepping their statutory rights and exceeding their powers but one can make it clear that if they do so they will find themselves in difficulty.  That can be a strong deterrent but we cannot legislate abuse out of existence any more than we can legislate crime out of existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Skelly asked about the combination of the offence here and section 3.  There may not be any need for a lengthy interview before a garda decided whether a person was in breach of this. If people had stolen goods in their possession and failed or refused to give an account of them, three hours of questioning will not make the refusal any different. When the refusal occurs the offence is committed at that point.  One of the safeguards under section 3 was that if at any point during the detention of a person the Garda were in a position to bring a charge, there was an obligation on them to end the questioning and the detention and to bring a charge at that point.  In many circumstances where a questioning under sections 14 or 15 occurred outside a Garda station they would have reached that point before the person arrived at the Garda station and the person could be charged and get station bail, or whatever.  It would then be brought to court where the court could test it.  If it occurred while people were <Col N="992" /> being detained they would have to be told that sections 14 and 15 were being invoked and that these obligations were on them, and this would have to be done in ordinary language.  Again, it would be a question of refusing to give an account.</P>
    <P>I cannot envisage a situation where a detention period could be lengthened by the fact of refusal because the fact of refusal is the offence and would leave a person open to be charged at that point. I know Deputy Skelly raised another point.  What was it?</P>

    <P>We should make an attempt to do something about the traffic in stolen weapons and stolen goods.  I would like to remind Deputies that these sections will be governed by the same review clause as sections 3 to 8.  They will lapse after four years if they have not proved to be effective.  Even though this is not a new concept in law, and even though it has operated well under the Road Traffic Act, there is the mechanism to review these sections.  We can monitor what is happening and at the end of a specific period we can see how they are working.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about a new development.  The Minister said that under the Road Traffic Acts there were specific questions asked about specific instances.  Part of our concern is that these are wide-ranging provisions and we are not sure how wide-ranging they will be in practice.  The Incorporated Law Society in a statement issued on 6 April 1984 said:</P>
      <P>Section 14</P>
      <P>The Society reiterates its basic objection as already enunciated in its initial submission, but without prejudice thereto, submits that the control of firearms is properly a matter for insertion in the Firearms Acts.</P>
      <P>Section 15</P>
      <P>The Society believes that the section should require the member of the Garda Síochána to have reasonable grounds for believing that the person being requested to give information, has, or is committing an offence such as is set out at Paragraph 15 1 (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Society does not believe that the offences of fraudulent conversion or embezzlement should be included in <Col N="994" /> this because of the effect of their inclusion and the provisions in sub-paragraph (c) is to make the category of items covered by &ldquo;the proceeds (direct or indirect)&rdquo; an extraordinary wide range of items including goods which may have been purchased with the proceeds i.e. cheques, pensions, savings certificates, stock certificates, title deeds etc.</P>
    <P>They claim that this is a particularly wide-ranging provision covering a wide area of activity.  The Minister gave specific examples in relation to driving charges &mdash; for instance, where one was required to state who was using the car.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in the event the court can say what is reasonable and the court will use its own criteria and will determine what it considers to be reasonable. The Minister also said that the court may regard incriminating the spouse as a reasonable excuse for failing or refusing to give information about a spouse.  By that time a person has gone through the courts and the whole legal process has been gone through.  Everybody knows that the number who come to court is a relatively small percentage of those who go though the legal process.  By that time a person can have been detained and questioned for six, 12 or 20 hours as the case may be, depending on the alleged offence.  It is clear that this is a matter ultimately for the courts to judge what is reasonable.  The Minister did not clear up the point about how far back one is expected to go or how this is limited in any way, especially in relation to firearms. This seems to be fairly open and this is something which should receive more attention.</P>
    <P>Section 14 (1) reads &ldquo;he may require that person to give him any information which is in his possession, or which he can obtain by taking reasonable steps,&rdquo;. The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors feel that there is a great need to clarify subsections 14 (1) and 15 (1) in relation to determining what information is required to be given.  There is also the question of when the information is <Col N="995" /> required.  Must it be given when asked in the first instance?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gerard Brady has been given permission to raise the subject of sewage pollution of the water and beaches in Dublin Bay. The Deputy has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity of highlighting this problem in the context in which I and many other citizens of Dublin feel that it should be raised.</P>
      <P>I should like at the outset to define the parameters of the geographical location to which I am referring in my contribution. Dublin Bay stretches from Howth right across to Bulloch Harbour including the areas of the Bull Wall, Sandymount Strand and, of course, Coliemore.  It also reaches out on the northward side to Portrane, Portmarnock and back down to Bray.  This area has boasted of the finest beaches and best amenities in Europe to citizens living in a city of the size of Dublin.  These afford great facilities in aquatic sports and are an important tourist attraction.  It would not be any harm to quickly refer to the famous Dublin Bay prawns which are readily available on many international menus.</P>
      <P>With the strongest possible voice I wish to raise an alarm to the effect that the waters within Dublin Bay and the beaches are in a very serious state of contamination at the moment.  I do not think that this is particularly realised in its fullest gravity.  Regrettably, repeated assurances from the Eastern Health Board that the level of pollution does not exceed EEC levels do not hold weight when one examines the evidence available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that statistics can be a little <Col N="996" /> boring but a level allowing for a contamination of say, 2,000 B-coli bacteria per 100 millilitres is acceptable by EEC standards.  The Eastern Health Board admitted recently that, of ten sample cases taken, two exceeded that level. Even though that is random sampling, on anyone's rapid calculation that represents something like 20 per cent above the accepted level.  However, the EEC qualify their recommendations by saying that up to 5 per cent is acceptable.  The figures obtained from sampling on some of our beaches &mdash; for instance, Dollymount Strand &mdash; shows 80 per cent, substantially exceeding that limit.  The same would apply on account of their proximity, to other beaches and sea such as Sandymount Strand, Seapoint and Bulloch Harbour.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be an alarmist and am not advocating the view that the beaches should be closed down and people stopped using the waters of Dublin Bay &mdash; far from it.  It must be put in its context. However, it is developing at present into a very critical situation, which as a matter of extreme urgency will have to be tackled before it becomes necessary for health hazard warnings to be put on beaches.</P>
    <P>I remember a short year ago raising the alarm here about the Windscale operation which was thought at that stage to be an alarmist point of view.  An all-party delegation are going to Windscale next week and action is being taken as a result of pressure being brought to bear.</P>
    <P>I shall give the House an example of the illnesses which can result from water pollution of this level when B-coli bacteria are present in such a high concentration in our waters.  Any doctor in general practice has chronicled many cases of severe gastro-enteritis in children during the summer months.  Quite obviously the problem is accentuated during those months, but it is there throughout the winter also.  Complaints such as skin rashes are not at all uncommon. People will say that we have not an epidemic of gastro-enteritis, but we do not want to wait for that.  What we have is a climate in the water and the surrounds which is ripe as a culture medium for the <Col N="997" /> spreading of an outbreak of, at the very worst, a polio epidemic if certain cases arise in the city.  We all realise how this dreaded disease spreads through sewage into the water.</P>
    <P>It might not be commonly realised or recognised that raw sewage is pumped out into Dublin Bay.  Some is treated and part of that to acceptable levels, but raw sewage is pumped into the bay.  If people for one moment doubt what I am saying the best that I can do is to ask them to go out to see for themselves on a calm sea in Dublin Bay.  Seeing, after all, is believing. Anyone with any sort of maritime experience or who has enjoyed the waters offshore in Dublin Bay for the past 20 or so years will realise that we are rapidly going downhill and that the pollution level there is quite appalling.  Children are at risk as a consequence of that.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Minister of State lives in a maritime constituency and likes to enjoy the facilities of the beaches of Dublin is present.  What is needed &mdash; and as a matter of urgency &mdash; is a complete survey of the entire bay, primarily to review what I take to be the antiquated system of pumping sewage into it.  World experts agree that, ideally, the best system is an outward pumping of two to three miles offshore, given that hydrologists would have ascertained after very extensive study the ideal siting for particular pipes rather than piping sewage out without realising the effects of complicated inflows, outflows and tidal flows within the bay.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that a major campaign is needed.  Perhaps the Minister would take note of this suggestion. He may intend doing this for the summer months, if he is aware of the danger.  An inordinate amount of dumping takes place within the bay at the moment.  This habit has increased.  It is like the sly criminal at night who dumps things overboard from boats.  This is quite a rampant practice in Dublin Bay.  When you go out into the bay you can go through hundreds of yards of flotsam and jetsam which is simply appalling and all this comes back on to the beaches.  We could be talking in terms of a number of years before the new sewage disposal scheme for Dublin <Col N="998" /> is fully completed.  There are almost one million people living in this city.  The cost of this scheme is estimated to be up to £300 million.  After all, we are members of the EEC and we have got rights to EEC regional funding.  I am sure the Minister has read with great interest the recent publication by the European Commission entitled <i>Ten Years of Community Environment Policy.</i>  If he turns to page 19, section 4(a), paragraph 25, on water, he will see that it is spelt out clearly how the EEC look at the water pollution question. The Government should become involved in this immediately because the pressure on sewerage disposal into Dublin Bay it totally unacceptable.  One has only to go to Bulloch Harbour to see what the situation there is like.</P>
    <P>In certain places where pollution is very bad and beaches are not suitable for use by young children health warnings should be put up.  We should admit the problem.  At least if we face up to it we will be able to do something about it.  I am not just speaking from my own investigation into this matter.  In <i>The Sunday Press</i> of last Sunday a marine expert and microbiologist argued that the pollution level in the water of Dublin Bay is far in excess of the standards set out by the EEC.  I remember when I served on Dublin Corporation studying many reports about this &mdash; the waters at that time were not as murky as they are today. I do not know if an on-the-spot examination would be the best thing for the Eastern Health Board experts to engage in, in conjunction with public representatives. I always think that is a good idea. If they want to do it on their own that is all to the good, but it is important to bring Members of the House out to Dublin Bay and let them see what the situation is.  It is much better to do that than put the problem away and continue on with one report after another.  I am voicing the concern of thousands of Dublin people when I say that.</P>
    <P>Sandymount Strand is a very important strand in my constituency and I am well aware of the pollution levels there and the algae and seaweed type material which is constantly on the beach.  Many parents are concerned about allowing <Col N="999" /> their children to bathe in the waters of Dublin Bay.  They want to get further down south to the Silver Strand and Brittas Bay.  That is the factual situation.</P>
    <P>I am rather surprised, with the European elections taking place tomorrow, that this matter of pollution in Dublin Bay has not become a very important issue in the campaign.  If we are going to quote EEC reports and EEC levels of contamination and if it is to be a matter for the EEC, perhaps the Minister could take the matter to Europe and if we have not got the funds to cope with it make it a major issue to do something about it straight away.</P>
    <P>We do not tend to use the bay sufficiently from a tourist point of view but, conscious of youth recreation and developing an awareness of the great outdoors, trying to encourage our children to engage in maritime activities, sailing and so forth, more and more people with increased leisure time will avail of this great facility.  It would be a great tragedy if we allowed Dublin Bay to become irreversibly damaged by pollution of this kind.  I am quite sure that, like me, many Members remember when one could safely go out to any of the beaches around Dublin, find clear water and enjoy the amenities of the bay.  That is not the case any more.  Sub-aqua people will tell you that you cannot engage in that type of activity any more in Dublin Bay because conditions are so bad.</P>
    <P>I realise that it is a very difficult problem, but I have set out a few matters which the Minister of State might address himself to, at least getting to grips with the problem and tackling it on a three or four year plan.  I am sure the Minister is fully aware of the problem.  There was great highlighting of the Dublin Bay problem with the talk of siting an oil refinery in the bay.  Leaving all that aside, the health hazard is there for everybody to see.  It only takes an epidemic of gastro-enteritis or something more deadly to turn people completely off using the facilities.  At that stage we will be saying that we should have done something about it.  I ask the Minister, instead of giving me repeated assurances that <Col N="1000" /> everything is all right, which thousands of people know is not the case, to think of what he will do about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern as to the need to preserve the quality of our waters, and I can assure the House that I would take immediate remedial action if I felt that any of our rivers, lakes or bays were endangered.  However, I do not agree that the waters of Dublin Bay present any danger to health, such as Deputy Brady spoke about.</P>
      <P>Substantial information on the bay and the Liffey estuary is to be found in the Crisp study which covers the period from 1971 to 1974.  This found that the water in the outer estuary and Dublin Bay was of good quality, and that the strong clockwise current continually flushing the bay contributed to the maintenance of this standard.  The generally satisfactory position in the bay area is also illustrated by the passage of salmon and sea trout for spawning.  However, localised pollution and aesthetically unacceptable conditions occur at times in parts of the bay and improvements must be made in the affected areas.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the domestic waste discharged to the bay does not receive full treatment.  While this practice has met with public criticism, it should be recognised that the use of properly designed and located sea outfalls provides for a form of marine treatment of sewage which compares favourably with the type of treatment which must be provided for our inland towns.  A proper outfall takes advantage of the ample supply of oxygen in the sea.  This allows micro-organisms to break down the organic substances in the sewage into separate substances which do not cause a nuisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A programme of monitoring for the purposes of the EEC Bathing Water Directive is carried out at two locations on Dollymount beach during the bathing season.  Monitoring is carried out on a fortnightly basis as required by the directive and results have been consistently good.  Since 1978 full compliance with the requirements of the directive has been <Col N="1001" /> achieved and analysis of the monitoring shows that results are well within the parameters of the directive.</P>
    <P>Other areas of the bay are also monitored, though less frequently, and these include Seapoint, Coliemore Harbour, Dalkey, Corbawn Lane, Shankill, Blackrock north and south beaches.  The monitoring programme for these areas was extended this year beyond the traditional bathing months and in fact commenced on 1 March 1984.</P>
    <P>While a number of monitoring results at certain locations have, on occasions exceeded the standards set out in the Bathing Water Directive, the coastal waters in Dublin Bay do not, in the opinion of the health authority, constitute a threat to public health and are safe to swim in.  I am quoting what the health authority said, not what my Department might say, or the Deputy might think I wanted them to say.</P>

      <P>A programme for improvement in sewage disposal has been in progress for some years and extensive headway has been made on the greater Dublin drainage scheme which will ultimately service 1,000,000 people at a cost of £50 million. As regards specific problem areas, improvement works are either completed or planned in the major trouble spots and I will now detail the position for the various locations along the bay.</P>
      <P>Seapoint: the source of pollution is the Dún Laoghaire outfall off the west pier and, with easterly winds, pollution would tend to increase at Seapoint.  Local authority proposals to alter this outfall are at early planning stage.  I have asked the local authorities to submit them.  We have been looking for them because we have been aware of the problem.  We will study them.  I sent a letter to the local elected representatives giving a clear indication that the Department are aware of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> Dollymount: the Dublin city outfalls, which discharge into the river Liffey upstream of the Poolbeg generating station and carry sewage from the city centre and from Pembroke&mdash;Rathmines, affect the Bull Wall significantly with lesser effects on the south Dollymount strand. A programme for improvement in sewage treatment is being carried out and a new sewage treatment works at Ringsend is operational since February 1982.  When the Ringsend pumping station is commissioned in autumn 1984, a major improvment in the existing position should occur.</P>
    <P>Coliemore Harbour Dalkey: this is not a bathing area of any significance and the cause of pollution is a small sewage outfall at the pier.  Corbawn Lane, Shankhill: a new sewage disposal scheme has been completed at a cost of £7 million and this includes a 1.4 km marine outfall at Shanganagh. This scheme which came into operation in autumn 1983 should resolve problems in this area.  It will take a little time to see it happening but it will.  Blackrock, north and south beach: occasional high readings have been mainly attributable to a malfunction in the Tobernea drainage pump.  The beach is not used for bathing and chlorination is carried out on the water in the baths.</P>
    <P>As regards pollution control, the Water Pollution Act, 1977, with its licensing provisions for the control of discharges of trade and certain sewage effluents into waters and sewers, is the main legal instrument at the disposal of local authorities.  The latest information to hand shows that the general level of implementation of the Act as indicated by the number of licences issued, cases investigated and follow-up action taken, continues to improve.  However, the <i>Review of Water Pollution in Ireland</i> which was presented by the Water Pollution Advisory Council last year highlighted the slow rate of progress in the preparation of water quality management plans.  I consider that such a plan is essential for the protection of water quality in Dublin Bay because the capacity of the bay to absorb pollution is finite and we need to assess the impact of existing discharges on the assimilative capacity. <Col N="1003" /> In addition, a plan would enable the local authorities to allocate the remaining assimilative capacity between new industrial and domestic discharges, and enable them to identify areas where remedial action is necessary.</P>
    <P>The making of a water quality management plan is a matter for the local authorities. When I was speaking in Dún Laoghaire at a Dublin Bay seminar I indicated that I want to get a water quality management plan going.  It is my intention to involve the three local authorities.  This will provide a positive approach.</P>

      <P>I will be moving quickly and requesting the local authorities <Col N="1004" /> to set it up.  We have to get permission from the Department of Fisheries because they are involved.  It will be in the near future.  That is the way forward. This plan will have a tremendous effect on Dublin Bay, which is a very important amenity.  We want to ensure that the population can swim in safety.  I do not harbour the same fears as the Deputy about the health aspect.  I am not a professional but I swim almost every day of the year.  There are times when I do not like the look of the water but, basically, Dublin Bay is reasonably clean.  We require a plan and we require action.  I assure the Deputy, and the House, that such action will be taken.</P>

      <P>The Central Data Processing Services (CDPS) of my Department operate a large computer facility which is used by a number of Departments, health boards, voluntary hospitals and other public service agencies.  Information retained on the CDPS computer is the property of the Department or agency which inputs the data and is not accessed or used by my Department except in so far as it is processed for the owners.  Most data held on the CDPS computer is processed via telephone links without any involvement by CDPS.  In these instances, my Department do not, and do not need to, know how many citizens are involved.  Such details can be obtained only from the owners of the data.  Personnel information in relation to some 30,000 civil servants is held on the computer for my Department as owner but this information is not used for any other purpose.  The CDPS, acting as agents for the Department of the Environment, transfer data on motor vehicle registrations to the Garda but also do not need to know the number of citizens involved.</P>

    <P>The Department's computerised records system holds information regarding the social insurance records of approximately 1.2 million insured persons.  The information relates to their pay-related social insurance contributions and comes <Col N="938" /> from the Revenue Commissioners with the exception of some data coming from the Department's own sources such as details of previous claims for benefit and records of credited contributions.

    <P>During 1983 the IDA also approved grant assistance for 156 projects with a total potential of 557 jobs for County Galway.  The fixed asset investment associated with these projects will amount to £14 million towards which the IDA will provide grant assistance of £7.8 million.</P>
    <P>Additionally, in recent years the IDA have committed substantial resources in grants to the expansion of existing industries and the establishment of new projects. Many of these, which are still engaged in their investment programmes, provided a substantial number of new jobs in 1983 and will continue to provide new employment opportunities as they build up to full production.</P>
    <P>As part of their strategy to develop high technology small industry projects a small business development centre comprising eight industrial units has been provided at UCG. Five of these units are now occupied.</P>
    <P>The IDA have a total of 242,000 sq. ft. of factory space ranging in size from 500 to 71,000 sq. ft. at seven locations and 248 acres of land at 14 locations available for industrial development in the county. A further 11 small industry units totalling 22,500 sq. ft. are reserved for industrial projects.</P>
    <P>The IDA will continue to actively promote County Galway and the western <Col N="943" /> region in general for industrial investment.</P>

      <P>University College Galway is undertaking a preliminary survey for inventory purposes of the monuments and sites of archaeological significance in County Galway (including the islands off the coast) with funds provided by the Commissioners of Public Works.  Field work on the survey is well advanced and a sites and monuments record for the county will be published by the Commissioners in 1985.  The sites and monuments record is aimed specifically at agencies concerned with environmental change and will consist of a numbered list of monuments for each six inch ordnance survey sheet for County Galway accompanied by a corresponding set of annotated ordnance survey maps.  An inventory consisting of a classified list of the monuments with a brief description of each and accompanying distribution maps will be published by the Commissioners as soon as possible after the publication of the sites and monuments record.</P>
      <P>The number of monuments in State care in County Galway is as follows:</P>

      <P>The person concerned does not satisfy the contribution condition for entitlement to unemployment benefit. His entitlement to unemployment assistance could not be determined pending inquiries by a social welfare officer into his circumstances.  These investigations were recently completed and he was assessed with means at £16.50 weekly derived from the value of board and lodging on his parents' holding.  He is accordingly entitled to £11.50 unemployment assistance a week being the maximum rate appropriate to him, £28 less £16.50 means.</P>
      <P>Arrears amounting to £214.68 were paid with the current week's entitlement on 31 May 1984 and further weekly payments are being made as they become due.</P>

      <P>Following investigation of his means by a social welfare officer the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his means derived from land exceeded the statutory limit applicable to him £2961.40 per annum.  He appealed at his local office against this disallowance of his unemployment assistance claim and arising from the contentions raised in the appeal the case was returned to the social welfare officer for further inquiries. These inquiries were recently completed and his case has been referred to an appeals officer for determination.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance <Col N="955" /> will be reviewed in the light of the appeals officer's decision.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that an applicant is available for work and to fulfil this condition an applicant must be capable of, available for and genuinely seeking employment.</P>
      <P>The unemployment benefit claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for work.  She appealed against the disallowance but an appeals officer also decided that she was not available for work on 3 April 1984.  She continued to sign as unemployed and inquiries were made to ascertain if she became available for work.  Following the completion of inquiries her claim was again disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for work.  She appealed against the disallowance of her claim and arrangements are being made to have an oral hearing of her case at the earliest opportunity. Her entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.</P>

      <P>I have taken all the possible steps open to me under the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, to secure payment of the compensation awarded to the person  concerned.  The latest position is that the Chief State Solicitor has obtained an execution order against the former employer for the compensation and that the execution order has been lodged with the county sheriff for execution.</P>
