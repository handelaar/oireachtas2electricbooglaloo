      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to a newspaper report in which it is suggested that the forthcoming meeting between himself and the British Prime Minister might not take place in Ireland?  Can he give us any up-to-date information?  I understand and fully appreciate that there are security considerations involved.  Could the Taoiseach advert to the fact that protocol clearly demands that this meeting be held in this country?</P>

      <P>I accept what the Taoiseach says about security.  Naturally we are all very conscious of that.  May I emphasise to the Taoiseach the importance of the protocol aspect and the fact that the last two meetings of this kind were held in Britain, and the importance of ensuring from the point of view of <Col N="1516" /> balance that this one is held in this country? I am sure whatever security problems there are, are capable of being overcome.  May I mention to the Taoiseach that I may have to make a reasonably long journey myself shortly and may I count on his good offices with regard to my travel arrangements?</P>

    <Title>Land Bill, 1984 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The last day I was speaking I commended the Minister of State for bringing in this legislation.  The previous Land Bill was the 1965 Land Bill.  He showed tremendous courage in persisting with the Bill, particularly since land is such an emotive issue, especially in the west.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been concerned to give equal rights to lessor and lessee and to banish some of the fears of elderly people on leasing land.  He did a good job in bringing together the Irish Farmers' Association, AIB, the Incorporated Law Society and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors to draw up two model leases.  These documents should allay the fears of landowners who come to lease their land.  The problem is that the Minister is relying on co-operatives and voluntary bodies to spread the gospel.  When drawing up the two model leases, the AIB and the Incorporated Law Society should also have been given the task of selling them.  These institutions have not played a full part in encouraging people to hand over their land, in particular to younger people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> The associations which represent the young people concerned, such as Macra na Feirme, have shown down through the years their disappointment at the length of time taken to gain possession of and be able to utilise land.  Since we entered the EC there has been a greater necessity to involve younger people, because productivity will be the key element in the future.  There are three and a half million under-utilised acres.  Experts have calculated that if this land was put into full production the amount of agricultural produce for export would increase by approximately 50 per cent.  This, in turn, would create enormous employment opportunities, both on and off the farm. The Minister is proposing in this Bill to make extremely under-utilised land available to landless people.  In the west, we have been bedevilled by the impossibility of giving land to all who desire it. Ownership of land is the greatest fulfilment but there has been too little attention given to whether the land is going to be productive.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in his taxation schemes, will have to place more emphasis on productivity from land and land holdings.  The cliché is bandied around whenever a Land Bill or similar legislation is introduced, that land is Ireland's greatest resource.  This resource is at present under-utilised.  In future, when leasing becomes more general, there will be greater productivity and more competition between farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes from an area west of the Shannon which has always had a major problem in land ownership.  Even at present all the benefits available to elderly people to retire are not known about.  There is need for further education and the Law Society and the banks have a major role to play in that.  I appeal to the Minister to impress on these institutions the need for co-operation and education of their members.  When land is being transferred from father to son the Law Society solicitors do not fully explore the Social Welfare Acts in order to point out the benefits available.  That leaves the young person acquiring the <Col N="1520" /> land in an inhibiting position which will bear heavily on him later, especially on the death of the donor.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister's courage in bringing in this Land Bill.  I wish him well with it in the future, but I hope that some major education process will be undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak very briefly on this Bill.  While I welcome it, it is a very minor effort at dealing with the overall problem of under-utilisation of land.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not avail of this opportunity to examine the reform report issued some years ago and to deal with the present major structural difficulties with regard to land.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not tackle the problem of the total under-utilisation of thousands of acres which could be in very valuable production at present.  The Bill, while useful, is not the type of measure we need at this time.  It goes a very small part of the way towards dealing with the central problem in our economy of the under-productive nature of the majority of the acreage, both marginal and good agricultural land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties in the area of land resettlement and rearrangement has been the discriminatory nature of some of the proposals in operation at present. In some cases when a farmer transfers his land he loses some benefits which he might otherwise have got.  The whole social welfare code appears to be working against such people, especially on the transfer of land to younger people.  I ask the Minister of State to take a very close look, with the Minister for Social Welfare, into the welfare arrangements applicable to farmers who are transferring their holdings.  One of the major handicaps to land transfer at present is that some farmers are substantially less well-off after transfer than they should be. This happens particularly in the small farming communities on the western seaboard. Many, because they qualify for unemployment assistance, on reaching pension age are substantially less well-off. Unless and until effective efforts are made to streamline our social welfare <Col N="1521" /> schemes to encourage people to transfer their holdings rather than discourage them the system which we have up to now will continue.  Many holdings which should be transferred will not be transferred, because farmers who are willing and anxious to do it cannot do so because of economic circumstances.  There is a need to look carefully into that area to see where encouragement can be given to enable farmers to transfer their holdings without being worse off than they were beforehand.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the attitude of the Government that now when discussion is taking place in relation to land structure generally and land mobility they decide to abolish the Land Commission.  The Land Commission have been criticised from time to time for delays in re-allocating holdings of which they had possession. In the cases I have examined in the 11 years since I was elected to this House I have found genuine and valid reasons in many case for the delays in transfers because the commission were dealing with complicated titles and issues of that nature.  The area is delicate and complex and there is need for a commission who are competent to deal effectively with the problems which arise.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the Government can mean what they say in relation to what is being done in this legislation and at the same time abolish such a commission who now have a more important role than ever to play in our developing agriculture scene.  There is still fragmentation of holdings all along the western seaboard which is hampering seriously the prospect of farm development.  Now when it is necessary to eliminate handicaps of this nature an existing body who have done remarkable work up to now are being abolished.  I do not believe that this Government know where they are going in this area.  To introduce legislation such as this which is designed to enable better utilisation of our land and better redistribution and resettlement in the whole land area while abolishing the Land Commission who have been doing this for years and years and who leave still an enormous amount of work to be finished does not <Col N="1522" /> add up.  Many holdings are complicated in title and the efforts of the commission are needed to rectify this situation.</P>
    <P>I agree that there is a need for education and for going ahead with the other areas that Deputy Carey spoke about, but we cannot ignore the real efforts being made by the Land Commission in the restructuring, resettlement and breaking down of this fragmentation of holdings which has been a serious handicap to land development.  When we are abolishing the Land Commission we must be very constructive in putting in their place some authority who will enable the work which has been done up to now to continue and to be expanded in the future.  This legislation, welcome as it is, is really a gesture and will not really face up to the real problems.  The Government seem to be going in two different directions, on the one hand introducing this type of legislation and on the other abolishing a commission who have done such tremendous work and who have still a valid and important part to play in the future in the area of land resettlement and restructuring.  I am at a loss to understand where the Government are going in this.  The Bill, welcome as it is, is merely tinkering with the problem and not dealing with the simple issues in the positive way that the farming community are demanding that the Government act at this time.  This is just another attempt at whitewash, a very weak measure which will not go anywhere near tackling the problem in the whole land area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my pleasure to welcome this Bill and I compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House. It is very desirable legislation.  Without this Bill it would be impossible to get a commitment from the farmers to co-operate with the Minister in the matter of land leasing.  This measure is vital to the whole future of agriculture and to getting the commitment and co-operation of farmers towards land leasing.  It is a step in the right direction over a long road that must be travelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of our greatest problems at this time is the amount of under-utilised land <Col N="1523" /> lying very often in the hands of people who are no longer able to farm it.  It is vital that the Minister encourage the total commitment of the farming organisations, Macra na Feirme, the IFA, the ICMSA and the co-operative movement to get as much of this land as possible leased to younger farmers many of whom now have agricultural training and are prepared to take risks and make a commitment to the development of Irish agriculture. For far too long too many Irish farms have remained under-utilised.  The amount in use at present is over 3.5 million acres.  If the under-utilised land was brought into full production one can imagine the massive impact it would have on the economy as a whole, on employment in the agri-sector and on agri-exports. As far as possible we should encourage mobility of land and this Bill will help to do that.</P>
    <P>A question very often asked is why farmers hold so rigidly on to their farms. I believe there are two reasons.  First, it gives farmers a certain degree of independence that they have this land and feel socially secure.  However, another question is that of social welfare entitlements, and I appeal to the Minister to examine this.  If a farmer leases or rents his farm, very often he ends up financially worse off and may very well deprive himself of certain social welfare benefits that he would be entitled to if he held on to it.  I ask the Minister to look into this to see what can be done under that heading. People are made redundant in different jobs, they get lump sum payments and then they go to pay-related unemployment benefit and perhaps later on to unemployment assistance.  If a farmer hands over a farm to a young man he has absolutely nothing to get in many cases. I ask the Minister to examine this.  I know it will cost money, but it is vital for the better development of agriculture that we try to get as much unutilised land as possible transferred to the hands of young people quickly, and the question of social welfare entitlements will have to be examined to secure that encouragement.</P>
    <P>Some farmers are extremely worried <Col N="1524" /> that if they lease land that the land will not be used as they would like it to be used.  Land leasing will eliminate many of their fears.  The present system of 11 months leasing was undesirable and it is questionable whether it should ever have been allowed.  Very often farmers who rent land under that system just try to knock as much out of it in the 11 months as they can.  The land leasing system will eliminate that.  It will encourage farmers who have land leased for five, seven, ten or whatever years to invest in that land by draining, reclaiming and fertilising it. When the land is returned to the lessee it will be in better condition.  Long term leasing is something all Government agencies should push to the maximum.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement to the effect that the people who are leasing land will no longer have to fear the lands being taken from them by the Land Commission.  Those leasing land in the past were terrified that this would happen.  I welcome the decision of the Minister to change the role of the Land Commission.  While that agency did some excellent work in the past, changing times necessitate changes in the method of operation of the system.  Very often the Land Commission, having purchased farms, left them idle for eight or ten years before settling them on the 11-month system.  When they were eventually allocated the land was in bad condition and there were no fences.</P>
    <P>The present system of group purchases is a step in the right direction and I compliment the Minister on it.  Tremendous progress can be made in that area.  The Minister should examine the possibility of facilitating a group involved in the purchase of land.  I accept that the Minister has introduced a new provision in regard to the legal formalities but it is my view that where three farmers purchase 40 or 50 acres the commission should value each portion of land and help the farmers in every way possible.  On the question of joint purchase it is of vital importance that farmers are given financial incentives.  Very often we will be depending on young people to lease those <Col N="1525" /> lands, but if in order to lease the land they must borrow at a rate of 15 per cent or 18 per cent it will be impossible for them to make a living from that enterprise. We should examine the possibility of making low interest loans available to young farmers involved in land leasing or group purchase.  Such improvements are vital for the development of agriculture. In this context we must take into consideration that it costs in the region of £15,000 to create an industrial job but a similar contribution should be made to improve agriculture.  The Government should consider making a similar investment by way of subsidied loans to young people anxious to get involved in land leasing.  If they get involved in that scheme they will be providing themselves with a way of living while at the same time bringing under-utilised land into production.  The result will be that industrial jobs will be created downstream.</P>
    <P>There should be a total commitment by commission officials about re-arrangements when the joint purchase scheme is in operation.  That was one aspect of the work of the commission I was never happy about.  Very often the commission preferred to give increased acreage to people without any commitment to eliminating the problem of fragmentation. Re-arrangement will be a vital part of the group purchase arrangement.  The Minister should ensure that local farmers will receive co-operation in regard to rearrangement.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems we may run into with the elimination of the Land Commission as a purchasing agent will be in regard to the sale of land to people who are not farmers or those who do not have any direct involvement in agriculture. The Minister should try to prevent this.  It is vital that the land of Ireland stays with Irish farmers.  They are best qualified to work the land and have a tradition and experience behind them. We should not encourage the sale of land to people who do not have any commitment to Irish agriculture whether by the introduction of a surcharge or some other means.  Money obtained from such a surcharge could be used to subsidise young <Col N="1526" /> farmers involved in leasing or group purchase projects.  Those schemes should get the full backing of the farm organisations and co-ops.  The country faces a major social problem in that there are 220,000 unemployed and we must try to create more employment directly from agriculture.</P>
    <P>Young farmers have not been encouraged to any great extent to remain on their farms instead of seeking industrial jobs. Very often the sons of farmers who possess 60 or 80 acres seek industrial jobs or go on AnCo training courses.  In their own interests, and in the interests of the State, would those young farmers not be better off employed helping to increase production on the farm?  One of the problems involved is a financial one.  Very often, even with the best will in the world, a father anxious to keep a son on a farm faces financial problems because of the limit on the amount of profit that can be obtained from the land.  We must try to encourage young people to stay on the land.  Huge grants are available for industrial training through AnCO schemes of one description or another and the Minister should investigate the possibility of getting young farmers to participate in those schemes with a view to continuing to work on the land.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to endeavour to get approval for a scheme of subsidied loans for those involved in group purchase or land leasing.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that huge sums of money have been left unspent under the western package. That money should be utilised to encourage the leasing or group purchase of land in the form of subsidised loans for young farmers.  I compliment the Minister on this worthwhile piece of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on having introduced this Bill and on the work done by himself and the organisations involved in the drawing up of this new leasing arrangement.  We are aware that over the years the Land Commission played a major part in the division of under-utilised land, in taking land <Col N="1527" /> from non-productive farmers for subdivision amongst smaller farmers in order to improve their holdings.</P>
      <P>I believe the proposals of this new leasing arrangement are worthwhile.  In recent years there has been less land taken over by the Land Commission, due mainly to its price.  These new proposals should ensure that such land is given to productive farmers, whether they have small or medium sized holdings, thereby ensuring a proper return from such land over a period of five, seven or nine years and that they will get that land back at the end of that period.  As has already been said, in many cases when they get that land back it will have been improved and in much better condition that when it was first leased.</P>
      <P>In my county small portions of land are at present being leased under the new system.  If we are to cater for farmers nearing the age of retirement, say 65, we must give them some incentive to avail of this new system of leasing their land. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that an incentive will be given which will mean that the first £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000 income from the letting of such lands in any one year be tax free, at the same time ensuring that the lessors of such property over a period of, say, five, seven or nine years will remain eligible for a pension. Such an exercise would not cost the State any money in real terms because none of the people about whom we are talking, who possessed non-productive land, has a taxable income anyway.  By ensuring proper usage of such land the country stands to benefit from a greater return from it.  We must guarantee some incentive to those people who heretofore did not avail of the retirement scheme because they feared it would leave them with less security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this scheme is to be successful in replacing the Land Commission method of getting land into the hands of more productive farmers, then such an incentive must be given.  I would suggest that the first £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000 income in any given year be non-taxable, constituting <Col N="1528" /> an incentive to farmers and yet costing the State nothing in real money terms.</P>
    <P>There are many older farmers &mdash; I am thinking now of those in my constituency &mdash; for whom there would be no incentive to participate in such a leasing system, most of whom will have been letting their lands on the 11-month system.  That 11-month system of leasing ensured that lessors were given back that land on 1 December each year, being free then to do whatever they wanted with it the following year.  As a result, many lessors failed to avail of the retirement scheme which had been available to them.  The 11-month system did not permit a lessee to make the best use of that land but rather to get the most out of it for that year without improving its condition through the use of fertilisers and so on. This meant also that the condition of the land remained static over a period of nine or ten years.  Under the proposed new leasing system this land will be given to productive farmers for a period of five, seven or nine years, to people who will care for it as though it was their own. At the same time it guarantees that the lessors stand to benefit.  They will receive an income and still remain eligible for an old age pension.  It will ensure also that younger people, say widows, not utilising the land in their possession will have an outlet, ensuring that that land will be available to their families in five, seven or ten years time.  There must be some headway made in regard to this type of leasing and, if such an incentive is not given in the next three years, then we shall not see this land leasing scheme take off as we would wish it to.</P>
    <P>Because of the relief allowed in regard to stamp duty inheritance tax in recent years there have been large tracts of land throughout the country changing hands, mostly to younger farmers, mostly sons of farmers.  This constituted a step in the right direction, guaranteeing that more land got into the hands of younger farmers at very little cost to the State.  Many people forget the value of our agricultural exports.  In this respect also, the more land transferred to younger farmers the <Col N="1529" /> greater will be the value of our export market, thereby reducing our balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>With the right incentives being given I am convinced we shall see large tracts of land throughout the country changing hands under this new leasing system, when the entire nation will stand to benefit because of increased production and a greater export potential.  We shall then also be moving away from the old 11-month system which, though not a bad system protected an individual farmer who wanted always to ensure control over the ownership of his land.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the role played by the Land Commission over the years.  I am convinced the reason they have not played such a large role in regard to the division of land in recent years has been the price that had to be paid for tracts of land which they were interested in purchasing.  They ensured that a large number of small farmers got proper holdings and were able to provide a living for themselves and their families.  I should like to see the inspectors work positively to dispose of the 40,000 acres of land which is still in the hands of the Land Commission.  I would not like to see a situation develop where we would not continue to give out land.  The fact that land is in possession of the Land Commission means we have a duty to ensure that it is put into the hands of farmers in need of it as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As a result of ACOT we have a very effective system of giving advice and so on to farmers.  The sooner we establish the land leasing system the better, because we have the mechanism to ensure that farmers get proper advice.  If we distribute the land it will mean that we will have greater production and that in turn will help the economy.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the group purchasing scheme.  Over a period of eight months there have been 118 different purchase schemes.  This has taken over the role of the Land Commission. Under the group purchasing scheme a number of farmers in need of a portion of land come together to purchase land which comes on the market.  If the <Col N="1530" /> scheme is to continue perhaps we should consider the introduction of an interest subsidy for small farmers.  I was involved in one or two such purchases this year for a number of local farmers and they see it as a way forward.  Regardless of what land costs and what the State has to pay for it, it would not cost the State as much if it gave a small interest subsidy to people with small holdings who would then be in a position to purchase more land and increase their holdings.  Perhaps something on the lines of the Housing Finance Agency loan could be investigated. This would mean that small farmers would only have to pay a portion of their income in repayments.  If these areas were investigated we would get better results in our balance of payments and in production generally.</P>
    <P>If land leasing is to be successful we must give incentives to farmers.  If farmers are prepared to lease their land, particularly those who are near retirement age, perhaps we could consider giving them the first £3,000 or £4,000 tax free and still allow them to be eligible for pension.  In that way there would be thousands of acres of land available for leasing.  Farmers would be assured that they still owned the land and could give it to members of their family whenever they wanted to.  I ask the Minister to do all he can to ensure that incentives are given.  The proposal I have just made should also be extended to widows.  This would allow them to earn £4,000 or £5,000 a year tax free and still retain their land for their family when they became of age to work it.  Land could be leased to people who are willing and able to get a return from it.</P>
    <P>We have had a very successful tillage year this year, particularly as far as corn is concerned.  There are large amounts of land in tillage areas which could be made available under this scheme.  We, as public representatives, have a role to play in this.  If the 40,000 acres which the Land Commission hold were transferred to developing farmers at least half a million acres of land would be available for leasing if incentives were given.  There is no point in introducing legislation unless <Col N="1531" /> incentives are given to the people who own the land.  If we do that we will reap the benefit of it in terms of the return that will be got from that land.  I compliment the Minister on the strides that have been made by him in two years and we look forward to continuing strides being made in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on this Bill.  It is probably one of the most important Bills to come before the House.  No one underestimates the function that land plays in the development, operation and wellbeing of our economy.</P>
      <P>Land is basic to our survival.  It is fixed in its location and, unfortunately for a number of people who would like to own it, it is limited in supply.  We are bounded by seas on all sides so the opportunity to increase the availability of land is hindered in that respect.  In modern societies land is used for a number of different functions apart from being the primary production base for food.  The availability of land for housing, utility and services, not to mention the development of roads, and for factories is something that we tend to overlook.  There has been a gradual erosion of our land bank by these things.  They are part and parcel of the development of our economy.  However, we should not underestimate the impact this has on the total acreage of land available for agricultural cultivation.</P>
      <P>I have always believed that the policies pursued by every Government should be to maintain the maximum number of people on the land.  This is our greatest natural resource and we should maintain as many family farm holdings as possible. Unfortunately, all the indicators have shown that there has been an accelerated decrease in the numbers involved in agricultural production and in the industry generally over the last ten or 12 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximising of the productive capacity of the land is the kernel of this Bill.  Since we joined the EC and got increased prices for our agricultural products people have been encouraged to look <Col N="1532" /> at marginal land.  Technology has helped bring a great part of this land into productive use.  This is an ongoing process which I hope will continue to be encouraged. The farm modernisation scheme and the grant scheme which preceded it encouraged the improvement and reclaiming of this marginal land to bring it into the productive land bank.  The expansion of our acreage under forestry has taken place on marginal land.  The potential for the development of afforestation and sound industry based on afforestation is very real.  I hope the Minister with responsibility in this area will recognise the potential for employment in afforestation as well as the development of the processing industry.</P>
    <P>Another area we tend to underestimate is the energy field.  We do not think of our bogs as part of our land mass, but they are.  They have been a very valuable source of energy down the years.  While the research and development work in the area of biomass is at a preliminary stage, I would like to think that the State agencies with responsibility in this area will get the money and resources needed from the Government to apply themselves in this area.  It is an open secret that the crisis which occurred over the last ten years upended our economy.  All efforts should be channelled towards the procurement of different sources of energy.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that trees grow on land, but the Deputy is moving away from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt I had to make that point because it is very relevant to land use and land structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Livestock rearing, cereal growing and the cultivation of root crops have been our principal agricultural lines and there is no indication we will move from those areas to any great extent.  They have served the industry well.  An Foras Talúntas have done a tremendous job in the area of research and development and they have helped increase the productivity of many of these crops.  They <Col N="1533" /> have contributed greatly to the economic wellbeing of those involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>Recently there has been a very steady trend towards part time farming.  The concept of a person working in industry while rearing a family on a small holding has become very attractive because the farm holding is unable to sustain the family economically.  The trend towards part time farming has been accelerated and all indications are that it will continue to accelerate in the foreseeable future. The average size of the family holding dictates that it will no longer be economically viable for these farmers to devote all this time to their farms.  For many centuries our land was relatively underdeveloped and it was only when we became part of the EC that the necessary cash flow became available for the development of these holdings.</P>
    <P>Another worrying trend has been the increase since the sixties in the number of land holders as distinct from farmers. Land has been bought by people whose primary occupation is not farming.  Many small holders have been deprived of access to land which could have been a lifeline for them, because the land was bought by people who made their money outside farming.  If that trend continues it will have very serious implications for the industry and could accelerate the flight from the land.  Farmers, as distinct from land holders, occupied 1.5 million acres fewer in 1971 than they did in 1961. That illustrates the movement of land to land holders who are not farmers.  In the same period it was estimated that 276,000 acres were taken out of agricultural production for commercial, industrial and afforestation purposes.  That is a very significant figure because it shows that there is a decreasing amount of land available for agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal now with the land tenure system, the farm size and fragmented holdings, that is, where a small holding is complemented by another small holding a few miles down the road. While this might be a satisfactory arrangement to an extent, it does not maximise the productive capacity of the <Col N="1534" /> farmer in question &mdash; the amount of time he spends travelling between his two holdings, the lack of supervision and so on. These are hidden flaws which we tend to underestimate.</P>
    <P>The land structure system we have is merely a reflection of the historic, geographic, economic and social evolution that has taken place.  It is really a product of our history.  The different types of land occupancy we had that came from the Brehon Laws era and the evolution that has taken place during the years has left us with our present set-up.  Perhaps this Bill will introduce a new element into the whole area of land mobility.  There is general agreement that there is urgent need for reform of land tenure and land structure to maximise the economic benefits to the economy as a whole.  In many ways we have been the victim &mdash; perhaps that is not the best word &mdash; of the concept of security of occupancy.  This is very much a sacred thing in rural Ireland. History has taught people that having a holding gives a sense of security.  Perhaps it is not viewed in the strict economic sense but in the sense of security given to the farm family.  The memories of the old tenant system live on in many parts of the country and they tend to create a great fear in the minds of many farmers.</P>
    <P>Land mobility is a very desirable objective. It will be achieved not as a result of any one measure but by a number of different measures that will complement one another.  Traditionally, inheritance and succession have been the principal vehicles for change of ownership and land mobility but this is slow and cumbersome and does not provide the opportunity for the social reform that the Government and those who have a deep interest in agriculture would like to see achieved. However, it is a fact of life and it will remain with us.</P>
    <P>The concept of providing resources to encourage land leasing is new.  If it will help in any way to break the mould of the one to three year conacre system it will be worthwhile.  If any one factor has militated against the development of agriculture it is the conacre system.  The person who takes the land on conacre has <Col N="1535" /> no incentive to improve it or to carry out the necessary development works and the upgrading of the land that is so necessary. He has no incentive to spend money on fertiliser, lime or seeds.  If the concept of land leasing improves the situation it will be worthwhile but I remain to be convinced that it will to any great extent bring about the desired improvement that we all wish to see.</P>
    <P>We all agree on the desirability of a farmer handing over his farm to his son or daughter, particularly when that young person has availed of the educational courses in agriculture during recent years.  The sooner such young people are encouraged to take over the management of farms the better.  However, we must not disregard the need for judgment in this area.  Youthful enthusiasm needs to be balanced with the experience gained during many years of hard work on the land and this combination should provide the ideal solution.  In many cases it does not because of the different approaches of the old and the young which have militated against a successful operation.</P>
    <P>The encouragement of the farm partnership arrangement in recent years should be continued to the benefit of the operation of holdings.  However, it has proved difficult to blend the ideas of the young and old in many cases.  The retirement of a farmer at 60 or 65 years as distinct from controlling the holding until he reaches 75 years or 80 years is a worthwhile objective but I am afraid this Bill does not deal with that matter.  Perhaps the kind of legislation necessary may prove difficult but that fact should not preclude us from doing something to help in this area.  For a farmer who has reached retirement age the matter of security of holding is very important.  We will have to wait and see if it will be possible to introduce a proper pension scheme to replace the sense of security that ownership gives.  The Minister must give consideration to this matter which should have top priority.  We will need to do something on these lines if we are to have the kind of land mobility that is necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> I may have strayed somewhat in my contribution but I have expressed a few thoughts regarding this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>If we discuss precisely what is in this Bill we will have a rather limited and technical debate.  Most of us will take the liberty to discuss problems generally and what might have been included in a Bill like this.  The Minister did the right thing in confining himself to what was absolutely necessary before there is any possibility of getting a land leasing system off the ground.  At this stage he has confined himself to eliminating the major difficulties that have arisen for people who are contemplating entering this kind of arrangement.  It is not possible to start a system of land leasing without introducing legislation such as this but that does not mean this is all that is necessary in order to change the system by which land is transferred and worked.</P>
      <P>Even if we go further at the moment, at least we will see if people proceed to avail of the improved conditions and we may find it necessary to introduce other measures, incentives or subsidies.  It has been made easier for them to avail of land leasing arrangements.  It is said continually that subsidies or incentives are needed to encourage people to take certain steps but of course we could approach the question from another angle.  We could make it more difficult for people to hold on to natural resources that are so important for the development of our economy.  We could make much more difficult the climate in which people would retain land that is under-utilised. Perhaps that would be another way of creating an incentive.  But most people who have contributed to this debate have talked of subsidies and incentives.  That is a safe line to take especially when one is in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole matter of agriculture in Ireland is considered in an outdated way. Agriculture is not considered as a business. The majority of people involved in agriculture see it more as a way of life than as a business.  They are proud of the tradition which has been handed down to them through generations; the standard <Col N="1537" /> of living is only secondary.  It became popular for politicians to go along with that attitude, to say to people that they will be helped to remain on the farms they have inherited, that they will be helped to do so, but that is to forget that we have developed an economic situation which has resulted in one-third of our people being congregated in this city. That is the direct opposite of what we were proposing.  Not only did we fail to keep the people on the land, while expressing these pious platitudes, but we failed to keep them in the villages.  We allowed them to congregate in one coastal area so that there are now too many in that area for the services that are available.  That is the difference between expressing our wishes as to what we should like to see happening and doing something about it.</P>
    <P>Farming is about the business of producing food.  It should be regarded in the same way as is any other business.  We should endeavour to move away as much as possible from the emotive terms of landlordism and so on, from talking of what happened a couple of hundred years ago.  While it is good to know our history in that respect, it is not good to continue to carry the inhibitions and the insecurities which were probably reasonable 150 or 200 years ago but which are only a disadvantage today.  People do not starve any more in these parts of the world if they do not own 20 or 30 acres of land. There is no possibility that by developing a new land leasing system we will create a situation in which a landlord will have absolute power over those people who lease land from him.  We are in a new situation.  It is obvious to anyone that, using science, technology and education, the potential of the land of Europe is almost limitless.  We do not need more land in order to produce sufficient food. There is a surplus of beef in Europe and for the first time ever there is a surplus of coarse grains this year.  There is also surplus production of sugar beet.  These are the foods that Irish farmers produce. We can sell foodstuffs to countries outside the EC but not at the prices we want. On the world market we would not get <Col N="1538" /> enough to cover the cost of producing these foods.  Therefore, we must be content to think in the European context though the American situation may be relevant.  The matter of putting food on the market is not a big problem any more. The emphasis in the future must be on the processing side now that we have the opportunity to add value and so on.</P>
    <P>Any measure introduced here should be designed to make our agricultural industry more efficient.  There is still the hankering after the family farm though I am not sure any more what that means. We tend to think that the ideal situation is to have the maximum number of farms that is consistent with a decent standard of living but we think in terms of one labour unit.  Today young farmers often wish to marry at 20 or 22 years of age. This can mean that in 20 years time, though only 40, he may have an heir who is 20 years old, who is trained and ready to work the farm.  If we think of the age of the re-elected President of the US, we can visualise there being four generations in terms of inheritance of land.  In that sense we would be talking about a farm for four labour units.  In the modern world also there is the factor that the spouse of a farmer will be demanding a right to work on the farm.  At a minimum we are talking about farms that employ two labour units.  Transition is usually from father to son by way of partnership. Difficulties may arise in any partnership but a father and son partnership is natural.</P>
    <P>In any event, we must think in terms of a family farm that will provide work and an income for two or possibly three labour units.  In the past the position has been usually two labour units but only one income.  Whatever we may say about the unemployment situation I do not think that future generations will have the same sentiment as those who have gone before them in relation to staying on the land.  I do not think they will remain on the land if they cannot have the same standard of living as would be available to them in other walks of life. Therefore, we must apply ourselves <Col N="1539" /> seriously to the question of viable agricultural units.</P>
    <P>I am not among those who object to land being bought by people who are not farmers.  There are some who may refer to such people as speculators but my attitude is that they should have the right to buy land if they so wish.  Devices could be applied to encourage people to make proper use of land and if they failed in that respect we could take steps such as those I outlined earlier.  I do not consider that agriculture should be the preserve of those who have been living on the land.  In recent years particularly there has been speculation in land.  Farmers were as guilty as everybody else as regards pushing up the price of land but recently, however, land has found its market value. In the past prices paid for land and for leases bore little relationship to the return that could be got from it.  This is the crux of the matter: farmers want a return from the land.  The person leasing the land wants to get a return from that and the lessee also wants to get a return for any investment he makes in the land by way of machinery, stock and so on.  He also wants to get a return for his labour.  Agricultural land does not yield that kind of return for one person never mind two people, given the level of productivity, interest rates and so on.</P>
    <P>If we subsidise this from whom will we take the money?  It will be from other taxpayers.  In doing so we will reduce the number of jobs that could be created elsewhere.  At the end of the day we might only succeed in pushing up the price of the lease still further.  No matter how it is approached, if it is decided to give a direct subsidy to a farmer who is purchasing a lease, the chances are that in a competitive situation he will pay more for the lease.  The price of the lease could also be pushed up if the guaranteed price for an agricultural product was increased.  The beneficiary in the end will be the person who is retiring and handing over the land and not the person who will farm the land.  The Minister must look at this very carefully.</P>
    <P>Many people say that the first thing to do is subsidise it and who cares who pays <Col N="1540" /> for it.  Others say to let the EC subsidise it.  Last year we received net benefits to the tune of £640 million and considering the budgetary position it is only wishful thinking to imagine that we will get significant assistance for new policies.  We can re-organise whatever way we want to and have improved structures at the expense of guarantees but we will not have an extended budget.  What more can we do other than what the Minister did?  We must look at the funds that are available to us and at what can be raised through taxation, put them together and ask how best we can use this money to promote the development of land and create the maximum number of jobs.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk and sentiment expressed about tailoring the size of a unit to meet the needs of a family. We have ended up with one third of our people being accommodated on the east coast and this shows that all the talk from the different political parties was just a pious aspiration.  There was no real action.</P>
    <P>In Germany they have paid the price for retaining small inefficient farms.  They have given such farmers part time jobs. They have been subsidised in efficient commercial and industrial activities. They have a beautiful countryside and have maintained life in the rural areas. Even in the mountain areas they have spare time farmers.  Most of these have full time jobs.  They farm in the evenings, on Sundays, during holidays and so on.</P>
    <P>Jobs are scarce and we need more of them.  It is a politically sore point but we must bear in mind that it costs between £20,000 and £40,000 to create an industrial job.  Is it reasonable to spend such money on the creation of an industrial job, to give a person social security and so on and then proceed to subsidise him on a farm as well?  There are 60,000 farmers who earn £5,000 or £6,000 a year. We need to study this matter more.  Just because it is popular does not mean it is right.  Can we afford to subsidise two jobs for anyone, one on the land and one in a factory?  Is agriculture any more entitled to be subsidised than manufacturing industry?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> We regard the percentage of people who are on the land as very good.  We have 20 per cent of people on the land and they produce 13 per cent of GNP. What is exported in terms of food is beside the point.  What they produce is less than their share of GNP.  I do not say that is their fault.  It is the fault of the system within which they work and of international markets.</P>
    <P>In an economic plan published by the Opposition some years ago they forcast that 3,000 people per year would leave the land.  Time has borne out their predictions. The rate is slowing down now basically because work has become scarce elsewhere.  The old argument was that if we did not provide people with a living on the land they would go to the cities but why go to the cities now when there is no employment there?  If we are to have work sharing on the land, why not have it in industry as well?</P>
    <P>We should cut out a lot of the sentiment and take a hard look at the whole matter. We must be realistic and assess how much money we need to invest and whether we would get a return for it.  In Europe the countries with the highest proportion of people working on the land are Portugal, Spain, Greece, Italy, and our country is next.  Generally speaking the higher the percentage of people on the land the lower the standard of living.  In America, GDP is three times greater than ours but they have only 2½ per cent of the population on the land.  They produce enough to feed themselves and many other people in the world.  Our objective must be to ensure that the land is utilised in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>When we speak about structuring we must bear in mind the points made by the previous speaker about the different uses of land.  The main crops which we produce are now surplus to our needs.  We depend on prices in the EC because it would be very difficult to sell our products in the world market.  As we have to sell on the European market we may have quotas for an indefinite time in beef and cereals although I would prefer to get <Col N="1542" /> back to a sensible policy which would encourage competition.</P>
    <P>The Minister must ask whether it is necessary to provide new incentives and encouragement in the form of subsidisation. A farm retirement scheme was introduced a few years ago to encourage people to leave the land but there were many other schemes which had the direct opposite effect.  They encouraged people to hold on to their land for dear life.  We must look at the sum of £250 million per annum which is provided for agriculture and see whether it can be increased.  Perhaps we are not making the best use of it.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the abolition of the Land Commission.  When Mr. Gibbons was Minister for Agriculture he told the Land Commission not to buy any more land and to get rid of their existing land.  None of the Ministers since then changed that order.  I wonder if the Land Commission will ever have all the land divided.  Somebody said today that they still have 40,000 acres under their control and I am sure they are as anxious to hang on to that as any old farmer is to hold on to land.  For some reason they are dragging their feet in this regard.</P>
    <P>During the past year and a half all the land in the west could have been divided by the officers there if they worked hard for a month.  Furthermore, there was no sense in the way some of the land was divided.  I know they are conscientious people who are trained to a particular job but they were only as good as the system within which they worked.  There were social and economic considerations which they had to take into account and they never knew where they stood.  The result was that it was given to people who did not even stock the land they had.  I questioned this policy and the Minister told me he could not do anything about it. I also questioned officers of the Land Commission and they said that it was only a temporary situation and that the land would be stocked after a while.  Why do intelligent, trained officers give land to people who have no intention of working it?  They do not have the capability, finance, knowledge or the will to work it. <Col N="1543" /> It is given to them for social reasons and in the hope that even if a farmer is not capable of working it that his sons will do better in 20 years time.  Land should only be given to people who are ready to work it as soon as they get it and, if that does not happen, it should be repossessed by the Land Commission and given to somebody who would work it.  If there was no one available in the area, the land could be used for afforestation or amenity parks.</P>
    <P>Unless we become much more efficient with regard to the production of food we will have to think seriously about alternative uses for our land.  We should think seriously about the areas of energy and afforestation.  I read recently that trees are being developed which will improve the performance of forest crops by about 25 per cent or 30 per cent.  We need long term planning to decide how much of our land we should use for amenity purpose and how much should be preserved in its natural state.  The whole question of land is not as simple as it is made out to be.  It is still an emotive matter in rural areas but it is our duty, as politicians, to introduce a note of realism and to tell farmers that they are another industry which produces goods and that they must do so at competitive prices.  If the cost is too dear it reduces the standard of living of the people who buy their produce.  It is not just a matter of devising a plausible policy which will attract votes.</P>
    <P>In the late seventies when conditions were right and prices attractive, our agriculture expanded more rapidly than anywhere else in the EC, even Holland and Denmark.  However, things have changed since then and today if you gave land to a young farmer and told him he could have it for nothing if he equipped it and bought livestock in order to get a return on his capital, he would not be able to do so.  People took risks in the seventies but not many farmers take risks today. Fortunately, the price of land has dropped and the Minister and the Government must be very careful not to do anything which will encourage people to <Col N="1544" /> pay more for it because in Ireland, for all the emotive reasons which were mentioned, we tend to remember the price of land but not the value.</P>
    <P>Recently many young people have come to me asking if they could get a loan to buy land.  I have to tell them that even at the reduced price of land they must be prepared to work the land for the first seven or eight years or subsidise it from existing holdings.  You wonder how the sentimentality can survive that causes people to want to buy land.  It is up to the Minister to give leadership and one good example is his campaign to bring groups of farmers together and offering the facility of the advice of his Department.  This is an example of what can be done without pushing up costs and without involving any more taxation.  It could have an immense effect.</P>
    <P>We had this sort of leadership a few years ago when Mr. Clinton was Minister for Agriculture.  He succeeded in encouraging farmers just by advising them to grow more cereal crops.  Apart from subsidisation and incentives we must encourage people.  We need training and education so that our farmers will be as efficient as they are any place else.  People ask what does the future hold for meat, beef and cereals.  The answer is to use the science and technology, education and training which are available in this State. If we can achieve that, we will survive.  If not, we will not survive.</P>
    <P>The European lesson has taught us to use the free markets.  Ireland would probably have done better with a more severe pricing system for milk.  The less interference by Government and State agencies the better.  We must ensure that our young people are well trained and well educated.  We need to create an economic environment in which they can get a return from their investment and their hard work.  Otherwise only the fittest will survive.  That does not mean we will let the weak starve.  We must encourage people with initiative and enterprise.  At present that is not possible for one reason or another.  You cannot invest money in agriculture and get a return.  There is no return for hard work and investment in <Col N="1545" /> agriculture at present for a number of reasons.  One is that we have not got the skills.  Some of our farmers are the best in the world but quite a number are not.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to take into consideration what I have said.  I want to congratulate him on the efforts he has made over the past few years.  He is expected to provide millions to finance every whim.  That will not work.  Within the limits of his budget he has used the resources which are available to him more than anyone else who has had his job.</P>

      <P>I want to speak very briefly on this Land Bill and compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House.  One wonders how suitable it will be in some parts of Ireland and, in particular, in the west of Ireland and in parts of my constituency where land can be used for a few months of the year only. This was an exceptionally good year and the land in that part of Ireland was used for a longer period than ever before.</P>
      <P>I deplore the Government's decision to abolish the Irish Land Commission. They tried to justify their action on cost cutting grounds, alleging that the Land Commission had outlived their usefulness. In the 11 western counties which come under the farm modernisation scheme, 80 per cent of the farmers have less than 50 acres, and 41 per cent have less than 30 acres, which is well below the acreage necessary to give an average standard of living.  Yet the Land Commission are being abolished.  This will have an effect in the west in particular where we have that percentage of small farmers. I do not agree with that decision.  When the Land Commission are abolished, when farms come on the market for sale, the wealthiest people will buy that land. Whether or not you live in a congested area, it is the wealthiest people who will buy the land.  As I said, I deplore that decision, especially as it will affect the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am the owner of a 30 acre farm. How can anybody think you could make a living on a 30 acre farm today in an area where the land is not very good and where <Col N="1546" /> it badly needs to be drained?  Recently the IFA wrote to all Deputies deploring the fact that the Department have refused to accept applications for drainage since February 1984.  To all intents and purposes there is no field drainage scheme in operation in the western counties. Farmers who want to do such work have no possibility of getting State or commercial assistance at present.</P>
    <P>The IFA had a meeting in Dublin recently with Commissioner Dalsager who said he was very concerned that the Irish Government should make an application for an extension to the western drainage scheme.  We are talking about land leasing when, unfortunately these schemes are not available.  I know they are mentioned in the national plan as being available in two years' time.  Why are they not available at the moment? They have done wonderful work.  I am sure the Minister sitting opposite to me knows that better than anybody else, because he comes from the west.  Arterial drainage work was carried out and farms were improved immensely.  The quicker we get a policy on land drainage and arterial drainage the better.  When Deputy MacSharry was Minister for Agriculture he had such a policy.</P>
    <P>I should like to highlight those few points and ask the Minister to do what he can.  I am not here to criticise him or any member of the Government.  Those policies were of immense benefit to the farmers in the west.  A big drainage scheme is needed in my own constituency. If the Arrow and Owenmore rivers were drained the farmers in that catchment area could produce much more milk, more beef and more sheep.  We need land reclamation and re-seeding of the land, especially for sheep farmers. This would lead to massive increases in output because the sheep could be fattened and sent to the French and Italian markets where there is an outlet for them.</P>
    <P>Land leasing is very well suited to parts of the country and particularly the areas where the land is better.  Where land can be used for a few months of the year only, one wonders how suitable this Land Bill <Col N="1547" /> will be.  Deputy McCartin comes from my own constituency and I have a great admiration for him.  He said that in Germany the Government were helping farmers and part time farmers and giving them grants to work their farms.  Until the last few years, the Government have been encouraging part time farmers by giving them good grants.  Today, if a farmer earns more than £3,500 on a part time job &mdash; and what person is working today for less than that amount?  &mdash; he will not qualify for sheep or cattle head-age payments or any grant of that kind. This is a shame.  Small farmers working with the county council earn £5,000 a year, as does a forestry worker and a factory worker.  These people are deprived of what Deputy McCartin said they were entitled to in Germany.  Our part time farmers should be encouraged to do more with their land and the few pounds they got from these grants were very encouraging.</P>
    <P>At present an application has been made to the European Parliament with regard to the reclassification of disadvantaged areas.  Unfortunately, the entire reclassification programme will be delayed for at least one year because the Government did not submit the necessary documents.  That is shameful.  The North Connacht Farmers and Donegal Creameries have been working for many years to have the disadvantaged areas, which include west Cork and all the western seaboard, reclassified so that the farmers there will receive the same grants as their counterparts in France and Italy. The UK have made an application to have their land in the disadvantaged areas reclassified.  No area is more disadvantaged than our western seaboard.  The whole mountain range from west Cork to the top of Malin Head needs to be reclassified so that the farmers will have the best benefits, grants and subsidies available.  They need them to live in this part of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is well aware that unemployment assistance has very severely hit the small farmers in that area. <Col N="1548" /> I hope, a Cheann Comhairle, that I am not wandering away from the subject under debate.</P>

      <P>If I may intervene, a discussion on unemployment assistance would be relevant in so far as it related to a rent that a lessor might get from the land.

      <P>If small farmers lease their land, that money will be taken into account when they are being assessed. The farmers who have been sending milk to the creamery will find it very difficult to survive in the winter months without that form of assistance known as the farmers' dole &mdash; unemployment assistance. Regardless of whether they lease or buy land or develop land which they are using, they will suffer hardship.  A farmer with a wife and five children who has seven milking cows has lost his unemployment assistance because of the small amount of money which he makes in the few summer months.  If these farmers had some type of assistance during the winter months, they would be quite happy to lose that assistance while the milk is good for the summer months.</P>

      <P>We all welcome the proposal of land leasing.  As we all know, an 11 months system was in practice, which was unsuitable.  The farmer who leased land for five years would build up a standard of living in that period and might have extra cattle, but when he loses that land one wonders what he is going to do.  I hope that some policy will be introduced to enable that man to continue to survive.</P>
      <P>Now that the Government have decided to abolish the Land Commission, I hope that something will be done to protect the farmers in the areas in the west where 80 per cent of the farmers have less than 50 acres and 41 per cent have less than 30 acres.  If a farmer with a 30 acre farm wishes to buy an adjacent 30 acres, I hope his entitlement to it will be put before that of some wealthy foreigner.  This is going to be difficult, but if we want to keep farmers interested in staying on their land, something will have to be done now that the Land Commission has been abolished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this Land Bill.  After many months of conditioning as to the great revolutionary land reform that was to be brought in under this Bill, what have we got?  We have a damp squib.  This Bill was to be the panacea for all the ills of retiring farmers and for the young people looking for new land.  It has failed to do anything for those people, despite the publicity which went on over the last year or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill removes some of the legal and technical obstacles to leasing, but it should encourage land leasing and this it fails to do.  The measures in the Bill will give adequate safeguards to both lessor and lessee regarding ownership of land and fair rent, provisions for the review of rent and some compensation for the <Col N="1550" /> lessee who provides farm buildings on the holding or improves it.  There is also provision for arbitration in cases of differences arising between the lessor and lessee.  These measures are welcome and are not before their time, but are they sufficient, are they far reaching enough to encourage people to transfer and take up land?  I believe they are not.  What do people need when they wish to transfer or lease land?  They need safeguards to assure and convince them that when they transfer or lease their land they will not be worse off financially for the rest of their lives.  The Bill goes some way towards meeting this need for those who will lease their land.  However, as most of the land in this country moves between related persons it is in the field of transfers that attention should be directed.  The social welfare system generally does not encourage the transfer of land between relations.  Conditions laid down by the Revenue Commissioners, such as reversionary clauses and conditions in the transfer deed regarding payments to other members of the family when, say, parents are transferring the land to one son, can prevent those parents from qualifying for an old age pension.  Such obstacles are inhibiting many parents from transferring the land. This matter should be looked into in detail with a view to making the transfer of land easier.  Of course conditions must be laid down but the present conditions are too strict.</P>
    <P>The farm retirement scheme has not been as successful as was envisaged because the increases in the annuities fell behind the increases in the old age pension and social welfare benefits.  People who went into the scheme have lost out and it is no wonder that now the scheme has died.  It is essential that a comprehensive, attractive and realistic retirement scheme be put forward to encourage land transfer.  Many young people who have been educated in agricultural colleges and have served their apprenticeship on farms are now wondering what to do. They are over-qualified and under-paid farm labourers who should be managing <Col N="1551" /> farms or running their own farm businesses, but they face great obstacles. Even if they meet a farmer who is willing to lease a farm to them, they must come up with finance.  The financial position today is very difficult and the extremely high rates of interest are a deterrent to anybody going ahead with a great risk enterprise such as farming.  One experience of bovine TB or brucellosis or a bad winter can wipe out a person's investment. A policy should be introduced whereby young people going into farming would be able to get long term, attractive, fixed interest rate loans.  At least then they would know what their commitments would be over a certain time and would not have to depend on the market rate.  The sad experience of the last ten years has been that interest rates rose alarmingly and knocked many farmers out of business.  The policy I have suggested would encourage young people to take the risk.</P>
    <P>At present with milk quotas, super-levies, beef mountains and sugar and beet quotas, what is a young person entering farming to do?  What is he going to produce? Is it more beef, more milk, more beet, more grain?  There is a surplus of all these products on the market today. A person would be taking a great risk in going in on the offchance that he would be able to break into these markets and make a success there.  The Department of Agriculture should look at other products and consider initiating a policy under which horticultural development would be examined.  Widespread training of young people in marketing, production and processing by the semi-State organisations such as ACOT, the Agricultural Institute, the IDA, CTT and the Department of Agriculture should be considered. We should be able to take advantage of products and markets in the horticulture field.  We are importing vast amounts of agricultural produce and a real effort must be put into import substitution by Irish products.  Here is a chance for young people to make a success of farming.  ACOT have a big role to play in this development, but at the moment <Col N="1552" /> their hands are tied.  They have been directed to devote their services to a narrow band of better off farmers who are in the best position to pay for their services.  Many small farmers who are rearing and educating young families are being neglected by this anti-social policy which in the long run will stunt farm production.  It will stop people from such families from leasing land because they will not have the means to pay for advice from ACOT, therefore they will be unable to lease land.  ACOT should aim at the broad mass of farmers and not, as at present, at the privileged few.</P>
    <P>A policy of central control, such as that of the Land Commission, should be considered with a view to helping the young people in the distribution of land. More power should be given to local committees of agriculture.  Over-centralisation can stunt the development of leasing as people in a central bureaucracy tend not to know the details of each situation.</P>
    <P>This Bill fails to tackle the serious problems affecting land distribution.  Its contents, though correct, will do nothing to promote the transfer and proper utilisation of our land resources.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Members who contributed to the debate on the Bill in recent weeks. As one might expect in regard to any legislation dealing with land the Bill evoked a great deal of interest here and in the Seanad some months ago.  There has been a welcome for the Bill from all sides and that is as I had hoped.  Many side issues were referred to in the debate on other aspects of agriculture which though very important are not relevant to the Bill.  In the Bill I set certain targets and I believe they can be attained.  Its provisions will mean that there will be a new concept in agriculture.  The whole area of land leasing has been mentioned frequently in the last 20 years but for some strange reason in those years no Government saw fit to bring to the House a Bill to implement the suggestions put forward by various committees that considered land leasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1553" /> Land leasing is a new concept here.  I must make it clear that the terms of the Bill are not confined to any area.  It appears that some Members from small farming areas, like mine, believe that the Bill will apply to the north-west only. That is not true.  Up to now land rented for a period in excess of 11 months was subject to certain conditions.  Under certain circumstances the tenant was not obliged to leave that land on the expiry of the lease.  The important point is that I can give a categoric assurance to farmers who believe that their best interests will be served by getting into medium or long term leasing that the contract entered into with a tenant will be binding and that on the expiry of the lease they will get their land back.  That is the central message in the legislation.  Tenants will have to accept that whatever deal they enter into with farmers they do not have a right to be on the land after the expiry of the lease.  I hope that through Members, the media and the farming organisations that message will get across.</P>
    <P>There is a great suspicion among many farmers that if they enter into medium or long term contracts they may not get their land back.  The Bill sets out to repeal legislation that goes back to 1881.  The only criticism that I can accept of it is in regard to the length of time it has taken to produce it.  It is almost 18 months since I set about having this legislation prepared and at that time I had hoped to have it before the House six months later. However, it has proved to be a complicated exercise in that we had to go through all land legislation.  The leasing arrangement will open up new avenues for many farmers.  A great deal of energy has been expended here outlining the aspirations of young farmers but they are not the only people that will be helped by the provisions of the Bill.  It is well known that in the last four or five years many farmers over-extended themselves on land purchases.  For whatever reason, possibly the air of optimism that existed, it did not appear to make any difference what price a farmer was asked for land as long as he bought it.  The view was, &ldquo;Every day will be rosier than the one <Col N="1554" /> that went before&rdquo;.  In this harsh world many very good farmers have found themselves in great trouble for no other reason than that they bought land that was too expensive.</P>
    <P>I am opening up a new avenue for those people.  There will be another way for people to work farms without owning the land.  This happens in other EC countries to a greater degree than here.  One message I should like to get across today is that under certain conditions people can make a living from land leasing.  I must admit that the individual will have to be highly trained and have a good back up service from his family farm.  However, I am creating an environment whereby there will be sustainable jobs in agriculture for those who want to work on the land without owning it.  There are many farmers living on uneconomic holdings who have a stark choice now.  Unless they get extra land or an off-farm job they will be in trouble.  Land leasing in such cases will help those farmers.</P>
    <P>It appears that the duration of leases will be between five and seven years.  Last year there was a great deal of activity on land leasing.  Farming organisations are very interested in this and that was evident at the many seminars I attended. On occasions up to 600 farmers attended those seminars.  Last year two master leases were introduced.  When I was a member of Macra na Feirme 12 years ago, I went on a deputation to a Minister for Agriculture in an effort to get the Land Commission to make master leases available.  The leases were made available through the good offices of the IFA, the Incorporated Law Society and the ICOS.  They represent complicated documents for a person who would not understand what was taking place.  I want to make it clear that all that is involved is a master lease from which we can work.  In the last ten years there has been reason to believe that, if two farmers wanted to enter into a contract for medium to long term land leasing, it was quite difficult to get the legal profession to have much to do with it.  It was an area in which the legal profession were not particularly interested.  Now that there will be the <Col N="1555" /> master leases all solicitors and legal people can work from them.  That is a most important point.</P>
    <P>There has been another important development both last year and this year to date in that many co-operatives became involved in the land leasing business. In my view they are well equipped to become so involved because their structure is composed of farmers' share-holdings, going on from there right up to the management committees.  They deal on a commercial basis with many hundreds or thousands of farmers in a given area on whom they rely to sustain their creameries with milk or their marts with cattle and sheep.  It is in their interests to ensure that there is more livestock passing through their hands each year. Therefore there is great interest on the part of many creamery and mart committees in devising what might be termed loosely a sort of marriage bureau, in that they place themselves in a position through their shareholders of knowing farmers who have land to lease and those farmers who want to rent such land.  That procedure worked extremely well.  But because of the legal constraints &mdash; that is until this Bill has been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; it meant that such arrangements were not absolutely legally binding on both parties.  Therefore many of such people have been awaiting the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points worthy of mention.  Another category of people to whom this Bill will bring good news is &mdash; indeed we talk about them in this Chamber every day of the week &mdash; families with sons or daughters unable to obtain a job off-farm.  Therefore land leasing, as I am promoting it, will certainly widen the horizon for a first or perhaps second son of many a farmer, particularly the larger type farmer.  With the back up service that he or she will receive at home, with the machinery and ancillary services, they will be in a position to lease land in their neighbourhood, conscious of the fact that they have all of those backup services to overcome financial problems and ensure a sustainable <Col N="1556" /> livelihood.  That is something to which insufficient attention was paid in the past and I foresee a fair number of young people obtaining jobs in that way.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have said that the Bill is to be welcomed but made the point that there were several things I had not done.  The primary purpose was as I have stated, but there are other aspects I would accept warrant examination in the future in so far as the whole land business is concerned.  There was much ado in the last week about the Government decision to abolish the Land Commission.  I would have to describe that as the shedding of crocodile tears.  Since I was knee high I have been hearing one body after another contend that the Land Commission were not serving a useful role in a modern, agricultural State.  Yet, when the decision has been taken to abolish them, crocodile tears begin to flow all over the place, indeed even on the part of Deputies representing counties in which the Land Commission have not been active in the past five to ten years.  The view I have always taken is that it does not make any difference whether there exists a body like the Land Commission provided that an effective, imaginative land policy is pursued by whatever agency exists at any given time.  As the House is aware, it will be the Department of Agriculture who henceforth will operate a land policy in this country.  Since the decision was taken to incorporate the Land Commission into the Department of Agriculture in 1977 that trend has obtained.</P>
    <P>When I assumed office practically two years ago I found the whole of the land structural side of things in a rather sorry state.  Indeed, it can be contended that successive Governments over many years had decided to wind down the acquisitions sections of the Land Commission. As official figures will demonstrate, the number of acres, or hectares acquired by them in the last four or five years diminished annually until we arrived at the position a year ago in which there was no more land acquired.  There are many reasons therefor and I do not want to delay the House by going into them in detail, but I do want to answer some of <Col N="1557" /> the criticisms levelled here in the last few days.  First, because most large estates have now been divided, obviously the same degree of interest did not exist for having the Land Commission acquire small parcels of land, that is not to say that on occasion such was not quite important to local congests.  But there are many ways of doing the same thing and there are better ways of helping smaller farmers without costing the taxpayer something of the order of £400 or £500 an acre to acquire and distribute such land, sometimes constituting half the price of the land involved.  In such harsh financial times no Government could allow such a system to continue.  Needless to say, the Land Commission have done a fine job throughout the country over the years but there are new methods, new programmes, that can be adopted.  For example, we can learn from what has been done by our European neighbours.</P>
    <P>What I have endeavoured to do in the course of the last two years was to introduce schemes that would be less costly to the Exchequer, to the taxpayer, at the same time ensuring that we helped the type of person about whom Deputy Brennan spoke.  I accept that he has sincerely held views.  I come from that area and am aware of the types of pressures prevailing there, but there does exist a better, more efficient way of doing that type of thing than the implementation of the acquisition programme.  This meant paying land bonds nobody wanted, waiting four or five years for the land involved to be allocated and, at the heel of the hunt, because of the laws obtaining &mdash; again through no fault of the Land Commission &mdash; and because of the social implication, many persons throughout the country who acquired land through that process did not actually work it, or even the land they had possessed already.</P>
    <P>The first and essential part of any land policy is land usage, to get into production every possible acre lying under-utilised. Thereafter one talks about the social implications in regard to the business of land structure.  I must acknowledge that, for obvious reasons, they are <Col N="1558" /> extremely important.  In the future we must ensure that land gets into the hands of the people best able to work it.  That is something that has been repeated over and over again and which rings hollow at this point.  It is important that we identify the types of persons in the future most likely to use the land available.  Bearing in mind the social implications about which I speak, the first people to be identified in this respect are those fulltime farmers who must make a living from the land and who can show through their endeavours that, with additional land acquired, they will become self-sufficent, will not constitute a burden on the State but rather will become self-propelled. They are the type of people who should have the first opportunity in relation to any land that becomes available.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to the view that the State should have some say in the overall control of land sales on the open market.  I would have to acknowledge that it is a very difficult and complex area.  One must acknowledge at all times the right of the owner to get the best possible price on the market.  That is enshrined in the Constitution and this Government will not do anything to undermine that right. At the same time it is only proper, because of the social implications, to have some curb or control on persons from outside farming who might not have the same expertise or agricultural education, and I am working on items which will go into the heads of a Bill to bring about a certain control of that nature.  I should like to see such a scheme being free from unnecessary impediments but the level of control should be such as to give the smaller farmer a chance of getting land.</P>
    <P>It should have been apparent during the past four or five years that the acquisition section of the Land Commission would be withdrawn.  It was obvious that there would have to be a replacement to help smaller farmers to acquire land.  I introduced a new group purchase scheme and I will give some figures to outline progress.  Under this scheme a number of farmers come together with the assistance of the Land Commission to purchase <Col N="1559" /> collectively land which individually they could not acquire.  The Land Commission give advice and help with mapping etc. In the nine months to September 1983 39 such groups were formed and by September this year the figure had jumped to 118.  Those 118 groups cover 3,353 acres of land.  It is obvious that these figures will continue to climb and we will soon arrive at a position where there will be land division between small farmers with the aid of the Land Commission or similar body at very little cost to the Exchequer. The cost to the Exchequer may be as much as £400 or less.  Obviously there are some warts in the scheme but we will endeavour to eradicate them.</P>
    <P>I introduced an equivalent re-arrangement programme last year.  In the first nine months of last year we had 16 applications and that figure has increased to 73 this year.  Under this scheme a group of farmers whose holdings are scattered throughout a townland or parish go to the local Land Commission office for assistance in making their holdings more compact.  The Land Commission give all the assistance necessary.  This is happening in good farming areas and obviously there is a great increase in activity under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The question of commonages is confined to marginal and poorer areas but it is of great importance to the people living there.  During the past couple of years division had almost come to a halt. I let it be known that my temper would be very short with people who for selfish reasons were putting a stop to division. The message has got across that we are not prepared to take much notice of such people, some of whom may have been raising objections for the past quarter of a century.  In the first nine months there were 20 applications and this year the figure is 123.  There is great activity under the headings of the land policy as I introduced it in the latter part of 1983.  This will continue and now we will add to it the land leasing prop which will make it easier for people to get into farming or extend their farms.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have said that there <Col N="1560" /> has not been any real transfer of land from father or mother to son or daughter. A few figures will give an idea of what has happened in the past two years.  One of the best schemes was the stamp duty exemption which was introduced two years ago.  It had the effect of coaxing the owner of land to transfer it to a son or daughter under certain conditions.  I will not delay the House with all the conditions but basically the son or daughter had to be under 35 years of age and had to have an agricultural qualification.  This resulted in the 100 hours EC course being held all over the country.  Between 3,000 and 4,000 families have involved themselves in this scheme and I have not the slightest doubt that there are several sons and daughters who are now owners and managers of farms who would not have such control if it had not been for the introduction of this scheme during the past two years.</P>
    <P>I believe the land leasing concept will become popular, and certain other small aids which I am considering might encourage people reaching pension age to get involved in the leasing system if it did not greatly upset their entitlement to old age pensions.  We would then reach a stage where the transfer of land would be much more common.  A total of 83 per cent of all land is transferred within the family.  I have now found a framework whereby I can expedite that transfer and in future I am confident that we will see a greater degree of mobility within the family.</P>
    <P>It is possible to say that a little bit of history has been created in that a new concept in Irish agriculture has been put through the House.  Legislative effect has been given to many of the views which have been expressed.  This Bill makes it clear to every landowner who becomes involved in leasing that he or she will get back that land at the end of the lease.</P>

    <Title>Age of Majority Bill, 1984: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am glad to be able to bring this measure before the House, I regard it as an important as well as a desirable item of law reform in an area of particular significance for young people.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to implement proposals concerning the age of majority that are contained in the Law Reform Commission's report entitled &ldquo;Report on the Law relating to the Age of Majority, the Age for Marriage and Some Connected Subjects (LRC5-1983)&rdquo;. The commission's central proposal is that the age of majority be reduced from 21 to 18 years or the age at which the person concerned marries.</P>
      <P>The commission's recommendations were made after a wide ranging investigation in the course of which they reviewed the law as to the age of majority here, in Britain and in various other countries in Europe and elsewhere.  They also received and considered submissions from a wide range of organisations and individuals.  The results were published in a Working Paper (No. 2 &mdash; 1977) and the commission's final report in the matter was published in April 1983.  The report was accompanied by a draft Age of Majority Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before referring in detail to the provisions of the Bill I would like to pay a special tribute to the Law Reform Commission for the work they have done in the comprehensive review of the subject set out in their working paper and in their final report.  Those documents have provided us with a wealth of valuable material and background information on the existing law on the subject and on the implications of making the changes they recommended.  The proposals in the Bill are based with only slight modifications <Col N="1562" /> on the work of the commission and I am sure that other Members of the House would wish to join me in thanking them.</P>
    <P>Before going further, I think I should say something about the concept of &ldquo;majority&rdquo;.  The terms &ldquo;age of majority&rdquo; and &ldquo;full age&rdquo; are interchangeable and are used to describe the age at which a person reaches full legal capacity, that is, the capacity to exercise all the rights of an individual who is not under a legal disability.</P>
    <P>The present age of majority is 21 years, as it has been for centuries.  It might be supposed that this resulted from the belief that 21 years was an age at which people could be presumed to be sufficiently mature mentally to assume full responsibility for themselves, but that does not seem to have been the case.  The emergence of 21 years appears to have had less to do with mental maturity than with physical strength.  There is authority for suggesting that it was related to the age at which a young man was regarded as strong enough to wear the heavy armour and wield the heavy weapons that went with knight service in the feudal system. The selection of any age as an age at which people generally can be regarded as capable of assuming full adult responsibility must of course be arbitrary to some extent but it can be said that the proposal of the Law Reform Commission is supported by the practice of many other countries and by developments in our own law, as I hope to show.</P>
    <P>Under the common law a person under 21 was treated as an infant &mdash; or minor &mdash; and was conferred with a special status, that is infancy or minority which made him subject to certain legal limitations, the most important of these being in his ability to enter into contracts or to own property.  The limitations on the legal capacity of a minor were not of course imposed to deprive the minor of his rights &mdash; the principle was that a minor should be protected from his own improvidence and inexperience, but that this should be done so as not to cause unnecessary hardship to any person dealing with him.</P>
    <P>There has been a general trend <Col N="1563" /> throughout the world towards a reduction in the age of majority, particularly in Europe.  A resolution of the Council of Europe in 1972 recommended lowering the age of majority below 21 years and suggested 18 as a suitable new age.  The age was reduced in Britain and Northern Ireland in 1969 from 21 years to 18 years. Other countries which in recent years have made the same reduction are France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, Sweden and Turkey.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is a growing consensus that transcends national boundaries that young people of the present day are capable of managing their own affairs when they reach the age of 18 years.  Many young people have already struck out on their own and are supporting themselves away from home by the time they reach 18 years.  Moreover, the Law Reform Commission referred at paragraphs 16 and 17 of their report, to Article 41.1 of the Constitution under which the State recognises the special role of the family in society and guarantees to protect it as the necessary basis for social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the nation and the State.  From this, they point out, it is arguable that no legal impediments should be placed in the way of young married persons solely on the grounds of age and that such persons should have the legal capacity to acquire a home and to furnish it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not a complete innovation however, but rather is the culmination of a continuing process of development in our law.  In recent years, our law has increasingly recognised that persons of 18 years of age are capable of undertaking adult responsibilities.  The Succession Act, 1965, enabled a person who is 18 years or married, to make a valid will. Previously he had to be 21 years or over. Since the enactment of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, a parent under the age of 21 years may appoint a guardian of his child by will.  In 1972 the voting age was reduced from 21 years to 18 years following an amendment of the Constitution. It is significant in the context of the <Col N="1564" /> present Bill that when the proposal to reduce the voting age was submitted to a referendum, 85 per cent of the votes cast were in favour of the proposal.  The Juries Act, 1976, reduced the minimum age limit for jury service in a court or at a coroner's inquest from 21 to 18 years.</P>
    <P>It is against this background and having studied the subject in depth that the Law Reform Commission have made their recommendation that the age of majority should be reduced to 18 years.  There was widespread support for such a reduction amongst those bodies, including the National Youth Council of Ireland, who made submissions to the commission. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Legislation also endorsed the commission's recommendation in their Report on the Age of Majority of 11 April 1984 (PI. 2321).</P>
    <P>The principal areas of law that will be affected are contract, property and guardianship.  Full contractual capacity will now be acquired at 18 or, if a person marries before that age, at the date of marriage.  I am glad to say that one effect of this will be to remove an obstacle in the way of many young married couples seeking to buy a home.  At present, lending institutions will not provide loans for house purchase to persons under 21 years because as a result of the Infants Relief Act, 1874, a contract for the repayment of a loan by a person under 21 years of age is not binding on him.  That will no longer be a reason for refusing a loan to a person who is 18 years or who is married.</P>
    <P>A person who has attained the age of 18, or is married before that age, will in future be able to buy and sell land and give valid receipts for the purchase money without the intervention of a trustee or other third person.  At present land held by a minor is subject to the Settled Land Acts and powers of dealing with it are exercised by trustees.</P>
    <P>When the Bill comes into force questions of guardianship and custody will arise only in respect of persons who are under 18 years instead of persons under 21 years as at present.  If, for example, on the commencement of this Act a person is <Col N="1565" /> a ward of court, he will be discharged from wardship on that date if he has then reached 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>Among the other effects that the Bill will have are that persons over 18 years or who are married before that age will be able to sue or be sued in their own names without the intervention of a next friend or of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>&mdash; a guardian <i>ad litem</i> is, of course, a person appointed to defend proceedings on behalf of a minor or a person under a disability.  They will also be able to enter into a binding compromise of an action without leave of the court.  In addition they will be entitled to act on the committee of a trade union, or any other body, corporate or incorporate.  At present, for example, a minor may be a member of a trade union, credit union or a friendly society but he may not serve on the committee of such a body.</P>
    <P>I do not think that at this stage I need discuss the detailed provisions of the Bill, most of which are technical or consequential &mdash; they will all be gone into fully on Committee Stage.  I will mention briefly only two provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is the principal provision.  It proposes that a person will attain full age on the date the Act comes into operation if he has then reached the age of 18 or is or has been married.  After the commencement of the Act, a person will attain full age on reaching the age of 18 or on marriage.  The section substitutes a reference to full age for any reference to the age of 21 in every statutory provision passed before the commencement save those specifically exempted.  The exempted provisions refer to marriage, adoption, social welfare, taxation and certain pensions.</P>
    <P>At present under a rule of common law a person legally attains a particular age &mdash; I am not talking only about full age &mdash; at the first moment of the day preceding the relevant anniversary of his birth.  I am sure that not many members of the general public are aware that this is the legal rule.  It is a rule that the lay person would probably regard as artificial and against common sense.  It means, for instance, that if a person's birthday is on <Col N="1566" /> a Saturday, the law regards him as having reached the relevant age at midnight on the preceding Thursday.  Section 4 &mdash; subject to a saving in relation to the Electoral Acts &mdash; will abolish this rule and provide instead that the moment when a person reaches a particular age, not necessarily full age, will be the commencement of his relevant birthday.  This is a sensible and desirable change bringing the law into line with popular understanding.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of section 4 is drafted so as to exclude its application to provisions of the Constitution &mdash; in other words, it will have no relevance for any constitutional provision which specifies a particular age expressed in years.  Also, because of subsection (3) it will have no relevance for the Electoral and Referendum Acts mentioned in that subsection, all of which reflect the constitutional provision about age for voting.  This merely means that if any question were to come up about the interpretation of these constitutional or electoral provisions it will fall to be decided in its own context and without regard to section 4.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not provide for the implementation of recommendations in the Law Reform Commission's report in relation to certain ages for marriage and the effect on the validity of marriage of failure to obtain the consent of parents or guardians to marriages below a certain age.  This does not mean the Government are opposed to the implementation of these recommendations but that they consider that they constitute a separate subject from the age of majority to be assessed separately.  Indeed, the Law Reform Commission themselves clearly distinguish between the two although they deal with both in the report.  The commission's proposals in relation to the minimum age for marriage and the effect of the failure to get parental or other consent for certain marriages are not, of course, directly related to the question of what the age of majority should be.  The Government considered that it is better to deal with the question of the appropriate age for marriage as a separate issue and that it would in any event be advisable to await the report of the Oireachtas <Col N="1567" /> Committee on Marital Breakdown before proceeding further with amendments of the law of marriage.</P>
    <P>Other proposals of the Law Reform Commission which are being left over for another day are those relating to an increase from 16 to 18 as the age up to which parents can be obliged to maintain a child under the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930 and the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, and as the age at which a parent ceases to be liable to maintain a child for the purposes of social welfare legislation.  These proposals are not directly related to a reduction in the age of majority and will be dealt with separately.  Similarly, the commission's proposals in relation to certain ages for the purposes of adoption are not included in the Bill which specifically excludes the Adoption Acts from its effects.  The two relevant aspects of age in relation to adoption &mdash; minimum age of adopters and maximum age of children to be adopted &mdash; have never been directly related to the concept of majority.  Any changes in this area are more appropriate for consideration in the context of the recently published report of the Review Committee on Adoption Services established by the Minister for Health rather than in the context of proposals for a change in the age of majority.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not affect social welfare or taxation legislation.  The exemption of social welfare legislation will ensure, in particular, that persons who are at present entitled to social welfare in respect of children between 18 and 21 who are in full-time education will not become disentitled by reason of this Bill.  The exclusion of taxation legislation will ensure that a taxpayer will not lose his entitlement to any tax allowance that he might be eligible for at present in respect of a child up to 21 years because of the change in the age of majority.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important piece of legislation which will affect our society in many ways and will, I believe, have significant effects for our young people by <Col N="1568" /> enabling them to take responsibility for the conduct of their daily affairs.  I understand that there could be as many as 200,000 young people affected by the change in the age of majority, not to mention many others who are approaching that age who will be affected soon after.  The Bill will also have important results for young married couples.  In the period 1975 to 1980, the most recent years for which figures are available, there were over 38,000 marriages registered in which at least one of the parties was under 21 years.  The change in the age of majority will be of particular benefit to them.  The Bill recognises that these young people, as a result of developments in education and communications, are reaching maturity at an earlier age than in former times and that they are more capable nowadays of assuming the responsibilities of life than, perhaps, young people were in former times.  I believe that this Bill is a timely and worthwhile reform in our civil law and I am confident that it will be widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in general. Like the Minister, I consider it represents and reflects social changes and political developments in our society that have had to take account of the earlier attainment of maturity and responsibility in young people in recent generations. To some extent this earlier maturity has been a product of education and greater equality of opportunity.  To another extent it is due to the fact that in recent years all politicians have had to come to terms with the needs and demands of the large percentage of our population who are under 25 years &mdash; approximately 50 per cent of our population.  In itself this is having an effect on our laws and it has had an effect on the thinking in relation to this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister's reference &mdash; I had also come across it &mdash; to the basis on which the age was decided in the long and distant past.  It was more related to physical strength and here young girls and women were at a disadvantage <Col N="1569" /> if they had to prove they could ride around like a knight in shining armour and carry the full weight that was required.  The Minister's research has been very detailed and I congratulate him on his Second Stage speech.  In fact, if he had provided it for us earlier I would not have had to do as much work as I did. Perhaps that indicates one of the odd situations in the House.  In the early days it was a question of physical strength and, as the Minister has said quite rightly, that has changed.  As a society we are changing rapidly and young people are beginning to want to take part in all aspects of society.  The educational opportunities that have been available in recent years have helped in this area, although perhaps some people might not recognise that so readily.</P>
    <P>As a party we recognised the need some time ago.  I refer to the Succession Act, 1965, to which the Minister has referred.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government they introduced that measure which provided that any person who was of sound mind, who had attained 18 years and who was or had been married could make a will.  We also recognised this development in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  In that case a section was enacted enabling a person under 21 years to appoint a guardian by will.</P>
    <P>The single most important reduction in the age of majority was brought about by the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1972, which resulted in reducing from 21 years to 18 years the age at which a person had the right to vote in Dáil and Presidential elections.  The proposal that was put forward by our party then received overwhelming support.  Out of a total vote of 856,353 valid votes 724,836 were in favour of the amendment and 131,514 were against it.  The proposal reflected our party's determination at that time to have recognised the role of young people in politics and their right to express their views on political issues.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there is a similar commitment in the Bill as there is generally in other legislation that has been discussed here.  According to the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill its purpose is to <Col N="1570" /> implement the proposal relating to the age of majority as put forward in the report of the Law Reform Commission. The Bill proposes to reduce the age of majority from 21 to 18 or earlier, depending on marital status, but this is done in a selective way.  In this respect we are being left with the situation in which, though a person will be regarded as an adult at the age of 18, there will be two majorities.  In other words, we are being left with in many ways a job only half done.  The Minister recognises this as indicated in his speech this morning.</P>
    <P>On the question of the law relating to the age of majority and to the age of marriage, the Law Reform Commission set out in the appendix to their Working Paper, 5/1983, the main heads of the Bill. In the accompanying explanatory memorandum we read that the main proposals put forward by the commission and included in the Bill are, first, that it is proposed to reduce the age of majority from 21 to 18 or the age at which a person marries; secondly, that a marriage solemnised between persons, either of whom is under 16, should be void and, that a marriage solemnised between persons, either of whom is under 18, should be void unless there has been obtained first the consent of parents or guardians or of the courts.  The Law Reform Commission envisaged these proposals as being incorporated in the one Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that the age of consent for marriage is an entirely separate subject.  He referred to the work done by the commission and I should like to join with him in paying tribute to them for the detailed and exhaustive work undertaken by them in this area as in other areas.  Their report tends to highlight the fact that the fault rests with politicians because of their not doing something earlier about the work of the commission.  In their working paper, 2/1977, relating to the age of majority, the commission set out a good deal of detail.  Their work has been very valuable. I find it most useful when examining legislation. I take the view that the question of the age of majority and that of the age of consent for marriage should be taken <Col N="1571" /> together and incorporated in the same Bill.  They are similar matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed to other questions which he would regard as not being similar in their general intent but the two matters I am speaking of are closely related.</P>
    <P>The Bill is selective in that seven statutes which rely on the question of the age qualification of 21 years are excluded from its operation as also is any statutory provision to provide for the payment of pensions or other allowances to such children up to the age of 21.  In relation to Irish marriage law, the Bill contains a specific element of exclusion.  It does not include the commission's proposal that the free age for marriage should be the same as the age of majority.  This will mean that it will continue to be necessary for people between the age of 18 and 21 to obtain the consent of parents, guardians or the court before being permitted to marry.  It seems illogical that such an exception should be continued when it is accepted that a young adult has a right to acquire or to dispose of property or to enter into contractual arrangements with third parties and to be responsible for the legal obligations that arise therefrom. The same young adult, without reference to his parents, to his guardians or to the courts can enter into a contract with a building society in respect of a mortgage.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposal to enable 18 year olds to enter into mortgage agreements and to undertake other commitments, but it is important that we take into consideration the matter of the age up to which consent for marriage must be obtained.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that this matter should be left until we have the report of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown. That report is due on 1 December which is not very far away.  Consequently, it should be possible to incorporate in this legislation those proposals which generally are agreed.  The Minister will have the full support of the House in regard to the inclusion, along the lines suggested, of the question of the age at which a person can marry without consent.  He <Col N="1572" /> has given good reasons for other aspects being dealt with separately but this is one which should have been dealt with.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is inconsistency indicates that the Bill was rushed.  This is undesirable particularly since the other reports will soon be available to us.  The Minister may say that there is other legislation designed to protect a young person from his own inexperience and improvidence. We recognise that in the life of a young person there are different stages of maturity and intelligence.  If that is the case one wonders about the logic of continuing the law as it stands which permits a young person of 17 years of age to be executed for a capital offence but does not recognise that he is an adult until he is a year older.  That is an aspect the Minister might have given attention to in the Bill.  We must look at the different implications in relation to the age of majority.</P>
    <P>What is the logic of permitting a person to take out money from funds in court as a right at the age of 18 but at the same time excluding him from the benefit of trust moneys until he is 21 years of age? That indicates that it is desirable to look in a wider context at the age of majority and make amendments.  The funds lodged in court may far exceed those lodged in a trust fund, yet 18 years is the majority age in the first instance and 21 years the majority age in the second instance.  I welcome the change to 18 years in the first case but why not look at the age in the second case?  As far as the trustees are concerned the young person continues to be a minor until 21 years but as far as the court is concerned he is an adult with full rights at 18 years.  It is all very well to say that the trustees will have powers under the Bill and that it will be at their discretion to pay out money to somebody aged 18 but the reality is they will have to continue to exercise discretion in favour of that person until he reaches 21 years of age when he can take out the trust money as a right.  What is the logic behind allowing the trustee such a right until the person reaches the age of 21 years when the same right is refused <Col N="1573" /> to the court when the person reaches 18 years?  This is an indication of the further work that needs to be done on this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not a clear concept of when a young person reaches adulthood or of what the consequences are of giving a right with one hand and taking it away with the other.  It would have been helpful if the Minister had dealt with that issue in the Bill rather than keeping the Bill as narrow as he has.  If he had made such a definition he would have been able to explain why there is a distinction between funds in court and trust money and between full legal capacity for commercial contracts at 18 years and restricted legal capacity for marriage contracts until a person is 21 years.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Bill that the Minister is setting aside some of the recommendations contained in the report of the commission. Obviously it is not because the Minister regards the period between 18 years and 21 years as a period of limited rather than full majority.  What is the reason?  The Minister is satisfied that a person is mature enough to be a member of a local authority at the age of 18 and vote at that age but he or she is not mature enough to stand for election to the Dáil at 18 years of age.  I accept it would require a constitutional change to enable a young person to be elected to the Dáil at 18 years or under the age of 21 years.  The Minister had an opportunity to address this issue.  If a person is considered to be an adult at 18 years of age should he or she be eligible to stand for election to the Dáil?  Such a person is eligible to stand for local elections.  The Minister did not refer to that issue.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission's Working Paper, No. 2 of 1977, provided the background information on that subject. As regards standing for election to various legislatures, in Canada the age is 18 years; British Colombia, 19 years; Austria, 25 years; Germany, 18 years; Greece, 25 years; Luxembourg, 21 years; New Zealand, 18 years; Norway, 20 years; Sweden, 18 years; Switzerland, 20 years and in the United Kingdom, 21 <Col N="1574" /> years.  We must address ourselves to this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate clearly why he is not adopting all the recommendations of the commission's report and particularly the draft Bill in its entirety.  The report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown is due shortly.  The first draft is being prepared at present.  There are two majority ages in this Bill &mdash; an 18-year-old will have full commercial liability for his contracts without protection of the Infants Relief Act, 1874 whereas a 20-year-old will still have to go cap in hand to his parents for permission to marry.  He or she can enter into substantial commitments for the purchase of a house or business without such consent and theoretically without the benefit of parental advice and guidance. If we follow the Minister's logic a young person of 18 years of age will be able to resist the power of commercial advertising loan sharks and be well able to understand the consequences of such transactions.  On the other hand, the 20 year old who may have acquired a degree or who may be fully qualified in technical or business areas will still be unable to marry without his parents' consent.  The Infants Relief Act, 1874, was a compromise between a desire to protect infants and a wish to safeguard the interests of traders.  From now on only persons under 18 years of age will be protected in their commercial dealings with other people. Is the Minister satisfied that it is safe to exclude some form of protection for young adults between the ages of 18 and 21 for their commercial contracts or dealings, especially when one thinks of loan sharks and hire purchase arrangements which people can be so readily pressed into without realising the implications?</P>
    <P>When the age of majority was reduced to 18 in New Zealand, provision was made for the intervention by the courts in certain circumstances where contracts were entered into by young adults between the ages of 18 and 21.  That element has been protected in our legislation up to now.  I agree with the step being taken in the Bill but we should <Col N="1575" /> consider on Committee Stage whether there is any need to provide some form of protection in the period between the ages of 18 and 21.  I cited as an example that this approach was taken in New Zealand when the age of majority was reduced to 18.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that a male juvenile offender may, under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, be sentenced to detention in St. Patrick's Institution instead of being sentenced to penal servitude or imprisonment.  Under the same Act the court may, when a person is convicted on indictment and is not less than 16 or more than 19 years of age, sentence him to detention instead of penal servitude or imprisonment.  Is it now proposed to reduce the age of 19 to 18 for that purpose on the grounds that the Minister is satisfied that a person is a fully matured adult at 18 years of age?  If that is the case will that have implications for the committing of persons to prison and the mixing of young people with older, more hardened criminals in Mountjoy and other prisons?  I should like the Minister to clarify this in his reply.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister also considering a reduction in the age of criminal responsibility? At present there is a rebuttable presumption that a child between the ages of seven and 14 has not the <i>mens rea</i> necessary to establish criminal responsibility. Is it considered that the age of adult maturity is now reached at 18 years of age instead of 21 years of age?  Has the Minister considered the age of full criminal responsibility?  Will that be reflected in a reduction to the age of 12? Looking at the question in global terms, how should we approach this problem? It tends to indicate that the Minister is developing one aspect above another. However, the Bill will give us an opportunity of considering these matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not told us why distinctions such as these are made and in some case have to be made.  That indicates the absence of a co-ordinated or consolidated approach by the Minister to this difficult problem.  When we talk <Col N="1576" /> about these changes taking place, such as a change in the age of maturity, we must consider the consequences and interactions of that very complex legal area.  I have tried to outline some of them here. I accept that there will always be certain categories of persons, not necessarily minors and young adults, for whom special safeguards will always be necessary, whether by the intervention of the court in certain circumstances or by other measures.  However, while the Bill is a very valuable advance, it will not give young adults full legal rights and obligations. It should be a much more widely embracing attempt at reforming legislation.</P>
    <P>There are various different categories of maturity in adulthood in present legislation but the Bill does very little to deal with these and to bring them into some form of cohesion.  For instance, if we were tackling these problems the Bill would have amended the 1947 Act, in particular section 2 (1) thereof, whereby a person aged 16 and over is treated as an adult.  He is free to choose his own doctor, obtain a medical card in his own right, give consent for an operation and apply for a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  In this legislation we are not tackling social welfare and other implications.  The obligation of a parent to maintain a child under family law ceases when the child reaches the age of 16.  If we were consistent we might have amended that to 18.  We should look comprehensively at the implications even of this one aspect of the question of maturity and its relationships.</P>
    <P>I have just mentioned some examples of inconsistency in existing legislation but there are others.  If the Minister and his advisers had taken the time to examine these, they might have been able to put a more comprehensive Bill before us without getting unduly complicated and without leaving on the Statute Book a number of measures which could readily be amended in the House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the principle of reducing the age of majority but we should have given it more attention.  Perhaps we can do that on Committee Stage.  This is an urgent <Col N="1577" /> matter and Members of the House must ensure that the rights of young people and their standing as citizens compare favourably with all sections of the population.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that at an earlier age young people are attaining considerable maturity and that the step we are taking in making 18 years the age of majority is the right step.  It is being done at the right time.  I compliment the Minister on that. We should look more comprehensively at the meaning of this maturity and the other implications, some of which I have pointed out.  I ask the Minister between now and Committee Stage to do some more homework on the Bill and to come back with a more comprehensive approach.  I will look at the Bill in that light and see if we can make some suggestions on Committee Stage which will help to improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister may feel that he can come back again with another Bill in the not too distant future, or that some other Minister could do so, for example, the Minister of State dealing with family law reform, Deputy Fennell.  All these things take time.  The Estimates are produced and have to be debated.  The budget is introduced and then there is the recess. I think we are all agreed on the age of consent for marriage.  The Joint Committee are due to report on 1 December but they will report soon after that date if the report is not ready on that date.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we can consider the inclusion of the recommendations which are likely to come from the committee. They have been fairly well broadcast and I think most of us agreed that 18 years should be the age of majority and the age of consent.  The Law Reform Commission prepared their own Bill. Between now and Committee Stage we can do more work and try to bring that element into it also, and deal with some of the other anomalies which relate to the question of majority.  I ask the Minister to consider these suggestions when he is replying and also when he is preparing for Committee Stage of the Bill.  I will do that myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Having campaigned for some years now for a change in the age of majority, I am glad to see this Bill before the House today.  With certain reservations, most of which the Minister referred to, I welcome the Bill.  It resolves the slightly ambiguous position in which young people find themselves.  On the one hand they are entitled to vote at elections and on the other hand they are denied the legal status of adults.</P>
      <P>It is arguable whether this Bill is a reaction to the social realities of the day or whether it gives us a positive lead in initiating social change.  It is something of both.  There is no denying the fact that young people of 18 years of age are anxious and willing to assume the privileges and obligations of adulthood. It is absurd that graduates and young people who have had years of gainful employment, and some of whom are married, are classified in law as infants.  I am glad this Bill will resolve that conflict.  As such, it is an answer to the social realities of our time.</P>
      <P>This Bill has the potential to create a change of attitude in our society.  Young people over 18 years of age will have to be more responsible for their actions particularly in contractual matters.  This is good.  It encourages maturity.  It is not satisfactory that 19- and 20-year-olds can enter into contractual agreements which cannot be enforced against them.  This encourages a great degree of irresponsibility. The Bill will create an atmosphere in which young people will see themselves in a different light and will respond in a mature way as full adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in the idea that every right carries a responsibility.  For that reason I should like to outline briefly the obligations of adulthood.  There is the right to own land without the intervention of trustees, but there are legal obligations to respect the land of others by looking after boundaries, keeping animals secure, and so on.  There is the right to borrow money, but there is the obligation to repay it with interest.  There is the right to receive an inheritance without the intervention of trustees, but there is the <Col N="1579" /> obligation to discharge the requirements of the representatives of the deceased.</P>
    <P>There is the right to sit on a trade union or on a co-operative, but there is the obligation to carry out the legal duties of adults on such bodies.  It is well to remind our 18 year olds that this Bill confirms the legal status of 18 year olds as adults. It gives the rights, the responsibilities and the obligations of adulthood and it creates expectations of maturity.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission recommended that the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, and the Family Law Act, 1976, should be changed. That does not appear in this Bill. The basic recommendation in both cases is that the age of 18 years be substituted for the age of 16 years, so that the obligation to provide financial support would continue to the age of majority.  There are great merits in those proposals and I urge the Minister to consider them very seriously.  These two recommendations on the age of majority could be enacted in this Bill.  Otherwise an anomalous situation will continue to exist.</P>
    <P>My major regret about the Bill is shared by Deputy Woods, that is, that it does not deal with the age of consent for marriage.  The present position about the age of consent for marriage leaves a lot to be desired.  The minimum age for marriage is 16 years, with a provision enabling the President of the High Court to grant an exemption.  Persons over the age of 16 years but under 21 years may marry but only with the consent of parents or guardians.  If the parents or guardians refuse consent there is a provision for application to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission reported twice on this and they finally concluded that the age of 16 years should be the absolute minimum age for marriage and that any marriage contracted prior to that age should be considered null and void.  Between the ages of 16 and 18 years a marriage would be valid only if the consent of parents or guardians was obtained.  There would be a right of appeal to the High Court, but not unless both parents refused to consent.  From <Col N="1580" /> the age of 18 years people would be allowed to marry without any restriction. It seems to me that these recommendations are very worthwhile.  It appears that agreement has been reached by the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown that the minimum age for marriage should be at majority, which is 18 years.  The committee indicated that between the ages of 16 and 18 years there should be provision for an appeal to the High Court.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Woods said earlier, the committee have not yet reported but will be doing so on 1 December next.  We have waited so long for this Bill and it would be an asset if we could include in it a change in the position regarding the age of marriage.  Great difficulty will be created between the ages of 16 and 18 years.  In Article 41.1 of our Constitution the right of the family is protected.  Yet, a married couple one or both of whom are 18 will continue to suffer the legal disabilities of being minors.  For instance, they will be unable to take out a mortgage policy or an insurance policy.  Perhaps the Minister would consider this point and refer to it on the next occasion.</P>
    <P>It is important that the general public be informed of this new law.  The Department of Justice could issue a pamphlet for circulation to schools, colleges, youth organisations and other interested bodies.  This would create public awareness of the change and would allow young people to know that the full age of majority is 18 years.  In the light of that, 21st birthday parties will have to change to 18th birthday parties.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal with the social welfare code or the Taxation Acts. While he points out that if he changed the Social Welfare Acts the parents of those between 18 and 21 who are apprenticed or continuing education would not qualify for children's allowances.  On the other hand, many people of 18 years who leave school and find themselves on the dole queue are not treated as independent. Their means are assessed on the basis of the family income.  This often leaves 19 year olds with £2 or £3 a week, which is very unfair particularly when we <Col N="1581" /> are now about to confer on them, having reached the age of majority, the full role of adulthood.</P>
    <P>Anomalies will also arise in the taxation Acts.  The Law Reform Commission have recommended that in those Acts the figure &ldquo;16&rdquo; should be deleted and the figure &ldquo;18&rdquo; substituted.  This would remove some of the anomalies but would not apply, for instance, where people under 21 are incapacitated or totally unable to look after or care for themselves. I feel strongly that people of 18 years should be allowed to stand for election to Dáil Éireann.  That is particularly relevant in this country which has a huge young population.  It would be good if the views of youth were reflected here and they would be best reflected by people of that age.  It would be a tremendous asset to have in this Dáil two or three Members aged between 18 and 21 years.  They have ideals and opinions which need to be reflected in a Legislature which is supposed to reflect the views of all the people.  It is true that older people can represent younger, but I firmly believe that young people are articulate and are best able to represent themselves.</P>
    <P>While I welcome this Bill and think it is a step forward, bringing us into line with our European partners and many steps beyond, I ask the Minister to consider the points which I have raised and to deal with them on Committee Stage. I trust that this is only the first piece of legislation of a social nature which we may expect in the coming years.</P>

      <P>On 8 May 1984 the Department indicated to Dublin County Council that the local authority's proposal to appoint consultants to develop the south-eastern motorway route from Ticknock to Loughlinstown is regarded as premature and that it would not be possible to make road grants available to meet any fees or costs which the appointment would entail.  The decision was taken in the light of existing and projected demands for road grant financing for other higher priority schemes in the Dublin area.</P>

Of course, it is open to the council themselves if they want to appoint consultants for the work and are prepared to finance the costs of consultancy out of their own programme.  We would have <Col N="1583" /> no objection to that but, given the programme we have in hand for the Dublin area, we see this now as premature.</P>

      <P>As I indicated, the local authority can from their own resources take on consultants.  We do not see in the programme we have that this road is near the list of priorities, and until we as a Department see otherwise we will not engage in expenditure that in the long term may not be required because of the number of roads in that area.  A major extension is in progress where the south-eastern motorway runs through and we do not want to fragment an ordered development.  I can see county councils and engineers wanting to move forward and there is no shortage of designs or proposals in any county council throughout the country.  Therefore, we are not in any way impeded by lack of programmes or initiatives from local authorities throughout the country for more and more roads.</P>

In view of the fact that the document <i>Building on Reality,</i> if it did anything, placed its hopes of any sort of economic activity on the building of roadways, does he not regard it as a complete negation of that whole approach that county councils are not being given the money now to plan ahead and employ consultants to design roadways that will be required in the future?</P>

      <P>Legislation providing for a farm tax, as outlined in the national economic plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> is being prepared in my Department and all relevant aspects will be considered in this connection.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that only weeks after the plan was announced many farmers are concerned as to what their position will be under the new scheme?  Many farmers are in financial difficulties because of disease in their herds and it is time their minds were put at rest in regard to the scheme.

Will the Minister agree that one would have assumed that this legislation in the normal way would have been prepared by the Minister for Finance?  Is the legislation being taken by the Minister for the Environment because it will be a substitute for local rates which have been abolished? Will the Minister give me some information on the matter of adjusted acres?  Will the Minister agree that the key to this tax proposal is the basis on which the adjusted acres are determined? Are we to take it that the system of measuring adjusted acres will be decided by the Department of the Environment in regard to this legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason this legislation is being taken by the Department <Col N="1590" /> of the Environment is that it will be up to the local authorities to collect.  That would be the normal position in regard to legislation dealing with local authorities. The tax is based on adjusted acreage and land will be classified according to its potential productivity.  That is how the adjusted acreage will come about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my question.  Are we to take it now that this new tax will in fact be a form of local rates?  Second, the question I asked him was: will the adjusted acres, or rather the format for deciding adjusted acres be a matter for the Minister for the Environment in the context of this legislation?  There have been suggestions by the Minister that this work would be done by the staff of the Land Commission or perhaps by the Agricultural Institute. Are we now to take it that this key and very complex issue of deciding on adjusted acres will be done by the Minister for the Environment and his Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for the Environment is now the Minister in charge of this tax legislation &mdash; which I think will come as a very big surprise to many people &mdash; can he clear up one matter for me, that is, listening to the Taoiseach and others speaking about this tax, they have indicated that twice the existing revenue will be collected from farmers and, on that basis, that the tax is calculated to be roughly £10 per adjusted acre.  Will the Minister confirm which will be the real objective?  Will it be £10 per adjusted acre, or will it be to bring in twice as much money, whatever that may involve, as a charge per adjusted acre? Which will be the objective?  Will it be twice the existing level of tax or will it be £10 per adjusted acre?</P>

Does he realise that the situation is now so serious that in my county &mdash; bearing in mind that surface dressing is the most important aspect of road structure &mdash; while we would need to be resurfacing our roads twice in every nine years our allocation allows us to do so only once in every 20 years?</P>

Their maintenance does not come out of that block grant, it comes out of the local authorities' own revenue which is raised within the county.  There is now at the disposal of local authorities means of raising additional revenue by way of additional charges, if they so desire.

This is the third day on which he has not been in here and it is very unsatisfactory that the man who is responsible in Cabinet is not answering questions.

      <P>This is probably one of the most important issues in rural Ireland. Being a rural Deputy, a Cheann Comhairle, you must be well aware of the total neglect by the Government of the county and main roads.  Anybody who travels in rural areas must be aware of the numerous potholes and the serious deterioration of the road system.  It is a major crisis and the Minister is passing the buck to the local authorities whom he has deprived of funds.  They do not have the money to repair the roads.</P>

      <P>Kerry County Council's proposal to reconstruct Dingle branch library has been approved by my Department from the technical point of view.  The appliction for loan sanction for the scheme will be considered in the context of the limited capital available for library development and the large number of other applications on hand for capital for this purpose.</P>

A total of £860,000 was made available from the Local Loans Fund for a new headquarters branch library at Tralee, while £260,000 was made available for the new library in Killarney which opened in 1982.  A sum of £24,000 was earlier made available for a library in Cahirciveen and £50,000 was made available for a mobile library.  I compliment Kerry County Council on their programme of library development but they have got a fair share of the capital allocation.  We will certainly consider sympathetically what the Deputy has said but when there are a number of applications priority must be given to the most urgent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am examining ways in which the scheme might be revised to deal with the situation.  This is one of the matters we are considering with the national tenants organisation.

      <P>That is fine, there is no problem with that, but there are families who any day now will be asked to sign contract forms for houses which are overvalued by £10,000.  These people must either sign now or lose the chance to buy their houses without knowing what form a new scheme will take or if they will be worse off when the new scheme comes into effect.

As I said, this matter is under review, but these changes have always been made through negotiations with the tenants' organisation.  If we step <Col N="1603" /> outside that arena we may be accused of a breach of faith and it might be said that we are operating on our own without prior consultation.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 20 and 21, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Joint venture housing involves the construction of private houses for sale to local authority tenants, local authority tenant purchasers and other persons in need of housing.  The essential feature of the scheme is that the houses are built under licences granted by local authorities on lands made available by them for this purpose.  Joint venture housing is not part of the local authority house building programme and as such the standards and procedures set out in my Department's circular N 8/82, issued in April 1982, are not applicable to it.  However, private houses built under joint venture schemes must have all the necessary planning and by-law approvals and the requirements relating to the payment of new house grants and mortgage subsidy must also be met.  I can assure the Deputy that there will be no question of waiving the requirements of building regulations in relation to joint venture housing and that I am satisfied that joint venture housing will not lead to an overall reduction in the quality of housing.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the joint venture housing to which he referred has existed for a long <Col N="1606" /> number of years, where local authorities give sites to small builders to construct houses?  Is this the joint venture housing to which the Minister is referring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The joint venture housing scheme to which I referred was the one started in February 1982 under which housing authorities could encourage owner-occupation by providing under licence building land at cost price for the construction of modestly priced houses for sale to purchasers approved by the local authorities.  That was the 1982 scheme.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a local authority, in particular the Dublin City Council, are considering opening up this to a wide extent to replace building their own houses by giving sites to builders to build houses for the corporation? This is the type of joint venture housing to which I am referring.  If the corporation invite builders to build houses and then sell them back to the corporation, will the Minister give me an assurance that in those cases the existing standards of the Dublin Corporation will be adhered to?  Is the Minister aware that the standards set by local authorities are to ensure minimum maintenance costs for which local authorities are responsible? Will those standards be maintained?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Joint venture housing is intended as additional housing.  It is not to replace local authority housing.  I am satisfied that the standards will comply with the regulations.  Local authorities now can go to the market-place and purchase &ldquo;spec&rdquo; built houses for their own housing stock and we have instructed them to do this if it would help them to get on with their housing programmes. Local authorities are in the business of providing houses.  If they are purchasing houses they have the necessary expertise to ensure that they are of the standard required by them.  Under the scheme we are talking about, they can go to the market-place.  They will decide whether they should buy but houses should be of <Col N="1607" /> a reasonable standard.  Otherwise they should not buy them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree this has not been the case in the past?  Local authorities in former years were burdened with what was called cheap housing and they are still paying for this low cost housing.  In the past decade, they have had to pay enormous sums for repairs and structural changes. This is why I am asking if the Minister will give an assurance that local authority houses, whether built to local authority standards or purchased by them, will be of the standard referred to in the circular from the Department of the Environment, No. N8/82, and will be in accordance with the building regulations set by local authorities.</P>

      <P>The low cost housing was of a particular design.  The technical people would not necessarily have agreed with it but because of the particular instruction and the format that was designed in that case they did not have a say in the matter.  However, we have got that behind us.  We are not in the business of having low cost housing but we are allowing local authorities to purchase &ldquo;spec&rdquo; built houses if they wish to do so. When they are expending public money local authorities have responsibility to ensure they are getting value for their money and that the houses they buy are of the required standard.</P>

That would be a disastrous step for local authorities to take in relation to buying such houses for tenants.  In the long run they will have to repair, maintain and reconstruct these houses.</P>

      <P>As I indicated, local authorities now have the option to buy these houses.  It is up to their technical people to ensure there is proper insulation and that the stairwells and other parts of the houses are up to standard. To say that if a room is six inches smaller than it should be a local authority should not buy that house would be to tie their hands.  However, that would not mean that the actual fabric of the house or the building standards would be lower.  It might be smaller&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are also giving them the option to buy second-hand houses in the market-place and these may not necessarily measure up to the requirements of the circular.  Local authorities have the option to act in the interest of getting a good social mix and of getting houses quickly if their building programmes are falling behind.  However, I wish to emphasise we are not forcing local authorities to engage in buying.  They have an option to buy but they also have the responsibility to ensure that they purchase houses that are up to standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no such <Col N="1610" /> limitations but obviously local authorities would require the permission of the Department to buy houses.  If, for instance, a local authority wished to purchase 50 houses we would not turn down their application for permission on the basis of the number of houses involved. If there were good reasons for their purchasing that number of houses, we would give the permission.</P>

      <P>That is not the case. But we would not wish builders to be under the impression that if they build 50 houses the local authority will purchase them.  The idea is that at any time a local authority may purchase houses in the market-place.  We are not talking about a long-term project because in that case the local authorities could build the houses themselves.  The idea is that if their housing programme is falling behind at any time they can take up the slack by buying houses quickly in the market place.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has called on a number of occasions for this legislation, I welcome its introduction.  The Bill proposes to give to young people the kind of recognition that is commensurate with the responsibilities placed on them.  I have in mind especially young people who marry and wish to enter into a contract with a building society for a mortgage and who also wish to enter into various other legal agreements.  I have had representations from numerous couples who found themselves in that situation. It was not logical that, though entitled to vote and so on, they could not enter into these legal agreements without the consent of a parent or guardian.</P>
      <P>Another area in which these minors very often found difficulty was in relation to joining the Defence Forces.  If they did not have the consent of a parent or guardian in this they could be discharged subsequently on the application of a parent or guardian.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to deal with all of these problems to which so many of us have drawn attention in the past.  We must take into account the input of these young people to society and also the numbers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normally a couple over the age of 21 would have no difficulty in obtaining a mortgage so long as they fulfilled the requirements as to employment income levels and so on but under the age of <Col N="1632" /> majority they could not enter into such an arrangement.  In some cases not even securities would be sufficient.  This resulted in many young couples having to live in housing that was unfit pending their being housed by the local authority. That meant very often that people would have to live in mobile homes for up to two or three years or until they reached the age of majority.  During that time their marriages were subjected to great stress and their health as well as the health in many cases of one or two very young children would suffer.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out also that the State suffered financially because these people would be in a position to help themselves if it were not for the regulation governing the age of majority. Therefore, this Bill is a major step forward. I would have much preferred that it had been before the House two years ago but one must have regard to constraints on business and so on.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill before us now.</P>
    <P>In a constituency like mine the difficulty that I have outlined in regard to joining the Defence Forces is often encountered.  The provision for an amendment of section 76 of the Defence Act, 1954, in section 5 of this Bill deals with that matter.  I do not want to deal with it in great detail.  Paragraph 6 of the Explanatory Memorandum states:</P>
    <P>Section 76 of the 1954 Act prescribes a procedure whereby a person under 18 years of age who enlists in the Defence Forces without the written consent of his parent may be discharged on the application of the parent.  In view of the proposal (section 2) that a married person who is under the age of 18 years will be of full age, it is proposed that section 76 of the 1954 Act should not apply to such a person.</P>
    <P>Couples under the age of 18 years who are married will achieve the same status, that is, full age.</P>
    <P>Life can be unpredictable for young people.  The traumas, responsibilities and pressures of modern living affect young people more so than anyone else.  It is laudable that we should bring in legislation <Col N="1633" /> which will give them the recognition that other adults have.  Young people pay PAYE and PRSI and it is only right to give them full recognition.  This Bill will be the first step towards giving them the status they deserve as a result of the input they make to society.</P>
    <P>Another area this Bill will affect is employment and the age at which a person can command a full wage.  When people are allowed to marry and enter into legal agreements they should be able to command a full wage to meet their commitments.  I am sure some of the legal eagles in the House will have interesting submissions to make in relation to the effect of the Bill on wills and so on.  I hope the Bill is sufficiently detailed to allow them to give a clear indication of it.  There were instances in the past where legislation was passed which created a great deal of difficulty as far as legal interpretation was concerned.  I do not say that as a criticism of anyone but merely to point out the problems that can arise.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the areas of housing, mortgages and so on.  As regards hire purchase agreements, young people will now be able to undertake responsibilities which heretofore they could not without their parent's or guardian's approval.  I hope young people will not be lulled into false security and enter into financial arrangements which might not be in their best interests.  That is an aspect that worries me.</P>
    <P>Persons under 18 years may be married and they require all the help and assistance that can be given to them.  With all the pressures on them it would take a great deal of advice and persuasion to ensure that they did not allow themselves to be coerced or cajoled into making financial agreements which would be detrimental to them.  People are getting married at a younger age now.  When a person has a job and has to face up to the responsibility of running a household, it is only reasonable to give him the benefits of the trappings of our society and ensure he is given every support and encouragement.  Legislation such as this will have the effect of doing just that. <Col N="1634" /> I welcome the Bill.  It is a constructive proposal which will update existing legislation and meet the requirements of our modern age.  It will give young people the recognition that their contribution to society deserves.  In one area at least we are doing more than paying lip service to the importance of our young population. More than 50 per cent of our population are in the younger age group.  We will accord that group a new status, which is laudable.  I hope it will prove to be worthwhile and that they will find it rewarding.  I thank the Minister for bringing in the Bill.  I am sure every Member has had experience of young people having to sit and wait for years in unfit housing conditions until they reached the age of majority in order to take out a loan and house themselves and their families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure was badly needed.  It will eliminate many of the problems we have had.  The age of majority for a person who wishes to be married will be reduced from 21 years to 18 years.  This Bill will have unanimous support.  Very few matters have been as controversial over the last number of years.  I am a member of Monaghan County Council and, on many occasions, we put down motions recommending that legislation should be introduced to enable young people to avail of their rights. Since the voting age was reduced to 18 many young people were resentful that the age of majority was not similarly reduced.  They felt that although they were paying substantial taxes they were unable to avail of loan facilities which were available to people aged 21 years and over.  I know a couple who applied for a house loan.  The person in whose name the application was is only 19 years of age and I found it very hard to convince him that he was not eligible for a loan.  I told him that it was a matter which needed to be dealt with by legislation but he could not understand that although he was working and paying taxes Monaghan County Council would not give him loan facilities which they would offer to a person who was a few years older.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1635" /> The Minister said that existing legislation protected people from their own improvidence and inexperience but when we see the responsibilities of young people of 16, 17 or 18 years of age, it is time the age of majority was reduced. This is desirable legislation and will be well received.</P>

      <P>I join with other Members in welcoming this legislation which has been required for many years.  Deputy Woods made interesting and constructive comments but he made one remark, which I found humourous, about legislation being rushed into the House.  I find it very difficult to regard this as rushed legislation considering that the Law Reform Commission produced their working paper on this legislation in 1977. I know they did not produce their final report until 1983 but it is not very different from the working paper and, as other speakers have said, the Law Reform Commission did valuable work on this issue.</P>
      <P>Many young people find it hard to understand how slow politicians have been to respond to the needs of law reform in this area.  Very few people who are going to be affected by this legislation would regard it as coming before the House with any undue speed.  Indeed it is a criticism of how the House operates. That is not criticism directed at any one Government but we are extremely slow in tackling areas of law reform.  There has been justifiable praise of the work of the Law Reform Commission in this context but one must ask why it took so long to produce their final working paper on this issue.  Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that this Bill is now before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say that <Col N="1636" /> Deputy Woods was really talking in the context of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and that we are supposed to complete our work by 1 December.  The Law Reform Commission, in their working paper and in their final recommendations discussed the whole question of the minimum age of marriage and to what extent that should be reformed.  The Minister this morning indicated that this was a matter which should be left over until the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown publish their report.  I can see the Minister's difficulties; there is no doubt that there is an overwhelming need to deal with all the issues relating to reforming the law concerning the age of majority.  I imagine that if this Bill when originally published had contained provisions relating to the age of marriage, the opposite criticism would have been made of the Minister. He could then have been accused of pre-empting the work of the committee.  If he excluded the law relating to marriage from the Age of Majority Bill he was open to criticism that he really should deal with it and take into account not merely what the Law Reform Commission said but also what has been largely agreed within the committee and of pre-empting the work of that committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy Woods in taking the view that this legislation provides a unique opportunity to deal with the problems relating to the age of marriage.  It is quite usual for amendments to be tabled on Committee Stage to deal with different aspects of matters directly related to the legislation contained in the original Bill.  I hope that on Committee Stage we can insert an appropriate amendment to deal with the law relating to the age of marriage.  I express that as a hope because, having been in this House since 1981, one sees how frustratingly long it takes to produce legislation relating to any aspect of law reform.  I am afraid that if we do not avail of the opportunity of dealing with the age for marriage and reform in that area in the context of this Bill we may wait another two or three years before any legislation appears <Col N="1637" /> to deal with that issue no matter what the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown say in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is no public controversy about the need to raise the minimum age for marriage.  Very few people take the view that it is appropriate to allow persons under 16 years of age to marry in any circumstances even when they apply to the court.  It is interesting to note that that facility is largely unavailed of.  Statistics published by the Law Reform Commission in their final report showed that in the period from 1978 to 1982 there were only 16 applications from people under 16 years of age to the High Clurt seeking permission to marry.  Permission was granted in only ten of those cases.  There is no over-riding public pressure or interest in maintaining the legal situation to allow people under 16 years of age to marry.  The Law Reform Commission did a great service in the work that they did and they looked at the matter in great detail.  There is an excellent appendix to their working paper produced by Dr. Helen Bourke dealing with the sociological aspects.  The point is well made and research has established that marriages of very young people are more at risk than marriages between people in an older age group.</P>
    <P>It is now generally accepted that 18 years should be the minimum age for marriage.  I do not think a single written submission or oral submission was received by the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown during all the work we have done since our establishment in which anyone suggested 16 years should be preserved as the age at which people can marry.  Virtually unanimously all groups who made submissions to us right across the social spectrum, and the religious spectrum, joined in recommending that 18 years should be the minimum age for marriage.  The only matter which arose for debate was whether in any circumstances people between the ages of 16 and 18 years should be allowed to marry.  There was a general concensus view that people over 18 years should be allowed to marry without the necessity <Col N="1638" /> for parental consent and that, as a general rule, people under 18 years of age should not be allowed to marry.</P>
    <P>The only other view which has arisen is that perhaps, in some circumstances, people under 18 years and above 16 years should be allowed to marry.  The Law Reform Commission suggested conditions which should be attached to that. The Committee on Marriage Breakdown have virtually finalised their recommendations on proposals in this area.  They have been widely published.  Effectively they are that normally persons between 16 and 18 years should not be allowed to marry without the consent of both parents and the consent of the court, be it a family court when it is established ultimately, or in the intervening period by the President of the High Court.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to adopt those recommendations on Committee Stage. It is in the interest of the protection of marriage and of ensuring that people who enter into marriage have some opportunity to think out the relationship which they are entering into.  It is also necessary for the protection of young people. Under the current law, people from 16 years upwards can marry, provided they have parental consent.  From the research done on this, one of the major areas, particularly in the 16 to 18 years age group, and particularly in relation to young girls, where parental consent is forthcoming for marriage is where the girl is pregnant.</P>
    <P>The second thing which has been learned in this area is that marriages of young people are at risk.  The marriage of a young person who marries due to pregnancy is very greatly at risk as a long term stable marriage.  It is in the interests of young people between 16 and 18 years that we reform the law in this area, and that they should not be subject to possible pressure from parents requiring them to marry, in a sense to ensure that the neighbours will not find out that an unwanted or unexpected pregnancy has arisen in the context of a young unmarried girl.</P>
    <P>I very strongly urge the Minister to do this.  I welcome the fact that Deputy Woods adopted the approach which he <Col N="1639" /> adopted this morning.  It indicates that there is agreement right across party lines that this matter should be tackled and dealt with in this Bill.  I welcome the fact that Deputy Woods did not suggest that, if it was dealt with in this Bill, it would be in any way pre-empting the work of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown. It would be seen as an immediate and rapid response to the gigantic task undertaken by the committee if, within a week or two of the committee finalising their report and even in the context of completing their work, this Government were to be seen to adopt one of the recommendations made.  This Bill provides the ideal vehicle for doing that.  I urge that strongly on the Minister.  I welcome the fact that Deputy Woods similarly urged the Minister to deal with this issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the Bill are very welcome. The previous speaker made a point about the difficulties experienced by young married people of 18 or 19 years of age in acquiring loans for the purchase of a family home from a local authority or a building society.  This Bill will enable property to be purchased in joint names by young couples when they marry.  It will remove the illogical legal impediment which has been there, and which was originally created to protect young people.  For the past two decades it has been seen as a major impediment and effectively discriminating against them when they sought housing loans from local authorities, or banks, or building societies.  It is to be welcomed that we are dealing with this.  My only regret is that it was not dealt with many years ago. At least we are dealing with it now.</P>
    <P>The other areas I am concerned about in the Bill &mdash; and I do not wish to go on at any great length, or to repeat what other Deputies said &mdash; are the provisions of the Bill relating to custody and maintenance to which the Minister referred briefly.  The Bill seeks to provide uniformity in the sense of making 18 years the age of majority and in saying that, where legislation refers to the age of majority, or full age, or infancy, or <Col N="1640" /> minors, or minority, or whatever, people will cease to be regarded as being minors, or infants, once they reach the age of 18 years.</P>
    <P>The legislation also effectively states that where in any legislation there is reference to the age of 21 years, such provision in future will be interpreted as if it were 18 years.  It goes on to make a number of exceptions to that.  It refers to the Marriages Act which relates in a sense to the issue I referred to previously, the age for marriage.  It goes on to allow adoption orders to continue to be made in relation to people between the ages of 18 and 21 years.  It deals with income tax and social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about one aspect of the legislation and it is my hope that, on Committee Stage, the Minister will seek to deal with this issue and bring in an appropriate amendment to the Bill. An amendment in this area is virtually essential.  The Minister referred to the Law Reform Commission's proposals. He said:</P>
    <P>Other proposals of the Law Reform Commission which are being left over for another day are those relating to an increase from 16 to 18 as the age up to which parents can be obliged to maintain a child under the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, and the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, and as the age at which a parent ceases to be liable to maintain a child for the purposes of social welfare legislation. These proposals are not directly related to a reduction in the age of majority and will be dealt with separately.</P>
    <P>The problem is that they are not dealt with separately.  They are being dealt with in this legislation.  I do not believe the consequences of the manner in which they are being dealt with in this legislation are fully appreciated.  The Minister is correct in saying that, under the Maintenance Act, the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, and the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, where there is a dispute between a married <Col N="1641" /> couple as to whether a parent is properly supporting a child &mdash; more usually it is a wife seeking support from a husband for a child &mdash; the child should be supported or a maintenance order made by the court should remain in force until the child attains the age of 16 years. That is not the end of the story in the context of married couples.  From what the Minister said, it would appear as if that were the case.</P>
    <P>The position is that maintenance orders made for the support of children under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, can continue in force under the existing law until children attain the age of 21 years.  There is no qualification to that.  Under that Act a maintenance order can be made for the support of a child until that child attains the age of 21 years. Under the 1976 legislation, a maintenance order made for the support of a child will continue after the child is 16 years of age, if the child continues to participate in a full time course of education or instruction, either at second level or at third level.</P>
    <P>The real effect of the legislation at present is that, by and large, maintenance orders made by the courts for the support of children normally remain in force unless a child completes his education and commences full time employment.  A maintenance order will normally remain in force under the existing law until the child attains at least the age of 18 years. If the child goes on to third level education it will remain in force until the child attains the age of 21 years.</P>
    <P>Under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, where a couple are living apart, where a marriage has broken down, and money is required for the support of a child going into third level education, and where the money sought relates not merely to the every day maintenance of the child, but also to the need to require, for example, a wealthy father, or a father who can afford to do so to contribute to university fees the father can be required to pay university fees or fees for other types of third level education. The effect of this Bill, as currently drafted &mdash; because it does not exclude the <Col N="1642" /> provision of the Guardianship of Infants Act and the Family Law Act in the manner in which it excludes other legislation such as the Marriages (Ireland) Act and the Adoption Acts &mdash; would be, on the day it came into force, to wipe out overnight the maintenance rights entitlement of all children over the age of 18 years.  It could, in effect, wipe out the right of a deserted wife, through the courts, to require her husband to pay third level education fees for a child over 18 participating in third level education or, if a child of that age were still in secondary school, could put the wife in a position where there were school fees to be paid and she could not require the father to make those payments either.</P>
    <P>The position is not as it is being perceived to date.  I would press extremely strongly for a substantial amendment to be made to the legislation in this area. It must be realised that there is a total difference between the concept of somebody attaining the age of majority and of somebody retaining financial dependency. It is acknowledged under existing family law that either a husband or wife may be financially dependent until the day he or she dies.  The fact that a youngster attains the magical age of 18 years one day will not make him or her any less financially dependent than at the age of 17 years and 11 months.</P>
    <P>Many hundreds of maintenance orders are made annually, largely against husbands, to require them to support children over the age of 18 years and there must, at this stage, be many thousands of such orders in existence.  The people who would suffer if the appropriate amendment were not made to the legislation would, firstly, be children of broken marriages because where a marriage is functioning properly and a parent can afford to support the child or pay third level education fees, they are paid. Normally there is no problem about that. With a broken marriage, very often the deserting husband, for example, is not willing to make any more money available to his family than he is forced to make available by the courts.  Rights available to young people since 1964 <Col N="1643" /> when the Guardianship of Infants Act came into force would be wiped out in one stroke.</P>
    <P>There is no need to confuse the concept of attaining the age of majority with the notion of financial dependency.  We have not confused the desirability of allowing adoption orders to be made in respect of young people until they attain the age of 21.  It seems somewhat inconsistent that someone between the ages of 18 and 21 would be allowed to be adopted but in the context of a broken marriage a parent would not be required to support a dependent young person between the ages of 18 and 21.  Many people would wish to seek reassurance from the Minister that this aspect of the legislation will be amended.  It would create a great deal of concern on the part of many if the necessity to amend the original drafting of the Bill to deal with this issue were not recognised.  In doing that, I would urge the Minister not simply to amend it to provide a re-instatement of the current provision that maintenance can be cut off at the age of 21 years, but to look at what is being done in other jurisdictions.  In other countries, for example, it is acknowledged that a young person might be involved in third level education of an undergraduate nature until the age of 21½ or 22 years, or slightly older.  Where finances permit, the courts are given a discretion to order a parent to contribute towards the support of a dependent young person until such age as is appropriate, with a cut-off date which takes into account the normal age at which people would complete undergraduate education.  This is not suggesting that the court should impose a permanent meal ticket or require parents permanently to support children until they reach the age of 40, 50 or 60.  In marital breakdown, the age of 21 has been seen in practice to be the wrong cut-off age &mdash; 22½ years is about right.</P>
    <P>It should be said that with one exception the Minister has, in the existing legislation and in the context of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, sought to make it coincide with the 1976 <Col N="1644" /> Family Law Act where if someone is so physically or mentally disabled as to remain dependent and unable to obtain employment, he or she would continue to be maintained by the parents.  This is a vital and important area for many thousands of children.  It would be an area of great concern to many thousands of wives who are dependent on maintenance orders and who could experience severe financial difficulty.  Without over-exaggerating, if this aspect of the legislation were not to be amended it could place in serious jeopardy the rights of many young people to participate in third level education, by virtue of the fact that they happened to be children of parents whose marriage had, unfortunately, broken down.</P>
    <P>The problem in dealing with legislation of this nature is to have a coherent overview of how it will affect individuals. One further argument in support of the amendment I am seeking is that with any young person at present seeking a grant to participate in third level education, the entitlement to obtain such a grant is judged on the financial earnings of the parents.  Whether the parents are living together or separated, by and large the dominant feature is how much is being earned by the husband or the wife in determining whether the young person will qualify for a grant, taken together with the points system and results achieved by the children in, for example, leaving certificate examinations.  It would be somewhat anomalous to disqualify somebody from being entitled to a third level education grant by virtue of the fact that both parents have a particular income which is too high and then to prevent the child from requiring the parent whose income has disqualified the child from getting a grant to contribute towards his participation in third level education.  I have no doubt that the Minister will consider this matter very sympathetically.  I sincerely hope he will.  I hope that whatever advice is forthcoming to him from his Department on this issue will confirm that the position is as I state and that whatever steps are necessary now to draft an appropriate amendment to deal with <Col N="1645" /> this issue will be taken.</P>
    <P>So far I have dealt with the effect in the context of married couples whose marriages have broken down and the financial supports which are currently made available for children of such marriages. This equally applies to unmarried mothers.  The legislation also seeks to cut off the time at which a father can be required to contribute towards the support of an illegitimate child.  As the law stands, the child born outside marriage is, in effect, in the same position as one born in marriage.  Once the courts have made an affiliation order, a father can be required to contribute towards that child's support until the child attains the age of 16 years or, if the child continues to participate in a full time course of education or instruction, until he or she attains the age of 21 years.  This legislation, as currently drafted, will cut down the age from 21 to 18 years and could equally have a dramatic effect on the future lives and prospects of a number of children whose mothers depend on affiliation payments as a contribution towards the support, maintenance and education of such children between the ages of 18 and 21 years.</P>
    <P>This is not a minor problem which will affect only a small number of people.  If this aspect of the legislation is not amended it will have a dramatic effect on the life-styles and future prospects of a large number of young people who are unfortunate enough to come from homes broken up due to marriage breakdown or to be born outside marriage.  I hope that the Minister will bring in the required amendments to this legislation and thus confirm our concern and show the extent to which this House is anxious to ensure that any assistance or support required is available to deal with the financial problem which arises following on marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I have gone on so long on that issue, but I feel extremely strongly about it.  I hope that the Minister will take my comments as constructive. He is to be congratulated on producing this Bill.  I hope that he will provide for the two areas of amendments that I have <Col N="1646" /> referred to.  His predecessors in the past and many Government Ministers of different Departments over the years have waxed lyrical about the need to produce legislation to reform the whole law in relation to the age of majority.  The Minister has come into this House after a lengthy debate on the Criminal Justice Bill to steer through this Bill which is of major importance to many young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the welcome for this Bill.  Its general acceptance in the House is clear and I hope that it will have an easy passage through the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not do certain things. Despite the fact that it proposes to amend the age of majority, it does not give persons aged 18 the right to run for parliamentary elections, because that would require a constitutional amendment.  The Constitution provides that persons of 21 years or more may be candidates for the Dáil.  People who are 18 years of age can vote for candidates for the Dáil, pay their taxes, be married, and enter into almost every other contract under this legislation, but they cannot be candidates for this Parliament.  Considering that half the population of the country is deemed to be under the age of 25, then a huge number of people in Dublin, for instance, cannot elect one of their peers to the Dáil if they so wish.  I am not saying that the demand for that would be great, but people should have the opportunity to elect persons aged 18.  If we can say that people of that age are capable of entering into all of these contracts and that they reach the age of majority at 18, we should go the full way and amend the Constitution so that the person of 18 can run for parliamentary elections.  I hope the Minister will bear that in mind when next we have a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the ridiculous possibility of people marrying at the age of 16. A colleague informed me recently that in an area of his constituency something like 25 per cent of the people are single parent families.  That relates largely to an argument which I suppose we will make under another Bill in a few weeks time.  Such people see it as proper that they can enter <Col N="1647" /> into that sort of relationship because the law states that in certain circumstances people of 16 years of age can be married. I do not believe that the general public accept the age of 16 as being in any way reasonable for that and the House feels strongly that 16 is far too young and that the age of majority would be much more reasonable to apply in the case of marriage. I can say that Dublin Deputies at any rate are consulted in their clinics by a large number of deserted wives, girls who have married young or entered into common law marriages when they were young because that seemed acceptable. It is time that we set some standard which would be more acceptable than the age of 16 and probably 18, the age of majority, meets that standard.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as stated in section 2(3), does not extend the age of 18 to all areas of legislation.  For instance, under tax law if a parent covenants to pay his or her son or daughter a fixed amount of money, that sum can be deducted from that parent's tax liability if the person attending third level education is over 21 years of age.  Many people who have tried to introduce a covenant have been told, &ldquo;Sorry, your son or daughter is only 19 or 20.  You cannot introduce a covenant because your child must be over 21.&rdquo; Perhaps many people feel that with the passing of this Bill they will now be able to enter into this covenant relationship for tax purposes.  That is not the case. Under existing law in the area of social welfare and income tax the age of majority is not the age which applies.  The age in such cases is 21 or over, and that position will remain.  That is worth stating clearly because many people may feel that they can enter into tax arrangements with their children who are at third level education which they could not heretofore enter into.  That is not the case.  This law does not provide for that.  Perhaps now that we are setting 18 as the age of majority we can recommend to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare that they both review the age clauses in various social welfare and taxation Bills or Acts as they relate to <Col N="1648" /> persons of 21 years or over.</P>
    <P>Public representatives are encountering all the time the problems with the current arrangements.  For instance, a married couple under the age of majority cannot enter into hire purchase agreements in most cases, yet we have allowed them by law to enter into the contract of marriage, probably the biggest single agreement they will ever make.  That is appalling.  Also, where one of the partners is under 21 years the right to obtain Housing Finance Agency loans or normal SDA loans from local authorities is affected.  I take it from the Bill that there is an express provision that this will no longer apply, and that the age of 18 will apply for such loans.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that the term &ldquo;infant&rdquo; is being redefined or extended.  I hope that at the other end of the scale a person described as an infant will also get the necessary protection under the Children Bills which are now overdue.  I hope that in dealing with this Age of Majority Bill and redefining the term &ldquo;infant&rdquo; we will soon be in a position to deal with the term &ldquo;infant&rdquo; as it applies to children, and that that Children Bill will be before the House without further delay.</P>
    <P>Parents of infants or persons under a stated age have a certain responsibility in law.  Take, for instance, a parent who is selling goods from a stall in a public place and who should not be selling those goods.  If the child of that parent is doing the same thing then the Garda can prosecute the parent for the child's act.</P>
    <P>That is one of the few situations where another party can be held responsible for the acts of a son or daughter.  This area relates definitely to the Minister for Justice.  There is a growing view that where people are under the age of majority and are regular offenders committing similar crimes daily under the criminal law, the parents of such persons should be held accountable.  There should be a provision whereby parents can be brought to court and told, &ldquo;it is not just your children that are the problem; you are not exercising your parental responsibilities for a minor&rdquo;.  Since there is a provision for prosecuting where people <Col N="1649" /> sell in a public place we should be able to extend that principle to other areas so that minors who are habitual offenders can be brought before the courts with their parents and their parents asked to account for their responsibility in regard to the crimes committed.  I hope the Minister takes that suggestion on board. I welcome the Bill and I hope it is given a quick passage through the House.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the House so soon bearing in mind the very heavy legislative timetable he has had to deal with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had an opportunity of reading the Minister's speech but I should like to make a few comments on the legislation before us.  It calls for a degree of analysis as to why the disabilities, as they may seem to be, on people between the ages of 18 and 21 are long established in the law.  The reality is that these were not introduced as disabilities.  In fact, they were introduced as protections for minors.  There are some notable examples, even in our current law, which we would do well to note as we change to keep abreast, and properly so, of current trends.  We must reflect on the fact that some of the protections that exist in the law for those under 21 will not be there in the future.  I am not saying that that in any way cuts across the major impact of the Bill but it would be well to bring some cases to mind.  It is well that the House, and the public, should have a broad awareness of the impact of any change.  Not all of what is established is wrong or all that will be introduced will be in support or in ease of the position of the minority group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give some examples.  In law cases at present any person under 21 has to bring the action in the name of what is called the next friend, notably the parent or nearest relative.  On the face of it that may seem to be a disability but it is meant to be a protection.  In the normal case settlements at law can be concluded on behalf of an adult without the consent of a court but the court has a special function in relation to a person under 21.  The function of the court is <Col N="1650" /> that it must approve of any settlement reached between a minor under 21 and the other party to litigation.  That was introduced and is practised as a protection for the minor.  There have been cases where courts have refused to sanction settlements that would otherwise not come before the court for approval.  I am familiar with many such cases.  It is just as well that we at least take note of that and try to consider if there may be some scope in some instances &mdash; I must acknowledge that I am not in a position to detail them now because I had hoped to delay my contribution to later &mdash; where that protection might still be applied.</P>
    <P>In traditional legal arrangements in respect of people under 21 there is a whole body of the law that says that where they enter into contracts of service, or otherwise, and if they are not clearly in the interests of the minor they may be annulled and the courts may not implement the effects of the contracts because one of the parties was a minor. The leading case in this regard concerned a man who was known as the Georgeous Gael, Jack Doyle, a rather colourful character, entertainer, boxer and wrestler who signed a contract as a minor. Being the type of character he was he might not always have been available to fulfil the exact terms of his contract.  A major case took place in the British courts in which it was found that it was important to protect the minor, as he was at that time.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister's advisers have looked into this matter.  This could apply in relation to anything dealing with the dissolution of marriage.  I do not wish to get involved in that issue now but sometimes the existing pattern would be in favour, as it appears to be in terms of court decisions or separation deeds, of the female partner <i>vis-à-vis</i> the male partner in marriage and under a new operation of the law as we move progressively, and there is need for that, each partner should be treated equally.  Each partner should have equal capacity, knowledge, and obligation, obligation being the other balance of right.  Sometimes one finds that rights that accrue under what would <Col N="1651" /> seem to be a more enlightened climate would be more evenly balanced.  The trend heretofore as defined in the law will not necessarily always operate to the advantage of the person or persons we now propose to help.</P>
    <P>I am supporting the Minister's proposals but we must recognise the points I have made.  The law after all reflects the climate of the time.  It was not introduced at any time for frivolous reasons.  Constitutional arrangements or otherwise always reflected the character of the time. This major change is one of the recommendations of the commission who were familiar with many of the matters I mentioned. I hope an open mind is kept on the operation of the provisions as they emerge under the Bill when it is passed. It may be necessary to consider if the established protections in respect of infants are still necessary in respect of those between 18 and 21, or a younger age in the event of either of the two getting married before 18.  That is the only comment I have to make and it has not been made by way of any negative criticism of what the Minister is proposing and which no doubt the House will support.  Nonetheless I should like the House to be aware that there will be consequences on any change of this nature that perhaps might not be fully envisaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Brehon laws seemed to recognise that a child required some legal protection, the concept of a fixed age at which a person could attain maturity apparently was not known at that time.  For example, normally a son had no power to make a binding contract during the lifetime of his father and while he was a member of his father's household.  After the Norman invasion in the 12th century those invaders began to impose their system of law on this country.  Several hundreds of years elapsed before the English common law system, as supplemented by statute law, effectively became the law throughout the land.  The common law treated a person under 21 years of age as a minor <Col N="1652" /> and gave such a person special status.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said this morning, the law acted on the principle that a minor should be protected from his improvidence and inexperience but that this should be done so as not to cause unnecessary hardship to any person dealing with a minor.  With the passage of time, statutes altered the legal position of minors.  Some of the more notable of these statutes were, for example, the industrial and provident Act of 1883, which permitted a person between the ages of 16 and 21 to become a member of a registered society unless there was provision in the rules of that society to the contrary.  While such a person could enjoy all the rights of membership of that society, nevertheless a person under the age of 21 could not become a member of the committee, a trustee, manager or treasurer of that society.</P>
      <P>Then the Friendly Societies' Acts of 1896 and 1908 enabled the rules of a friendly society to provide for the admission as a member of a person under the age of 21, that a person over 16 years of age could execute all assignments but &mdash; as in case of the industrial and provident Act of 1883 &mdash; he could not become a member of the committee, be a trustee, manager or treasurer of the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Credit Union Act of 1966 applied the provisions of that industrial and provident Act to credit unions.  It should be noted that nothing in those three Acts gave a minor the power to do anything that he could not otherwise do.  For instance, he could not borrow money from such a society or union and he could not contract for the repayment of borrowed money or give security for it. These actions on behalf of a minor are invalidated by the infants' relief Act of 1874.  It should be said that, since the enactment of the Succession Act, 1965, a person who is of sound mind and has attained the age of 18 years or has been married is authorised or eligible to make a will.  The Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1972, dealt with the referendum in relation to the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1972.  This amendment of the Constitution reduced from 21 to <Col N="1653" /> 18 the age at which a person had the right to vote in Dáil and Presidential elections and referenda.  Following the passage of that referendum an 18 year old had the right to vote in elections and referenda and to be a member of a local authority. Their eligibility for membership of Dáil Éireann still remains at age 21.  Moreover, to be eligible for membership of Seanad Éireann a person must be eligible for membership of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Juries' Act, 1976 reduced the minimum age limit for jury service in a court or a coroner's inquest to 18 years.  The common law rule, that a person does not attain majority until 21, applied in England as it does here.  However, in July 1965 a committee was appointed there to consider whether any changes in the law relating to contracts entered into by persons under the age of 21 were desirable. That committee's report was presented to the British Parliament in July 1967 and recommended that the historical causes for fixing 21 years as the age of majority were not relevant to contemporary society and recommended that the age of majority be reduced to 18 years.  That recommendation was accepted and, on 1 January 1970, the age of majority there was reduced from 21 to 18 years.</P>
    <P>In 1970 the European Committee on Legal Co-operation established a committee of experts to consider the question of the age of full capacity.  Following examination of their report a resolution was passed recommending that Governments of member states should lower the age of majority to below 21 years and, if they deemed it advisable, to fix that age at 18.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to something Deputy Shatter had to say because that European committee made a very interesting recommendation.  The recommendation was that the Governments of member states should take appropriate remedial measures where the lowering of age of majority would substantially curtail the rights of children to be maintained by their parents with the possible consequences of depriving them of the necessary assistance for pursuing their <Col N="1654" /> education or training.  Since that resolution was passed, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Sweden have reduced the age of majority to 18.  The question then posed was, should the law in Ireland be changed?</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission Working Paper No. 2 of 1977 examined the situation.  They advertised in the press requesting any person who had views on the law relating to the age of majority to communicate those views to them.  In a submission to the Law Reform Commission Cork County Council were concerned particularly with the desirability of reducing the age of majority so that persons under the age of 21 could become legally entitled to avail of house purchase loans.  All of us who are members of local authorities have been confronted with this problem from time to time because in recent years there has been an increase in the number of people who have married before reaching the age of 21.  This occasions many serious problems, for example, in relation to their inability to obtain a mortgage from a building society or a house purchase loan from a local authority.  I am most pleased that the provisions of this Bill rectify that situation.</P>
    <P>A submission from the Department of Agriculture to the Law Reform Commission favoured a reduction in the age of majority to 18 years.  The view expressed was that if the age of majority was to be reduced to 18 lending agencies would be more readily prepared to give credit to young farmers at an earlier age.  At present a progressive farmer under 21 years of age is unable to implement farm development programmes or be eligible to avail of the provisions of the farm modernisation scheme simply because lending agencies will not consider making a loan to him.  Furthermore, the inability of a young farmer to obtain a loan because he is a minor may tend to frustrate the desire of other, older farmers, to pass on their farms to their successors at a younger age than had been customary.</P>
    <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions in <Col N="1655" /> their submissions stated that they should like to see a reduction in the age of majority to 18 years, mainly to allow young people take a more active part in the administration of credit unions.  They argued that persons under the age of 21 are interested in community affairs, displaying an ability and sense of responsibility to warrant their participation in decision making.</P>
    <P>In their submission, FLAC contended that a reduction in the age of majority to 18 years would be beneficial to everybody and suggested it would prevent young people hiding behind their special status as infants.  The National Youth Council also favoured a reduction in the age of majority to 18, their views being based on answers they received following the circulation of questionnaires to their members.</P>
    <P>The present Bill formally recognises the fact that, generally speaking, an 18 year old person of this generation is as mature and responsible as was the 21 year old of past generations.  An endeavour to explain how this came about would necessitate a discussion of the social, educational and technological revolutions of recent decades.  Young people in Ireland between the ages of 18 and 21 no longer will feel at a disadvantage in comparison with their counterparts in Northern Ireland where the age of majority was reduced in 1969.  That in itself, underlines the fact that this Bill is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The immediate effect of the Bill will be the opening of the commercial world to those aged between 18 and 21 who will no longer require a guarantor to give legal effect to their contracts.  No longer will we have the situation where an 18 year old could join the Army but could not buy a toy gun on credit; where he could obtain a driving licence but could not buy a car or even a bicycle on hire purchase without a guarantor; or where he could get married but could not buy a kitchen table by deferred payments. Under this Bill a person aged 18 can be termed a new adult and will be liable for the payment of any money he may <Col N="1656" /> borrow for goods.  He may also take out a mortgage or make a hire purchase agreement.  He will be free to make settlements on his property.  He will be free to buy and sell land and to give valid receipts without the intervention of a trustee or a third person.  He will be entitled to act on the committee of a trade union or any such body.  He may enter into binding contracts for the repayment of money and may marry without the consent of his parents or guardian or the consent of the President of the High Court.  He may be sued or sue in his own name.</P>
    <P>Some people who will benefit from the Bill may feel that wonderful avenues of opportunity are being opened up to them by the removal of various restrictions which previously applied.  It would be unfair not to point out that their rights will be balanced by duties and responsibilities which they will also acquire.  They will find that they can buy motor cars but that an 18 year old driver who crashes his car may be sued in his own name.  If he fails to pay his bills he may find himself in distinguished company in <i>Stubbs Gazette</i> and may have the doubtful privilege of being declared a bankrupt.  If he acts as a guarantor for some younger person he may find that it involves more than just signing his name.</P>
    <P>With all these extra duties and responsibilities falling on the shoulders of those aged between 18 and 21 and having regard for the fact that the voting age was reduced to 18 in 1973, it seems inevitable that this group will seek the right to be elected to the Oireachtas.  Unfortunately, one right not being conferred on them as adults is the right of election to Dáil Éireann because the Constitution excludes anybody under the age of 21.  It may be worth having a look at other jurisdictions to see their minimum age for entering Parliament.  I note that in some of the Canadian provinces, the Federal Republic of Germany, New Zealand and Sweden the minimum age is set at 18.  It would appear that there is a well established precedent for allowing people of this age to have a voice in Parliament.</P>
    <P>For the past decade our political parties <Col N="1657" /> have given a special status to youth in their organisations.  While there may be some reluctance to allow 18 year olds to stand as candidates for Dáil Éireann, there is some merit in creating a panel for the election of, say, three young people to the Seanad.   The nominating bodies for this panel would be the National Youth Council, the Union of Students in Ireland and other youth bodies.  It would require an amendment to the Constitution but this would not create any more difficulty than the previous amendments dealing with the voting age and the voting rights of the universities.  It would also be consistent with the proposal to bring young people into greater consultation at a higher level.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on updating the present law and I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the bringing before the House of this Bill. The Minister and his Department must be complimented on moving in relation to this very important matter.  The subject has been under discussion for many years but until today no Government action was taken.  I am very pleased that our mid-west Minister is the person who has pioneered this important and progressive legislation.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of this Bill is to give legal status to a person aged 18.  This is an extremely important measure in this modern age when so many demands are made on young people and so many responsibilities are forced upon them. The Minister in his speech mentioned that one reason for adopting 21 as the age of majority was that it was generally believed that a person of 21 was physically strong enough to wear heavy armour and carry heavy weapons.  We may not have to do these things today but much greater weights of responsibility are thrust upon us by modern society.  For this reason it is important that the age be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak especially of young people who are setting up home and who are not in a position to raise a local authority loan <Col N="1658" /> or a mortgage to purchase their house. Girls are inclined to marry younger than boys and there is a certain discrimination against women because in many cases the name on the deeds of a house has to be the name of the husband only since it is not possible to put the property in joint names because of the age limitation.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission carried out much groundwork and examined many submissions.  Their final proposals were based on the evidence presented to them.  The Minister is today introducing one of those proposals.  They also suggested that the age of marriage be reduced and I am very happy that the Minister has not decided to reduce the age of majority and the age of marriage in a combined Bill.  It should be clearly stated in this House that marriage is a very important aspect of one's life which must be seen as something separate and definite.  It is more in the nature of a social contract than a legal contract.  It is necessary to see that difference.  For that reason I am happy that the Minister has adopted this approach.  However, I hope that the Minister will see fit at a very early date to introduce a Bill to increase the age of marriage from 16 to 18.  It is imperative that action be taken on that aspect sooner rather than later.  I say this because of legislation which may come before the House shortly.</P>
    <P>In Canada, 21 is generally accepted as the age of majority but during the past decade there has been a move to reduce the age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity to raise this very serious matter and I thank the Minister for coming here to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann was founded in 1951 and is deep rooted in every parish and town of the country. It is internationally renowned and has <Col N="1659" /> branches in Britain, Europe, America and elsewhere.  A Bill was passed during the last Dáil session granting £300,000 to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  This money was to come out of the funds of suitors.  From my information, there were no strings attached to the transfer of those moneys.  I cannot understand how the Government did not transfer that money in total.  A sum of £200,000 was transferred and I would like the Minister to outline in detail by whom that money was transferred and who received it.  Perhaps he would tell the House the reasons why the balance was not paid at that time to Comhaltas Céoltóirí Éireann.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know why pressure has been brought to bear on Comhaltas by his Department in particular. At the request of his Department, Comhaltas had to change their accounting and auditing procedures.  They were asked to do a six month audit as a result of queries raised by the Minister's officials.  Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann carried out a six month audit which cost them a lot in professional fees.  Over the past few years Comhaltas expended a great deal on professional fees at the instigation of Government Departments.  Once again this organisation had to spend a large sum at a time when they were not financially self-sufficient.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that one of the reasons Comhaltas find themselves in financial difficulties is that they built this very beautiful theatre in Monkstown, of which we are all very proud.  They went ahead with that project at a time when our economy was very buoyant. The recession hit us all, and they were victims too.  The liquid resources they were expecting did not come their way. In 1981 they expected a Government grant to offset their financial targets, but they did not get that grant and they had no option but to borrow £200,000 from ICC to meet the contracts they had signed and to which they were committed.  Due to the high inflation rate and the difficult economic times Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann found themselves in financial difficulties. <Col N="1660" /></P>
    <P>As Irish people we all have a patriotic duty to ensure that an organisation like Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann is maintained for the preservation of our identity. They are the strongest cultural movement in the country and they have brought us international fame, attracted many people to our shores and, indirectly, have helped to generate a lot of revenue for the economy.  They employ 17 permanent and three part time workers.  Comhaltas are reasonably good employers.  They pay their PRSI and PAYE contributions like every other employer.  We must preserve those jobs and we must preserve this cultural institute.</P>
    <P>We should compare the annual grants being given to other organisations &mdash; ballet gets £400,000, the Projects Arts Centre get £160,000, opera gets £250,000 and Players get in the region of £3 million. There are over one million people involved with Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and we should compare that number with those involved in the other groups.  I acknowledge the contributions made by those groups and I welcome whatever support can be given to them but we must at least examine the contribution made by Comhaltas.  We must compare the numbers involved in Comhaltas with those involved in other organisations and we must also compare the grants paid to Comhaltas with those paid to the other organisations.  If we examine our conscience in this regard we will admit that we have not given a fair financial contribution to this outstanding organisation over the past few years.  I cannot understand how this House passed £300,000 for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and that money has not been transferred to them.</P>
    <P>Realising their financial situation and the fact that they are short £100,000 by way of the grant which was passed but not paid, there has been accruable interest on their financial commitments since the £200,000 was transferred.  I would like the Minister to outline in detail the reason the balance was not paid, to say exactly when it will be paid and if he will pay that organisation the normal commercial <Col N="1661" /> interest rate they had to pay for the period the grant was denied to them.  The Department have a duty to make sure that this money, plus the interest, is paid to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.</P>
    <P>Again, I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this great organisation does not stagnate and that the money passed by this House, plus the interest, will be paid to them and I ask him to tell the House why pressure is being applied to this organisation by his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Treacy for giving me the time to contribute to this debate and I thank the Chair for agreeing to it.  I do not want to add to the friction that has been generated between Comhaltas and Government Departments. I cannot understand why such an organisation, which has brought our music and traditions back from the dead, has been neglected by successive Governments.  Comhaltas have many volunteers who apply themselves very assiduously to preserving our music and traditions.  Most Governments did not do enough for Comhaltas; I am not saying my Government were more generous but they were more considerate and more aware of the great work Comhaltas were doing.</P>
      <P>I do not know the cause of this friction, but there is hassle to the point where the Government do not reflect the wishes of the people who are indebted to Comhaltas. What happened in this case is similar to what happens in other voluntary organisations.  Many people are willing to work for these organisations on a voluntary basis and the Governments, and the present Government too, treat these organisations as they treat sporting organisations.  Their attitude is, &ldquo;They are enjoying what they are doing and let them do it for nothing.  Why should we give them money?&rdquo;  When the case was being made here for money the attitude then was that as they have so many members another £5 per head would give them what they required.  It was as though the members were not giving enough in time, money and effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say anything that <Col N="1662" /> would add to what is the near rejection of Comhaltas by the Government.  The least that might be done is that the moneys voted for them should have been paid before now.  It should not have been necessary for Deputy Treacy, Deputy Daly or myself to say anything further. What was right should have been done. I hope that next year and in future years, irrespective of which Government are in power, the tremendous and invaluable work done by Comhaltas will be honoured more generously than has been the case in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to say a few words on this matter and to lend my support to what has been said so well here by Deputy Treacy and Deputy Tunney.</P>
      <P>It has been a cause of concern to all of us to have it brought to our attention in the past few days that this substantial amount, in the region of £100,000, is outstanding.  I am alarmed about this because there is now a crisis situation in Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann which may necessitate the cutting off of some of the services they have and the closing down soon of their operations.  We have been told that insurance cover may have to be cancelled, that telephones may be cut off and the ESB supply terminated.  All of this could be avoided if there was payment of the amount of money which it is considered is due and which should be paid.  I should like to hear from the Minister the reason it has not been paid.  I am sure this debate this afternoon can expedite payment of the outstanding amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go into detail on the arguments that have been made here.  When the Funds of Suitors Bill was going through the Dáil I highlighted the impact of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann on the cultural and social activities of my own constituency and also nationally.  I said then we needed to put the financial structure of Comhaltas on a sound footing. Incidentally, I do not criticise the amounts given from the fund for other projects.  We know that the other projects that have been grant-aided out of the <Col N="1663" /> Funds of Suitors legislation are worthwhile and we do not criticise what it has been decided to pay to other organisations and associations.  However, there is need for an explanation now as to how this situation has arisen.  We hope the discussion this afternoon will have the effect of speeding up payment, thus fulfilling the obligations we entered into last July.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm an deis seo a bheith agam miniú a thabhairt céard go baileach atá ag tarlú maidir leis an íocaíocht seo. Faoi mar is eol don Teach, cuireadh £300,000 ar fáil do Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann faoin Acht don Ciste Eagróirí 1984 níos luaithe i mbliana.  Faoin Acht sin, alt 2 (c), tá sé de fhreagracht ormsa mar Aire na Gaeltachta cinntiú go bhfuil na cuntais i ceart, agus chomh maith leis sin chugamsa a thagann an t-iarratas agus ormsa atá an fhreagracht an t-airgead sin a íoc.</P>
      <P>Íocadh £200,000 don ICC mar aisíoc don Chomhaltas ar iasacht a fuair an Comhaltas ón ICC.  Chomh fada agus is eol domsa tugadh geallúint i scríbhinn i 1982 go n-íocfaí £200,000 ó Chiste na nEagróirí agus idir an dá linn shocraigh an Rialtas seo a bhfuil daoine ag tabhairt amach faoi láthair go n-ardófaí an £200,000 go £300,000.  Rinneadh é sin agus fuair mé tacaíocht ón Tí seo chun é sin a dhéanamh, ach is é an Rialtas a mhéadaigh an tsuim sin.  Is é an fáth nach bhfuil an £100,000 breise sin íoctha go fóill &mdash; agus ní thógfainn ar an Teachta Treacy é gan a fhios sin a bheith aige &mdash; ná go raibh coinníollacha ag baint leis an íocaiocht sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>D'íoc mo Roinn an £200,000 díreach don ICC.  Maidir leis an £100,000 breise bhí coinníollacha ag baint leis agus is é an choinníoll ba mhó a bhain leis ná nach n-íocfaí é go mbeinnse sásta go raibh cuntais an Comhaltais i gceart agus de réir gnáth rialacha cuntasóireachta. Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuair mé tacaíocht an Comhaltais sa mhéid gur iarr mé orthu cuntais leath-bhliana a chur ar fáil, go bhfuair siad cuntasóirí nua agus gur chuir <Col N="1664" /> siad na cuntais ar fáil, ar 24 Meán Fomhair, agus níos déanaí ná sin, go deimhin i lár na míosa seo caite, trí sheachtain ó shin, fuair mé eolas faoin toradh a bhí ar an bhfeachtas bailiúcháin a d'eagraigh an Comhaltas cúpla mí ó shin.  B'fhéidir go mba mhaith le Baill an Tí a fhios a bheith acu nár éirigh chomh maith agus ba mhaith liomsa leis an bhfheachtas bailiúcháin sin, go dtí seo ar aon nós.</P>
    <P>Tá an ceart ag na Teachtaí gur obair an-tábhachtach í obair an Chomhaltais, go bhfuil cultúr, ceol agus rudaí eile a bhaineann leis an gcultúr á gcur chun cinn acu ar fud na tíre le 30 bliain agus an-obair déanta acu agus á déanamh acu. Tá an-taithneamh le baint as an pháirt a ghlacann daoine in obair an Chomhaltais ach d'ainneoin an caitheamh aimsire a chuirtear ar fáil is cosúil gur beag airgid a thagann go dtí an Comhaltas ón obair sin.  Tá 400 brainsí acu sa tír seo, i Meiriceá, Canada, san Astráil, sa Bhreatain agus ar fud na hEorpa, chomh fada agus is eol dom, ach is cosúil nach bhfuil siad ábalta é sin a aistriú go teacht isteach dóibh féin.</P>

Thóg siad amharclann a bhfuil an-bhród agamsa as amuigh ansin, ach chuaigh na costais as riocht ar fad.  B'fhéidir go raibh baint ag an boilsciú leis seo ach chuaigh sé ó £340,000 go dtí £984,000.  Sin ardú de bheagnach 300 faoin gcéad.  Bhí boilsciú ard ann ach ní raibh sé chomh hard sin.  Sin í an fhadhb a bhaineann leis seo agus go deimhin bhí an obair tosaithe beagnach bliain go leith sula bhfuair siad an gheallúint i scríbhinn go raibh an £200,000 ar fáil.  Sin í an trioblóid agus tá siad i bhfiacha anois sa suim sin minus an £200,000 a íocadh leis an ICC agus minus an £100,000 atá sa chiste.  Mar a deirim, ní bhfuair mise an cuntas deireadh uathu ach trí sheachtain ó shin.  An mhi roimhe sin fuair mé na cuntais ó na cuntasóirí nua agus glacaim anois go bhfuil na cuntais sa riocht a mba cheart dóibh a bheith.  Beidh an £100,000 <Col N="1665" /> á íoc dóibh go han luath ar fad.  Ní réiteoidh an £100,000 an fhadhb atá ag Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.

Ní haon mhaith a rá gur thosaigh an Comhaltas ag togáil fhoirgnimh íontach amuigh ansin nuair a cheap siad go mbeadh go leor airgid ar fáil dóibh. Níor tugadh an tuiscint sin dóibh am ar bith ag oifigigh na Roinne ná go deimhin <Col N="1666" /> ag aon Aire a bhí ann romhamsa.  Ní haon mhaith a rá gur tógadh é sin ar mhíthuiscint, go rabhadar ag súil le airgead a fháil nach bhfuair siad toisc go raibh droch-bhail ar chursaí airgeadais na tíre. Níl sé sin fíor.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 542 and 543 together.</P>
      <P>An integral part of Government policy in regard to development co-operation is to encourage and facilitate as far as possible the participation of Irish individuals and organisations with relevant expertise and experience in development work in the Third World.  In this context, the various issues involved in protecting the interests of development workers are kept under continuing review.</P>
      <P>Where public service employees are assigned overseas as development workers, the period of assignment is reckonable for superannuation purposes under a scheme for the purchase of notional service at actuarial cost.  Such provisions apply generally to bilateral aid personnel and to development workers funded by the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, a semi-State body under the aegis of my Department.  Applications in respect of development workers assigned by other sending agencies are also considered by APSO.</P>
      <P>With regard to social welfare, the provisions of the pay-related social insurance scheme are currently applied to assignments under the Government's bilateral aid programme and to assignments directly funded by the Agency for Personal Service Overseas.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the social security entitlements of volunteer development workers, this matter is being pursued at both national and European Community levels.  It is understood that a draft Community instrument on the subject is being finalised at present. As soon as it has been published, the Minister for Labour intends to add it to the work programme in the social affairs area with a view to having its processing begun during the Irish presidency.</P>

She appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing of her case on 1 November 1984 following which an appeals officer allowed the appeal.</P>
      <P>Her claim has been authorised at the maximum flat-rate unemployment benefit £32.75 weekly and pay-related benefit at £10.49 weekly.  All arrears due will be paid this week and further combined payments of £43.24 will be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 20 August 1983 and she was paid to 21 August 1984, a period of 52 weeks which was the maximum period payable based on contributions made on her behalf under her RSI number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of an administrative error, earlier contributions made on her behalf under her old insurance number were not taken into account when deciding her entitlement to benefit beyond 52 weeks. <Col N="1625" /> The error has since been rectified and a cheque for £198.71 which represents arrears of benefit for the period 22 August 1984 to 31 October 1984, the date of the latest medical certificate received, less the amount of supplementary welfare allowance advanced by the South-Eastern Health Board, was issued on 6 November 1984.</P>
    <P>Further payment of disability benefit will be issued to her, at the weekly rate of £37.25, on receipt of appropriate medical evidence while she remains unfit for work.</P>

      <P>To be eligible for a free telephone <Col N="1626" /> rental allowance a person, in receipt of a qualifying payment, must be living alone or only with children under 15 years of age or other persons who are so permanently incapacitated as to be unable to summon aid in an emergency.</P>
      <P>The person referred to in the Deputy's question is residing with his wife and 34 year old daughter.  All three members of the household are in receipt of qualifying payments.  In order for one of them to qualify for this allowance, therefore, the other two must be permanently incapacitated, as required by the scheme.  From the medical evidence furnished, however, this does not appear to be the case and accordingly the allowance cannot be granted.</P>
