      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he will consider allowing Government time for a discussion on the growing problem of emigration and the effects it is having on young people?  I think we should discuss this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps as a preliminary the Deputy would have a discussion with the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Taoiseach for sending me notice about impending legislation on company law. Could the Taoiseach say if it is proposed to introduce domestic company law legislation on limited liability in this session? He sent me details about other company law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in this session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach give us any idea when it is intended to take item No. 6 on the Order of Business which the Minister for the Environment has had down for a couple of months?  It deals with the Convention for the Prevention of Maritime Pollution from Land Based Sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give a date at the moment but I will communicate with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Flynn the Taoiseach said the limited liability aspect of company law will not be introduced in the House in this session. When is it intended to do that?  It has been signalled for 12 months that we would have that legislation.  During the <Col N="1319" /> debate on the Finance Bill the Minister for Finance indicated that it would be coming through very quickly because of the distortions and problems that arise in liquidations.  Could he give us any idea when we will see that long-promised legislation which is very urgently needed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is extremely complex and it will not be possible to have it ready before the end of this session, ending as it will in the ordinary way, but it would of course be available in the autumn session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more than 12 months since it was promised &ldquo;very soon&rdquo; and the scandal of companies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to understand that even the leader of his party cannot initiate discussion on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Government make a statement confirming the statement by the Minister for Communications yesterday that he proposed to support the reduction of VAT on newspapers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  I am asking if there will be an amendment to the Finance Bill to allow for the proposal of the Minister for Communications to reduce VAT on newspapers.  That is a fair question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should have read the paper properly and quoted what was said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I was present at the launching but the Taoiseach was not.  I heard the Minister for Communications correctly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell the House if it is intended to introduce legislation in this session to increase the State equity in Irish Steel and if the <Col N="1320" /> rumours freely circulating in Cork that a decision has been taken to close the plant on July 14 has any validity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Deputy not say June 14?  It would have sounded better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The rumours the Deputy may wish to spread are his own affair.  I certainly have no knowledge of any such rumours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard it in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy repeat the first part of his question because he went off on a tangent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asking the Taoiseach if he intended to introduce legislation to increase the State equity in Irish Steel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that question at the moment.  I will communicate with the Deputy in due course.  It would be a great help if Deputies who want information gave a few minutes notice and I could give that information. It would make the work of the Dáil much better rather than asking questions in respect of a large number of Bills and expecting an immediate answer.  I am more than happy to help Deputies and it would be much better if I could give answers to the House available to all Deputies instead of having to come back and inform the Deputy in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Taoiseach that this is not a new departure. When we were on the Government side such questions flew every morning. The Taoiseach should be aware, as a member of the Government, if there is any proposal to increase the State equity in Irish Steel.  Surely the Government have provided for this in the budget and the Taoiseach should have some idea as to whether the Government are going to take an increase in State equity in Irish Steel or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The rumours did not emanate from me but from the people in Irish Steel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair amazes me every time I try to ask a decent question. When the Chair was a Member on this side of the House he asked such questions time and again.  The Chair knows well that when Government Deputies were in Opposition they threw questions morning after morning on the order of business and expected answers.  My question is a legitimate one.  Will legislation be introduced? That arises on the Order of Business. Does the Taoiseach know what is going on in the Government at all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be coming before the Government shortly.  As regards the date, that is a matter on which I could make an estimate if I had an opportunity to do so.  The matter will be coming before the Government in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I should like to encourage the Minister for Health to see to it that the problem developing at the Cork Regional Hospital is solved in the best interests of the people of the area, particularly the out-patients who attend the clinics there.  This is a serious matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Will any action be taken by the Minister for Health on the position in the Cork Regional Hospital?  That is not a difficult question for the Minister to answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware, in regard to No. 6, that unless we ratify that Convention we will not be able to vote at the Paris Commission in Oslo on June 20?  Will the Taoiseach arrange to have this motion dealt with by the House before then?  It could be cleared pretty quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to give legal effect to a decision taken last year to dissolve An Chomhairle Olla.  The Bill also provides for the continued implementation by my Department of the statutory functions of the Wool Marketing Act, 1968, in relation to licensing and registration of premises.</P>
      <P>The provisions of that 1968 Act, including the establishment of An Chomhairle, arose directly from the recommendations of the Committee on Wool Improvements.  This committee, on which appropriate interests were represented, reported their findings in 1966.</P>
      <P>The main functions of An Chomhairle were to advise the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the fixing of grades of wool, apply standards in relation to the registration for the register of wool buyers and, in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, to fix a code of practice to be observed by wool exporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> An Comhairle was funded by an annual grant-in-aid, provided by the Oireachtas, which in the last three years averaged £100,000 per annum.  Membership comprised a chairman and 11 other members representative of the trade and producers.  Four of the staff of An Chomhairle were seconded from, and paid by, my Department.  The remaining member, a specialist in wool grading, was employed directly by An Chomhairle on a daily fee paid basis.</P>
    <P>Before An Chomhairle were established there was no standard system whereby wool was purchased on a graded basis, nor, indeed, were there any set standards in respect of buyers' or exporters' premises where wool was stored prior to export.  There was a need, therefore, to improve the image of Irish wool especially on export markets.  The main provisions of the 1968 Act, together with the principal related functions of An Chomhairle, provided for the proper grading and presentation of wool for sale, the registration of wool buyers and the licensing of wool exporters.  On the recommendations of An Chomhairle, regulations were made by the Minister for Agriculture setting out minimum standards in respect of these matters. These regulations will continue to be implemented by my Department.  The inspection of buyers' and exporters' premises, heretofore carried out by officers of my Department on behalf of An Comhairle to ensure that standards are maintained, will be continued on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>As part of the measures taken to reduce Exchequer expenditure, the Government decided, in February 1983, to dissolve An Comhairle.  Here I would like to emphasise that this decision should not be interpreted in any way whatsoever as a reflection on An Chomhairle's performance.  I pointed this out at the time to the members when I wrote to them apprising them of the dissolution. I am satisfied that, due in large part to the activities of An Chomhairle, the marketing of wool is now in a much healthier state.  As a result of these activities, Irish wool enjoys a very high reputation on world markets and commands a higher <Col N="1329" /> price per lb. on these markets than comparable types of New Zealand and British wools.</P>
    <P>Total wool production in this country amounts to 13 million lbs per annum made up of 5.2 million lbs Galway wool, 3.7 million lbs Blackface Mountain, 2.9 million lbs Cheviot and halfbred and 1.2 million lbs other types.  The value of the national clip to producers is estimated to be worth in excess of £11 million a year. This represents a significant contribution to farm incomes.  Over 70 per cent of the Irish clip is exported, 65 per cent of which goes to Great Britain.  The percentage of wool exported to Great Britain has been declining over the years as new markets were opened up, particularly in Europe and Eastern bloc countries.  Exports to France and Belgium have shown significant increases.  Czechoslovakia and Poland have been the main outlets in Eastern Europe but exports to that area have declined in recent years.</P>
    <P>The EEC is not self-sufficient in the production of sheep meat and, because of the application of the CAP to that commodity, I anticipate a substantial increase in our national flock, with a consequential increase in wool production.</P>
    <P>All in all, therefore, I am satisfied that the wool industry has been placed on a sound footing.  I am confident that the 79 licensed exporters will continue to seek out new markets, that the 303 registered buyers can effectively handle any increase in production and that the producers will continue to provide the high quality product which the market place demands.  A continuation of the successes already achieved will, of course, depend on the willingness of both traders and producers to observe the statutory requirements.  I am confident, however, that in co-operation with my Department, traders and producers can maintain progress.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, whilst the budget for An Chomhairle was a relatively modest one, I feel that members of the House will appreciate that, in the current financial situation, any scope for cutting back on Exchequer expenditure cannot be overlooked. In recent years, a high proportion of An Chomhairle's grant was spent <Col N="1330" /> in highlighting the need for clean wool presentation by means of fleece displays; in conducting training courses in wool grading and sheep shearing and subsidising sheep shearing demonstrations at shows throughout the country.  Expenditure was also incurred on press advertisements and display posters and promoting wool end-products through fashion shows, etc.  All of these activities, whilst useful, are minor in the context of the Wool Marketing Act.  The main intentions of the Act and the corresponding principal functions of An Chomhairle have long since been implemented, and expenditure on An Chomhairle's recent activities cannot be justified in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I regard the monitoring of world trends as an essential service to the industry.  It provides up-to-date information on trends and prices and guarantees a fair return to producers in line with world trends.  The market intelligence service will, therefore, be continued on a regular basis by my Department &mdash; as, indeed, it has been since An Chomhairle ceased to function.</P>
    <P>The four officers seconded from my Department have now returned and three of them have been assigned to other duties.  The fourth is assisting in implementing the statutory functions of the Act.  No additional expenditure has arisen for my Department.  Indeed, staff savings have been achieved through the more effective use of the returned staff. The wool grader employed by An Chomhairle has been paid his statutory redundancy entitlements and I understand that further claims he has made are under negotiations.  Also, I am informed that he has secured outside employment in the industry.</P>
    <P>Apart from giving legal effects to decisions taken involving the dissolution of An Comhairle, the Bill contains safeguard clauses in regard to creditors and other claimants of An Chomhairle.  These are included in Article 3 which provides, in general, that any outstanding debts will be discharged by the Minister for Agriculture, and that every contract entered into in force between An <Col N="1331" /> Chomhairle and any person shall continue in the name of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Article 4 provides that a final account of all moneys received and expended by An Comhairle from 1 January 1983 to the day on which the last liabilities are discharged shall be prepared for audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General prior to its presentation to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>For many years the wool industry was the poor relation of Irish farming.  This was true in the thirties and forties and even into the fifties and sixties.  It was only when we got the CAP facility in relation to sheep that Irish sheep farmers managed to earn a respectable living and get a reasonably good gross margin from sheep production.  Almost two-fifths of our sheep are raised in my county.  Were it not for our entry to the EEC and the facility for sheep meat, our industry would be in a dreadful state.  We now expect a 6 or 7 per cent increase in the number of breeding ewes this year.  This is particularly welcome because there is a shortage of sheep meat produced within the EEC.  It is one of the very few commodities in this category, and this gives us a chance to increase production in an area where there is not already overproduction.</P>
    <P>Wool has always been an important consideration for the sheep farmer.  It is worth £11 million to the Exchequer, a lot of money by any standards.  From 1968 onwards a brave and successful attempt was made to adopt a strategy whereby wool was presented in a light which would allow us to obtain the best possible price. Traditionally our chief market has been in Britain but now that market is declining. Every sheep farmer, buyer or exporter knows that what happens at the sales in Bradford and other such centres has a profound effect on prices.  These prices can fluctuate overnight, and for many years this has been a great problem. It has been very difficult to get a wool marketing strategy and a sales pattern that would give any guaranteed price.  No country has been able to achieve this.  It is the nearest thing to shares on the Stock Exchange that I have ever come across.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> It is important that market intelligence about the workings of the main wool centres in Britain be transmitted to Irish farmers and the wool industry generally. I am aware as a farmer and politician that one of the most important aspects of the work of the Wool Board was their ability to transmit information about what was happening at international level.  On many occasions I listened to the radio at 6.20 in the evening to hear about the wool price in Bradford.  This information is parallel to the market reports by Michael Dillon from marts and factories around the country.  That service will continue. The officers dealing with it in my Department will make sure that this intelligence will be available to farmers. When a farmer decided to sell wool to his local buyer, usually a multi-purpose operator, it goes on to the central wool board and then to the world sales, particularly at Bradford and Edinburgh.  The method by which this is done means we are up to date with prices obtaining.</P>
    <P>When the Wool Marketing Board were first established our wool was extremely badly presented.  In many instances sheep were shorn on grass without any shearing boards and there was very little evidence of efficiency.  We could not blame farmers because in the past there was not a great differential in price between the clean wool and that which was badly stored and presented for sale, so the farmers obviously wondered why they were going to all that extra trouble.</P>
    <P>The Wool Marketing Board which I must compliment on its work, was broadly an educational venture throughout the country.  I had the pleasure, on a number of occasions, of organising the All-Ireland Macra na Feirme sheep-shearing finals and in the early seventies from 6,000 to 8,000 people would see fit to congregate at those displays to see how the job was done properly.  A great educational job has been done in this respect. There are other very important aspects which have to be noted one being the conditions under which the wool was stored in the buyers' stores prior to export.  Until the Wool Marketing Board came into operation, sheep farmers did not bother unduly about the handling of <Col N="1333" /> wool and wool is a commodity needing expert handling to arrive at the various grades.  At a time when there was so much competition between synthetic fibres and pure wool, it was extremely important that we had trained wool graders available around the country to show the difference between wools of good and inferior quality.  It would not be appropriate for me at this stage to go into the various wool grades, but this needs very in-depth research, including as it does research into the different types of wool needed for different types of clothing and other commodities.</P>
    <P>I believe that every Irish sheep farmer knows all there is to be known about the production and presentation of good, clean wool to the buyers.  However, that does not mean that he will get a good price.  Because of the general depressed wool trade all over Europe for many years, many sheep farmers whom I have met have said that, unlike any other commodity, they are just not paid for the type of wool that they are producing.  The sheep meat trade is allied to the Common Agricultural Policy, but wool production has no guaranteed price whatever and we are in competition with sheep farmers everywhere.</P>
    <P>The fundamental principles towards which the Wool Marketing Board had been set up have been achieved.  I am delighted to be able to say here that for the last two or three years the sheep industry has been given a boost which it never got before.  At the moment, Irish lamb in our marts and our factories is doing extremely well.  Last year was one of the best sheep years, helped by the EEC ewe premium to Irish owners of good breeding stock under certain conditions. For this season already, £5 per head has been paid on every ewe and for the second half of this year it is likely that £7 or £8 will be paid.  Also, there are all the headage grants and grants to disadvantaged areas and the £9.50 ewe-hogget scheme.  Everyone in the agriculture industry will appreciate that, at the end of the day, it is the price which the product makes in the market or in the factory on the day of the sale which counts.</P>
    <P>There are all the appearances that this <Col N="1334" /> year is going to be a good sheep year.  I hope that it is not by chance that on this very day our wool price, depending on the type of wool involved, is approximately between 7p and 10p a lb. dearer than on this day last year.  How long that will last is another story.  We shall be maintaining a very close scrutiny of all wool buyers' export premises.  The agricultural officers in my Department will ensure that these premises are up to national and international standards. Market intelligence regarding the pricing mechanism on the major world wool centres will be transmitted through the national media as heretofore.  This and the general increase in profitability of the entire national sheep flock, have brought about an increase in sheep numbers when for many years they were decreasing.  It is now paying our farmers to get into the sheep producing business, and the only time one will ever have that in any production line is when people genuinely believe that they will make money out of it.  That is what any normal business man would do.  For the last three or four years, sheep rearing is a real alternative under many conditions.  I sincerely hope that the wool price will be maintained, but it is a little like the stock exchange.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that not much money was involved here but, at a time of great economic stress, when every penny must be put to the most productive use, we must be geared towards production. Up to now, because of the problems in the wool business, it has been very important to put our resources into ensuring that we have products which will obtain the best possible price against all comers, not alone in Europe but all over the world.  I believe that we have arrived at that point.  What we must do now is ensure through the negotiations in Brussels, that we maintain a very high profile for our sheep farmers.  The future looks good for the sheep industry.  I have a very deep, personal interest in sheep farming, because of my background.  The Wool Marketing Board has ceased to operate but because of the good work done by that board I sincerely hope that it will not now be missed.  I pay tribute to the various chairmen and members of the board <Col N="1335" /> who have served the sheep industry loyally down through the years.  I reiterate that it was no reflection whatsoever on their expertise that the board was disbanded. If we maintain the present trend, our sheep farmers will achieve the success which should have been theirs for many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Listening to the Minister introducing the Second Stage of this Bill, I felt a certain sympathy with him.  I believe, knowing the Minister, his background and his commitment to the development of agriculture, that it is against his better judgment that this Bill is being introduced.  I know irrespective of what he has said about the wool industry and whatever gloss is put on it, that in his heart and soul he feels, like this side of the House, that this is a step in the wrong direction. It is a step as far as the wool industry and the sheep industry are concerned, that they will suffer from.  I cannot agree with the Minister that removing the Wool Marketing Act, 1968, from the Statute Book is something which will benefit the sheep and wool industries.  He said that now there is only one officer doing the work of the Wool Council when formerly there were three to four people doing this work.  Surely he is not telling me that one man &mdash; I know how good he is &mdash; can do the work of the council which is being abolished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is quite right in saying that the sheep industry was considered the poor relation.  A committee set up in 1963 emphasised that very clearly.  It was as a result of the findings of that committee that the Wool Council was set up. The Minister stated that the industry is now worth £11 million to the Exchequer. Surely now, when there is an upward trend in sheep numbers and consequently an upward trend in the amount of wool produced, it is a backward step to abolish the Wool Council?  It is important, like in any other farming industry, that there should be a proper organisation to deal with the promotion of sheep and wool as a very important aspect of farming.  The Minister said it was his pleasure &mdash; it was <Col N="1336" /> my pleasure also &mdash; to be present at some of the functions for the promotion of wool in the earlier years.  Surely it is not any pleasure for him to preside here this morning over the abolition of the Wool Council?</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister when he says that the abolition of this council is accepted by the producers and the traders. That is not a correct statement.  I have contacted many people over the last few days and not one producer or trader told me that this is a step in the right direction.  They have said it is a backward step and is something that the Government and the industry will regret in the years ahead.  I know the Minister agrees with me, The Minister is now being asked to do something which is against his better judgment.</P>
    <P>When the Minister departed from the prepared script and gave his own thoughts on the wool industry it became very clear to this side of the House that he has a deep conviction about what the sheep industry and wool industry can provide for the agricultural economy in the years ahead.  He emphasised very clearly that there is now an upsurge in sheep production.  That should be encouraged rather than discouraged, as this Bill is doing.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a few brief points the Minister made.  He said:</P>
    <P>The inspection of buyers' and exporters' premises, heretofore carried out by officers of my Department on behalf of An Chomhairle to ensure that standards are maintained, will be continued on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>I would like him to emphasise more clearly what he means by &ldquo;on a more regular basis&rdquo;.  Will it be on the same basis as that carried out by An Chomhairle? This brings me back to the point I made earlier that there is only one man doing the work of An Chomhairle.  I am glad the Minister is giving a commitment to the House that the intelligence with regard to prices will be maintained.  This was another important function of An Chomhairle.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would like to <Col N="1337" /> emphasise that this decision should not be interpreted in any way whatsoever as a reflection on An Chomhairle's performance. I doubt if the trade and the producers would accept that.  Of course it is a reflection on the performance of An Chomhairle Olla.  It is one of the costsaving exercises by this Government we have had to listen to daily.  In this case only £100,000 is involved.  It is a further example of the neglect by the Department and the Government generally of agriculture and rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the statement the Minister said:</P>
    <P>This represents a significant contribution to farm incomes.  Over 70 per cent of the Irish clip is exported, 65 per cent of which goes to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>This is a further reason why the Wool Council should be maintained, encouraged and developed.  This would allow the sheep and wool industry to make a further contribution to farm income and ultimately to the whole economy.  The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>A continuation of the successes already achieved will, of course, depend on the willingness of both traders and producers to observe the statutory requirements.  I am confident, however, that in co-operation with my Department traders and producers can maintain progress.</P>
    <P>I hope they will maintain progress; but the Minister is missing the point, which is that neither the producers nor the traders will have any say as to how their industry will evolve in the future.  Up to now they were represented on the Wool Council but now they will have no voice in the development of the industry.  The Minister has referred to the involvement of the trade and the producers in the industry.  What the Government are proposing is a backward step and I hope they will have second thoughts with regard to abolishing the council.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister stated that expenditure was incurred on press advertisements and display posters.  He stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> All these activities, whilst useful, are minor in the context of the Wool Marketing Act.  The main intentions of the Act and the corresponding principal functions of An Chomhairle have long since been implemented, and expenditure of An Chomhairle's recent activities cannot be justified in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Of course the functions have been implemented but it is important that the development of the wool and sheep industry be undertaken as a continuing process. The Wool Council may have achieved what they set out to achieve but it is important that the process be continued. There is now no guarantee that this development will continue because neither the trade not the producers will have a say in their own industry.  The Minister has said that the market intelligence service will be continued on a regular basis.  I hope that the Minister and the Department will live up to that commitment.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the four officers seconded from his Department who have now returned and three of whom have been assigned to other duties.  Even though the remaining officer is excellent he is the only person ensuring that the functions are being carried out.  The Minister has stated that no additional expenditure has arisen for the Department.  It is a backward step to replace the council by one officer because, irrespective of how good he may be, he cannot be expected to carry out the functions of the Wool Council.  The Department of Finance decided to achieve a saving of a miserly £100,000 but that must be set against the major losses that will accrue in the wool and sheep industry as a result of the short-sighted attitude of this Government.  They have neglected this major industry which is contributing so much to the economy and to the incomes of farmers at a time when many Irish commodities are overproduced.</P>
    <P>We should develop the Wool Council into a marketing board as was suggested in a report published in 1966.  The council was set up by this party in 1968 to advise the Minister for Agriculture in relation <Col N="1339" /> to the fixing of grades of wool, price increases relating to quality and price deductions in respect of defects.  It also had a function with regard to the fixing of standards to be applied in relation to the registration of wool buyers and it fixed a code of practice to be observed by wool exporters.  All of these were important matters for the industry.  The council also provided courses for the training of people in the grading of wool and it implemented methods to increase wool exports.  It had the responsibility of securing maximum use of home-produced wool by manufacturers here.  These functions will not be carried out because it will not be possible for the one person who is carrying out the functions of the board to do this work.</P>
    <P>In his reply I ask the Minister of State to outline how the functions will be carried out.  He has said that many of them have been implemented but the development of the wool and sheep industry is a continuing process.  When neither the trade nor the producers will have a say in the matter, how can the industry develop?</P>
    <P>As the Minister correctly pointed out, this Bill gives statutory recognition to the abolition of the Wool Council.  Because of the amount of money involved &mdash; a saving of £100,000 &mdash; the Government should feel ashamed.  I should like to know what will now be the fate of the functions of the Wool Council, what will become of their promotional aspects, will they be dropped in addition to the marketing of wool abroad?  Will all of these be dropped?  Who will now undertake that work?</P>
    <P>Our party set up the Wool Council in 1968 which, from any reports I have read, was considered then to be a prelude only to the setting up a proper wool marketing board.  Rather than removing the present structure this Government should be establishing more permanent, positive structures for the whole of the wool industry.  I might say that back in 1968 when the Wool Council was established it did not meet the wishes of the farmers or of the farming organisations because <Col N="1340" /> it was considered then to be scraping the surface only of the whole of that industry.</P>
    <P>I might remind the Minister that the United Kingdom have a very successful wool board, playing a most important role in the promotion of their wool industry. Since our Wool Council was abolished early in 1983 there has been no inspection of wool in the different areas of the country, with no incentive being given for the improvement of its quality. It was a pity that our wool had to be exported for processing.  It is a pity also that there are not some processing plants being established here, a role which would be appropriate to that Wool Council, indeed even to a new wool board.</P>
    <P>The Wool Council did provide a useful service making information available to producers such as the minimum prices our wool should yield.  The importance of our sheep industry to the country generally cannot be over-emphasised, more particularly because it forms a very large part of our small farmers' incomes, something which the Minister should take seriously into account.  Surely those small farmers needed the advice of the Wool Council the Minister has abolished?  I must reiterate the importance of the sheep industry to our small farmers and, ultimately, our economy.  From the farmers' viewpoint and also that of employment the sheep industry constitutes a worthwhile source of employment in our meat factories and in the manufacture of our wool.  It cannot be said too often that, rather than abolishing this Wool Council, we should now be seriously considering its expansion or conversion into a proper wool board but we are moving in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>Let us for a moment consider the serious unemployment situation obtaining, in which the figures are on the upward trend.  Indeed the Minister himself said as recently as this week that we should be developing our food processing and meat industries, where employment could be provided on a large scale.  Yet the Minister and the Government are prepared to throw this worthwhile industry out the window.  It should be remembered also that we have a long tradition <Col N="1341" /> in the wool industry.  A study should be undertaken of the different blends of wools for manufacturing here.  I am now speaking in the context of employment in the wool industry, in areas we should be investigating with regard to the provision of jobs.  There is no better place than this industry for the provision of worthwhile, sustainable jobs in our small parishes, villages and towns in rural areas, thereby also developing one of our natural resources, because we can no longer be dependent on major international industries contributing to the provision of employment here.  There is no better channel for the development of our natural resources than through the development of our sheep and wool industry, or indeed within the context of the Wool Council which has just been abolished. That council might well be developed into a proper wool marketing development board giving the industry functional structures it so badly needs at present, thereby creating worthwhile, sustainable jobs.  Here I am merely re-echoing what the Minister himself said this week.  The Minister should put his money where his mouth is, ensuring that jobs are provided in the sheep industry.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i>&mdash;&mdash;what the sheep industry means to this country.  The only effective means of achieving the requisite improvements in the wool industry is through the establishment of a proper wool marketing and <Col N="1342" /> development board, such as that already obtaining in the United Kingdom.  The system prevailing here, since the abolition of our Wool Council, is satisfactory neither to the producer not the trade.  It is important to the industry that there be a proper system of marketing which is widely favoured in other countries where the wool clip is of any worthwhile size.</P>
      <P>It is important also that the confidence of the producers is restored and this can be best established by arranging adequate producer representations on such a board which would have complete responsibility for the collection of wool from producers and marketing it to users and exporters.  There should be a guaranteed price for wool to producers on a graded basis, a major function for the Wool Council.</P>
      <P>There should be adequate storage facilities and capable wool graders in all wool producing areas.  As the Minister said, many of these have been achieved but it should be a continuing process to ensure that the sheep and wool industry will develop into a major aspect of Irish farming and industry.  In order to encourage the proper production of wool &mdash; I acknowledge the work of the Wool Council in that area &mdash; all wool producers should be registered with the wool board and should sell their entire clips to the board.  The appropriate wool dealers and merchants should also be registered and should act as collecting and grading agents for the board.  In this way, all wool collected from the producers can be paid on a graded basis and payments for wool would be made directly by the board.  I may be placing great stress on the establishment of this board but the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, New Zealand, Australia and many other countries have such a marketing board.  Our wool and sheep industry will play a vital role in the future as has been acknowledged by the Minister.  The establishing of a board would play a major role in putting wool production in this country on a very sound footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Wool Council which was set up in 1968 also provided a very important role in a publicity programme for producers. They advised on the proper handling and <Col N="1343" /> presentation of wool for sale.  The programme of publicity also included a number of educational and wool promotion programmes at shows and agricultural schools throughout the country.  What will become of these programmes?  Their major exhibits were at the Royal Dublin Society's Spring Show.</P>
    <P>The Wool Council also participated in the fashion show of all wool garments which proved to be one of the top attractions at the Spring Show.  Fleeces entered in the wool competition were on display and there were other exhibits featuring clean wool presentation, fleece branding, woollen products, wool spinning, wool weaving and skin curing.  What will happen to all these things when the council is abolished?  These exhibits will not be staged in future.</P>
    <P>In an effort to improve the standard of sheep shearing, the council regularly looked at the organisation and techniques of shearing in the bigger wool producing countries like New Zealand and Australia to encourage the improvement and production of high quality wool.  The council also conducted competitions and some of our competitors who represented us in sheep shearing competitions all over the world did us proud.  In the export of wool, for example, to France, the Wool Council developed a very worthwhile market as a result of contacts which the general manager of the Wool Council made.  Visiting wool buying delegations from abroad were helped by the council to make contacts with Irish exporters.  This will also be dropped.</P>
    <P>At home the Wool Council were instrumental in promoting the greater use of Irish wool in home manufacture which is very important in the context of developing our natural resources.  Prior to that, marketing arrangements for Irish wool created a number of problems for home manufacturers who might wish to use Irish wool because 80 per cent of the Irish clip is exported.  Part of it is re-imported in a processed state or as a blend, making it nearly impossible to identify its country of origin.  Where particular types of wool are required, there is no guarantee that <Col N="1344" /> sufficient quantities of Irish wool will be available or that there will be continuity of supply.  The council could be usefully engaged at present in ensuring that various branches of the woollen industry here are encouraged to accept the quantities and types of wool available and that they will be guaranteed continuity of supply and availability of scoured wool.</P>
    <P>The promotion of Irish wool should be directed towards speciality lines with a view to entry into the upper end of the market where there is demand for quality wool products.  I am firmly convinced that the production of a quality Irish wool tag should be considered.  Adequate scouring facilities are essential to provide scoured wool on demand.  These functions should, appropriately, be carried out by the Wool Council which is being abolished or by a wool board.  Who will now carry out these functions and listen to the views of the producers and the trade?</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that the committee on wool improvements set up in January 1963 reported subsequently and the follow-up was the setting up of the Wool Council.  This committee was set up to consider and recommend desirable improvements in quality handling and marketing of Irish wool, including grading.  The terms of reference for the committee are as important today as they were then.  This is a backward step.</P>
    <P>While sheep numbers may have fallen since 1965, the 1983 figure was something in the region of 3,600,000.  Nevertheless, sheep and wool contribute £78 million or 3.65 per cent of total agricultural output. Fortunately there has been a steady increase in sheep numbers over the last couple of years and the Minister and the Government should give the industry every assistance and the boost it requires. Where you have increasing sheep numbers those numbers will inevitably be accompanied by an increase in wool production and that has also been the case over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the Wool Council which the Minister is now abolishing for the work that body has done in the promotion of Irish wool over the years.  Our thanks are also due to An Foras Tálúntais who undertook <Col N="1345" /> during that period and, indeed, are still undertaking, a very comprehensive research programme into various aspects of wool improvement, such as the genetics of wool improvement, the effect of flock management on wool, grading assessment and the packaging and storage of wool.  I also want to pay tribute to the laboratory operated by An Foras Talúntais at Creagh in County Mayo which was primarily concerned with studying the genetics of Irish wool characteristics, all aspects so very necessary for the development of our sheep and wool industry.  I want to pay tribute too to the people who brought this industry, which the Minister is now downgrading, to the pitch it has reached today.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the personnel in the Department of Agriculture who have contributed so much to the upgrading of wool in ensuring that the industry should play a very important part in our agricultural development.  I would like to pay tribute to the National Farmers Association, as the body was then known, and also to Macra na Feirme who, in the early 1960s established a committee for the upgrading and improvement of wool, whose work was ultimitely finalised in the establishment of the Wool Council.  The pioneers in this Wool Council were imbued with the idea that they would evolve into a proper marketing board for the promotion of the wool industry.  The setting up of a wool board is more important today than it ever was in previous years and so I would ask the Minister again to have second thoughts about abolishing this council and second thoughts on introducing this Bill designed to give statutory force to the abolition of the Wool Council.  I would ask him to reconsider this in the light of what I have said.  In conclusion, this party do not approve of this Bill and will oppose its passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last speaker that this Bill provides an opportunity for Deputies to go into other areas, and certainly some good points were made.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Connaughton, made the case this morning <Col N="1346" /> that this is a straightforward Bill.  As I said, good points have been made by both the Minister of State and by Deputy Noonan on the Opposition benches.  The Wool Council have certainly done a good job over the years.  We agree the basic reason is low priority because of our stringent budget financial situation.  There is then the point that the main functions of the council have, as I said, long since been fully implemented.  Its continued existence is not necessary and continued expenditure could therefore hardly be justified.</P>
      <P>We can always go back to the time when the council did not exist and there were all sorts of products arriving on the market.  Now the council has been in existence for some 15 years, and 15 years is a long time in which to educate people as to how wool should be handled.  Anyone who attends the various sheep shearing demonstrations around the country knows very well that people now know how wool should be handled and graded and, indeed, how the sheep should be shorn.  That is priority No. 1.  There is now tremendous expertise in wool handling. It was my pleasure last year to attend quite a number of competitions and there is no problem any more.  Farmers are no fools and they know that anybody producing an inferior product will not be accepted.  They know exactly what good husbandry means and they seem to have no problems now with regard to the marketing of their products.</P>
      <P>In the early days &mdash; I have to say this &mdash; producers were not so anxious to send wool on a graded basis and I think the reason was that they felt wool would not be graded in their favour under the then existing price structure.  They failed to realise that the fat price was probably the bottom price anyway.  As a result of grading and of finding out there is a great deal more money in doing the job properly and falling into line with the proper ideas, the problems that existed have long since disappeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have then the whole exporting scene and I do not think a marketing board is the right approach to this type of operation.  Traditionally exporting has been done by people who are familiar <Col N="1347" /> with the market place from one generation to another.  Anybody attending such markets appreciates there is a sort of international group which deal in wool. It is usually built up through a family from one generation to another.  There is an established line of communication which has not broken down and, because those engaged in exporting know their business, know their customers and know their wool we have ended up by catching for our farmers a very good slice of the international market and we are getting good prices.  As a result of the Wool Council we succeeded in cutting out a great deal of second handling.  The product is now so good that it does not require very much grading.  They know exactly what they are getting in, and they are in a position to re-export.  That has proved to be advantageous.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Connaughton, and Deputy Noonan mentioned the marketing intelligence service.  The council provided a service and contact was maintained with the main wool markets.  This was done partly through the good offices of the British Wool Marketing Board. We had guideline prices based on world trends for producers, and the fluctuations week by week were recorded as were the guideline prices for the different types of wool.  The producer could find out on a day-to-day basis what his wool was worth.</P>
    <P>I must stress that that service is still available and will continue to be made available by our Department.  The same contact is maintained with prices on the international front.  They are conveyed to the media each week.  Newspapers and radio seem to be particularly anxious to publish the data from the Department on a regular basis.  We have no difficulty in getting this information across through the media.  It is important that that should be said and that fallacy put out of the way once and for all.</P>
    <P>In future flock owners will have to continue to do what they have been doing, and they will continue to do it in their own interests, that is, to produce clean, dry wool free from contamination, colouring and brand marks.  That is basic <Col N="1348" /> commonsense.  If we are to continue to hold the share of the market we have enjoyed over the years, that sort of attention to detail is essential.  Like any other sphere of farming at the moment, it is a highly sophisticated game.  Because of the margins there is no room for second-rate operators whether it is in producing sugar beet or growing wool.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Connaughton, referred this morning to the fact that farmers are swinging over to sheep production because of improved margins.  I agree with him.  Swinging over to sheep production in itself will not guarantee profits.  The production of sheep, mutton and wool will have to be managed in a highly efficient way.  Relatively speaking, the margins are not all that exciting in any type of farming enterprise, except for the people who do it well.  Farmers are not fools and they very soon see that. Wool has to be produced and treated in a certain way.  If particular types of paint or colouring will spoil the fleece they should not be used.  It is unfortunate that we experimented with quite a number of colourants which did not prove to be successful.  That is one of the big problems the buyers tell me they have with wool.  An indelible colour mark renders the wool useless for many products.  For Aran sweaters and traditional white garments that wool cannot be used.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sheep industry generally, the common organisation of the market for sheep meat has been in operation for three years.  It has worked very well for sheep producers.  Profitability in sheep trading has been good.  Numbers are up in recent years.  There is nothing to suggest this trend will not continue.  It is inevitable that there will be a consequential increase in wool production and, as a result, new outlets for wool will have to be found.  There is a buoyant demand for raw wool in industries such as the clothing and carpet industries.  The way synthetics took over from wool bugs me. It is hard to explain how it happened.  It is a feature of our times.</P>
    <P>Some years ago all clothing was made from wool and in practically every town there was a flourishing woollen mill and carding mill.  It was disastrous that synthetics <Col N="1349" /> took over.  Those flourishing industries have gone by the board.  They have gone under to synthetics.  Nowadays on television you see the famous wool mark advertised.  One would think the product displaying the wool mark was brought in from the moon, that it was a type of élitist product that was so unusual and so difficult to come by that it was almost miraculous that it was all wool. That is great advertising, but this is an indigenous raw material.  The same applies to real leather.  There is nothing more flaithiúlach all around the country than hides and skins, and still people talk about real leather as if it were a commodity which had to be brought in from Mars.</P>
    <P>Recently there has been a trend, especially in men's ware, to go back to the use of wool.  Young people are going in for sweaters and woollen garments.  That trend is bound to have good results for the woollen industry.  Perhaps we should be plugging wool a bit harder.  We are over-sensitive about offending the EEC when we talk about buying Irish and promoting Irish.  There was a time when Irish wear and Irish blankets were well-known all over the world.  We had famous names like Ballincorrig, Foxford and Blarney. They were part of our tradition.  If at all possible we should start to cultivate them again.  Deputy Noonan talked about jobs. This must be an area of job creation.</P>
    <P>On the question of a wool marketing board, my personal opinion is that there is possibly a case for producer groups getting together with the people already involved in the marketing scene.  I would not favour any type of State authority in this area.  With all the extra wool being produced, there must be a case for us to produce of more Irish wool and tweed of the right quality and at the right price. A good promotion job should be done. From the point of view of wear and tear you cannot beat wool.</P>
    <P>We have our carpet industries.  One in my own constituency is in trouble at the moment.  It is a pity to see so many people going for what is really a short term gain with imported synthetic carpets which in the long term are no substitute for a good carpet.  People are travelling around with <Col N="1350" /> rubbish in the boot of their cars and doing damage to the Irish carpet industry which was a great industry.  With proper education in the value of the real product &mdash; and I mean the real product; the woollen carpet &mdash; people could be brought around slowly to buying a product which was made at home, which has won international fame and has in many places been replaced by some type of raggedy quality product that is being imported from Taiwan.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to contribute to the debate so as to emphasise the importance of this industry to our economy.  Across Europe there is a great demand for mutton, a demand that has not been filled as yet.  There is an opening on the European market for Irish mutton and we should interest ourselves in that.  As the Minister, Deputy Connaughton, pointed out, farmers in many areas are inclined to forge ahead into dairying.  As that outlet has been curtailed the rearing of sheep is the obvious replacement.  In some parts of the country tillage is not suitable but it would not compare with sheep rearing, if it is properly managed.  With the aid of An Foras Talúntais we hope to be able to produce high quality mutton. Members who examined carcases at various shows must realise how important breeding is.  It was an eye-opener for me to see the difference in poor and good quality carcases.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the export scene is different from the home market. The French demand a particular type of lamb and if we are serious about capturing that market we must have the right crossing and the right management.  Our lambs must have the right amount of lean and be the correct size.  They may appear very small and at one time if a farmer had a creel of such animals he would be inclined to go around the corner with them.  However, that is the type of animal the French want.</P>
    <P>I have been interested in the whole area of breeding.  We have too many low-land flocks.  They do not have the genetic capacity to achieve high lambing percentage levels.  It has been pointed out to me repeatedly that there is a shortage of known high prolificacy ewes available <Col N="1351" /> to sheep farmers.  That was stressed to me by a well-known journalist.  The production and marketing of these prolific ewes, already available from existing sources, the hill-flocks, must be stimulated and efforts continued to introduce new genetic material for this valuable trait into our low-land breeds.  We have made a start on both fronts.  A number of hill-cross ewe production groups have been established by the Department and are working closely with ACOT, sheep-breeders associations and livestock marts.  Two of the groups, located in Waterford and Donegal, are crossing black-faced ewes with blue Leicester rams.  The third group in Carlow are crossing Wicklow cheviots with border Leicester lambs.  The co-operative basis of the group is a model for expansion and development in other areas.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that organisations such as AFT are working hard on the breeding areas.  For instance, An Foras Talúntais have developed a new source of high prolificacy ewes, the <i>Belclare</i> improver, not a million miles away from the Minister, Deputy Connaughton, or Deputy Kitt.  It is anticipated that the proven high lambing rate of these ewes will give a considerable boost to the lowland sheep industry.  There should not be complacency about the future market possibilities for sheep and sheep meat. There is still a significant group of sheep producers obtaining poor results in returns either due to poor levels of technical performance or lack of attention to animal condition at the time of sale. Stocking rates could be considerably improved.  For example, a stocking rate of over four ewes per acre is common in parts of Britain, especially in the lowland sheep farms.  However, in the final reckoning the real key to profitability is the number of lambs weaned per 100 ewes.  We lag behind our main competitors in regard to productivity in lowland sheep production.  This is a problem that will be tackled as a priority by the Department in conjunction with ACOT and the sheep producers.</P>
    <P>The future is encouraging based on forecasts and markets.  There is an indication <Col N="1352" /> that the overall balance of self-sufficiency for sheep meat in the community will be 76 per cent this year.  In order to exploit market opportunities which exist we must learn to manage sheep flocks better.  There will have to be at least a minimum size in order to justify the adoption of proper management systems at farm level.  Producers and processors will have to apply themselves to the fact that there are substantial differences in terms of prices realised on the export market for carcasses of different quality.  EEC markets, in particular the French market, have a system of severe price discounts against overweight and overfat lamb carcasses.  Our production and husbandry factors will have to be adapted for this scene.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the ongoing problem of the ravaging of flocks of sheep by marauding dogs.  The House will be aware that committees have considered this problem and produced conclusions as to how this should be tackled.  Dog wardens have been appointed around the country and they are doing a tremendous job in picking up stray dogs.  However, we will have to introduce a national scheme and fund it properly.  I am informed that recommendations will be put to the Government shortly on this issue.  This is a recurring problem in the lambing season.  Each morning we can see the terrible photographs of flocks of ewes that have been torn apart by dogs. It is no harm during this debate to appeal to dog owners to control their animals. All the dog wardens in the world will not solve the problem if the owners of the dogs are irresponsible.</P>
    <P>Parents should remember this when at Christmas and on the occasion of birthdays they give little cuddly pups as pets. Some of those pups grow up to be big dogs that are not wanted around the house.  They are let loose on the streets and finish up by attacking flocks of sheep. The dog warden system is the proper one. It is worked very efficiently in Wicklow and helps to solve the problem.  However, no amount of policing will solve it. We must have an awareness by people in the towns and cities that their dogs wander. In fact dogs wander from Dublin city <Col N="1353" /> to the Dublin mountains and worry sheep there.  It is important to realise that apart from fouling up footpaths and so on dogs do a lot of damage and cause severe hardship to farmers.  It is not only five or six sheep that are slaughtered when dogs chase a flock.  The entire pregnant flock could be in jeopardy as a result.  The full story does not emerge until the lambing season is over.  I should like to compliment the officials of An Chomhairle Olla. They have done a good job in their educational programme.  I do not know anybody anywhere in the country who is involved in the sheep business and does not know the wool scene, how sheep should be shorn, how the fleece should be handled, how to avoid the colourants. If somebody does not know how to do these things properly plenty of people around can tell him how to do them.</P>
    <P>The disciplines suggested by An Chomhairle Olla have been acted upon and the results have been dramatic, and now the part of their functions that is necessary is being carried on by our Department.  Regarding Deputy Noonan's comments about a wool marketing board, by all means let producer groups get together.  The IFA at the moment have a very powerful and efficient producer group, the IFA Committee on Wool and Wool Production, chaired by a very efficient and vocal person. He has set up his own relationship with the people on the wool scene.  The wool scene is very much like some aspects of the meat trade.  It is captured by individuals who are extraordinary enterpreneurs, highly successful, who have found their way into most extraordinary marketplaces. I am quite sure that any producer group to be set up would involve such people and would work for the betterment of the wool trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on this Bill.  I compliment and give the highest praise to the Wool Council.  However, I cannot agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, when he says their job is done. It was amazing to hear so much praise for a council from two Ministers of State followed by the news that that council is <Col N="1354" /> to be abolished.  We had a similar situation on the last two nights in this House when we discussed rural home economics colleges.  We heard praise for those colleges, for their staff and for the courses organised by them.  Then we discovered that the Government are not providing the funds to allow their operation to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To abolish the Wool Council is a retrograde step; therefore our party are opposing this Bill.  This step will undermine the sheep industry and the position of the wool producers.  A great deal of discussion has taken place on how to improve wool production.  A committee was set up in 1963 to deal with wool improvements.  I will read for the House the terms of reference of that committee. I quote: &ldquo;To consider and recommend a desirable improvement in the quality, handling and marketing of Irish wool including the question of grading&rdquo;.  Those terms of reference were very specific, and that committee did a very good job.  They sat for three years and then produced a report.  Not all the members on that committee agreed with the findings.  A former Member of this House, a one-time colleague of mine and of the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, that was John Callanan, had reservations about the representation on that committee. Only three producer representatives were recommended.  When the Wool Council was set up I was glad to see six representatives of the producers and five from the trade on that council.  Those 11 members and their chairman struck a very good balance between producers and people in the trade.  They met their terms of reference and we had improvements in the quality of handling, marketing and grading.  They went about their job comprehensively.  They sent questionnaires out to sheep owners.  The county instructors at the time did tremendous work in gathering information.  The committee realised that we had to increase our sheep numbers in order to increase wool production.  They saw clearly that wool production was the Cinderella of the agricultural industry, that it took a secondary place to the production <Col N="1355" /> of lamb and mutton on both home and export markets.</P>
    <P>The IFA &mdash; or the NFA as they were known at the time &mdash; accepted the committee's report and also that the committee would be a forerunner for a wool marketing board.  The IFA and the committee did a great deal of research into what was going on in other countries. They considered that the British Wool Marketing Board or some similar system, perhaps a co-operative, would be desirable. I would point out that the committee examined not only the British situation but also wool production in New Zealand, Australia, the US, South Africa and even Pakistan.  They did very comprehensive research into the way wool production was dealt with there.  Most of those countries have a wool board or commission.  Since 1968 Governments here have been remiss in not introducing a marketing board.</P>
    <P>We are taking a very retrograde step here today, following on the decision of the 1983 budget, if we abolish the existing council without examining some other system or a strengthening of the present system.</P>
    <P>The committee on wool improvements wanted the wool board to have full responsibility for the collection of wool from producers, for marketing the wool and also &mdash; most important &mdash; a guaranteed price for the wool to the producers. I would like to pay tribute not only to the late Deputy John Callanan, who was a member of the Wool Council, but also to the producer members and the trade members, two of whom were from County Galway, Gabriel Browne in Tuam and Patrick Lyons in Newtowndaly, Loughrea.  Both trade and producer members did tremendous work.  It is retrograde for the Minister to say, following the budget decision last year, that they are no longer needed and that the Department will now take over their functions.</P>
    <P>The council held educational exhibitions throughout the country, especially at agricultural shows.  Their fashion show was a highlight of the RDS Spring Show. <Col N="1356" /> Standards were also improved by demonstrations of sheep shearing.</P>
    <P>One must ask why the grant-in-aid of £100,000 could not be continued. Recently we have been discussing instances where money has not been used to best advantage and we have been hearing about large sums paid out in rent for unoccupied offices.  The Government have decided not to continue AI and lime subsidies because there will not be EEC funding, yet the money is provided for in the Estimates.  Surely the necessary money could be provided to keep the Wool Council in operation.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to voluntary bodies such as the West of Ireland Wool Merchants' Association and the Wool Federation who have done so much for the wool business.  Over the years we have improved the quality of our wool. The Wool Council had recommended that there should be price deductions for any faults in wool.  Much good work has been done by all the bodies concerned with the wool business but now there is a danger of a decline in quality.  Who will now carry out the functions of the Wool Council?  The Minister of State seemed to imply that one person would be charged with this responsibility but it is not reasonable that all the very important work carried out by the Wool Council should be entrusted to one person.  I am glad that information on prices will continue to be available on the radio.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a bad day's work in undermining the sheep industry and wool production.  I will be opposing the Bill but I would ask the Minister when replying to give an assurance that there will not be a drop in the quality of our wool and to state who will carry out the functions of the Wool Council.  The committee which reported in 1966 recommended the setting up of a board and I am concerned that this recommendation is not being listened to.  I would welcome a statement by the Minister that there are no grounds for the fears expressed by that committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  It is a step in the right direction and I foresee <Col N="1357" /> a very bright future for our sheep industry. At present we are only skimming the surface of its potential.  It has been treated thoroughout the years as the Cinderella of agriculture, but I have no doubt that under the guidance of this Minister it will continue to grow and prosper.</P>
      <P>Some 100,000 acres are lying dormant along the western seaboard from Cork to Donegal.  That land is starved of lime and manure and very low in fertility.  If the fertility of the pastures could be improved our sheep population would at least triple within five years.  In view of the impact this industry could have on our economy it is vital that steps be taken immediately to improve the soil fertility of mountain land.  We cannot expect a measure of return from soil that is starved of manure and lime.  The Department and the Minister should explore every possibility to ensure that this work is carried out as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Our total sheep numbers are approximately 3.75 million.  This figure could easily be increased to ten million if proper attention were devoted to the industry. The Minister states that total wool production is worth £13 million per annum and almost £9 million of that is produced by Galway and black-faced mountain sheep, while £4 million is produced by Cheviot and lowland breeds.  This is a true reflection of the primary importance of mountain sheep and their potential. Unfortunately the industry was neglected by successive Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 70 per cent of the Irish clip is exported, of which 65 per cent goes to Great Britain and the balance to France, Belgium and and Eastern bloc countries. It is vital that the Department of Agriculture should explore and create markets for our wool products, especially on the Continent, because we are relying on Britain as our main customer.  I have no doubt that the Department and the 79 licensed exporters will continue to expand exports to other nations.  I should like to see the Scandinavian wool market, particularly Norway and Sweden, explored &mdash; a region which is under snow for so many months of the year.  Surely there is an unlimited market there?  I am amazed that this has not been tapped.  I <Col N="1358" /> have no doubt that among our 79 licensed wool exporters there are some entrepreneurs with ideas on these lines and, if this is not the case, then the Minister should see to it that that position is changed.  It is very bad management to place all one's eggs in the one basket and experience has shown that our wool exports to the Eastern bloc countries have not had great results.  A lucrative trade could be built up with Western Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and other countries. There should not be only one outlet for this valuable product.  I hope in the not too distant future to hear good news in that respect from the Minister and his Department as the sooner we broaden our market on these lines, the better.</P>
    <P>An Chomhairle Olla have done a very good job over the 15 years of their existence. However, it is well known that our Irish farmers, especially the mountain sheep farmers, are apt pupils.  They know that the guidlines given and policies carried out by An Chomhairle Olla have been correct.  These have brought our wool industry out of the doldrums and made it a vital part of our economy. Before the emphasis was laid by the then Minister and his Department on these important aspects and before An Chomhairle Olla was established, knowledge among the farmers as regards the marketing of wool was practically nil.  They all are now experts in the handling of this commodity.  Every farmer knows it to be of vital importance to him that a high class product be available on the market for export.  Nothing will educate a farmer more quickly than a good return for his products.  Before An Chomhairle came into operation and before the strict departmental regulations were laid down as regards the marketing and exporting of wool, any kind of trash was put on the Irish market and exposed for sale; but a complete change of outlook has come about within the past 15 years. Every farmer today takes the greatest care of his clipper wool to ensure he gets the maximum return from his wool crop. It is vital for him to offer a product second to none on the world market and to have a product which will obtain the highest price available on that market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1359" /> It is very gratifying to hear our Minister today saying that, although An Chomhairle Olla has been disbanded since February 1983, the price of wool is 9p a pound dearer than it was on this date last year.  That alone bears out the belief that the industry is on a sound and level footing and that the wool producers will be able to stand the test of time.  They have learned a considerable amount about the industry and how to produce a marketable commodity.  I have no doubt that they will continue to do this because it will be in their own interest.  The industry has reached a point where it no longer requires the services of An Chomhairle Olla and where, with proper direction from the Minister and his Department, it will survive.</P>
    <P>Bodies such as An Comhairle were not established for prosperity.  Their aim was to build up an industry and put it on a sound footing.  Any Minister for Agriculture or Department of Agriculture worth their salt will give the Irish sheep producer the benefit of all available information towards further expansion of the industry and of warning against possible pitfalls through lax efforts.  Many sheep farmers in County Donegal will never again be lax in their efforts as far as the marketing of wool is concerned.</P>
    <P>Continuation of the effort to promote the use of wool is a venture.  This industry is worth £11 million to our Exchequer and that could easily be increased to £33 million or £34 million, providing our sheep industry gets the proper incentive to expand.  The outlook in the EEC markets is bright now for that industry.  It is only fit and proper that the emphasis should be placed on it that should have been the case 20 years ago.  It is better late than never.  I have no doubt, when the Minister of State, who is in charge of that particular part of the industry, and his senior advisers in the Department, formulate a proper sheep policy the better it will be for the economy.</P>
    <P>The quality of the product is essential. As everybody knows in every walk of life and in every industry the quality of the product is the keynote to success. <Col N="1360" /> Nobody should get away with the idea that, if he produces X pounds more of wool than he should be producing and is not producing the proper quality and type of wool, he will be rewarded for his efforts.  It is very important for our farmers to ensure that the quality of their products is A1.  It is the responsibility of the Minister and his Department to ensure that the producer gets the best price possible for his wool.  I am pleased with the assurance given by the Minister that the Department will continue to monitor progress in this industry.  I appeal to him to be very vigilant.</P>
    <P>We should endeavour to maintain a standard where quality prevails.  Incentive should be given to wool producers to maintain that standard.  If we allow the quality of the product to drift we are actually cutting a twig to beat ourselves with.  Every sheep farmer who has any experience of sheep production knows that very well.  I am pleased that the Minister has given a guarantee of constant inspection by the departmental officers of wool buyers' premises and of export premises.  This is very important if the industry is to thrive.  As I said at the outset, An Chomhairle Olla did a lot of very good work and formulated policy in relation to the improvement of wool stocks and markets.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I would like to be associated with complimenting the members of An Chomhairle Olla over the years for their hard work on behalf of sheep producers.  The time is now ripe for those producers to stand on their own feet and for the Minister of State, who is concerned with that particular aspect of agricultural policy, to continue the headlines laid down for a successful and viable industry.  I cannot agree with Deputy Noonan that abolishing An Chomhairle Olla is a retrograde step.  If any Minister for Agriculture fails in his responsibility to sheep producers he should not be Minister for Agriculture.  If the section in the Department of Agriculture responsible for wool production fail in their duty they should share the blame.  Any Minister for Agriculture should be able to run this part of the sheep industry to perfection.</P>
    <P>The Minister can get advice from the <Col N="1361" /> county sheep dipping committees and the IFA sheep committee.  I would like to pay tribute to the IFA for the information they have given to the Department over the years in this respect.  I would also like to thank the members of the various sheep dipping committees throughout the country who have played their part in supplying proper information to the Minister and the Department over the years. I would like to remind Deputy Noonan that his county of Limerick has no county sheep dipping committee.  This is a disgraceful state of affairs.</P>

      <P>That is what the Deputy thinks.  I would like to pay a tribute to the members of the Joint Cork and Kerry <Col N="1362" /> Sheep Dipping Committee who over the past 15 years worked unrelentlessly in their efforts to eradicate sheep scab.  I should like to pay tribute to them for the way they have tried to get a particular kind of dye available to ensure that all sheep are dipped.  I wish to emphasise to the Minister the necessity to ensure that the county councils concerned should set up sheep dipping committees.  European countries will not accept our products unless they are free of sheep scab.  We must not forget the immense damage sheep scab can do to wool products.</P>
      <P>All the counties on the western seaboard should come together periodically at a central venue and share their information with regard to the sheep industry. Speakers on the other side wanted to know who will promote the sale of wool on the abolition of An Chomhairle Olla. Surely the 79 registered wool exporters will have the ambition and the vision to explore this outlet for their products and I have no doubt that Córas Tráchtála will help them.</P>
      <P>There has been a suggestion by Members opposite that the Minister is throwing this industry out of the window. I can assure them that is not so.  There is no Member with more intelligence, capability, tenacity and courage than the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton.</P>

The Minister has done valuable work for this country in the EEC.  All of us can play a part in safeguarding this <Col N="1363" /> valuable industry.  The future of the wool industry must be guaranteed.  People should insist on buying a pure wool product when they purchase suits, skirts, coats and so on.  I have the pleasure of wearing an all-wool suit and I am proud of the emblem on that suit.  I ask Members to ensure than when they next place an order for a suit they should make sure it has the all-wool stamp and not a stamp of a synthetic commodity from Taiwan or from eastern countries whose industries operate under slave labour.</P>

      <P>The Opposition Deputies have claimed that the Government have abandoned all interest in and responsibility for the sheep and wool business.  I wish to refute that.  Our sheep industry is operating in a good environment at present, principally because the Common Agricultural Policy has been extended to cover sheep meat when, for the first time ever in the history of this country, sheep farmers are getting a reasonable crack of the whip. But that commenced in the last three or four years only&mdash;&mdash;</P>

From the intelligence available to me from European and world markets &mdash; while we all understand that this is engaging in a little crystal ball-gazing &mdash; it appears that there will be quite good markets for out sheep and wool in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many aspects of the marketing organisation of the wool board, as it used to be called, have been discussed here this morning.  I should point out that a number of the important duties and responsibilities of that board will be continued by the Department of Agriculture.  I went to great lengths earlier this morning to assure all Members that the intelligence from market places all over Europe on pricing and general trends will, as always, be available.  It cannot be over-emphasised how important that is to the industry. Over the years, even when world economies were in depression, many <Col N="1366" /> sheep farmers felt they did not get a proper price for their wool.  Because of new systems of communications, because the wool board were always good at this, because we had that expertise to hand, this bulletin will continue to be produced from which sheep farmers all over the country will benefit over the season.  I want to make that perfectly clear.</P>

The next and most important matter with which I should deal is that it has been contended here that there will be no advice available to producers.  That will not be the case at all, because the wool section within the Department are negotiating with ACOT to ensure a steady supply of advice on marketing trends, production methods and so on.  And of course, there is the Agricultural Institute.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are well aware, that has been one of the most fundamental aspects of wool sales over the years which will continue also. Once one has the market intelligence, so important, once there are inspections of buyers' premises, once ACOT are involved in advising and there is grade selling, one has sufficient safeguards. Those were the primary responsibilities of the wool board.</P>
      <P>In my view the wool board achieved its goal in the last 15 years.  There was a huge educational job to be done on the presentation of wool and all aspects connected with it.  I have no doubt now but that certain aspects once foreign to so many sheep farmers were learned very speedily because it was recognised that, at the end of the day, it was money that made all the difference, that if one had a good product for the wool buyer, who, in turn, brought it to Bradford&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a well known fact, indeed I might add a note of caution about the country, or the Government getting involved in a wool marketing organisation on the same lines as the Pigs and Bacon Commission because Deputies will have seen that that commission ran counter to EEC policy.  But there is nothing in the world preventing producers and buyers from sitting around the table formulating a policy of mutual benefit. Perhaps that is something producers and the trade will now do because that constitutes the next step on this long road.  There are certain world markets that still remain to be explored.  Indeed it is a long road from the initial sheep-shearing operation to the production of wool, finishing up with the fashion trade. The experience of all countries worldwide, including those in the EEC, has been that it is difficult to integrate the whole of the operations of the industry in such a way that producers have some control over the end price.  That has never really happened because there will always be problems encountered through fluctuations in wool sales and it would be very difficult for any organisation to control them.  At the same time a lot can be done, and perhaps the time is now ripe for producers generally and wool merchants to ascertain what they can do in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sheep industry is in quite a healthy state at present.  I believe we will see a 6 per cent or 7 per cent increase in ewe numbers this year and there is no reason to doubt that we will have a similar increase next year.  Because of various EEC changes being proposed, particularly on the part of the sheep management committee at present &mdash; there will be important days ahead for our Government in Brussels in discussions on certain laws in relation to sheep meat, subsidies and so on.  I want to give the House an undertaking that at these meetings the Government will have a very high profile. Coming from a major sheep-producing county I more than understand the <Col N="1370" /> important part the industry plays in our economy, amongst the agricultural community generally and others also.  I can give the House an undertaking that everything that is humanly possible will be done to ensure that the lot of our sheep farmers will be improved and that the upsurge in price they received over the last two or three years will continue so that this great industry will take its rightful place amongst the many other sectors of our economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this short technical Bill is to correct a defect in sections 56 and 57 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those sections were intended to transfer <Col N="1371" /> to the State bodies, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann, as appropriate, all liabilities attaching to the national postal and telecommunications services in respect of claims and court proceedings arising from events that occurred before 1 January 1984 but which had not been settled before that date when the bodies took over the operation of those services. Similarly the benefits of claims being made or actions being taken on behalf of the services and which had not been settled by vesting day were intended to pass to the companies.  The object was to provide for continuity in the case of these claims and proceedings, and as from 1 January 1984, all the necessary staff and records were transferred to the bodies to deal with those cases as well as with all cases arising after that date from their own operation of the services.  That was accepted by the interim boards, An Post and An Bord Telecom.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as worded, the sections transferred liability to the bodies only in cases in which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was a party.  This meant that the sections did not transfer liability in cases which arose before 1 January 1984, in which the State itself or the Minister for Finance was a party as had been intended.  Two main categories of claims are involved.  The main example of the first category is where negligence had been attributed to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in relation to road works arising from cabling operations. The second category relates mainly to cases in which negligence arising out of the driving of departmentally owned motor vehicles had been attributed to employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill correct the defect in the 1983 Act by transferring liability &mdash; and benefit, where it arises &mdash; in all such cases to the appropriate body with effect from 1 January 1984. Section 2 also makes provision for the cost of any settlements made in such cases since 1 January 1984, to be borne by the appropriate body.</P>
    <P>Overall, it is tentatively estimated that some £1.3 million could be involved in <Col N="1372" /> these cases, of which about £1 million would be in respect of the telecommunications service, the balance affecting the postal service.  In the nature of things, many cases do not come to attention until quite some time after the event and this obviously makes it very difficult to forecast the costs involved.</P>
    <P>Because of the defect in sections 56 and 57, the Chief State Solicitor and his staff have had to deal with cases since 1 January 1984, to which the State or the Minister for Finance was a party.  It is, therefore, necessary to recover the expense involved in those cases from An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann, as appropriate, and section 4 of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also provides for the Minister for Finance meeting certain claims covered by this Act in the highly unlikely event of either company failing to pay up on foot of a judgement against it.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is designed to have effect from 1 January 1984, I need hardly stress the need to have the Bill enacted as early as possible.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather disappointed that the Bill is necessary and that the Minister has made such a short speech because this Bill gives an opportunity to the House to review the situation regarding postal and telecommunications services since we enacted this legislation in June 1983.  It is appropriate on this Bill to refer to matters relating to postal and telecommunications and I intend to proceed along those lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, and An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann are also involved.  After nearly six months of the operation of An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann, I thought that the Minister would have outlined developments to date and the progress in these areas since 1 January 1984.  It gave the Minister and the Government an opportunity to make a statement regarding developments since vesting date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> I am very proud of the fact that An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann have been very successful since 1 January 1984.  Fianna Fáil take great pride in the fact that they initiated the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, 1982, which started the process of setting up these two boards.  It must be a record that, after less than six months in operation, this Bill had to be amended.  That is regrettable because the Bill was discussed here on many occasions and I would have expected the Chief State Solicitor and his staff to foresee the difficulties in relation to sections which we are amending today. Naturally, we must allow for human error but, in a Bill of such importance, a section dealing with the legality and questions of claims was of paramount importance and should have been gone into in far more detail because of the serious implications for people who have claims against the State and those organisations.  I remember that we had time problems on Committee Stage and perhaps this was why we did not pay as much attention to those sections as we should have done.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my appreciation to the 30,000 employees of the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs at which I had the honour or serving as a Minister of State for about nine months in 1982.  Those employees willingly transferred to both these boards and made a very successful transition from Civil Service status to semi-State status.  It has been the most phenomenal change in the status of any employees here since the foundation of the State.  It is heartening that so many were prepared to place their trust in the Government and the Opposition by relinquishing their rights as civil servants and transferring them to the care of two semi-State organisations.  Their trust has been appreciated.  The chairman of the board was responsive to the wishes of the staff over that period and, as the spokesman on this matter for Fianna Fáil, I received very few complaints, if any, from the staff of both of these boards in regard to their conditions.  I am very pleased about that, because had major problems been brought to my attention I would have believed it necessary to put down amendments to this Bill to give any <Col N="1374" /> further protection necessary or highlight problems brought to my attention.  However, I have not received any major complaints in regard to conditions of employment in the case of either board.  I am delighted about that because on both sides of this House we were more than anxious to reassure the workers that they would be treated fairly.  Indeed, the two organisations have been abundantly conscious of their responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>I shall deal first with An Post.  It has major responsibility in regard to postal matters and I believe the work has been carried out in a responsible manner. Would the Minister be able to give me information about the quality of delivery since the effective date?  He may not have that information available but I would appreciate it if at some stage he furnished me with that information.  We were proud of our record in regard to delivery.  I believe the situation has steadily improved and I hope it will improve still further in the future.  In the first phase of the establishment of An Post the one penny stamp was launched.  I believe this offer increased public awareness of our excellent postal service.  The Saint Patrick's Day card was very much appreciated by the general public.</P>
    <P>I expressed concern at the time from the point of view of the producers of the normal Saint Patrick's Day cards.  They were seriously disadvantaged as a result of this offer.  As far as I was concerned personally, I welcomed the principle of the special offer.  That card brought greetings to every corner of the world and it increased the status of our national holiday.  I received correspondence from as far away as Nigeria where missionery priests were delighted to receive greetings on Saint Patrick's Day from their friends and relatives at home.  I believe this created a great deal of goodwill for our national holiday.  Sometimes I think we do not recognise as we should our great national holiday.  In fact, it seems to be better recognised in the United States of America.  We should do everything possible to establish the importance of our great national holiday, and I express my concern now about the producers <Col N="1375" /> of cards and I recommend that in 1985 alongside the special card offer there should be a special Saint Patrick's Day stamp brought out yearly to enable people to post cards to any corner of the world at reasonable cost.  I believe there would be a great response from the public. I believe there would be a great response from the producers of such cards.</P>
    <P>I received a communication from the Minister on 25 April in response to a question I asked here during the debate on the Estimate for the Department on 29 March.  I will quote from the letter since it is relevant: &ldquo;The company is, understandably concerned about ways of stimulating postal traffic and the introduction of a special Saint Patrick's Day greeting card was successful in generating substantial extra traffic.  It cannot have been altogether without advantage to the retailers and others interested in greeting cards that the public's interest should have been stimulated in this way.  It would be a pity if a negative view were to be taken of what most people regarded as a praiseworthy initiative, but I would expect An Post to exercise care so as not to be accused for good cause of unfair trading in this area.  You expressed the view that it would be more appropriate for An Post to offer cheaper postage rates to mark special occasions rather than to go into the business of selling greeting cards.  I have had this suggestion transmitted to An Post for consideration.&rdquo; Arising from that the chairman of the board, Mr. Fergal Quinn, issued a statement recently, which the Minister may confirm at some stage, if not today, that for the Christmas trade An Post will certainly not bring forward special Christmas card offers but I would hope An Post would provide at least a special stamp with the Madonna and Child for the Christmas period at a reasonable price. I would suggest 15p for open Christmas cards.</P>
    <P>I have a local vested interest in this area because adjoining my home in Roscommon we have the Divine Word Missionaries who are well known for the production of that excellent magazine. <Col N="1376" /> Last Christmas they produced 2,000,000 Irish Christmas cards.  This Christmas they hope to produce 2.5 million cards. If An Post provided pre-stamped Christmas cards that would put that organisation into jeopardy.  It would also put the future of the staff in jeopardy, and in our area we certainly need to retain all the employment we have.  I do not wish to throw cold water on the progress being made by An Post.  I thoroughly approve of their developing ideas.  I suggest that they should provide a special stamp and, if such an announcement were made in the very near future, I have been told that would lead to an increased production of Christmas cards to enable people to avail of the special offer, an offer which should generate extra demand during the Christmas period.  I would appeal to the Minister to place those views before An Post and I sincerely hope they will be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>In regard to the response to representations from public representatives, I have received complaints from colleagues in regard to a lack of response, particularly in relation to personnel matters.  I appreciate that An Post are anxious to keep political influence out of appointments. I fully accept that.  That is in accordance with their regulations, but I believe that if a constituent approaches a TD or a Senator and he in turn puts those views to the board in the proper manner he should at least be responded to in a responsible and proper manner.  We will be putting forward the views of our constituents.</P>
    <P>Recently I made representations in relation to a genuine case in my constituency. A postman was reaching retiring age but, due to family circumstances, he was seeking an extension.  When I was in the Department, if that type of case came before the Minister, where possible he would treat it in a humane fashion and give an extension of six or nine months, or whatever was necessary, to allow the man to complete the education of his children, or because he would be disadvantaged by having to retire while he still had a young family.</P>
    <P>The response I received from An Post was that they will not entertain representations <Col N="1377" /> on behalf of personnel, that it is a matter for the person and the board. I was doing my duty as a public representative and conveying the views of my constituents to the appropriate personnel people.  I and others should be responded to in a manner which would indicate that our views were being considered.  That may be a small point to An Post.  They are trying to build up goodwill.  I am relating my experience and the experience of my colleagues who have serious complaints about representations.</P>
    <P>Deputies who were so willing to hand over complete power for postal matters should be given recognition for the role we play in conveying the views of our constituents to an organisation like An Post.  I ask the Minister to convey the concern of Deputies to An Post.  I hope the press will not use this as an effort by politicians to influence appointments.  I understand that in An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann there has been a change of strategy on that matter.  Our position should be still recognised at least to the extent that our views should be considered by the appropriate sections in a responsible way and they should communicate with us.</P>
    <P>On the philatelic side of An Post, we are missing a great opportunity with the forthcoming visit of President Reagan and his wife Nancy to Ireland in June. Perhaps An Post have decided to bring out a special commemorative stamp.  If not, it would be a major coup to bring out a commemorative stamp to recognise the visit of the President of the largest democracy in the world to our shores.  I suggest that from a commercial point of view as well as for the honour it would give to a visiting President.  From my experience, the philatelic section were making a profit of £1 million, which was a major achievement for that section. They also create a great deal of goodwill throughout the world.  Irish stamps are very highly regarded for their quality of design and production.  We are regarded as being very responsible about the production of stamps.  Some countries produce far more stamps, but the quality and the frequency of ours are recognised by <Col N="1378" /> the people in the philatelic world.  We should remember the market we would have in America if, while the President was here, we had a first day launching in Dublin or in Ballyporeen on the day President Reagan visits that great town.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would support such a proposal.  It could recognise the birth place of the President's ancestors in Ballyporeen and could be accompanied by portraits of the President and his good wife.  I know it takes time to produce stamps and that you have to plan ahead.  This would be an opportunity to avail of this great publicity coup. Goodwill would be generated and sales of stamps would be generated which would bring worthwhile money into the country.  We should at least consider that suggestion.  I am sure the Minister agrees with me fully.  I know that, unlike some of his colleagues in Government, he supports the visit of the President of the United States and his wife.</P>
    <P>Last March I was promised that consideration would be given to another matter.  I put down a question in the Dáil on 28 April 1983 to the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he proposes to extend the postal bus service which was introduced in County Clare in July 1982 to other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>In his reply the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>It is the intention to extend the post bus service to other parts of the country and arrangements are in hand to identify suitable routes on which services may be introduced.  However, progress will depend on the availability of financial resources.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate it if the Minister would up-date the progress made in the development of the post bus service which we introduced in County Clare in 1982.  It has given a major boost to that part of the world.  I am very anxious to see it extended to other areas.  I can identify very suitable routes in my constituency which would be excellent for a post bus service.  It provides a tremendous service to the elderly and to people who <Col N="1379" /> have no transport.  The service passes their doors practically every day of the week.  It is a paying service.  It has paid its way to date so far as I am aware.  It is a matter of utilising existing services for the transport of mail and people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals to extend the banking facilities throughout the postal service.  We have a very willing staff who are more than anxious to facilitate customers by extending the banking service. We have 2,000 sub-offices located in almost every village in Ireland.  The staff are trained, willing and able to participate in these exciting new developments. The board are considering major developments in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate it if the Minister would give a progress report on developments in Board Telecom Éireann since vesting date.  I should like to know the number of telephones which have been installed since 1 January 1984 and the number of outstanding faults which have not been attended to.  That was a major difficulty, particularly in the city of Dublin where there were delays of up to two months in having repairs carried out. I hope there has been a major improvement in that regard.  We were heading that way with the improvement in the wiring in the system of communications. I should like a progress report on that in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I must express concern about the telephone billing system.  I will take every opportunity in this House to highlight the complaints of the public about the billing system.  The Minister should allay public disquiet about the system.  In the course of the debate on the Estimates in March the Minister promised me further information which I received about the points and the complaints I raised.  The major point I made was that there should be a public inquiry into the telephone billing system where the public, the aggrieved subscribers, who had received very little satisfaction over the years, would have an opportunity to make known their feelings about the telephone billing system. The Minister wrote to me on 25 April 1984.  I will quote it because I would like <Col N="1380" /> to have it on the record of the House.  He said:</P>
    <P>During the Debate on 29th March on the Estimate for my Department, you expressed concern about the reliability and accuracy of the telephone billing system and raised a number of questions about it.</P>
    <P>I know that Bord Telecom Éireann are very conscious of the need to increase customer confidence in the billing system and that they will take all reasonable action open to them with this in mind.  I will bring what you said on this subject to their attention.</P>
    <P>You referred to the provision of private meters which telephone users can instal in their homes to check the number of units being recorded and asked what was the position about these . These meters are available for some time and I am informed by Bord Telecom Éireann that agreements have been entered into for the supply of a few hundred of them.</P>
    <P>You asked that the consultancy report on the telephone billing system which I had commissioned should be made available to Deputies and enquired why foreign consultants were employed.  The question of publishing the report is under consideration at present.  To carry out the examination needed required a detailed technical knowledge of the operation of the telecommunications network and, for this, some experience of the operation of a telecommunications system was essential. It was for this reason, and also because the Swedish network is similar in many respects to that in use here and has a high international reputation for efficiency, that I selected a firm of Swedish international telecommunications consultants.</P>
    <P>You also referred to the &ldquo;open days&rdquo; that were held in some exchanges last year and suggested that it would be helpful if individual subscribers with complaints were shown their own metering equipment and could discuss their problems with a technically qualified person.  I will bring this to the <Col N="1381" /> notice of Board Telecom Éireann for consideration by them. </P>
    <P>Arising from that reply, and the debate in the Dáil, I should like to ask the Minister to identify the number of private meters that have been installed.  We have been waiting for information in regard to this for some time.  While I was in the Department we were pressing for the completion of the production of those private meters because I believe they will allay the fears of those who are concerned about their telephone accounts.  I am anxious to get more information on the number installed.  Has even one meter been installed?  If one has been installed I would like to hear how it has operated. I do not know of any subscriber who has looked for such a meter.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State tell the House why the report of the Swedish consultants has not been published? What is so secret about a report commissioned by the Government?  Why is the report being suppressed?  It is a major report on the telephone billing system.  Is there something in the report that the Minister, and the Government, are ashamed of?  The report should be made public so that subscribers can analyse its conclusions.  The public are deeply concerned about the major increase in their telephone accounts and the big errors that have occurred.  About 12 months ago I expressed the view that about 40,000 accounts were queried annually by subscribers. There must be something radically wrong if so many people are querying their accounts.  Will the Minister tell the House the number of accounts that have been queried to date in 1984?  Will he inform the House of the amount of money that is allegedly outstanding to Telecom Éireann on accounts that have been queried?  I suggest to the Minister that he take a personal interest in this area.  I do not see any reason why the bills cannot be produced on a twomonthly basis giving a breakdown of the calls made.  If that was done subscribers would know the cost of each call and would be in a position to query any charge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> The only way to deal properly with this matter is to hold a public inquiry and I would hope that it would not be a long drawn-out affair.  It is my view that there are many good firms in Ireland who would have been capable of carrying out a detailed examination of the billing system as was done by the Swedish firm. However, as the Exchequer paid for this report a copy of it should be placed in the Library so that Members can study it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to renew the policy of holding open days at local exchanges.  Subscribers should be made aware of such events and invited to call to the exchanges to inspect their meter working.  Many people are not aware of how the system operates and because of that they are wary of it.  In the interest of good customer relations Telecom Éireann should hold such open days. During the debate on the Estimate we were told that the question of consultation with elected public representatives was being considered.  It would be a worthwhile exercise if the local engineering staff met public representatives to discuss the development of the communication service, consider plans for the future and deal with local complaints.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of automatic exchanges throughout the country.  In Boyle, the northern part of my constitutency, after a long wait a new automatic exchange was opened yesterday.  That move has been welcomed by local people.  With regard to communications with Members I should like to state that the response to representations to Telecom Éireann is excellent.  I do not have any complaints about that area.  Queries are dealt with in a speedy manner.  Local engineers also deal with queries quickly. That is an important public relations exercise and I should like to compliment the staff who deal with those queries.</P>
    <P>The decision by Telecom Éireann to remove the need for an advance payment of rental from subscribers was one of the best taken by them since they took over on 1 January.  People in rural areas were asked to pay up to £1,000 in advance rental before that date.  The installation fee of £180 is high, but it is better to have an installation fee rather than asking <Col N="1383" /> people to pay an advance rental also.  I have no doubt that many more people will be anxious to get a telephone because of that.</P>
    <P>At the annual conference of the Irish Post Office Engineering Union fears were expressed about radiation from communications systems.  According to <i>The Irish Press</i> of 17 May 1984 fears that Telecom engineers may be in danger of blindness or even death because of radiation from a communications system used by the firm were expressed at the conference. An article in <i>The Irish Press</i> stated:</P>
    <P>Delegates adopted a motion, calling on Telecom to implement safety regulations for the use of microwaves in relaying telephone messages.</P>
    <P>The proposer of the motion claimed, according to <i>The Irish Press</i> that:</P>
    <P>there had been a serious leakage from a microwave transmitter in Donegal recently and called for a lowering of the acceptable level of microwave radiation.  He pointed out that the level in Russia was much less than it is in Ireland and the USA.</P>
    <P>Mr. Quinn [the proposer] also called for proper screening of microwave terminals, and regular testing of all equipment used by engineers to check for leakage.</P>
    <P>In the past few years, he said, microwaves had been used extensively in relaying telephone messages, being cheaper than cabling and needing fewer staff.</P>
    <P>Mr. Quinn referred to US research which shows that microwave radiation can cause blindness, alter behaviour, cause genetic defects, or even kill. Workers exposed to radiation should be given a full medical examination, he said.</P>
    <P>According to Mr. Quinn, there are only two meters in Ireland for measuring such leakages, and one of these has broken down. </P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and Bord Telecom Éireann first of all to issue a statement to allay fears in relation to the points made at the Irish Telephone Workers Union <Col N="1384" /> (Engineering Branch) conference.  The points made raised certain fears and queries and I am not in a position to allay those fears.  The Minister and the BTE should issue a statement immediately in relation to the disclosures in today's <i>The Irish Press</i> and other newspapers about this very serious question.  Anybody who recently attended a film about leakages from other installations will realise the danger inherent in this area.  I do not want to increase the fears of workers involved in this area, but I believe that BTÉ have a responsibility to their staff to indicate the exact position regarding the dangers and also to reply to the question of the necessary equipment and to inform them that there is at the moment only one piece of metering equipment to detect leakages.  I appeal to the Minister to communicate this information to BTÉ, although I presume they have it already, so that they may be in a position to express their opinion and also give a detailed reply to the points made.</P>
    <P>We should be proud of the developments in BTÉ and An Post since 1 January.  We have an extremely dedicated, hard-working staff who have brought great credit to both services.  In the next few weeks we will be in a position to show clearly to the whole world how advanced our telephone service in particular is.  With the visit here of the President of the US the entourage of journalists and staff will be using international telephone lines constantly.  We are fortunate in having the station in Cork which the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, opened recently.  We will show clearly that we are advanced in the telecommunications area.  Our service, with the investment which has taken place over the years under our Government in particular &mdash; because we are conscious of the need for improvement in telecommunications which has now been achieved &mdash; will prove to the visiting journalists that we can provide high class, top quality land lines and satellite lines for immediate transmission of television, radio and telephone communications to all corners of the globe for the visit of the President of the US.</P>
    <P>In that regard let me place on record <Col N="1385" /> my appreciation and that of Deputies on this side of the House and Ministers who serve in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to the American postal and communications service, the postal service in particular, who made available to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the advanced research facilities which they have in Washington DC.  One of the reasons why I welcome the President of the US is that America at all times has co-operated with our Government in relation to the development of postal and telecommunications matters.  As I have stated already, I had the privilege of attending at the research facilities in Washington DC and seeing the facilities there which were made available at low cost to our Department of Posts and Telegraphs to develop our postal services. That is the kind of co-operation we have received from America which I have had the personal experience of witnessing. We, as an independent Republic, should give a royal welcome to the President of another great Republic.  With the connection between us and 40 million Irish-Americans and the great hospitality which has been extended by America to visiting Ministers of Posts and Telegraphs over the years and which will continue, it would be very wrong of us not to give a similar welcome to the President of the US.  I mention that particularly in the context of the type of co-operation which we received from Mr. William Bolger, Postmaster-General in the US, and all his staff who at all times extended to us great courtesy.  In that regard let me mention that a very high percentage of very senior executives in the American Post Office are of Irish descent.  That is why it is very important that we extend great courtesy by recognising the visit in a philatelic way by producing a special commemorative stamp.</P>
    <P>We support the amendments to the Bill before us because of the need from a legal point of view that the Bill be enacted.  I support the Bill.  I regret that it had to be brought before the House, but at least it has given me an opportunity of expressing some concern which I have in relation to the President of the US.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity &mdash; although not strictly in the terms of this Bill &mdash; to examine the operation of the two new boards since they were established.  I have heard no criticism of the two boards on any substantive ground.  We should pay a tribute that in the first few months of their operation they have made real strides in the eyes of the public in bringing these two services into a much more efficient and flexible area.</P>
      <P>In particular they have brought in a new attitude to pricing.  For many years there has been too much rigidity in the attitude of Government Departments on issues such as pricing.  The attractiveness of flexibility in pricing and bringing low price offers is a good way to build up goodwill and extra volume for these services.  The initiatives taken in that area are to be commended.</P>
      <P>I am glad to learn that in Bord Telecom Éireann and An Post an effort is going on to improve both management reporting and the planning done within these bodies.  It is no secret that being locked into Government Departments that have over the years confined themselves to single-year budgeting and have not evolved proper management information systems has done nothing but hold back those two services.  Now I am glad to see that the two new boards are making moves to bring in a proper style of corporate planning and proper management information presented on a regular basis, which are needed urgently.  Without those, the five-year plans or planning the costs of the different services cannot be carried out properly.  The initiatives taken in that area are very welcome.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a few comments on what may be regarded at this stage as an old chestnut, that is the issue of telephone billing.  Unfortunately in this area Bord Telecom Éireann have not succeeded in clearing waters altogether. They have made great efforts to meet people and so on, but I am not happy about it.  In recent weeks in my own constituency I have seen a disquieting growth once again in the number of phone bill queries that are not being resolved satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> I know there are great problems.  The equipment used by Bord Telecom has not the capacity for spelling out the precise calls made and detailing them so that people can understand exactly what they are being asked to pay for.  The digital equipment being installed in many centres does provide that facility.  However, I am informed by officials within the board that the use of such equipment to print out details for subscribers as to what calls they made and at what cost would put an undue strain on equipment. It would shorten the life of the equipment by up to 50 per cent if it were used for the extra job of recording and printing those details.  That must temper our demand on Bord Telecom, because while we would all like the public to be presented with the type of bill which is available in other countries, we must give due consideration to the cost that would be involved.  It would be a worrying feature if we were to shorten the life of exchanges to the extent suggested.</P>
    <P>The purchase cost of the recording and printing equipment required would be in the region of £400 million.  There seems to be a real cost constraint in providing the public with the sort of bills that would be satisfactory.  Like the spokesman for the Opposition, I should like to see the study on this issue done by the Swedish consultants.  No doubt other countries which provide greater detail to subscribers have had to confront these cost considerations in some way and I am sure the Swedish experts would have been able to give us some assessment as to whether there is a half way stage where we could provide greater detail at a cheaper rate.</P>
    <P>Bord Telecom should extend their pilot experiment.  I understand they have provided this detailed print-out in Naas for a very limited number of subscribers. The experiment should be expanded and, if possible, they should allow people who can present at least a <i>prima facie</i> case that they are being overcharged to get a detailed print-out in subsequent quarters. A subscriber who queries his bill is normally told that the meter has been checked and that the bill stands.  That is <Col N="1388" /> highly unsatisfactory and it would be some reassurance for people if their line could be put on special surveillance for the following quarter and a detailed print-out provided.  I would hope that could be done without involving Bord Telecom in the very high expenditure which would be required if that type of service were to be provided across the board.  I would ask that they consider some such option.</P>
    <P>I must express some concern about the success of the subscriber meter experiment. Availability is a real problem.  In my constituency I have come across people who would be willing to have a meter but there does not seem to be a possibility of getting one from a contracts manager.  Only certain exchanges are able to provide them.  I expect that problem will be solved in time.  I would suggest that people who purchase subscriber meters should be surveyed on a regular basis to monitor their satisfaction with these meters.  On the issue of telephone accounts the public probably have an unjustified lack of faith in the reliability of the equipment.  It is only natural that this should occur where accounts are presented without details.  It would be advisable for Bord Telecom to take the opportunity of the subscriber meter experiment to publicise the satisfaction of people who are using such meters and feel their accounts are accurate.  Without a little more confidence on the part of the public we will, through sheer force of public outcry, be forced to invest money in print-out equipment that would not otherwise be justified.</P>
    <P>The recent reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General showed a 25 per cent shortfall in revenue from call boxes in 1981 and 1982.  That is a serious problem which has grown very rapidly from only 7 per cent in 1978.  If people can get away with so many free calls, it brings into question the security of these boxes. This must be examined, as must the possibility of making call boxes indestructible. The Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention to some deficiencies in the preparation and processing of charge cards and the manner in which unpaid bills are dealt with.  There are <Col N="1389" /> serious problems in the billing area to which Bord Telecom should address themselves in the near future.</P>
    <P>We still face a major problem in the telecommunications area in attracting new industry here.  Although we have made great strides, this is one area of infrastructure which foreign companies take into account when considering locating here.  There is a need, particularly in regard to telex, for a prompter response to genuine business applications.  I have come across cases of business line applications being unnecessarily delayed.  A priority system should be introduced to prevent that sort of damage to our industrial development procedures.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with negligence in the case of restoration work on our roads.  I am not satisfied that the problem of where the responsibility lies has been grappled.  Legal reform may be necessary to define a clear chain of command because there is still confusion as to who is responsible.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the two boards and thank the Minister for introducing this amending legislation to clear up the remaining difficulty.</P>

      <P>I agree that this is a matter for legitimate concern and I note that this concern is shared in Northern Ireland across the community divide.  I would naturally hope that it will <Col N="1390" /> be possible not to have to resort to such sources for evidence, particularly if there is not corroboration from other sources. I would point out, however, that informers concerned have come from within the ranks of both loyalist and republican subversive groups.  I would add that, while we share the concern of nationalist and unionists about this system, we must also share the concern that murderers of innocent Catholics and Protestants are pursued and brought to justice.</P>
      <P>We have mentioned our concern about aspects of this system on a number of occasions to the British authorities and we shall continue to do so as necessary. We do not propose in these circumstances to raise this matter in Strasbourg.</P>

      <P>There is grave concern on the part of many of us, who, as the Minister is well aware, are as much against the crimes of violence committed by these people as he is.  The whole concept of the supergrass seems to go against human rights.  The import of this question is that if this continues would the Minister consider, with the Government, taking this whole matter to the Court of Human Rights and asking them to make a judgment, if necessary, even on a trial case? It is important that we are seen to be on the side of justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain to the Deputy that the term &ldquo;supergrass&rdquo; is a slang term for a type of evidence which has been part and parcel of our legal system as long as we have had a criminal legal system.  It is what is referred to as the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice.  That is evidence which is admissible in circumstances where the court must be very circumspect and extremely careful about how it is received.  It is admissible evidence under our legal system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he leave a forwarding address?  Would the Minister agree that if in trials, up to 40 people can be summarily convicted on uncorroborated evidence of a paid informer that is not only a travesty but a corruption of justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that one can approach this matter in simplistic terms such as that.  One cannot make a judgment on a particular trial and assess the weight of the evidence before the court unless one is present, listening to the evidence, assessing the witnesses, listening to the cross-examination and getting a general picture of the case.  There is no doubt that in legal circles uncorroborated evidence of accomplices is not the best evidence and is very far from being that.  However, it is admissible evidence and if it is the only evidence in a criminal case it has to be put to the court, subject to the safeguards to which I have referred and which are part and parcel of the legal system in dealing with evidence of this kind.  Obviously, it would be more satisfactory to have best evidence, which would be direct evidence from an impartial and skilled observer, or even consistent circumstantial evidence.  All these would be preferable but, in their absence, evidence from accomplices is admissible but requires to be extra carefully assessed by the courts.  There have been cases in the Northern Ireland jurisdiction where the evidence of accomplices has been found by the courts to be untrustworthy and unreliable.  In some cases it has been rejected, in other cases it has resulted in convictions of some of the accused being tried and in the dismissal of cases against others.  In some cases there have been pleas of guilty and the evidence of the accomplice has not had to be taken. There has been quite a range of experience with regard to its use.  Basically, it remains an unsatisfactory type of evidence, though admissible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="1392" /> agree that this procedure offends against the Convention on Human Rights and that the supergrass system infringes, in particular, Article 6 of the Convention which guarantees everyone a fair hearing and requires persons to be proved guilty? Would the Minister agree that the supergrass system does not constitute a fair trial and that convictions obtained on such a basis do not constitute proof of guilt within the meaning of the Convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree with the Deputy's interpretation of the Convention. The uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is, as I said, admissible evidence within our legal system, as well as within the criminal law system of the United Kingdom.  It does not contravene the European Convention.  That convention bestows the right of a fair trial.  Part of the process of a fair trial is the adducing of evidence.  There are different kinds of evidence &mdash; this would be the lowest grade and consequently has to be received by the court with the utmost care, but it is admissible evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in cases where one has evidence from a source such as in this case about which I am speaking where the source had already been convicted of perjury, it is ludicrous that that kind of evidence would be sufficient to find a person guilty on that testimony alone?  Surely the Minister would agree that this type of procedure brings the courts system in the Six Countries into total disrepute.  The man referred to was also described as a scoundrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would share the Deputy's concern at the courts system in Northern Ireland being brought into disrepute. It should not be brought into disrepute but should be regarded by all citizens as a place where one can go with confidence.  There will be cases where the uncorroborated evidence of accomplices will be such as to cause the greatest of worry.  I am not familiar with the particular case to which the Deputy is referring, but can only deal with the broad principle <Col N="1393" /> of the admissibility of such evidence.  As I have said already and repeat, it is admissible evidence which must be treated with the greatest of circumspection. Obviously, if a person proffering that evidence has a conviction, such as for a crime alleged by the Deputy, the amount of care required in that case would be very high indeed.</P>

      <P>Obviously, there has been no specific decision by Parliament in this matter.  It has not come before Parliament.  It is a matter for the Executive of the day to bring recommendations in this or any other area before Parliament for their acceptance or rejection. This matter has not been the subject of much debate within Parliament although it is a subject which has been attracting more and more attention in recent times and may well come to the floor of this House for debate, but as the Deputy is aware, that is not a matter for me to arrange.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he supports the <Col N="1395" /> declaration by the US Secretary of State, George Shultz, at the opening of the Stockholm Disarmament Conference concerning the division of Europe and the partition of Germany; and if he will seek a similar declaration from the United States Government in respect of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem to me that Secretary Shultz in the part of the statement to which the Deputy's question refer was focusing mainly on the problems in the political, security, human rights and cultural areas to which the existence in Europe of different political and economic systems have given rise and on the need to pursue solutions to these problems as part of the Helsinki process.  As Secretary Shultz put it, &ldquo;Confidence-building in the larger sense means pursuing the work of Helsinki &mdash; through political steps to break down barriers, expand human contact and intellectual interchange, increase openness, and stretch the boundaries of the human spirit&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Helsinki Final Act of 1975 commits all 35 signatory states, including Ireland and the USA to regard as inviolable the existing frontiers of all states in Europe while recognising that these frontiers can be changed &ldquo;in accordance with international law by peaceful means and by agreement&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, the Government view the interest of the US Administration in the problem of Northern Ireland as a very positive and useful element in the search for a solution.  President Reagan has already made clear his belief that &ldquo;a lasting solution can be found only in a process of reconciliation between the two Irish political traditions and between Britain and Ireland&rdquo;.  This year, speaking at the White House on the eve of St. Patrick's Day, the President told the Taoiseach that he was especially heartened by the Taoiseach's own efforts as well as his colleagues' in the New Ireland Forum and the British Government &ldquo;to seek a democratic and peaceful reconciliation of Ireland's diverse traditions&rdquo;. <Col N="1396" /> Following the publication of the Report of the New Ireland Forum, the Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Foreign Affairs went to Washington to brief the US Administration and senior American politicians.  On 4 May last the Deputy Secretary of State, Kenneth Dam, having applauded the hard work and effort that had gone into the preparation of the report, expressed the hope of the US Administration &ldquo;that the Forum process and the Forum report will strengthen Anglo-Irish co-operation in resolving the Northern Ireland problem and in furthering reconciliation between the two communities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that these statements by President Reagan and his Administration are a very satisfactory endorsement by the United States of the work of those who peacefully seek to end the divisions in our country.</P>

They have already made, in effect, statements of the type suggested by the Deputy.  There is no lack of goodwill on the part of the US Administration towards a solution of these problems and a peaceful reconciliation.  Their public stance is well known to all the parties who have been involved in achieving reconciliation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the representations, if any, the Government have made since the beginning of last year to the British authorities concerning the clear evidence produced by the Fair Employment Agency of continuing discrimination in <Col N="1397" /> employment against Catholics in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether in the context of the recent agreement to supply Kinsale gas to Northern Ireland, he is satisfied that the Northern Ireland gas industry has adopted fair employment practices; and if he has had any discussions with the Northern Ireland authorities in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The question of discrimination in employment in Northern Ireland has been raised by the Government with the British authorities on a number of occasions since the beginning of 1983.  With regard to the specific issue raised by the Deputy concerning the gas industry in Northern Ireland, the Deputy may be assured that the Government have indicated to the British authorities their concern that fair employment practices be followed in the Northern Ireland gas industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that strong evidence has emerged in recent months of continuing discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland, that, for example, only 5 per cent of the workforce of Shorts is Catholic and in the administrative grades of the civil service over 80 per cent of officers are Protestant?  Is the Minister aware that unemployment is between 30 and 50 per cent in many strongly Catholic areas such as West Belfast and Strabane? Would he agree that the Government should be urging the British Government to take positive and affirmative action to alleviate this situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to discrimination is not good but it is better than it was.  As the Deputy is well aware there has been action by the British Government going back to 1976 when the Fair Employment Agency was set up to try to redress the discriminatory position. Some progress has been made, but, regrettably, it has been slow.  The <Col N="1398" /> Government are concerned to ensure that progress will continue to be made and we are alert for any areas of discrimination which come to our attention and we will draw the attention of the Northern Ireland Office to them.  We are satisfied that there is concern by the British authorities to ensure that discrimination will come to an end as quickly as possible.  Clearly, it does not require a lot of consideration to realise that it will not come to an end by waving a wand.  It is obviously part and parcel of the difficulties that are inherent in the whole Northern Ireland situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the expansion of the North-South industrial co-operation must be to some extent dependent on the elimination of sectarian discrimination on the part of the Northern workforce and on real efforts being made to introduce greater balance in employment?  Does he believe that useful pressure has been exercised by the United States Congress to improve the pattern of distribution of employment in Northern Ireland and that this pressure appears to be having some positive results?  Could he say if the embassy in Washington has been supportive of such efforts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of whether the assistance of the embassy in Washington was sought by the American authorities in this regard.  Obviously, if it was, it is a matter that would be favourably considered, because our general policy is to do everything we can to assist in the elimination of discrimination.  The Deputy can be quite certain about that. He can also be assured that if there are any industrial development projects in which this jurisdiction are involved we would, of course, be concerned to see that there would be no discrimination in the employment that would result from such development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in possession of sufficient information to make a statement on the matter referred to by the Deputy.  It has not been established what the object reported sighted might have been, or where it might have come from. Investigations are continuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any information. There was a report that two men working on a bog heard a gushing noise and saw a rocket-shaped object passing over them at high speed.  That is all the information we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gives the impression in his answer, maybe not intentionally, that the Department of Foreign Affairs might not be taking it too seriously.  Would he accept that one of the two people who heard this and who described it so aptly is a member of the Garda Síochána and he is quite adamant that this object passed from a point north of Tory Island over Donegal and disappeared into the mountains?  Does the Minister share my concern that foreign powers may be using our territorial waters as a training ground?  Does he share my concern that the object which was seen could damage life and property? Could he outline the Government's policy in relation to the use of our waters by foreign powers as training grounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no evidence that the object in question, whatever it was, was discharged from within our waters or from where it was discharged.  We have not any information and, consequently I cannot comment on the implication in the Deputy's supplementary that this was a missile of some type discharged across our airspace.  There is no information to <Col N="1400" /> support that implication.  Obviously, the Government would be worried if any such activities are taking place but, on the bare facts of this particular incident, this object was seen by only these two men.  There were no other sightings reported and there is no information as to where its flight terminated or originated. I think this will have to join the long and inconclusive list of UFOs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If it landed in Donegal and if it was travelling at a high speed as it crossed the two people who observed it, one would imagine it would have made an impact and would have been reported. There is no report that it landed in Donegal.  There have been no other reports of this sighting except from the two men concerned.  I take it one of them is a trained observer and I am sure the other man is equally observant but no one else has reported the sighting and there have been no reports of the termination of the flight within this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Government propose to make any representations to the Governments of the foreign powers who could be in the area?  Obviously those foreign powers are very limited. Does the Minister propose to make representations to his counterparts in those Governments informing them that they do not have permission at any time to use our territorial waters as a training ground.  I and other people in the area firmly believe that foreign powers are using our territorial waters.  This may be a very cheap lesson for us and it is something the Minister and the Department might pursue and investigate fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The insurance section of my Department handled almost 2,000 complaints or inquiries in 1982, and approximately 1,800 in 1983.  Over 80 per cent of the complaints or inquiries received in both years related to motor insurance, with the balance being divided more or less equally between miscellaneous other classes of life and non-life insurance.  Most of the motor insurance complaints or inquiries related to the premium rates being charged.</P>
      <P>The Irish Insurance Association already provides a comprehensive complaints service and advertises the existence of this service.  The Federation of Insurers in Ireland will also provide a comprehensive inquiries service for those who wish to avail of it.</P>
      <P>I have put the view to the insurers that a high level of consumer service is in the interests of the insurers in attracting policy-holders and they have assured me that it is their aim to provide such a service, and that the views expressed by me will receive close attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State accept that 2,000 complaints in one year with regard to insurance is a sizeable number considering that the vast majority of people are not aware of the mechanism <Col N="1402" /> available to them to make a complaint? Will the Minister make available a more efficient way for the public to make their complaints known?  Will he consider improving the complaints procedure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphasise it is in the best interests of the industry itself to provide the most comprehensive complaints service possible.  If policy-holders complain about their policies it is the company concerned that will lose those holders. The prime responsibility must rest with the industry to provide a comprehensive complaints service.  The people who make complaints to my Department receive close attention and I can assure the House that will continue to be the case in future.  However, I emphasise that it is primarily the responsibility of the industry to provide a comprehensive complaints service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate it is in the best interests of the insurers to provide a comprehensive service for the selling of insurance but I am not so sure they would see it in their best interests to provide an open complaints service.  I am asking the Minister of State to publicise for the benefit of the public that there is a mechanism whereby they may convey their complaints and that they will get satisfactory attention.  It is not evident to the general public that there is such a service. Will the Minister of State contact the Irish Insurance Association and the others involved and ask them to formalise a proper complaints service to cover all types of liability cover?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the specific case to which the Deputy is referring, that is not the case.  It will take some time, possibly a number of years, to ensure that the company in question is back on a sound commercial footing.  In relation to that case, there is no intention on my part to take any action in relation to the removal of the administrator.  In relation to the general thrust of the question, the Act is of continuing application and it may well be used in future years in other cases to ensure that any company that gets into difficulties will not have to be wound up as was the case under the 1964 Act.  The 1983 Act could be used to appoint an administrator through the courts to ensure the continuation of a company and the security of the policy-holders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the administrator appointed by the courts to the named company has indicated and published that a new executive will take over the operation in his place?  Would that not seem to indicate that as far as the administrator is concerned they have now reached a satisfactory way of dealing with business on a continuing basis?

      <P>I would not accept the argument put forward by the Deputy.  In the first instance the administrator is responsible to the court and not to me.  I do not want to say too much about this because possibly the <i>sub judice</i> rules apply.  In relation to the recent appointment of a chief executive, that is a management decision by the administrator in relation to the company in question and does not relate to the position of the company under the administratorship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

Is he indicating that the licensing authority for which he is responsible are suggesting that this legislation may have to be used in respect of other companies? Is he aware that it would not have been necessary to talk about the liquidation of this or any other company if the terms of the original Act which allowed inspectors to be put in had been utilised.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he accepts the method of discount schemes as operated by motor insurers to be in the best interest of the consumer; and the steps he proposes recommending to bring about a more equitable system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have on a number of occasions expressed my reservations on these types of discount schemes.  The Deputy may be aware that on foot of the report of the Prices Advisory Body on motor insurance, the Government indicated <Col N="1405" /> in October 1983 that I would seek to ensure that those firms running special discount schemes will not be allowed to subsidise such schemes from the pocket of the general motorist, and such special schemes will stand or fall on their own underwriting results.  Scrutiny of such schemes takes place in the context of applications made to me either for price increases on the general motor account, or for increases in the premium rates charged for these special schemes.  It is noteworthy that within the past year or so two such schemes effectively ended, and the price increases granted in a number of other schemes &mdash; based on the underwriting results of the schemes &mdash; were substantially in excess of the increase allowed on the general motor account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is the perception of the general public that young drivers are being discriminated against which, in effect, means that it can be more expensive to insure a vehicle than to buy it?  Would he agree that this has an effect on a number of individuals who are prepared to run the risk of driving uninsured vehicles?  Will the Minister accept my recommendation that it would be more equitable to divide the total amount of people seeking insurance in the under-25 age bracket amongst all the insurers, <i>pro rata</i> to the number of insured they have on their books? Would he recommend that to the insurers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question raised by the Deputy is an entirely different one from that he put down.  The question on the Order Paper is in relation to discount schemes.  I have stated quite clearly that, in relation to any such discount schemes, they must stand on their own underwriting results and that my Department will not allow the general motorist, including the under-25 policy-holders, to subsidise these general schemes.  The question of the treatment of young motorists under the age of 25 is not the subject matter of this question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a final supplementary with regard to the discount schemes.  Would he agree that it is showing preferential treatment to sections of the community who are best able to bear the burden of the insurance rate, that perhaps if there was a more equitable system of dividing out the total amount of insurance that has to be written in this country we could have a more equitable and even system and that, consequently, more people would be insuring their cars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary the insurance companies' experience with their specialised discount schemes has not been successful.  As I said in my reply, two such schemes have been ended.  As I said also in my reply, my Department will take every step necessary to ensure that the general body of policyholders on the motoring side of the industry will not be subsidising these special schemes. That would apply also to the younger policyholders.  In that way they are secured to a certain extent, in that whatever losses are incurred under the special discount schemes will have to be borne by the discount schemes policyholders.</P>

      <P>In his reply the Minister said that in the past year or so two such schemes have effectively been ended.  It is only reasonable to ask him to specify the two schemes that have been terminated. That is not all that difficult.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the steps he proposes to take to stop the practice of insurers of rate cutting, particularly in liability underwriting; and if he will give an undertaking that this practice will not be to the disadvantage of the insuring public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is obviously no objection to competitive quoting for insurance risks, but concern has been expressed to the industry about the practice of excessive price cutting without regard to the risk involved.  There are recent indications in liability underwriting, however, that the insurers have taken this matter to heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no powers under insurance legislation to enforce minimum premium <Col N="1408" /> rates and indeed in liability insurance, where rates are complex and the nature of individual risks is important, the setting of minimum premium rates by law would be a difficult task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that considerable losses have been incurred by general insurers in the country in the last year or two, that it is estimated that 25 companies lost money in 1981-82 and that, perhaps when the blue book is available from his Department, it will indicate further considerable losses on the part of insurers, a lot of such losses being in excess of £2 million? Would the Minister indicate what action he proposes taking in order to prevent the possible collapse of some of those writing general insurance in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact there are 26 insurers writing liability business.  I am concerned that, in recent years, there seems to have been some under-cutting in the market place.  But my understanding is that there is recent evidence that insurers are having a change of heart in this insurance area and are returning to more normal practices.  What has happened is that there has been a rate cutting below the official guide rates which companies should have used and from which they had departed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that approximately 18 per cent of all general insurance claims goes on fees to specialists and consultants? Is the Minister prepared to take the initiative in so far as improving the flow of legislative procedures in claims processing that exists, for example, the big backlog in the courts, and the whole question of fees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am happy to hear the Minister at least admit that the legislative procedures are somewhat inadequate in so far as the settlement of all types of insurance claims is concerned.  Would the Minister agree with me further that there is a certain amount of selective quoting of insurance premiums taking place and that certain companies are not now prepared to take the risk &mdash; because of the location of certain properties, because of the crime rate and so on?  But I would have to ask the Minister if he is aware that some companies are actually talking about withdrawing from quoting in general insurance entirely because of these difficulties?

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

      <P>It is expected, since the Government took major legislative steps with regard to the Insurance (No. 2) Act, <Col N="1412" /> 1983, that there will be a call on the funds.

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the steps he proposes to take to insist that motor insurers provide the consumer with a complete breakdown of renewal premiums and generally revert to less fragmented rating structures and that there be a greater simplicity in the wording of policy documents, so that policy-holders will know exactly what is and is not covered by their policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that in general insurers do provide a breakdown of renewal premiums giving details of gross premiums and no claims discounts applicable and that where further details are requested these will be provided where reasonably possible.  As for the rating structures these are examined on the occasion of price increase applications and where any rating scheme is unduly fragmented, this can be taken up with the insurer.</P>
      <P>The Department have taken up the points referred to by the Deputy with the insurers' representative body and will continue to do so.  The insurers have assured me that they appreciate the desirability of clarity and simplicity in the wording of policy documents, but given that the policy is a legal document there are limits to how far one can go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that some of the renewal documents received by the public from certain insurers can be very confusing?  I will not go as far as to say that they are misleading but the language is often couched in terms which they find difficult to understand. <Col N="1413" /> Would the Minister consider recommending to the insurers that they should issue a simplified version on third party and comprehensive cover which would be clearly understood and applicable to all insurance companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise and agree with the Deputy and I can assure him that my Department are in touch with insurers to try to make these documents as simple and clear as possible.  However, one must accept that you can only go so far in simplifying legal documents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is satisfied with the operation of the Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1983 and particularly that the Act affords a sufficient degree of protection to employees of a company where an administrator is appointed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that <Col N="1414" /> where an administrator is appointed the position of employees is improved, since the Act specifically requires the administrator to carry on the business as a going concern.  It also provides that contracts of employment are not affected by reason only of the appointment of an administrator. Under the earlier legislation of 1936 and 1964 the only option available to the Minister in a case of serious insolvency was to petition the High Court for the winding up of the company in question with the inevitable consequences of termination of employment for the staff and of insurance cover for the insuring public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that one of the factors in passing the Act was to safeguard employment. He said the purpose of the administrator was to carry on the company as a going concern.  Apart from the principal company were the subsidiaries taken into account in relation to employment?  Can he be specific about the closure of the garages with a loss of 80 jobs and no redundancy repayments after 20 or 30 years' service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a certain difficulty because there may be a <i>sub judice</i> problem.  I said in my reply that the Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1983, specifically requires the administrator to carry on the business as a going concern whereas under the 1964 Act the company was forced to wind up.  An administrator was appointed by the courts and he has direct responsibility for the PMPA.  He acts under the court's direction.  The administrator is subject to and answerable to the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>My question asks about the operation of the Insurance <Col N="1415" /> (No. 2) Act, 1983.  Surely the Minister monitors the operation of that Act to ensure that it is operated in accordance with the wishes of the Dáil.  Did he take up with the administrator the closure of the garages almost as soon as he took up his job with a loss of 80 jobs particularly as they did not receive redundancy payments after 20 or 30 years' service?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is aware that of all the insurance companies (details supplied), only one company will quote insurance cover to a person aged 20 years to insure a car worth £2,000, and for this quoted a premium of £1,032; if he regards this situation as satisfactory; and if he believes that the motor insurance industry is discharging its responsibilities under the declined cases agreement by quoting the terms (details attached) for motor insurance cover to young persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to say from the details supplied by the Deputy whether the precise premium quoted is correct.  However, it would appear to be in line with the basic rates for the company adjusted by the age loading applied by the insurer.  As stated in replies to previous questions, the age loadings applied by motor insurers have been found by the Motor Premiums Advisory Committee to be broadly in line with the risk they represent.</P>
      <P>The other companies referred to by the Deputy in his question have been written to asking them for specific details about their underwriting policies in relation to young drivers.  The matter has also been taken up with the insurers' representative bodies.  The information I have received so far indicates that young drivers can get insurance cover, but when I receive detailed information from all insurers I will be in a better position to examine the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the companies made an agreement not to refuse motor insurance to any person on the grounds of age alone?  Would the Minister agree that in the three months since this question was put down the insurance companies have not responded satisfactorily?  Out of the 17 companies I listed only one would insure persons aged under 25 years.  Would the Minister not agree that in those circumstances the insurance industry is discriminating seriously against young persons?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Motor Premiums Advisory Committee accept the fact that the risks are substantially higher for young people because of their claims experience.

      <P>When I have received full information from the people referred to by Deputy Molony I will be better able to assess the situation.  I do not think the matter is as serious as the Deputy makes it out to be.  I say that in the context that there is a general acceptance that the level of premiums for young people is of its nature higher than the levels of premium for adults or those over 25 years.</P>

It has been the experience of the insurance industry that it is a loss-making underwriting situation and that the younger the person, especially those under 25 &mdash; this has been <Col N="1418" /> proved by the PAC &mdash; the higher the accident rates.  The liabilities on the insurance companies are highest for those categories.  I accept that the level of premium must reflect the risk involved.  That has always been the case.</P>

      <P>I am not one for reporting people to anybody.  I made a recommendation to the Minister that the easiest and quickest way to deal with this problem was for all young people seeking insurance to be divided out equally in proportion to the total motor insurance being written by the companies.  That is the fairest way.  It will guarantee that young people get a fair quote and that motorists will be insured.  What is happening now is that because of the attitude of the insurance companies up to 25 per cent of people using our roads are uninsured. Will the Minister accept our recommendation?</P>

      <P>The concept of equalising the numbers throughout the companies is something I cannot dictate.  The industry has its right to their own spread of the portfolio.  I cannot dictate to them as to what they should do but even if what the Deputy has suggested was carried out it would not necessarily mean that the rates would be reduced for young drivers.  The risk will not change.  Therefore, there may not be a lot of sense in what the Deputy has said but I am prepared to give the matter consideration.</P>

    <Title>Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Bill, 1984: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the comments of Deputies about dissatisfaction with the billing system.  Due to the fact that this is no longer the responsibility of the Minister it has not been possible to highlight here some of the faults that still exist in that system since that section of the Department went semi-State.  I accept that in the first year of operation there will be a lot of bumps to be ironed out.  Last week a constituent showed me a bill he had received for £400 although his quarterly bill up to then had been between £60 and £70.  I had queried a bill earlier for him but nothing happened. Sometime later the subscriber received a bill for the current quarter and the arrears.  The bill for the current quarter was at what the subscriber felt was the normal rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should convey to the chief executive of Bord Telecom the fact that people are finding it difficult to get information from Bord Telecom.  I am aware that there have been certain difficulties between Members and Bord Telecom in regard to information.  Whether we like it or not in a democracy elected representatives of the people are supposed to act as a buffer between the people and the bureaucrats.  If we do not have such access there is little point in our being here.  In that event we will have a system whereby the bureaucrats will reply to the bureaucrats.  When a public <Col N="1433" /> representative writes to Bord Telecom on behalf of a constituent the board should reply to the Deputy.  I understand there may be some arrangement for sending on a copy of the correspondence to the subscriber but Members will not have any way of knowing if the matter has been dealt with.  We are trying to do a job on behalf of people who feel they are facing a gigantic bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the board on introducing a cheap rate for calls to the United States over St. Patrick's weekend. If the Minister has any information on that he should give it to us in the course of his reply.  That was a good way to generate business.  It is better to have some income rather than none at all.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the length of time that passes between a new subscriber signing a contract and when the telephone is connected.  I have some examples and I will pass them on to the Minister.  I know of people who signed a contract up to six months ago and are still awaiting connection.  I must point out that that has not occurred in the Dublin area.  When subscribers are presented with excessive bills they should be given a better explanation of how the cost arose.  Is there any plan to improve on the existing system?  People who want to query their telephone bills feel they will come up against a blank wall.  Is there a proposal to introduce a system whereby subscribers can pay by way of a budget account similar to the system operated by the ESB?  That is a good way to get in money and people would not wait to pay until the last day.</P>
    <P>I do not have any objection to the Bill under discussion.  I must express my fears about the microwave radiation as reported in today's issue of <i>The Irish Press.</i> The Minister should arrange to have the people concerned medically checked immediately.  If one of the machines for checking the measurement of the microwave radiation has broken down the Minister should see to it that a substitute is provided immediately even if that means having it shipped in from some other country.  You do not play around with this sort of thing.  If there is <Col N="1434" /> any thought that people will be blinded or develop cancer and so on from these microwaves you can be assured immediately that that worry does not apply just to the workers involved but also to their wives and children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset, this is a very short technical Bill to deal with a defect in the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  On a technical Bill of this nature the question of making a progress report on An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann since they took over does not apply.  I can understand Deputy Leyden seeking to broaden the debate.  I have often seen his frustration with yourself, a Cheann Comhairle, on the Order of Business in seeking to introduce a number of matters which you have thought fit to rule out of order from time to time, so we can understand readily his approach on a Bill of this nature.  However, it is a technical Bill dealing with a defect and I do not think it will be appropriate to follow the various areas raised by other people as well as Deputy Leyden.</P>
      <P>Since vesting day Bord Telecom Éireann and An Post are semi-State bodies and it would not help them if we were constantly looking over their shoulders on operational matters.  There will be ample opportunities on other occasions, as there have been in the past.  In the Estimates already Deputy Leyden has contributed at length and explored these things.  In the Estimates the Minister said there were signs that these bodies had got down to work enthusiastically.  A number of broad areas were brought up today by Deputy Briscoe, Deputy Bruton and Deputy Leyden during the course of the debate and I will endeavour to have each sent to the appropriate body.  Also there were requests for specific information which in the normal course of events would come within the aegis of the Department of Communications, as they now are, or the aegis of the Minister, and those I will seek to have answered and the replies sent to the appropriate Deputies on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said all that, I feel it necessary <Col N="1435" /> to confine myself to this very short technical Bill.  It is regrettable that it had to be brought in.  It was amazing legislation in itself and Deputy Leyden was involved in it in the earlier stages.  Everyone paid tribute to the manner in which it went through the House and the tremendous work done in the transfer of those vast areas.  That one single matter should arise is understandable at least.  &ldquo;The Minister&rdquo; was designated.  It should have been &ldquo;The Minister, the Minister for Finance and the State&rdquo;, because in different types of cases various people are named.  This is a technical matter to put that right.  It is also an urgent matter.  Therefore, I have great pleasure in recommending it <Col N="1436" /> to the House and stress the urgency of the matter.</P>

The sketch plan had been sent to the Department of Education for consideration at the time. In March 1984 the Department of Education indicated to the Office of Public Works that it had been decided to proceed with the project and asked if the original sketch scheme was suitable.  It is necessary to consult with the manager's architect to confirm that there is no change in the requirements and this is being arranged.</P>

      <P>Where a claimant has 26 but less than 156 contributions paid at the appropriate rate since entry into insurable employment, payment of disability benefit is limited to 52 weeks.  In order to requalify for payment of benefit she must resume employment for at least 13 weeks <Col N="1428" /> for which contributions at the appropriate rate are paid.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has been claiming disability benefit since 28 August 1982.  She was not qualified for continued payment because according to the records of the Department she had only a total of 94 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment and had exhausted her 52 weeks entitlement to benefit on 31 January 1981.</P>
      <P>However, it has now been established that the claimant had an additional 20 paid contributions in the 1982-83 year which entitled her to payment for a further 52 weeks.  Accordingly, payment of benefit from 1 September 1982, the fourth day of incapacity, to 30 August 1983 was issued on 17 May 1984.  She cannot requalify for further payment of benefit until she again resumes employment and has at least 13 weeks of insurable employment for which contributions have been paid at the appropriate rate. She should however, continue to submit medical certificates while she remains incapable of work so that credited contributions may be awarded in order to preserve the continuity of her insurance record.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The unemployment benefit claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for work.  She appealed against the disallowance of her claim but an appeals officer following an oral hearing of her appeal which took place on 10 April 1984 also decided that she was not available for work and she was notified accordingly on 17 April 1984.  She continues to sign as unemployed and inquiries are being made to ascertain whether she satisfied <Col N="1429" /> the condition of being available for work from 11 April, 1984 and her entitlement to unemployment benefit will be determined in the light of the outcome.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disablement benefit at the rate appropriate to disablement assessed at 20 per cent to 29 March 1984.</P>
      <P>Following an examination by a medical referee on 1 March his disablement was provisionally assessed at 10 per cent in respect of the further period to 28 February 1985 and he was paid a gratuity at the rate appropriate to the assessment. His claim therefore is due to be further reviewed in February 1985.  If however he considers that his condition has deteriorated or would warrant a higher assessment, it is open to him to apply for an earlier review.  His recent appeal against a decision terminating disability benefit on the grounds that he was not considered to be incapable of work is being dealt with by way of an oral hearing which will be arranged as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Uniform general procedures in connection with payment are prescribed by my Department in relation to the European Social Fund special training grants scheme in technical and technological colleges.  The payment of these grants may be on a weekly or monthly basis at the discretion of the college authorities. The verification of attendance of ESF <Col N="1430" /> trainees is essentially a matter for the college authorities.  I would point out, however, that deductions are made from the training grant in respect of all absences from lectures.  I do not consider that any further specification by the Minister for Education in relation to these matters is necessary at the present time.</P>
