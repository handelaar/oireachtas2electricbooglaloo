    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the heavy losses sustained by the salmon fishermen in the Erne estuary at Ballyshannon this season, due to the continuous flooding of the estuary from the turbines of the hydro-electric station, he will request the E.S.B. to make an amicable arrangement whereby the fishermen may operate undisturbed for specified periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the E.S.B. that the flooding of the estuary is necessary for the efficient operation of the Erne stations and that it would not be feasible to vary the flow conditions of the water in such a manner as to suit the fishermen's requirements.</P>
      <P>As the operation of the stations is in performance of the statutory obligations and functions imposed on the board I have no function in the matter and I cannot, therefore, see my way to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, while we admit that the board are not performing anything other than their statutory function, they should have consideration for the fishermen who have suffered very heavy losses because of the unusually prolonged flooding?  Would the Minister not consider using his good offices to see if some amicable arrangement can be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the E.S.B. that this matter has been sympathetically considered by them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is as to whether we will have an electricity generating station there or a river for fishing.  Apparently one cannot have an electricity generating station there <Col N="375" /> without this flooding, which flooding the E.S.B. say is technically necessary for the operation of the station.  If, however, the Deputy has any suggestions to make which are acceptable to the board I will have them submitted to the board for sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in previous years the flooding was not so continuous?  I am told it is possible to have the same output from the station by arranging the flooding at other times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The E.S.B. say that it is not possible to do what the fishermen want to do in this case, but if the Deputy has any proposals to make whereby the matter can be settled in an amicable way I will ask the E.S.B. to consider any suggestions which he makes.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that they placed a contract for the erection of a new school at Loughconnera, County Galway, and that work on the site was commenced towards the end of December last. After a short time, however, work was abandoned.  The inclemency of the weather, the necessity for reviewing the type of sanitation to be provided and the illness of the contractor have been among the causes of the suspension of work.  The prolonged delay in resuming operations is, however, a matter of concern and steps are being taken with a view to having work on the building of the school resumed at an early date.</P>

      <P>In replies to questions on the 18th February and 23rd April, 1953, the Dáil was informed of 12 projects for the utilisation of the funds in the American Grant Counterpart Special Account, which had been proposed to the American authorities.  These 12 proposals, together with a reserve fund, were designed to absorb the entire sum of approximately £6,142,000 in the account.  The draft of an agreement between the Irish and American Governments to govern the disposition of the funds on the basis indicated was initialled last August.  Since then, however, certain modifications of the proposals have been agreed upon in order to meet the views subsequently expressed on the American side, particularly in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  As a result of these modifications, the projects are now as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Grants towards the purchase by creameries and cream separating stations of equipment for the pasteurisation of separated milk and the sterilisation of milk containers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="388" /> 2.  Grants to assist Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Feirme and the Irish Countrywomen's Association.</P>
    <P>3.  The provision of additional laboratories and equipment for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.</P>
    <P>4.  The establishment of a fund for defraying in whole or in part the cost of technical assistance projects.</P>
    <P>5.  The provision of a regional scheme for the eradication of tubercular cattle in County Clare.</P>
    <P>6.  The provision of an agricultural institute.</P>
    <P>7.  The provision of a scheme for the subsidisation of the delivery cost of ground limestone.</P>
    <P>8.  The establishment of an educational exchange programme.</P>
    <P>These projects are expected to absorb about £5.8 million of Grant Counterpart Funds.  The balance of approximately £340,000 will be held as a reserve fund from which moneys will be applicable to any of the foregoing or similar projects as may be necessary.</P>
    <P>In view of the modifications which have taken place in the proposals originally submitted to the American authorities, it has proved necessary to revise the agreement initialled last August and a new agreement was signed on the 17th of this month.  I understand that the American Government hope to obtain the approval of both Houses of Congress for this agreement before Congress adjourns in a few weeks' time.  Once the approval of Congress has been obtained, action to implement the projects can proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £348,700 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The Estimates for my Department which I am now submitting to the Dáil are as prepared by my predecessor. They are three in number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first Estimate, that for the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, provides for the administration costs of the Department.  It will be seen that the gross total of the Estimate for 1954-55 is less by £18,064 than the corresponding figure for 1953-54.  This is more than accounted for by a reduction of £24,347 in the amount required for salaries and <Col N="398" /> wages in 1954-55.  This may not seem consistent with the printed Estimate where, in Part II, there is an increase of £53,673 shown against the salaries sub-head.  At the bottom of the table in Part II there is, however, an amount of £78,020 in respect of increases in remuneration in 1953-54. When this amount is added to the amount in sub-head A for the year 1953-54 the increase of £53,673 in salaries and wages shown in the printed Estimate becomes a decrease of £24,347.  This drop in expenditure on salaries and wages is due to a reduction in the number of staff employed in the Department by 144. This decrease arises from certain staffing economies resulting from centralisation of headquarters staffs in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada and the continuance of efforts, initiated when the Department was established, to secure reductions in the cost of administration by systematic reorganisation of major sections and the introduction of improved working methods and equipment.  This over-all decrease in the number of staff has taken place even though the staffs of some sections have had to be increased, and are still being augmented, to cope with increased work arising from new legislation.</P>
    <P>The only other figure in this Estimate which calls for comment is that for Appropriations-in-Aid which shows an increase of £124,476 in 1954-55 as compared with 1953-54.  It will be seen from the analysis of the Appropriations-in-Aid figure given on page 379 of the Book of Estimates that this increase is accounted for by an increase of £124,700 in Item I of the Appropriations-in-Aid, which is the receipt from the Social Insurance Fund in respect of the cost of administering the various insurance services.</P>
    <P>The amount which the fund will repay to the Vote in respect of the cost of the insurance services is considerably larger in the current year than it was in the previous year for the following reason:&mdash;The Social Welfare Act, 1952, gave title to unemployment benefit to persons not formerly so entitled such as persons employed in agricultural employment.  This had <Col N="399" /> the effect of increasing the work relating to employment benefit at employment exchanges and branch employment offices and reducing the work relating to unemployment assistance. The increased expenditure on insurance work at employment offices (balanced by a corresponding reduction in expenditure on assistance work) amounts to a large sum and, being repayable to the Vote by the Social Insurance Fund, accounts for most of the increase of £124,476 in the Appropriations-in-Aid figure.</P>
    <P>The second Estimate with which I have to deal, that for Social Insurance, is for a sum of £2,798,000. As Deputies are aware, this payment represents the amount by which the income of the Social Insurance Fund was estimated to fall short of the expenditure of the fund in 1954-55.  The payments for disability benefit, unemployment benefit, maternity allowance, contributory pensions, marriage grant, maternity grant, treatment benefit and administration were expected to reach a total of £7,947,000, including a small sum of £30,000 in respect of adjustments relating to the old insurance schemes.  Income from contributions and interest were estimated to reach £5,183,000, leaving a deficit of £2,764,000, which is the figure shown in sub-head A.  It will be seen that as compared with 1953-54 the amount to be provided in this Vote for 1954-55 shows a reduction of £753,482.  This is mainly due to the reduction of £745,000 in the amount under sub-head A.</P>
    <P>That the amount of this deficit is estimated to be less in 1954-55 than in 1953-54 by a sum of £745,000 is due to the fact that the cost of certain benefits is expected to be substantially lower in 1954-55 than in 1953-54, while the income of the fund from contributions and investments is expected to be higher.  For example, unemployment benefit is estimated to cost £2,142,000 in 1954-55 as against £2,765,400 in 1953-54, a reduction in expenditure of £623,400.</P>
    <P>As an offset to these reductions in expenditure the administration of the insurance services is expected to cost <Col N="400" /> £1,067,200 in 1954-55 as against a sum of £900,000 which was provided for in the 1953-54 Estimate.  This increase in the cost of administration is due to the increase in Civil Service salaries and to the transfer of work from assistance to insurance already referred to.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with the Social Insurance Vote I should, perhaps, mention a matter which has been dealt with since I took office.</P>
    <P>It is a condition for unemployment benefit under the Social Welfare Act that at least 50 employment contributions have been paid or credited for the contribution year preceding the benefit year of claim.  Contributions are credited for contribution weeks of proved unemployment and notified incapacity for work.  Where the condition is satisfied unemployment benefit is payable at full rates.  If the condition is not satisfied unemployment benefit may nevertheless be payable by reason of regulations made in January, 1953, which enable personal benefit and allowance in respect of an adult dependent to be paid at lower rates proportionate to the number of paid or credited contributions for the contribution year.  The weekly allowance payable in respect of a child dependent is not affected.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1952, came into full operation on the 5th January, 1953.  Without special provision, persons insured under the former insurance schemes would not, until some time had elapsed, have been in a position to satisfy the contribution conditions for unemployment benefit under that Act.  In order that such persons could, when unemployed during the transitional period, obtain unemployment benefit, special provisions were made, including the waiving of this condition until the beginning of a benefit year which would be governed by a complete contribution year under the 1952 Act.  The first such benefit year for men began on the 7th June this year, and the governing contribution year was the 1953 contribution year from 5th January, 1953, to 3rd January, 1954.</P>
    <P>Normally insured persons are in employment, sick or unemployed and the condition should not be difficult of <Col N="401" /> fulfilment.  On examination of the position, however, I found that some 40 to 50 per cent. of claimants would suffer reduction or loss of unemployment benefit by reason of this condition. It was not expected that so many would be affected.  The crediting of contributions in respect of unemployment is a new feature in unemployment insurance and although the importance of acquiring credited contributions is brought to the notice of persons using local offices, it was felt that such persons had not appreciated the effect on future benefit of failure to furnish evidence of unemployment when not receiving unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. For these reasons I considered that the immediate application of the condition would impose hardship in many cases and I therefore made regulations the effect of which is to continue until the end of the current benefit year the waiving of the condition for men who had been insured under the former insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>The last Estimate with which I have to deal is that for Social Assistance. This shows a net decrease of £135,600 in 1954-55 as compared with the amount provided in the Estimate for 1953-54.  As will be seen from the Book of Estimates, smaller amounts are being provided in 1954-55 than were provided in 1953-54 for old age pensions, unemployment assistance and widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions.  The actual expenditure on these benefits in 1953-54 was, however, less than the amounts provided in the Estimate owing to the difficulty of making accurate estimates of expenditure in view of the changes brought about by the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and the Children's Allowances Act, 1952.  The amounts being provided in 1954-55 for the services I have mentioned are, therefore, substantially greater than the actual expenditure on these services in 1953-54.  The estimated expenditure on the Social Assistance Vote for 1954-55 is actually £442,400 more than the actual expenditure out of this Vote in 1953-54.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has mentioned, this Estimate was prepared by his predecessor and we, therefore, <Col N="402" /> cannot level criticism against him for anything that may be in it.  There is one thing I just want to mention and that is with reference to the applicants for unemployment insurance who must have 50 stamps either contributed by or credited to them.  I am, indeed, surprised to hear that the percentage of applicants is so high as 40 or 50 per cent.  The estimate I got when I was Minister was very much lower than that.  In fact, I was told that the number would probably be negligible. Indeed, you would expect that the number would be negligible, because if a person is either working or unemployed or sick, then he should qualify for his full unemployment benefit if it becomes due in the following year.  But the Minister has evidently found that a very big number will be affected.  In view of that, I think he was right in taking the step he did, because I gather from the Minister that it is due to negligence on the part of insured people that they did not have their insurance stamps credited to them as they might.  It has given them a chance to be very careful in future.  From that point of view, I think the Minister was right in giving a little more time to people to look after their own interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it may be too soon&mdash;I suppose it is&mdash;to expect to be told by the new Government what we are going to get with regard to increased benefits in the social range of insurance or in social assistance.  I just want to say that, looking through the local papers, I found that the present Minister posed a question to the people in Wexford during the election.  When speaking in the Bull Ring, he asked them how could they expect an old age pensioner to live on 21/6 a week, or even 24/-, or how could they expect an unemployed man with a wife and three children to live on 50/-?  He was a little bit inaccurate in speaking of 50/-.  As a matter of fact, the Fianna Fáil Government had provided for a little bit better than that.  Any man who is unemployed or sick, if he has a wife and three children, is allowed 50/- unemployment benefit and 6/6 children's allowance.  Even so, the inaccuracy, I suppose, as things went in the <Col N="403" /> election, was hardly to be compared with the ordinary inaccuracies we heard.  We can take the 50/- as usual enough, anyway.  However, the question was posed to the people in the Bull Ring and, I suppose, the people who were listening naturally came to the conclusion that the man who put that question when he got power in his own hands would answer the question by saying that it is not possible for an old age pensioner to live on 21/6, or for the recipient of sickness allowance or unemployment benefit to live on 50/-.  Therefore, we may expect when the Labour Party comes back into power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You spoke to the people about external assets and asked the people of Wexford at some meeting how they liked to have £49,000,000 or £56,000,000 leaving the country to be invested in England.  The Deputy muddled the people of Wexford so much that they did not know what he was talking about, and he did not know himself.  I only want to ask the Minister whether, in his reply, he will give an indication when this matter of increased benefits under social welfare will be considered.  I do not want to embarrass him by saying that if I were there I would do it.  I think it could not be done.  I think we were spending as much as we could out of the national income on sickness and other benefits. That is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister thought it could be done.  He did give a clue as to how he thought it could be done when speaking in Gorey.  Deputy O'Leary was also there on that occasion.  I think that was the time Deputy O'Leary was talking about Tulyar.  The Minister on that occasion said that the Government should have power to create and control credit.  That is one way of doing it I admit, but I do not approve of it.  If the Minister gave the impression to the people of Gorey that one way of doing it was to create and control credit, we had better hear a <Col N="404" /> little more about it and see whether it could be done that way.  I am not impugning the Minister's honesty.  I think the Minister was honest in thinking this could be done.  I am sure he was honest when speaking in Gorey in thinking that the money was there and that it was only a matter of the Government doing something about it by creating and controlling credit.  I think he was honest when he spoke in Wexford when he said that it was impossible for an old age pensioner to live on 21/6 or for a sick person with a wife and three children to live on 50/-.  I am not in any way impugning his honesty.  I am not expecting an answer, but perhaps the Minister would give some indication when we can expect to have an answer from him and the Government as to when this matter will be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point to which I wish to direct the attention of the Minister.  There is considerable concern and, in many cases, disappointment, with regard to the standards on which maternity benefits are being paid.  I believe the matter rests more or less with the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call attention to some anomalies which <Col N="405" /> exist, particularly in Limerick.  I think the Minister will agree that they are predominant throughout the country. I refer to the inexcusable delay in paying people entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance or any benefit under the Social Welfare Act.  I think the Minister will agree that in some cases people have to wait for five or eight weeks.  I heard of a case recently in which there was a delay of three or four months. There is a continuing grievance in all these cases.  If the Minister cannot expedite the payment of these benefits, then would he at least examine the possibility of providing more adequate funds and not the meagre amount paid out in public assistance?  It is a great hardship for people who have been earning a certain wage that, due to no fault of theirs, they have to wait for some weeks to get benefits under the Social Welfare Act.  It is very humiliating to have to turn round and not alone accept public assistance but in some cases assistance from the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  We all agree that that society does excellent work in this country, but the days are over when the citizens should have to humiliate themselves.  I would ask the Minister particularly to direct his attention towards expeditious payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the matter to which Deputy MacCarthy referred, the Minister mentioned that it was a matter for the Minister for Health.  There are two maternity grants&mdash;I think there is a maternity grant by the Minister for Health of £4 and there is a maternity grant of £2, which the present Minister deals with.  I would urge him to make a public statement on the whole question of maternity benefits, jointly if possible with the Minister for Health, as there is grave misunderstanding throughout the country.  I would also ask the Minister to bear in mind the hardship experienced by individuals who could be eligible for the maternity grant.  Due to certain circumstances when the Act was framed, it was not envisaged, for instance, that a person who was idle one week and who in the week his child was born was working, could be turned <Col N="406" /> away and might become a member of the public assistance class.  It is very hard on a person to have to suffer a loss of that kind.  The main thing to which I would draw the Minister's attention is the undue delay, particularly in Limerick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to a matter in which he himself has been interested for the last 12 months and which the South Cork Board of Assistance has been interested in and on which they had a deputation to the previous Minister.  I know there were difficulties, but the position is difficult for recipients under the Special Employment Period Orders from March to September or October when benefits are denied to certain people in the rural areas.  I know the Minister will recall the matter when I say there were certain women recipients of the benefit who last year or the year before were victims for the first time under the new system.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the position of those people.  The position that obtained during the last 12 months was very unfair to them.</P>
      <P>I understand there is a file in the Department dealing with a certain controversy with the South Cork Board of Public Assistance in connection with the application for payment by certain traders for footwear under the free footwear scheme.  That is going on for a very long time. While the Department may not be in a position to allow the grant, from their side of it, they should consider the point that the members of the board and the county manager are in favour of meeting the applications and paying the amounts they believe the traders are in fairness entitled to receive.  I would ask him to have this matter investigated and have fair treatment given to these people also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the last speaker, Deputy O'Malley of Limerick, I think it would be very important to get some sort of statement&mdash;jointly with the Minister for Health or otherwise&mdash;as regards these maternity and other grants.  It is amazing that there is such a large number of people in rural areas who <Col N="407" /> are not aware of where they stand as regards these benefits.  I do not know what the position is in this city or in Cork City.  Some people believe they are entitled to grants and are not being treated fairly.  It is quite likely that they are being treated properly but because they are not familiar with the circumstances prevailing in connection with the grants it is only right that the information be made available to those people in a concise and clear way.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should say to the Minister, as a young Minister in his Department, he knows&mdash;and I know he knows&mdash;the obligations imposed on him in the office he holds.  He knows that I also know his views regarding the old age pensioner, the widow, the orphan and the blind.  It is vitally important for us never to lose sight of our obligations to these people, who are far more important than any political question or political theories inside or outside the House.  I am not interested in what any speaker said during the general election campaign, whether in the Bull Ring in Wexford or in Patrick Street of Cork City, but I am interested, as every member of the Party here is interested, in the position of the old age pensioner, the widow, the orphan and, above all, the blind person.  We expect the Minister to give his closest attention and to use his best endeavours in those matters.  We believe he will do that.  We are satisfied that these people will be placed in a somewhat better position than they have been in years past, while the present Minister holds this office.</P>
    <P>I do not mind what Government was here in the past&mdash;I am not interested in that, but in these points regarding social welfare.  It is vitally important that in social welfare activities we look at both angles.  We must see what we can give as a State, what we must give to those who need so much from us at the latter end of their days.  It is also vitally important that we see where we stand as regards the cost of living for those people.  I expect the Minister, together with other members of the Cabinet, with a true sense of co-operation, to see that these sections of the <Col N="408" /> community to whom the Department of Social Welfare means everything, are not lost sight of in the years to come or in the many years during which the Minister may hold the position he is in to-day.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, were it not that there was a change of Government, thousands of unemployed men would have had their assistance cut off.  The new Minister for Social Welfare restored it on the 6th June last.  That is not so very long ago.</P>
      <P>Benefits under the national health insurance remain at only £2 but I might say here that the ex-Minister for Health and Social Welfare imposed a £4 maternity grant on the local authorities.  That money had to be provided out of the pockets of the ratepayers.  Representatives of seven county councils went on a deputation to Deputy Dr. Ryan while he was Minister for Health and Social Welfare. There were representatives of Cavan, Wexford, Kilkenny and three or four other county councils.  The only information that Deputy Dr. Ryan gave those representatives was that the arrangments would be on a 50-50 basis. The result was that from the 1st January of this year Wexford county council had to make a provision of £2,000 to meet grants under the maternity scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan talks about what the present Minister, Deputy Corish, said and what I said in Wexford.  Anything I said was true.  I told the people that there would be a change of Government.  At the expense of the State, Deputy Dr. Ryan sent letters to every person in Wexford informing them of what he intended to do to improve the health of the people.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Deputies raised this matter first.  It is only right that I should answer them. It will generally be agreed that the country welcomes the change of Government. We look to a future for the old age pensioners, for the widows and for the orphans.  There was no future for those people while Fianna Fáil were in office.  We must not forget that when Deputy Dr. Ryan was Minister for Health and Social Welfare he stated in this House that 1/6 extra was sufficient to enable the old age pensioners to meet the increase that had taken place in the cost of living. Those are hard words but they are the words which the ex-Minister uttered in this House when he was asked questions about the plight of the old age pensioners as a result of the steep rise in the cost of living which took place shortly after Fianna Fáil took office in 1951.  Now, however, Deputy Dr. Ryan is worrying about those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is in earnest about improving the lot of our people and reducing the cost of living.  Please God, when he shall have completed the five years of office which lie before this Government, the promises which this new Minister for Social Welfare and myself made in our constituency will be fulfilled&mdash;and Fianna Fáil will be forgotten.  I believe that things can be improved in this country.  I know that every Deputy sitting on the Government Benches has the confidence of his constituents.  It is the people's voice that is speaking here to-day&mdash;not the voice of a minority Government such as we had here for the past few years.  The sooner the Opposition realise the full facts of the situation and get down to the job of working, as an Opposition, to further the welfare of our people and of our country, the better, because national progress has for too long been held <Col N="410" /> up by politics and by the one-Party system.</P>
    <P>Our new Taoiseach, Deputy J.A. Costello, will fulfil the promises which were made to the people before the general election.  When Fianna Fáil were in office, they were not thinking about the old age pensioners nor about the widows and the orphans.  That has amply been proved by their actions during the three years they were in office.  During that time, money could be got for the purchase of an expensive racehorse, for Constellations, and for other things but nothing could be found for the old people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With due respect, I am replying to statements made by the Minister on the conduct of the Department.  Fianna Fáil introduced widows' and orphans' pensions, children's allowances, free footwear and many other benefits of which the members of this House must be well aware. While the Coalition Government were in office, we waited for the Social Welfare Bill which they had promised the people and, as I said a moment ago, that Bill was not introduced until just before that Government had to go to the country.  Fianna Fáil were not long back in office in 1951 when they increased the old age pensions by 2/6 and then by a further 1/6, making 4/- in all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask one question.  During the marches of the unemployed in Dublin Deputy Kyne, the Chairman of the Labour Party, said that all those unemployed people should get £3 per week.  Is it the Minister's intention in the near future to increase the unemployed men's benefit or assistance to £3 per week?  This was said very publicly to incite those men to continue their marches through the city and it undoubtedly had a big effect during the recent election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter on which I would like to support Deputy Desmond and that is the question of free footwear which was supplied to poor people in Cork a few years ago. Deputations have come to two Ministers about that where the traders supplied free footwear which was not as specified by the Department and was not official free footwear.  As I understand the matter the fact was that the official free footwear was not available and the people supplied the other and have since been refused payment. One small trader had to go out of business.  The South Cork Board of Assistance have repeatedly requested the Department to sanction the payment for this and the last letter they got recently was to the effect that the Minister would have no objection to <Col N="414" /> the board paying for them, if they wished.  The county manager says that that does not give him sanction and that he would be surcharged if he paid.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister that if the board paid their half of it at any rate would the Minister give a guarantee that that official would not be surcharged? I think it is an injustice.  It went on during the time of Fianna Fáil and I think during the period of office of the inter-Party Government but it is going on a good while and those people are without their money.  Surely permission should be given at least to allow the board to pay its half.  I strongly appeal to the Minister to consider that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickPGogan" hpid="Mr. Gogan Mr. Gogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In wishing the Minister well in his new office, I should like to suggest that in the Social Welfare Act of 1952 he has an instrument for doing great good and I hope he will see that that instrument is used to the full.  I should like to take this opportunity of asking the Minister for some information as to what savings are effected by the discontinuation of the payments from voluntary national health and whether he would consider the question of the restoration of those benefits?</P>
      <P>The Minister is also aware of certain local government officials who are through their office debarred from making contributions to the widows' and orphans' pensions.  I would ask him to consider that matter to see if it could be rectified.  In taking up his new office I am sure the Minister will have an approach that no other Minister would have and I would ask him to consider the question of the abolition of the means test.  We have heard complaints in regard to investigations of old age pensions.  This morning I had a letter from an old lady in which she stated that she had been awarded a pension and mentioned the fact that she applied on the 14th February, 1954.  I suggest that that is altogether too long a period for anybody to wait for an old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to accept the statement made by Deputy Dr. Ryan, the former Minister, with regard to the proposed reductions in <Col N="415" /> unemployment benefit, that he did not understand what repercussions there would be if this section of the Act were to come into operation on the 7th June.  I cannot say what he would have done in the same circumstances had he been returned as Minister for Social Welfare, but I only hope and trust he would have acted as I did when I assumed office and when I realised that some 11,000 or 12,000 men who were on unemployment benefit would be reduced substantially in relation to the amount they had been receiving before the 7th June.</P>
      <P>I think I would join with Deputy Dr. Ryan in an admonition to those people who may be applying for unemployment benefit to be much more careful of their contributions and to seek the credits which they may get during the present year.  By staying in bed too late in the morning, by being too careless to go down to sign or through being ill on one, two or a maximum of three days and not notifying this illness to the local exchange these people can reduce their credits and the consequence of it will be that their unemployment benefit will be reduced and may be cut of entirely unless they take greater care in regard to the matter.</P>
      <P>One of the things that influenced me when I made that particular decision last week or the week before was the fact that there was a regulation, since revoked or repealed, which meant that a person who received less than 30/- for a job of work done during the week was not entitled to a stamp or a credit and that militated against him in endeavouring to have 52 credits during the year.  Inasmuch as that regulation was in operation for approximately three months, I considered it to be unfair in respect of many in receipt of unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to tell the House and Deputy Dr. Ryan that any sentiments I expressed when I spoke in the recent election with regard to old age pensioners and those in receipt of social welfare benefits are still my sentiments.  I think it is known now to the House and the country that they <Col N="416" /> represent the sentiments of the present Government as well.</P>
    <P>The political pledge of the present Government in respect of these benefits is embodied in the statement made prior to the formation of the Government.  It means an increase in old age, blind and widows' and orphans' pensions, an improvement in the Workmen's Compensation Acts, provision of retirement pensions for men at 65 and women at the age of 60 years, an increase in mortality benefits and an increase in maternity grants.  I am sorry to see that the former Minister, Deputy Dr. Ryan, who happens to be a colleague of mine in County Wexford, should accept the defeatist attitude that it is not possible to make increases for such people as old age pensioners, blind people and those who are at the present time in receipt of widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
    <P>If I said in the Bull Ring in Wexford that I thought 21/6 was inadequate for old age pensioners on which to live I believed it and I still say the same thing at the present time.  I think that every person across on the other side of the House will share those views, but I am not prepared to accept the defeatist attitude that it cannot be done, that an increase for these people is not possible.  When we consider how many other things can be done at a cost to the State of substantial sums of money, it is only fair that this House should approve of any measures that might be taken to improve the lot of these people who cannot exist on the allowances that are given to them at the present.  There is no point in boasting of what was done last year or the year before or ten years before that or when a cut was made in old age pensions.  We must consider these cases on their merits.  If we consider that 21/6 is not good enough for the old age pensioner the Government should move heaven and earth to try to see that increases are given.  As far as this Government is concerned, improvements in respect of all these benefits will be made.  I am not in a position nor do I think anybody would expect me to say at this stage exactly when those increases will be given or to what extent they will be given, but <Col N="417" /> I want to say this, as Minister for Social Welfare, that as far as I am concerned, there will be no avoidable delay in making my proposals to the Government with regard to improvements for the particular categories to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I may have been misquoted by Deputy Dr. Ryan or misreported by the Press, but I do not ever remember saying that one of the methods by which we could get money to pay increased social welfare benefits would be if we took powers as a Government to create and control credit.  If my memory serves me accurately every single one of my speeches in respect of the creation and control of credit was in respect of further capital development.  I never implied or inferred that old age pensions, unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance would be, could be, or should be increased if we had the power to create and control the credit of this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to delays in the payment of benefits.  In that he may have been voicing the opinions of practically every Deputy of this House. We have all had experience, and I have as much experience as anybody, with regard to the delay in the payment of different types of benefits.  I have not yet examined the whole position, but I know that many complaints have been made.  Having regard to the number of claims that are examined and paid out in the Department from week to week I think that the delays occurring in payments form a very small percentage of the total payments made; but, as Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, even if there are 30,000 payments made it does not lessen the hardship on any particular person who is waiting two, three, four, five or six weeks for his or her particular payment.  I have been presented with the schedule of the procedure or machinery with regard to these payments from the time the person has become ill until the time he or she receives payment.  I propose to have that particular schedule and that particular machine examined with a view to seeing if there can be any short circuit.  Deputy Desmond raised <Col N="418" /> that point, too, and, as I say, if we were to have the usual debate on these particular Votes I am sure that practically every Deputy who would speak would have mentioned delays in the payment of benefits.</P>
    <P>The matter of the footwear scheme in Cork has been referred to by Deputies Desmond and McGrath during this debate.  That is the first I have heard about the difficulty, and I can only say, with respect to that scheme in Cork, that I will have it examined with a view to seeing if anything can be done.</P>
    <P>I know that I am not entitled to talk about maternity grants.  There are, it is true, two alternative grants, one of which is administered by the Department of Social Welfare and the other by the Department of Health.  To receive one, one must qualify and have a certain number of stamps in respect of a particular period, but the maternity grant paid by the local authority is not on an insurance basis, and it is paid by the local authority having regard to the person's means. As far as I am aware, there has been issued by the Department of Health a regulation which sets out means in respect of different sizes of families and, as far as I know, the regulation is pretty uniform for the whole country; but, as I have pointed out before, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it has nothing at all to do with the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I think that those are the main things which have been mentioned in this debate.  In conclusion, I would like to thank the Deputies who wished me well in my new office, and to say that, as far as I am concerned, I will try to do my best for those people for whom I am responsible.</P>

That is done at the present time in Dublin and is often the cause of complaint not only by the recipients of benefit but by the officials themselves in the larger offices throughout the country.

    <P>This Estimate has not, of course, been prepared under my supervision.  I shall, therefore, confine my statement to a factual presentation of the figures, with observations on the important broadcasting developments during the year in accordance with information given to me by the director.</P>
    <P>Under arrangements made in a reorganisation of the broadcasting service in 1953 the sum to be provided for ordinary operations each year, that is, apart from the cost of equipment and other capital works, is the equivalent of the receipts from licence and sponsored programme fees together with a smaller sum representing the cost of staff transferred to broadcasting from the Post Office for administrative and accounting work. This sum is shown in sub-head A of the Estimate and this year amounts to £475,100&mdash;£469,300 from receipts and £5,800 the cost of transferred staff. The sum for equipment is provided by subsidy over and above receipts from fees and is settled each year with the Minister for Finance.  The sub-head B provision in the current year is £11,600. The reduction of £133,400 as compared with last year is due to two causes. First, there was a sum of approximately £115,000 for the purchase of three new transmitters last year and secondly equipment to the extent of £50,000 is being provided for exceptionally this year in sub-head A as the full amount available under the approved formula in that sub-head will not be needed for ordinary day-to-day operations.  This relief of the subsidy sub-head is purely temporary for the present year only as normal broadcasting developments are expected to require all the money from licence and sponsored programme fees in the coming and future years.  The net decrease of £119,600 in the Estimate as a whole is due to the clearing of the bulk of the cost last year of the transmitters I have referred to and <Col N="422" /> to an increase in the anticipated receipts from sponsored programme fees by £29,300.</P>
    <P>I shall now refer to the principal developments that took place in the programme sphere during the year. The House has already been told that talks were given on the last Budget by representatives of the three larger Parties.  A notable and very important extension of that type of broadcast was the introduction of a scheme of general election broadcasts during the recent election campaign. The Director of Broadcasting offered time between 10.00 and 10.15 at night on 15 nights in the three weeks before the election date and the Parties themselves arranged the allocation of the number of talks for each Party and the order of speaking. The talks were recorded for the convenience of the speakers and to ensure accuracy of timing.  Beyond that the Director of Broadcasting did not, of course, exercise any supervision or censorship.  The scheme was very successful from the broadcasting point of view and Comhairle Radio Éireann and the director would like to thank all the Parties in the House for the support and co-operation they gave among themselves in the allocation of the talks and with the broadcasting authorities in the general arrangements for recording.  The scheme had to be considered hurriedly at the last moment.  The Parties had necessarily to be somewhat rushed in their consideration and the implementation of the scheme imposed a severe strain on the broadcasting machinery.  At the same time the scheme was well worth all the effort that had been put into it.</P>
    <P>The Comhairle and director were given authority recently to remove the ban that existed on the engagement of Deputies and Senators in ordinary broadcasts, that is, in broadcasts which are not political.  It will not be necessary to consult the Parties about such engagements.  The services of any particular Deputy or Senator will be requested by the director in the ordinary way for any broadcast for which his qualifications are considered to be particularly suitable.</P>
    <P>Another recent innovation which is <Col N="423" /> not concerned directly with political broadcasting but involves controversial discussion is a series of programmes entitled &ldquo;Press Conference&rdquo;.  In these programmes the heads or other chief representatives of important national organisations or functions, as, for instance, An Tóstal, come to the microphone and discuss their enterprises with interviewers who subject them to a form of questioning or cross-examination. These programmes have proved highly interesting.</P>
    <P>The Director of Broadcasting has held three inquiries of a national character over the past year to ascertain the listeners' tastes in broadcasting programmes.  These were carried out with the valuable assistance of the Central Statistics Office in framing the questions and compiling the results and with the generous assistance of the Post Office in the &ldquo;field work&rdquo;.  A summary of the results has been published and I need not refer to them here in detail.  I should say, however, that despite what has been heard from time to time in the past&mdash;perhaps it was said rather facetiously&mdash;that listeners in this country pay their licence fee for the privilege of listening to the B.B.C., the three inquiries disclosed that listening to Radio Éireann heads by a large margin listening to any other station.  That is what one would naturally expect but it is very good to have it proved in a national inquiry.  I am glad to know also that Irish traditional music holds a high place in listeners' tastes.  To satisfy this demand the director introduced programmes like &ldquo;Take the Floor&rdquo;, a medley of Irish music and song and even Irish dancing.</P>
    <P>It was announced already in the House that the broadcasting time had been extended by half an hour per day from 11.00 p.m. to 11.30 p.m.  Since then the Sunday time has been extended by three hours from 2.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.  We now have on most Sundays a continuous programme from 10.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>The Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra has continued to give twice-yearly series of public concerts in the <Col N="424" /> Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, and bi-weekly concerts in the Phoenix Hall to which the public are admitted free of charge. The orchestra continues to co-operate with the Dublin Grand Opera Society in the production of opera.  Provincial tours have been undertaken by the orchestra and an interesting tour planned for the autumn is one to the Six Counties which includes concerts in Belfast and Derry.  The Light Orchestra continues to provide light classical music, céilí music and music for variety.</P>
    <P>In the news section of the station the most important development was the recent addition of a sub-editor with special responsibility for the improvement and extension of scope of the news in Irish.  A second sub-editor will also be added to the Irish language section during the next few weeks.  The first result of the strengthening of that section has been the introduction of a news broadcast in Irish on Sundays containing world and provincial news and news features.</P>
    <P>Facilities for news collection and preparation in English have been improved by allocating a sub-editor specially to look after provincial news. A notable advance also has been the appointment of a full-time staff reporter in Belfast to augment the news collection arrangements in the Six Counties.  Up to now the broadcasting station has been depending there on local news correspondents engaged for fees on a message basis. They will still continue to be employed.</P>
    <P>The House has already been informed of the purchase of three new transmitters.  The first two transmitters have now been installed and are in operation in Dublin and Cork.  The new high-power transmitter for Athlone has been received but, unfortunately, owing to difficulties experienced by the Commissioners of Public Works in connection with the erection of an extension building for it, the transmitter is not likely to be in operation before the spring of next year.</P>
    <P>As regards the immediate future, no large-scale developments have been planned and the comhairle and director <Col N="425" /> are concentrating on the detailed improvement of the organisation with a view to the production of still better programmes.  The broadcasting day now stretches over a reasonably long period and within the existing studio and office accommodation it is not likely that very much further extension in hours can be made.  A choice between simultaneous programmes has been given to a large section of listeners from time to time by giving separate transmissions from Athlone and from Dublin and Cork, particularly on Sunday afternoons.  This practice will be extended as much as possible.</P>
    <P>I shall finish by making a brief reference to general broadcasting policy. The broadcasting reorganisation which was brought into force on the 1st January, 1953, included the appointment of a comhairle to function under the Minister but without special statutory powers. The Minister remains legally responsible for all broadcasting activities. The Minister announced to the House, however, that he would refrain from interfering in broadcasting matters except where major policy was concerned, and he asked the Deputies, on the other hand, to refrain from raising matters of broadcasting detail in the House.</P>
    <P>Wide financial powers were delegated by the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for the operation of the broadcasting service.  I am informed by the chairman of the comhairle and by the director that these somewhat far-reaching changes have meant an immense improvement, first of all, in the facilities for the staffing and the daily running of the station and, more important still, in the freedom for broadcasters to express opinions on controversial subjects without allegations of Party bias.  These developments appear to me to be on right lines.  As the House will understand, at the same time, I have not yet had an opportunity of making any but the most cursory examination of the broadcasting service and I cannot, therefore, commit myself in any way to expressing an opinion as to whether <Col N="426" /> further changes might be desirable either in detail or in a major way.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the staff of the station, many of them newly recruited, have pulled their weight fully during the year in providing the public with programmes of as high a standard as the talent and resources of the country permit and that the honorary Broadcasting Advisory Committee continued to give valuable advice to the Minister on general broadcasting matters.  I wish to thank all of them for the services they have given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the service of broadcasting is more or less non-political in character I hope that all members will continue to show the same helpful attitude as they showed to me during my period in office, that the Minister will be allowed to proceed with the development of the broadcasting service undeterred by political prejudice.  Indeed, I recall that during the last three years Deputies on both sides of the House showed an extremely co-operative criticism with very, very few exceptions.</P>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity also of congratulating the members of the comhairle of Radio Éireann and the director on the good work they did.  As the Minister has said, under present circumstances Radio Éireann is administered under his authority by a comhairle. There has been a great increase of freedom available to those on the staff in the preparation of programmes and also in the delegation of financial powers.  I hope that the Minister will consider in the future whether the present half-way house of organisation, whereby a council administers Radio Éireann directly under his authority, should not be extended to a full incorporation of Radio Éireann in the form of a statutory service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the principal objectives in any broadcasting organisation is to have various types of staff, staff that can be changed frequently and staff that have a gift for making a perpetual contribution to broadcasting which will form part of a permanent <Col N="427" /> corps for administration, and then persons working on the basis of contract in a purely temporary capacity.  In the case of an organisation like Radio Éireann, as in that of a theatrical production association, an opera company or a newspaper, it is essential to have a wide measure of variation in planning staff.  At the same time, I feel that incorporation is inevitable if the full development of Radio Éireann is to take place.  I feel also that the question of providing some sort of retiring pensions for the permanent members of the staff should engage the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will be able&mdash;I am sure he will be able&mdash;to maintain the political impartiality of Radio Éireann.  During the last three years, the criticisms of the political features of the broadcasts were always very few in number and were gradually becoming less and less as people became accustomed to hear different political views expressed freely over the air.  The Minister will find enthusiasts on both sides of the House detecting bias in a programme where, in fact, no intentional bias occurred.  He will hear criticisms from both sides of the House based on the general concept that 50 per cent. value should be given in any type of political report in respect of each side of the House, but he will find that sometimes a 50 per cent. balance is impossible, and that it generally can be corrected, not in a period of 24 hours or a day, but over a considerable period.  He will find that the news officers are able to provide a political balance.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Minister will go ahead with the second objective in connection with political Party broadcasts, namely, the institution of broadcasts during the autumn and winter months on the same basis, and in the same proportions as far as the Parties are concerned, as we had during the general election, whereby the public can hear over the air a detailed analysis of Government policy and of Opposition policy.  The proposal was that there should be some ten broadcasts between October and March, assuming that no general election intervened, <Col N="428" /> in which the representatives of the Parties would be able to play the same part as they played during the general election.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will examine, as soon as possible, the question as to whether the G.P.O. is a suitable place in which to conduct modern broadcasting.  I think that about 23,000 cubic feet of the G.P.O. building is utilised at the moment for broadcasting.  The Minister will be informed by the staff, and by those in charge of Post Office administration, that for an efficient postal service the whole of the building would eventually be required for the accountancy section of the telephone branch and for the accountancy section of the Post Office Savings Bank.  A site is available for a radio building.  We are the only country in Europe without a modern radio building.  That seems to me to be an inevitable feature of the future, and I should say that the cost in relation to the total capital development of the State, would not be excessive. I think it is inevitable that the Minister would be advised by the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Local Government that a certain amount of unemployment is likely to take place in Dublin from time to time, the relief of which would provide an opportunity for creating certain public amenities such as a radio building and a Post Office sorting office.  The provision of such amenities, which are essential, would play a part in the maintenance of employment in the building world, as well as a much better radio service, since we would then have our own radio station.</P>
    <P>I hope also that the Minister will give attention to the prospects of television which appears to be as inevitable as the motor car.  I think it is true to say that in every small country in Europe, regardless of financial difficulties, some progress is being made in regard to television. The Minister will find available to him a major report on the immediate prospects, and the difficulties of the problems involved in an Irish television service.  Apart from what the critics have to say about its social disadvantages, television would seem <Col N="429" /> to be a source of entertainment and education, and to be also of great value in combating the wave of Anglo-Americanisation which is spreading not only over this country but every country.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will study this most elaborate and painstaking report on the general problem which he will find ready for him.  If he will examine the future of the Radio Éireann organisation, as to whether it can stay in its present state of half-way between proper incorporation and the old system, as well as the project for a radio building, and at his leisure &mdash;not with a view to any immediate change&mdash;the prospects of television, I think he will be rendering a good service to this country in so far as the maintenance and development of our own culture and our own institutions are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year I and many other Deputies when speaking on this Estimate, drew attention to a certain point which we considered needed attention.  It was not, of course, political. It was a problem affecting reception in some of the south and south-west seaboard areas.  I am sorry to have to say that the problem still exists, and so I should like if the Minister would convey the remarks which I have to make to those concerned. Our people in those areas would like to enjoy the programmes from Radio Éireann.  Like Deputy Childers, we are approaching this subject from a completely non-political angle.  I am satisfied that the angle from which we should approach it is the one in which we are all interested, namely, the true nationalistic viewpoint. We want our people to be able to enjoy the programmes from Radio Éireann.  People, I suppose, will never be satisfied with those programmes. No matter how good they may be, you will find the critics and the cranks. As far as I am concerned I believe that the last Minister for Posts and Telegraphs did his utmost as regards broadcasting to improve the standard of the programmes going out on the air for the people of this country.  I <Col N="430" /> believe, and I am convinced that what I say is true, that the present Minister will do his best to see that the programmes going out from Radio Éireann will be good programmes, as good as this country can afford, but in order to enjoy them properly the problem of reception must be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>I was involved perhaps in another little problem last year and I made it clear that I did not wish to have to be involved in any more than was necessary and I am not going to go over it again except to say that I believe it to be my duty to say what I believe to be true.  And I believe it to be true to say that for the past 12 months the announcers of Radio Éireann have in my opinion been of an excellent standard in their speech over the air.  I believe it is only right to compliment them.  As far as I am concerned I believe it is not alone how we here in this country will hear the announcers speaking over Radio Éireann that is important, but how people in other countries will hear them when they switch on a radio and get on to the station without hearing any station announcement naming the station and may not be aware that it is an Irish station or that it was, as it were, the shop window of this little country of ours.  In my opinion the importance attaches to the approach and the tone of the announcers whose voices go out on the air not only to people at home but to people beyond our own country.  That is of importance to us and I would wish to congratulate those who for the last 12 months have given to the people the news and the announcements over the radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would say to the Minister that there was one point I hoped I would hear from him.  I appreciate, of course, that he is, as it were, barely inside the door of his office, but I would like to know what is happening as regards a suggestion I made last year.  Again, I believe that when the Minister at that time replied to the debate he made it clear that he was interested, and so was the Director of Broadcasting but so far we have heard nothing about the possibility in a Christian, Catholic country of getting <Col N="431" /> the family Rosary broadcast over Radio Éireann at night.  We are at a stage at the present time when we can hear from the B.B.C. and the continental and American stations nothing but materialistic conceptions and news bulletins containing nothing but reports of hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs.</P>
    <P>Cannot we, because we are related so much to a history of which we are proud, give something to these countries?  Why can we not, while they are speaking of war, speak of peace? Is there any way we can do it more efficiently and more satisfactorily than by starting in this particular year to broadcast a family Rosary?  Let it be the big family of this country of ours and let those in England, America and elsewhere know that while we here may differ politically, thanks be to God, fundamentally we can, instead of talking about war, show that it is more important to try to bring about peace. Let us give that contribution to those countries which this country is entitled to give and which it should give.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that there is a new school of music built in Cork and that it is proposed to have a new broadcasting station in connection with that school of music.  I was one of the Deputies who approached the Minister's predecessor some time ago with a view to getting an orchestra in Cork, and the Minister might notice that there are three Cork City Deputies all very interested in the matter and we did impress on the Minister's predecessor the need for an orchestra and we came away very hopeful and without any doubts that in the near future we would get an orchestra in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I am informed that there was actually a studio orchestra in Cork from 1927 to 1930 and that the Cork station provided Sunday night broadcasts for Radio Éireann at that time. Not only was this orchestra the same size as the Dublin studio orchestra but every six weeks or so a full orchestra of about 40 players was engaged for the presentation of a symphony concert in Cork.  We believe, <Col N="432" /> with all this talk about decentralisation that we hear from year to year, that a good start could be made by transferring the light orchestra to Cork and it would be very much welcomed by the music-loving people in Cork.  It would be a great help&mdash;I understand from those people&mdash;towards improving production of grand opera in the city as I believe that this light orchestra could be used in connection with it.  We have had several very good attempts with local companies in Cork to start grand opera but they are always handicapped by the fact that they could not get a local amateur orchestra up to the standard that was necessary to produce those operas.</P>
    <P>From what I know of the present Minister, I believe that it will not be his fault if anything is done to interfere with the hopes of his predecessor, and I am sure that, as a Munster man, he will be anxious to decentralise as much as possible in his Department, and that he will help to decentralise in other Departments as well.</P>
    <P>I was not here last week, but I was very glad to read in the papers the fine tribute he paid to the former Minister, and that is only what I would expect from the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  While I know him&mdash;and that is for a very long time&mdash;he has always acted fairly and justly as far as it lay within his own power.  So I would ask him to make every effort to insist that we get the light orchestra in Cork in connection with the broadcasting station which was going to be instituted in connection with the new school of music.  I understand it was hoped to have this functioning in the autumn of next year, and on behalf of the people of Cork, I would strongly appeal to the Minister to do everything in his power to bring this about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few observations to the Minister, and to offer a few suggestions, with the object of securing an improvement in certain broadcasting features.  The Minister expressed pleasure that broadcasts of traditional music were being continued.  Generally speaking, they have been a source of pleasure to me, and I am sure to the whole country, too, but some of these broadcasts <Col N="433" /> do not contribute very much to the pleasure of listeners.  Some of the instrumentalists or groups who broadcast traditional music produce rasping and discordant sounds.  In my opinion, many of them do not know the true airs of the tunes they are playing.  I think more care should be taken so that when anybody offers to broadcast traditional music, the director or the officials of the broadcasting station would make sure that he is able to play it properly.  I would suggest also to the Minister, that there should be more outside broadcasts, that the microphone should be taken into the theatres and concert halls in Dublin and throughout the country, so as to give the Irish people an opportunity of hearing what is going on in our theatres and concert halls.</P>
      <P>I do not know very much about television, beyond what I have heard from friends of mine in England and in America.  Some of them look upon this country as a place of refuge in this world of television.  They consider that American social life has been changed, and not for the better, by television.  They tell me that if you go into a saloon for a drink the barman will &ldquo;shush&rdquo; you, pointing out that there is something on in the way of a game of baseball, or some speaker whom he may want to hear, and you are not welcome in the saloon at all. I just want to mention that matter so that when the Minister has the report in his hands, he will consider all these factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not as yet used to the rules of this House, but I would ask you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to bear with me while I pay a compliment to the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. I was in this House when the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs brought in his Estimate and I was impressed by the businesslike manner in which Deputy Childers dealt with it.  I was impressed also with his opening statement when he said that the Minister is only doing now what he or anybody else would do if he were taking over the Department in the same circumstances.  I hope that his Party will follow his example.  It was a gentlemanly and a sporting <Col N="434" /> gesture and I wish in my maiden speech in this House to compliment him on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a pleasure to listen to my namesake, Deputy Lynch, paying a well deserved compliment to Deputy Childers for the manner in which he administered his Department and, in particular, the broadcasting services side of the Department.  I think the whole country has already acclaimed, and has been doing so for almost two years, the improvement that has taken place in wireless broadcasting in this country.  I think the former Minister can claim a large share of credit for that.  It would be wrong, of course, to give him all the credit because the comhairle which was set up, either during or before his time, can also claim much of the credit for the improvement to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>I believe that, with the new Minister, that improvement is bound to continue. We are certain here on this side of the House that he will bring to bear on the problems that will present themselves to him, as Minister responsible for broadcasting, a very fair-minded outlook, and that the good reputation that the broadcasting service has from a political point of view in this House will be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had also intended to deal with the subject to which Deputy McGrath addressed himself, namely the establishment of a light radio orchestra in Cork. Deputy McGrath did not fully state the case when he mentioned that the former Minister had given every encouragement to the deputation from Cork that met him during his term of office.  The fact was that he went further, and that, at the opening of the International Choral Festival in the City Hall, before ever a general election was mooted, he announced that it was decided in principle to provide an orchestra in Cork, or, at least, the nucleus of an orchestra around which a full orchestra could be built, to serve permanently the radio station which is being built in Cork.  I feel certain that the present Minister will not do anything to interfere with the plan to that end, and that with the provision of that alternative broadcasting station and <Col N="435" /> that alternative orchestra, the standard of broadcasting will be further improved.</P>
    <P>I want to make only a few remarks with regard to the general programme of Radio Éireann.  I agree with Deputy Desmond that the standard of the announcers in the past couple of years has improved tremendously.  It is seldom now that we experience the jarring notes or the jarring tones we heard in former years from radio announcers in this country.  The introduction of special features for particular periods of the year has also found many new listeners throughout the country, but I would suggest that, in some cases at least, these features are being retained rather too long and that the retention of them tends to make people tired of them rather than win increased listener support.  I believe that in the case of the most popular features, a shortening of the engagements will tend to increase support for them and to increase interest among the people who listen only casually to them.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I need say because I know the Minister has not had, as yet, a full opportunity of examining the administration of this particular branch of his Department. I shall conclude, as the former Minister concluded on the main Estimate, by wishing the Minister well in his new office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with both Deputies Lynch in the tribute paid to the outgoing Minister.  I think we are all agreed that the standard reached by Radio Éireann during his administration was very satisfactory. The new Minister has a difficult task to maintain that high standard, but I hope that, if possible, he will improve it.  The emphasis in our broadcasting should be on quality.  I hope the Minister will resist any pressure that is brought to bear on him to lower the standard of our broadcasting.  Talks, discussions, the drama and, particularly, music, reached a very satisfactory and good standard in the last two or three years and we all hope to see that continued.  In a small country like this quality should be the important <Col N="436" /> thing in a broadcasting service.</P>
      <P>I would like to have had more good music from Radio Éireann, but I am grateful for what we had for the last few years.  I regret the very low quality, bad quality, of the music sent out on the sponsored programmes.  I would give it as a businesslike tip to those sponsors that they might find that the broadcasting of good music would pay dividends.</P>
      <P>The symphony orchestra progressed very satisfactorily and here, I think, the Minister must resist pressures that will be brought to bear upon him. Undoubtedly, we will have to import, for the present and the near future, foreign musicians.  It is very important that a high standard has been set; that it is very desirable but it is nationally important that it should continue in future.  It is our hope, of course, that Irish musicians will be available to take the place of any foreigners now employed, but let us make sure that whatever music is sent out is of a very high standard and very well played.</P>
      <P>The provincial broadcasts by Radio Éireann Orchestra were a very useful development.  Wherever the orchestra went it stirred up a musical activity that was of great benefit.  One aspect of that in Cork, and I think in Limerick also, that was very valuable, was the children's concert.  That did more good than we in this House can now measure.  All the pleasure that an adult gets out of listening to good music is nothing compared with the marvellous opening up of a new world to the child when he first hears good music.</P>
      <P>With regard to the projected orchestra in Cork, I hope the Minister will be very co-operative.  It is a development that will cost nothing and I think the only snag in the way now is the provision of guarantors for the concerts that would be arranged by that orchestra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another item to which I would like to refer is the publication of programmes. The current publication of an item in the daily newspapers is <Col N="437" /> practically useless.  We will have to get something a little more detailed.  If I want to find out now if there is some piece of music being broadcast to-night by Radio Éireann to which I would like to listen I do not get that information from the newspapers; I do not get it anywhere.  I am not sure how far the director has gone with the development of the idea of publishing a journal but, if that is too ambitious, something in the nature of a typewritten duplicated sheet should be made available to listeners.  It could be done on a subscription basis and posted to listeners for 5/- or 6/- a year, just to cover the cost of postage.  It would be a good thing to do.</P>
    <P>The detection of radio interference is very unsatisfactory.  I do not want to mention details but I have knowledge of cases where the machinery that exists for tracking down interference caused by household appliances, and that kind of thing, has been, at the very best, inefficient.</P>
    <P>We have been very pleased with what Radio Éireann has done for the last two years.  I hope it will continue. I hope the Minister will insist on quality being the keynote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The influence of the radio on both domestic and general life in a nation is growing so important that any time that is devoted by this House to a discussion of its development and of the programmes is very usefully employed.  Even though from time to time there have been controversies about features of various kinds, as there always will be, the development of the radio programmes in the past few years has given general satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must make some reference to the attention which the previous Minister gave to the general development and the standard of our radio programmes and to the success that he in great measure achieved.  It was with much pleasure that I heard the Minister this afternoon giving an account of the policy which he intended to continue and pursue and develop in the course <Col N="438" /> of his Ministry and his authority over that particular Department.</P>
    <P>This country has been referred to as a small country.  Let us remember that there are countries in Europe which we do not call small countries, the area of which is no bigger than the province of Munster or any other Irish province and whose development in these matters is based principally on their history and their national life and economic development.  When we are catering for our people we should base our programmes on our history and on our national effort and endeavour in a great measure while not excluding many features from the music and history of other lands which would serve as encouragement and enlightenment to us.  There must be a blending, because music and everything associated with it have an international flavour.  At the same time, we must not forget that we have national music and a history which should be an inspiration to the rising generation.</P>
    <P>Owing to the influence of the cinema and radio our people perhaps become too absorbed in international matters and pay too little attention to what is fundamental in their own civilisation. I was very glad, therefore, to hear the Minister this evening speak of the development as far as the national language is concerned.  The national language, national music, and national games all pertain to our own land.  It is a pleasure to see the development of the Irish language in town and country over the past few years and to praise the effort of those who organise feiseanna, choral festivals of various kinds and school concerts in order to try to bring about a national development in the rising generation which will preserve the things that are best in their own nation.  It is a delight to go into the City Hall in Cork when the schools programme is on, to hear the children talking Irish, singing songs in their own language, and all the rest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony Barry referred to the concerts by Radio Éireann Orchestra for school and college children. One of the best features of that is that Professor Fleischman, who has done so much for music in Cork City and district and in the university <Col N="439" /> itself, is able to go there and explain in the Irish language the various features of the items which are being played by the Radio Éireann Orchestra.  He brings into it something native and fundamental when he is able to explain to the children in the Irish language the various features of the pieces which the orchestra is playing.  It is a delight indeed to have these orchestral performances in the various cities.  It may be looked upon as a loss sometimes because it takes time to build up a taste for the type of music they sometimes play, but the volume of support is growing and as the years advance it will grow more and more and the concerts will have a very excellent effect on the local people and on their taste for music if they are continued.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to say much about the development in Cork which in future will extend I am sure to other cities, the principal cities at any rate.  The incorporation of a broadcasting station in the new school of music is a development which is most desirable.  Until the new school is built, to prepare for the day of its opening and for the development which will come subsequently local effort must be stimulated, but it must also get some help from the central body who control Radio Éireann, because the people all over the nation pay their fees for wireless licences and, just as in any other walk of life, they look for a fair distribution and all the talent that they get together will serve to promote musical appreciation.  That is being met in some measure by the tours of the Radio Éireann Orchestra.  But there must be something more permanent if we are to have local radio stations and alternative programmes.  We must have locally the nucleus at least of an orchestra encouraged by local development which will give that alternative programme.</P>
    <P>Travelling around the country is very expensive and contributions can be made to the development of the musical tastes of the people and the variations required in that regard by having those local orchestras and by <Col N="440" /> seeing that they will not only serve their own particular areas but the surrounding districts and the other cities until orchestras can be built up in those cities to give these concerts, with variations by visiting orchestras.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with Deputy Barry in what he said with regard to a matter I mentioned here before on more than one occasion and that is the sponsored programmes.  They are appealing to the Irish people to buy Irish products in many cases, but they are doing it through the medium of the vilest foreign music they can collect. The whole thing is out of place.  If they are appealing to the Irish people to support Irish manufactured goods, at least they should take more cognisance of what Ireland has produced in the past and what she has preserved and use what has been preserved for the entertainment of the Irish people.  I would not listen to these sponsored programmes and I am sore other people would not listen to them because the standard of music, if it can be called such, does not and should not appeal to the native tastes in this country.</P>
    <P>We have complaints sometimes that the rising generation do not know enough about our own history, that stress is laid on what is happening the world over.  The newspapers feature wars and rumours of war, and the less desirable features of what is happening abroad.  I think that Radio Éireann should have some feature such as used to appear in one of our papers under &ldquo;This Happened To-day,&rdquo; and give some kind of outstanding event in our history daily or weekly for quarter of an hour.  I appreciate very much the plays, operas and operettas based on features of our history and phases of our national culture.  They are very excellent and will be improved as the years go by.</P>
    <P>I would say about the Irish language &mdash;I am sure the Minister and his officials will take notice of it&mdash;that until our people get a better knowledge of the language it is more desirable to have short features whether for the children or for adults, varied but short and inspiring.  They should be brief and make one point, so to speak, of some <Col N="441" /> kind or another, and that should be stressed.  In that way, the radio will help to develop our national life, and when the people tune in to our radio they will know that it is the national radio and that it features Irish life and intends to train our people, as far as possible, in the highest features of our culture and national development which have come down to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely disagree with the last speaker who introduced the only jarring note into the discussion. He has complained about the sponsored programmes.  I think these programmes are splendid.  They go out of their way to cater for all classes. They are presented by trained people, and you will find that people listen-in specially to these sponsored programmes because they know they will get a good selection.  The Deputy has been a bit harsh on those responsible for trying to cater for all tastes.  All the people have not the same tastes, and by listening-in to these programmes they get a fairly good selection. They can be improved, of course, and I should like to see them improved, but I feel that the sponsored programmes are giving us of the very best and that they are catering for different types of people.  As we have not all got the same tastes, they have a difficult job.</P>
      <P>I rose to repeat a statement which I have made on previous occasions. The phrase &ldquo;Radio Éireann&rdquo; does not convey very much to people outside our own country and I would ask my colleagues to support me in asking for &ldquo;Ireland Calling.&rdquo; That would claim the title &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; for this country and would emphasise that claim to the world.  A lot of money was spent, long before new boards came into being for tourist development, to advertise the word &ldquo;Ireland,&rdquo; yet we have been changing the name, using Saorstát Éireann, Radio Éireann and Irish Free State.  I earnestly hope the day will come when we will again claim the right to the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; and use the phrase &ldquo;Ireland Calling.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Seosamh Ó Cinnéide Seosamh Ó Cinnéide">
      <NameTxt>Seosamh Ó Cinnéide</NameTxt>
      <P>Tuigeann gach duine agus gach tír an focal &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; ar fuid an domhain.  Tá cúpla rud le plé <Col N="442" /> agam sa cheist seo an craobacháin.  I want to advocate two things in connection with broadcasting.  On national occasions like St. Patrick's Day and Easter Week, we should get the full orchestra of Radio Éireann, augmented if necessary.  We should also have&mdash; as was attempted once before&mdash;massed choirs to broadcast, with the full orchestra, the national airs, properly arranged.  We give a very wrong impression to the outside world by having the unaccompanied song which is a relic of the Penal Days.  We give the impression that when we had full civilisation here there was no such thing as the harp or other instruments. The sooner Radio Éireann helps in getting away from the caoineadh of the Penal Days the better.</P>
      <P>At one particular time we had a Scotch half-hour.  My colleague, the former Minister, has told me that Scotch music is now included with the music of the world, which is given at a particular time in the broadcasts.  In this debate, when a former Minister was in charge, I said it was a great help to us to have the Scotch half-hour because the Scotch ceilidhe band, to my mind, is about 50 years ahead of what we get in Ireland.  Their timing and everything else is perfect.</P>
      <P>I advocated a Welsh half-hour.  That would do immense good in this country in improving our choirs and our taste for music, showing what could be done in choral singing.</P>
      <P>I would place before the Minister a plea that on occasions like St. Patrick's Day, Easter Week and Christmas, we should have the co-operation of people like the Keating Branch of the Gaelic League and other musical societies and the full orchestra of Radio Éireann, showing the world our achievements and our possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree at all with Deputy MacCarthy's point about sponsored programmes.  I am not completely in agreement with the sponsored programmes offered, they are not completely to my own taste; but we must remember that those who purchase radios and subscribe for licences have a say in regard to the programmes. Whether it is a matter for regret or otherwise, a large percentage <Col N="443" /> of our people have shown in no uncertain way that they are in favour of the sponsored programmes.  As long as this is a democracy, we must cater for the taste of the people in it.  Every effort must be made to cultivate a taste for the best music, but there is no use in suggesting we should utilise all the available time catering for those gentlemen who can afford to sit down with a cigar between their teeth for half the evening to listen to Beethoven. Many of the people who listen are workers who do so between 1.30 and 3. Many of them have to work for their living in factories and other places, and like light music during this break.</P>
      <P>The modern trend is such that light music is all the fashion.  That has come about mainly as a result of machinery and such forms of development.  If a person is used to a type of work in a factory, that conditions that person's mind to some extent afterwards and the type of music listened to will have something in common with the work. We cannot put the clock back.  If we do not give them that music during the sponsored programme period, they will get it elsewhere.  At night it is quite easy to switch to Luxembourg and get that light music or the jazz that some Deputies seem to dislike intensely.</P>
      <P>One of the worst ways to go about educating the people into listening to good music is to try to ram it down their throats.  Anything we try to do by compulsion has always failed.  The sooner we make up our minds that compulsion is not the way to bring culture into the hearts and minds of the people, the better.  One of the factors that has held up the revival of the Irish language and cultural pursuits is compulsion.  I do not want to see the entire programme of Radio Éireann taken up with the more cultured aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne made a plea here which, I think, some people in the House were inclined to sneer at&mdash;that we should change the phrase &ldquo;Radio Éireann&rdquo; and use &ldquo;Ireland Calling&rdquo;. That is not such a silly suggestion, although Deputy Kennedy remarked in Irish that everyone in the world knew what Radio Éireann meant.  I guarantee <Col N="444" /> that you will not have far to go outside the country to find people who have never even heard of it.  We are inclined to think too much of ourselves and give the impression that the whole world has its eyes fixed on us all the time.  We should disillusion ourselves on that point.  From my knowledge of people, I would say that &ldquo;Erin&rdquo; is not understood in foreign countries except by a limited few.  In the case of the ordinary person just listening in and catching the words &ldquo;Radio Éireann&rdquo;, the words mean nothing to him.  From that point of view the suggestion of Deputy Alfred Byrne is worth considering, and it might be quite feasible to adopt it at certain times.</P>
    <P>There is a point I mentioned last year to the former Minister.  I made it my business since then to keep in touch with the news programmes. Some Deputies will not agree with me. I believe that the presentation of the news here is very similar to that on the B.B.C.  After hearing the B.B.C. I have often listened in to Radio Éireann and they have dealt with certain events&mdash;I will not say it was given word for word according to the British line, but the slant was there, the slant was exactly the same as given by the B.B.C.  The former Minister did not agree with me on that.  He was in a better position to know, as he had the advice of his experts, but I have knowledge also because I have listened specially to the news to compare the two broadcasts.  If we are to hear broadcasts dealing with conditions in Africa, talks about the Mau Mau, the war in Indo-China or other events of world importance, I want to see the presentation of that news given in a neutral manner by our radio and not given along the line that is handed across to the British public.  Surely it would not be very much for Radio Éireann to do that&mdash;unless they are actually going to take their news from the British sources exactly as they hear it.</P>
    <P>I would also pay a tribute to the former Minister for the great improvement that took place in wireless broadcasting. It is not perfect and it never will be.  Radio Éireann has to cater <Col N="445" /> in the educational sphere and also has to give amusement and pleasure.  It has to cater for so many tastes that the old phrase occurs to me: &ldquo;Where you try to satisfy everyone, you end up by satisfying nobody.&rdquo; Radio Éireann has tried to satisfy as many people as possible and has tried to cater for as many tastes as possible.  It has done a very good job as far as it could and as far as the funds allowed it to do so.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope the present Minister will continue with the good work.  Knowing him as I do, and knowing the work he did when he was formerly a Minister in the previous inter-Party Government, I am sure he will put the same energy and enthusiasm into his work in this new Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to wish the Minister&mdash;he being a Limerick man like myself&mdash;the best of luck in his new office.  I would draw his attention to the racing results from Radio Éireann, that we do not get the S.P. figures of Irish racing.  I would like this given in the first and last news. I would also like the Minister to consider including the English racing results, together with the S.P. figures for them.  These things are features of our life&mdash;football pools, racing and matters like that&mdash;and it is of the highest interest to know, particularly if we have an each-way treble, what the odds are on a certain horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an anti-climax, I would ask the Minister to consider the question mentioned by Deputy MacCarthy, a programme, &ldquo;This Happened To-day&rdquo; or &ldquo;This Happened This Week&rdquo;.  I would like a programme for schools, or, at least, given at a time when school children could listen, dealing with the period 1916 to 1921.  There would be nothing controversial in that &mdash;I stop at 1921.  Nowadays the children&mdash;and even the people of 19, 20, 25 and 35&mdash;are more conversant with the life of film stars than with Pearse, Connolly or McDermott.  They are totally ignorant of what happened in that period.  It is all very well for Deputy Kennedy and others to talk about national culture and music.  We should have a national knowledge first <Col N="446" /> of all&mdash;which is sadly lacking in the younger people.  They talk about people coming into Ireland.  The Minister must agree that he himself has often heard strangers comment on the fact that they have discussed certain aspects of Irish history with members of the younger generation and have been appalled at their lack of knowledge.</P>
    <P>Regarding the suggestion by Deputy Byrne, to use the phrase &ldquo;Ireland Calling&rdquo;, that is reminiscent of another station in the recent past.  I agree in principle with the suggestion that the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; should be used at certain specific times, as Deputy McQuillan mentioned.  However, is it necessary until such time as we obtain the short-wave station? Until then it would be completely superfluous.  Finally, I again wish the Minister the best of luck in his new office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to say how appreciative I am of the discussion that has taken place upon the Estimate.  There was a very generous contribution from all sides of the House in a sincere effort to build up and to improve the service.  That discussion has been, and will be, very helpful to me in guiding the steps I take in trying to maintain the present standard and improve on it.  I have been very new to the job, and yet I have been able to see there is a good standard at present in Irish broadcasting. These suggestions which have been coming from various parts of the country, and various parts of the House, will be helpful to me in my discussions with the director in trying to improve the standard and make it as high as we can possibly afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the points raised, I may say our programme is a wholesome programme and in its efficiency it can hold its own against the bigger stations of other countries.  In material it is a wholesome programme for the Irish people and has no comparison.  I am glad to find that that has been appreciated in the national inquiry conducted recently by the director, when we found the Irish people responding in great measure and appreciating <Col N="447" /> the Irish programme as against any programme outside.  That speaks for itself, for the wholesomeness of our programme and the wholesomeness of our listeners.  I shall strive to continue on those lines and try to improve it and to give effect to some of the suggestions made this evening.</P>
    <P>First of all, I think there is no question about the unsuitability of the building.  It has been agreed for many years that the G.P.O. is not a suitable broadcasting premises.  There is the question of getting a suitable site, getting the money, and so on.  The outgoing Minister, Deputy Childers, has been giving this his attention.  There was a site already in contemplation, but obstacles came in the way and it was through no fault of Deputy Childers that we have not a new broadcasting station now.  That does not obviate the necessity.  There are problems that must be faced and overcome. We need a broadcasting station, as the G.P.O. is, in the experts' opinion, quite unsuitable.</P>
    <P>If and when we come to build that station, having got the necessary finance and having got over other difficulties inherent in that question, we will have to give some thought also to television&mdash;I did not speak about it to-day&mdash;and include that in the Estimate. We cannot ignore the fact that television will come.  Personally, I am not inclined to make speed or hurry with it, as I believe we can get on without it at present and there are other and more necessary things than television.  We can drag on without it for another while, but we cannot ignore the fact that it will come.  If and when we are building a broadcasting station, we will have to make provision for a television station also.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath raised the question of the Cork station.  I have been interested in Cork as Deputy McGrath well knows and I raised a question, when Deputy Childers was Minister, as to why more use was not being made of Cork.  As we in Limerick had nothing nearer than Cork to us, I was anxious to have greater use made of the Cork station and short as I have <Col N="448" /> been in office I have discussed the wider use of this station.</P>
    <P>The question of the orchestra came up for consideration as well.  The question of the orchestra is a difficult one.  There are several angles to it that must be faced.  There are questions of standard, quality and availability of suitable persons for positions. We have two orchestras, the Radio Orchestra and the Light Orchestra.  They have reached high standards and if you are to have a third orchestra you must have a standard equal to that which we have already established.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch mentioned that traditional music was not at all times up to standard.  That matter received attention before this.  A new official is about to be appointed whose special responsibility it will be to get traditional music and prepare it. The matter is having attention.  We want to have the best form of traditional music that can be had.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry spoke about a radio journal.  Efforts were made in the past to establish a radio journal but without success.  It is a matter of considerable technical difficulty.  There is also a possibility of financial loss, but the matter is not being lost sight of.  It will continue to receive examination with a view to seeing if we can have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch referred to the question of programmes being rested.  They have to be rested from time to time. Obviously, to keep putting the same programme on would result in the programme becoming stale and drab. You have got to take them off for a <Col N="449" /> while.  That had to be done with Question Time, which had to get a rest; otherwise it would have become stale.  You have got to rest the programmes from time to time, and that is being done.</P>
    <P>The question of sponsored programmes was raised by one or two speakers.  Sponsored programme agents have already been in consultation with the director with a view to making an improvement in the programme.  They are prepared to step up the programmes and do whatever is necessary to improve the tone and standard of these sponsored programmes.  The agents promoting these broadcasts have met the Director of Broadcasting and discussed the matter with him.  They are prepared to do what they can to improve still further the sponsored programmes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy spoke about St. Patrick's Day.  We do have massed orchestras and choirs on St. Patrick's Day.  That is fairly well known.  We have orchestral choirs and programmes of a national character suitable for that day.  The question of Scotch and Welsh half hours is a new suggestion to which I will draw the director's attention at the first opportunity.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to the news presentation from outside.  That is taken from both American and British agencies and everything possible is done to avoid any particular slant.  We have to take world news from the world agencies, condense it and try to give it a fair and unbiased presentation.  Everything is done to avoid any particular slant on it.</P>

Needless to say, that will continue <Col N="450" /> to be the aim and objective.  The director and the comhairle have given very valuable service in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell) Patrick O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,128,910 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including grants to local authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing and miscellaneous grants.</P>
      <P>The net amount provided for 1954-55 in the Vote for Local Government as published is £4,925,590.  This represents a net increase of £334,300 over the amount provided in the Department's Vote for 1953-54, and in the Vote of that year for increases in remuneration so far as the Department of Local Government was concerned.  In his Budget Speech, however, the former Minister for Finance intimated that the provision of £400,000 in sub-head Q would be transferred from the Estimates to the National Development Fund and, taking this into account, the net Estimate for the Department this year shows a saving of £65,700 as compared with the net figure for the previous year.  Increases in individual items are mainly referable to the automatic growth of the statutory subsidies of local authorities' loan charges, offset to some extent by a reduction in the Transition Development Fund grants to local authorities for housing schemes and sanitary services works, this fund being still in course of liquidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances in which this Estimate was prepared, and in the circumstances in which it is now being presented, I propose not to extend my <Col N="451" /> speech beyond a factual review of the main services for which the Estimate provides.</P>
    <P>By far the greatest item is the provision of £2,000,000 under sub-head I (3) in respect of grants to private persons, public utility societies and other authorities for the erection or reconstruction of houses for occupation by private persons.  This amount is the same as that provided for the same services in the preceding year, and, to judge by the general trend of monthly payments in course of disbursement in the months since the beginning of the present financial year, it will be fully expended.</P>
    <P>In the last financial year, 5,643 dwellings were completed by local authorities as against 7,476 in 1952-53; 7,195 in 1951-52; and 7,787 in 1950-51. The figures for dwellings in progress on 1st April, 1954, 1953, 1952 and 1951 are 6,416, 6,005, 9,526 and 10,222 respectively. The dwellings in course of construction in Dublin City together with those for which tenders were being invited on the 1st April, 1954, were 2,984 as against 3,173 in the preceding year.</P>
    <P>I propose, with the assistance of my Parliamentary Secretary, to take every possible step to encourage the planning and construction of working class houses by the Dublin Corporation and also in Cork City where the housing programme is equally urgent. Apart from the special magnitude of these two city programmes and the need for removing as soon as possible any obstacles in the way of their speedy execution, I recognise that some of the decline in local authority housing output in other parts of the country is due to the completion of their housing programmes by some of the urban authorities and the approaching completion of the programmes in various county areas. There are, however, some areas where the needs are still far from being met and where, I am informed, there does not appear to be a sufficient realisation of the necessity for a more efficient and progressive tackling of the problem.  A few counties are, I gather, in a rather unenviable limelight in this respect.  We propose to give these <Col N="452" /> areas special attention and, in doing so, we bespeak the co-operation of the local public representatives and of all others concerned.</P>
    <P>Taking the over-all picture of housing output by both local authorities and private persons, the total number of new dwellings erected in 1953-54 were 10,750; in 1952-53, 13,291; in 1951-52, 12,416, and in 1950-51, 12,118.</P>
    <P>One provision in the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1952, which was very welcome to me was that enabling a new type of grant to be made for the provision and installation of private water supply and sewerage facilities in dwelling houses.  I understand that the number of grants allocated for the purpose over the past year has averaged about 44 per month.  So far as I can stimulate activity under this head, I shall be very glad to do so.  I propose to issue a special instruction to my housing inspectors that when they are consulted by persons in rural areas about to build or reconstruct houses, they should if at all possible make provision for the installation of sanitation which would qualify for these extra grants.</P>
    <P>My predecessor allocated the bulk of the Road Fund income likely to be available in the present financial year in the same way as he had allocated it in the previous financial year, namely, £1,400,000 as a main road improvement grant; £1,700,000 as a county road improvement grant, £100,000 in grants for the reconstruction of certain important bridges, and a main road up-keep grant of 40 per cent. of the expenditure under that head by county councils.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K contains a provision of £400,000 for grants to local authorities for the execution of works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949.</P>
    <P>In the last financial year, work was commenced on 48 waterworks and sewerage schemes, while 61 schemes were completed.  The schemes in progress in March last are estimated to involve a total cost of £2,688,895 as compared with £2,595,550 in March, 1953.  The portion of the North Dublin drainage scheme, comprising the laying of the intercepting sewer between <Col N="453" /> Finglas and Raheny, is almost complete. Considerable progress was made during the year on the detailed planning of the second section from Raheny to the proposed outfall at Howth.  Work commenced last September on the construction of the foundation for the 60&rdquo; pressure culvert on the foreshore at Sutton.  The acceptance of tenders for certain sections of the culvert have been approved in the meantime, as have draft contract documents for the Howth tunnel.</P>
    <P>Work is now well advanced on the North Dublin regional water supply scheme.</P>
    <P>Approval has issued to the acceptance of tenders for Dún Laoghaire main drainage scheme.  Proposals for the acceptance of tenders for sections of a joint drainage scheme being promoted by the Dublin County Council and the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation to serve the Foxrock-Killiney district are under examination.</P>
    <P>Other important sanitary services schemes now being proceeded with include two contracts for the Kildare regional water supply, schemes 2 and 3.</P>
    <P>An issue of £5,000,000 Dublin Corporation 4½ per cent. stock at 97, underwritten jointly by the Minister for Finance and the banks, is at present in course of flotation.</P>
    <P>The net indebtedness of local authorities increased in 1953-54 by about £9,000,000, and at the end of that year stood at £93,152,807.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question last week, I stated that I was satisfied that there is a need for a more accurate compilation of the Register of Electors.  Omission and mistakes cannot be rectified unless we get specific information about them.  I wish, therefore, to bespeak all possible publicity for my appeal to public representatives and to the electorate generally for definite evidence of particular inaccuracies or omissions where they have occurred.  It is of manifest importance that these should be rectified before the local elections, which are due to be held next year.</P>
    <P>There will, I am sure, be other opportunities during the year for debates on various aspects of local <Col N="454" /> government law and administration.  I do not, therefore, propose to protract my speech on the Estimates by any more detailed review at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the benefit of listening to the Minister, but unfortunately I have not the same knowledge of the administration of the Department of Local Government as Deputy Smith has.  However, there are a few matters to which I would like to refer with regard not only to the subject matter of the Minister's statement but to a few other small matters concerning the administration of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to local authority housing, the figures for the current year do indicate a slight falling off in the number of houses built by local authorities.  That, I think, has been pointed out before as being due largely if not mainly to the fact that almost half of the local authorities throughout the whole country have now reached or almost reached their building target.  The Minister, however, saw fit to refer in particular to the difficulties that face the local authorities of Cork and Dublin county boroughs.  It is unfortunately true that the same satisfactory position as applies to many of the local authorities who are near completion do not apply to either Cork or Dublin.  I know more about Cork than I do about Dublin, and I urge on the Minister in so far as it lies in his power to expedite the completion of the Cork local authority housing programme.  I am sure he will do so.  His predecessor on meeting a deputation representative of the entire Cork Corporation and its senior officials indicated clearly that the provision of money for the solution of this problem in Cork was to be no bar to the progress made by the local authority's staff.  I am sure <Col N="455" /> the same will apply to the views of the present Minister for Local Government. Unfortunately, there are, I am sure, somewhere approaching 4,000 families in Cork in dire need of housing accommodation.  The tempo of construction has been accelerated in recent years but unfortunately it lags far behind the demand.  I think that each Deputy for Cork and each public representative in Cork will bear me out when I say that of every ten people who come for advice or assistance in a public capacity of one kind or another seven are people looking for houses.  That in itself is sufficient indication of the big problem that there is before the local authority in Cork.</P>
    <P>I am sure the same applies, possibly more so, in Dublin; but the solution of the problem there was largely retarded by the delay in carrying out the big main drainage scheme which, happily, has been overcome I am sure that the solution of the Dublin problem will be expedited, as well as that in Cork.</P>
    <P>There is one peculiar aspect of the acceleration of local housing demands. I came across it in a country town very recently.  During the period of the last inter-Party Government, the tempo of construction in this town was accelerated to such an extent that numerous skilled and unskilled workers had to be imported from outside the area.  Ultimately, they got married in the town or they brought their families with them, and by the time most of these houses were built, those who were engaged in their construction were the people who took up residence in them, so that the housing problem in the town was not solved&mdash;on the contrary, it was made more acute.  The slum clearance problem in that town was not solved, either, because there were not sufficient houses then available for the people living in these unhealthy dwellings. That was a peculiar aspect of the housing problem that presented itself to me only in the last year.  I am sure it is one to which the Minister will have regard, but I ask him, on the other hand, not to let it weigh too heavily against his administration in regard to <Col N="456" /> the main problems in Cork and Dublin.</P>
    <P>With regard to private house building, there is only one point I want to bring to the Minister's attention. Everybody appreciates the job that is being done by private builders&mdash;&ldquo;spec&rdquo; builders, as they are often called&mdash;in providing a solution of the housing problem by building houses on the basis of a small deposit and comparatively low weekly outgoings.  In Cork, we have a particular problem&mdash;I do not know whether it applies to other parts of the country&mdash;in that, when a housing site is taken over by a builder, purchased or leased from a landowner, and houses built, after some negotiation, I take it, with the town planning authority, in too many cases the road leading into the scheme or park is left for many years after in a very unsatisfactory condition.  The local authority disclaim any responsibility for it.  The builder himself is not liable for the proper construction and maintenance of the road and the landowner, the ground landlord, disclaims responsibility, too, with the result that the tenants in most cases are the sufferers.  I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to that problem and if, by ordinance, by decree or even by legislation, a solution can be provided, I urge him not to hesitate to resort to it.</P>
    <P>Another matter&mdash;it is very difficult at times to know whether it comes within the purview of the Minister or that of his colleague, the Minister for Justice&mdash;is the question of road safety. The time, fortunately, has come when there is a more progressive and enlightened outlook amongst those responsible for constructing and maintaining roads.  They are building them wider and eliminating dangerous corners, and, from the economic point of view, too, a very welcome new development is the laying of a proper foundation for these roads which will obviate the necessity for too frequent repairing.  As these roads are being straightened and widened, the danger to cyclists, in particular, increases.</P>
    <P>Everybody who has the experience of driving cars on main roads in any part of the country will appreciate that at night it is almost impossible <Col N="457" /> to pick out the cyclist cycling on the same side of the road as that on which one is driving against the oncoming lights of another motor vehicle.  I have urged in this House before that the question of whether or not it should be compulsory to affix rear lights and not simply reflectors to bicycles should be seriously considered.  It may be an imposition in so far as it affects the individual cyclist, but if the cyclist himself knew the danger he places himself in, with even the most careful driver coming behind him, blinded by lights, he will appreciate that it is an imposition put on him only in his own interests.  I ask the Minister to have particular regard to it.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister made reference to the compilation of the register and I hope he will give due consideration to the suggestion made by Deputy Briscoe last week that the card indicating a person's number on the register and the number of the register itself might be sent out at an early stage and not merely on the eve of a general election.  That might be one solution, one means of eliminating the complaints that are heard only too frequently from all political Parties that many of their supporters are left off the register.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope the Minister will continue the special grant for the rehabilitation of certain roads in the Gaeltacht.  I do not believe there is any danger of that grant being reduced or of any let-up in the carrying out of that Gaeltacht road programme. The Minister knows better than I do the value of good roads in these Gaeltacht areas, not only for the employment they provide but in giving to motor tourists in particular proper facilities for going into these most beautiful districts on our western seaboard.</P>
    <P>There was a complaint made at the end of the first year of the administration of that scheme that certain county councils were using the grant for these Gaeltacht roads for the purpose of relieving the allocations out of their own funds to their own ordinary road development programmes.  The former Minister and I had that investigated and found that there was no foundation <Col N="458" /> for it, but I should like to impress on the Minister now the need for ensuring that these funds are used for the purposes for which they were intended&mdash;to put roads in the Gaeltacht areas, which unfortunately were neglected by the county councils, into a proper condition and to make them capable of bearing the type of traffic, motor tourist traffic, that we all want to attract, not only into the country generally, but, in particular, into these Gaeltacht areas.  I compliment the Minister on his appointment and wish him the very best in his new office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I avail of this opportunity to repeat what I said last year, that I am of the opinion that the grants given by the Government towards the building of houses for the working classes are totally inadequate. Many members last year and the year before spoke about the inadequacy of the grants, especially in view of the increasing cost of building.  The municipality raises money and has to pay heavy rates of interest for that money, and we feel that the Government should give us something more towards the cost of every house we build for letting to the people who are clamouring for houses in Dublin at present.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister should examine the desirability or the necessity of giving to the municipality the full grant in respect of houses built for newly weds.  If the corporation has as an applicant for a house with a family of four children, they naturally give the house to that person.  Then, there is the case of a person who might come under the heading of newly wed, with two children, one child or no children, and the municipality dealing with that type of person does have regard to the fact that the grant he gets for the building of what may be called a newly-wed house is not equivalent to the grant paid in respect of a house built for a family of four or six people, and I suggest to the Minister that the time has come when there should be a review of that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very good Bill was brought in last year by the previous Minister, and, during the discussion on it, we expressed the hope that at a later date <Col N="459" /> these points would be considered with a view to improving housing legislation as we go along.  I mention it to the Minister now because he will be in charge of new measures or amending legislation to improve the position.</P>
    <P>We had a draw for houses only a few months ago among about 2,700 newly weds, many, if not most, of them living with their parents.  The local authority was not building for them at all.  It is very wrong that there should be any difference in the grants made available for the building of houses for these very deserving people.  The newly weds are not getting an opportunity for a good start in life.  It is sad to relate that a young couple must have four children before it is possible for them to get into a cottage of their own.  The number required for a corporation house recently came down to three children and if there is an exceptional or very deserving case&mdash;say, if a member of the family has T.B.&mdash;the corporation have been known to house that type.  Often people write to us and say: &ldquo;Must we wait till we get T.B. before we will get a house?&rdquo; It is unfortunate that such letters should have to be written and I earnestly hope the Minister, in going through the legislation that has already been passed dealing with housing, will see his way to give a better grant to the municipality for the building of houses.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister, too, would encourage the Dublin municipality&mdash;I say &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;, I do not want too much interference from his Department with our activities; I do not want to ask him to accept responsibility that we ourselves should take&mdash;to start to build up old Dublin on derelict sites that are available, property that we compulsorily acquired.  We are going out to the outskirts of the city.  Let me say that, from my long association with members of the corporation, I have found that they all strove to give of their best to see that houses were built for the people regardless of any political group.  However, I do say that we are leaving old Dublin derelict; schools of the old granite <Col N="460" /> type in the centre of the city are being left without their pupils; shopkeepers are losing their customers and the churches in many cases are losing their congregations.  New churches, schools and shops have to be built in such areas as Walkinstown, Ballyfermot, Finglas and Cabra.  I would ask that an extra grant would be made available to have all these houses in old Dublin reconditioned or, if they are not fit for reconditioning, that new houses would be built on the same sites, that is, blocks of flats.  The corporation is doing that and doing it rather handsomely but, in my view, not quickly enough.  I often wonder would it not be possible for somebody to arrange a tour for public representatives to see what has been done in the City of Dublin.  New towns have been built up in the areas I have mentioned.  Ballyfermot, one scheme alone, is as big as Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from this morning's newspapers, the corporation are asking for £5,000,000.  The officials of the corporation, with the help of the Government, have done splendid work in the past, but I am anxious to put forward my own point of view in regard to rebuilding the old city.  It is a great hardship on some working class people who have to travel many miles to their place of work.  Take a North Wall worker; he is five miles away from the far end of Ballyfermot.  The bus fare is 5d. from the near end and 6d. from the far end of that area.  If he does that twice a day the bus fare alone is a handsome rent imposed on the man in addition to the high rent he is paying for his house.  I hope, therefore, the municipality will be given an opportunity to build more flats and recondition more old houses in Dublin. In passing, I want to say that the former Minister, in his last Bill, made some fine improvements and expressed the hope that the new Minister would continue to make further improvements.</P>
    <P>I will leave the question of municipal work and say a few words on private building.  The moment a private builder puts up a house you will see it advertised in the newspaper <Col N="461" /> requiring deposits ranging from £80 up to £150.  The average outgoings will amount to 42/- a week and in most places you will find the ground rent is £12 a year, on one of these small houses that you see on the outskirts of the city.  That unfortunate person, a newly wed, ventures out on his own and has this heavy burden of £12 a year to meet for the rest of his life. The valuation of these houses will be from £20 to £25.</P>
    <P>I remember the days when £15 or £16 would have been considered a very high valuation.  We are now living in an inflationary period and perhaps it is only natural that the official, seeing everything else go up, asks himself why should not valuations go up also?  In practically all these new houses there is a remission of two-thirds of the rates for seven years.  A large number of these new houses are now coming into the full rate and the young people are beginning to feel the pinch.  Very often when the remission period comes to an end a new baby arrives to add to the liabilities of these young married people.  It has been suggested that the remission period should be extended over 20 years.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Minister and his Department will consider all these points to see if anything can be done. I have been asked to put forward these views so that something may be done to encourage people to put down their own deposits and build their own houses.  It is robbery to ask them to pay £12 a year, first of all, for a site. At the moment the corporation have completed some very fine houses at St. Anne's at Clontarf.  Now those houses are fairly far from the centre of the city and the bus fares will be in the region of 6d. per journey.  Some 25 or 30 years ago in London new houses were built 15, 20 and 25 miles outside the city and provision was made for special bus fares.  In some cases free tickets were issued for the first five years.  Would it not be possible to arrange here with our transport company some special fare when the municipality or private builders develop an area outside the city proper?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on his appointment.  I know that at this stage he will not be in a position to deal with things in the detail that some Deputies would like.  Like Deputy Byrne, I merely want to ask for his encouragement in one or two matters in connection with housing in the City of Dublin.  I agree with Deputy Byrne so far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned&mdash;I say this in all sincerity both with regard to political opponents and political friends&mdash;I do not think there is ever any question of politics as between members of the corporation when dealing with municipal affairs.</P>
      <P>I am a member of that body.  I am not able to attend the various committee meetings with the same assiduity as Deputy Byrne and some other members, but there is no doubt the majority of the members of the corporation give a tremendous amount of valuable assistance in relation to the civic life of our city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to call the Minister's attention to two anomalies.  The first is in connection with a group of cottages known as St. Enda's Road, Terenure; the other is a smaller group, known as Riverside Cottages, Templeogue.  It seems very odd that in the year 1954 we should have in the City of Dublin <Col N="463" /> two groups of houses, or cottages, devoid of running water facilities.  One of those groups is practically in the centre of the city.  I know the corporation has difficulty in dealing with cases of this kind since it is necessary to seek a contribution from the tenants, either a direct contribution or a contribution by means of increased rents.  It is not very easy to obtain agreement on such a matter when there are 40 or 50 cottages concerned in a scheme.  I would ask the Minister, if there is any manner in which he can assist by way of grant or otherwise, to help the corporation to get over these difficulties because it is not right that in this day and year we should have practically in the centre of the city people living in reasonably good houses without any of the adjuncts, such as sewerage and running water facilities, to which everyone now feels himself entitled as a right.  If there is anything the Minister can do to assist either of these schemes I would be very grateful to him if he would give that assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  He displayed tremendous energy when he was on this side of the House and I hope that he will be just as energetic in the work of his Department.</P>
      <P>It is only natural that Deputies representing Dublin and Cork should be concerned with housing more than anything else.  I was very glad the Minister drew attention to the position in relation to housing in these two cities.  I was very glad that he seemed to be aware of the urgent necessity for pushing on with the housing drive. Deputy Lynch told the House that when the previous Minister was approached by Deputies from all Parties about 18 months ago in connection with housing in Cork, the answer he gave to that deputation was that, no matter how fast houses were built in Cork, he would, while he was Minister, see that the moneys would be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt the present Minister will continue that policy and ensure <Col N="464" /> that the people who are now living in bad houses will be removed from these conditions.  We had an investigation into housing in Cork a few years ago and I suggested to the inspector in charge of that investigation that the first thing he should do was to go around and visit some of the slums to see for himself the conditions in which the people were living.  Of course, he had his job to do and he did it.</P>
    <P>Without casting any reflection on the two Ministers in the previous inter-Party Government, I want to say that housing progress in Cork was very slow during that period.  That may have been the fault of the local officials in Cork.  I can, however, say that we increased the number of houses built in Cork during the last three years practically threefold.  That represents about 400 houses a year. But we have still about 3,500 families to house.  About five years ago I asked a question as to how many applicants there were for houses, and the figure I was given was something like that which I have just mentioned.  That reminds me of the man travelling along the road who, when he asked how far more he had to go to a certain place, was told that it was another mile.  Having been told that many times, he said: &ldquo;Thank God, we are not losing ground.&rdquo; That would seem to represent the housing position in Cork, because there does not appear to be any great improvement in the city although we are building an increased number of houses.  There is an increase in the number of houses that are being demolished.  Most of these tenement houses are in a very bad state of decay.  When one of them is demolished, it very often means that seven new houses have to be provided. The result is that, I believe at the present rate of building in Cork we will not be able to overcome our housing difficulties for a very long time, that is, unless we speed up the provision of houses much more than we are doing at present.</P>
    <P>I believe that a lot of delays that occurred three or five years ago were due to the fact that we had not enough officials in the offices of our city <Col N="465" /> architects and engineers.  We pressed on the manager and on the Department to get more assistant architects for the development of our plans for the new housing schemes and for the acquisition and development of land.  During the past couple of years we have been in a much better position in that regard. I would ask the Minister to speed up the giving of sanction to housing plans when they are sent up to the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne spoke about derelict sites in Dublin.  We have much the same position in Cork.  We have submitted schemes for flats and for what the architects describe as two-dwelling residences, that is, dwellings with entrances for two families.  In each case we were told that we would have to get a comprehensive plan of the whole area approved of before sanction would be given.  We have overcome one of the difficulties in that connection fairly well, and hope that, in the very near future, we will have sanction to go ahead with building in the northeast area of the city.  We have a place known as the Marsh which is down in the centre of the city where, for years, we have been trying to do some development.  A great part of that area has been derelict for over 30 years.  We have sent up plans for flats in that area.  Clergymen and everybody else have been pressing us to try and put some people back in that area.  We then got a request for a comprehensive planning scheme for this big area part of which is occupied by industrialists with warehouses, etc.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is fair that we should be asked to hold up a couple of schemes for flats in a particular street until a planning scheme is approved of by the corporation.  The matter was discussed at a meeting of the corporation last night.  We decided to inform the Department that we wanted this scheme of flats in Grattan Street, and that we did not think it would be fair to the merchants and traders in that area to rush through a town planning scheme.  We think it would be only fair to give these people an opportunity of studying a town planning scheme for the area, and of getting their observations <Col N="466" /> on it before tying future corporations or future citizens to a particular scheme for the area, one which might not have the approval of those traders or merchants.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider giving his sanction to this scheme of flats that we want built there.  I think it is about time we got some little bit of autonomy in the case of local authorities, especially as regards sanction for small schemes such as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>We have a number of derelict sites in the city, many of which are not cleared yet.  We are anxious to clear them.  We, like Deputy Byrne, do not want to be sending all the people out from the centre of the city.  We know, of course, that we had to remove a certain number of them.  We had to build in outside areas in order to house them.  When, however, certain sections of these derelict sites are cleared, we should be allowed to build and so provide houses for people in these areas who, at the moment, are living under wretched conditions.  I suggest that we should be allowed to build flats for them.  We should not be asked to send them all out from the centre of the city where there are churches and schools and all other amenities.  The Minister should not delay in giving his sanction until such time as the corporation are in a position to obtain the views of the people of the city in regard to other town planning schemes.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Finance Bill, 1954&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I might commence by remarking that the Collection of Taxes (Confirmation) Bill&mdash;all stages of which were given by the Dáil last Tuesday&mdash;was designed to remove the difficulties and uncertainties arising from the dissolution and to restore the position which would have existed if the Budget Resolutions had run their course without interruption up to the date of passing of the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Bill, which is now <Col N="467" /> before the House, provides for the matters to which the Budget Resolutions related as well as for certain other items requiring legislation, most of which were mentioned in the Financial Statement on 21st April last.</P>
    <P>In view of the debate which has already taken place on the main provisions of the Bill and of the further opportunity of obtaining additional information which the Committee Stage will afford, I propose to confine myself at this point to a brief reference to the salient features of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part 1 contains 12 sections relating to income-tax and of these the first section is the most important in that it imposes income-tax and surtax for the year ending 5th April, 1955, and continues in force the previous enactments. This section was covered by Financial Resolution No. 1.  The matters dealt with in six of the remaining sections in this part of the Bill were mentioned in the Financial Statement, namely, Section 2 relating to the increases in personal allowances; Section 3 providing exemption for incomes not exceeding £240 a year and appropriate relief for marginal incomes; Section 4 increasing child allowances; Section 5 dealing with the relief in Schedule A tax for owner-occupiers of residential property; Section 11 relating to the aggregation of periods of residence abroad for the grant of relief from double taxation; and Section 12 dealing with the extension to stocks of the E.S.B. of privilege of dividends being payable without deduction of tax.  The concession is being extended also to future issues by C.I.E. of Transport Stock, which is a Government-guaranteed security.</P>
    <P>Of the remaining sections in Part 1 of the Bill, Sections 6 to 9, inclusive, relate to the exemption from income-tax of certain statutory pensions, gratuities and allowances.  Section 6 exempts pensions payable to the widow of Terence MacSwiney and the widows of the former mayors of Limerick&mdash;Michael O'Callaghan and George Clancy.  The other two sections bring up to date the tax exemption of pensions, gratuities and allowances <Col N="468" /> under the Army Pensions Acts. Section 10 merely brings Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1924, into conformity with the extension under Courts of Justice Act, 1953, of the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts.</P>
    <P>The first four sections in Part II of the Bill&mdash;that is the part relating to customs and excise&mdash;provide for the alterations in the duties on beer, matches and rural entertainments announced by my predecessor.  The other four sections, viz., Sections 17 to 20, provide for the termination of various customs duties which are no longer deemed necessary and which are at present suspended by Orders made under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Acts which, however, are due to lapse on 31st March next with the result that the suspended duties would automatically revive next day unless previously terminated; in addition, Section 18 provides for the termination of the excise duties on glucose and saccharin.  The commodities covered by these sections are boots and shoes (Section 17), glucose and saccharin (Section 18), mats of straw, rush or grass (Section 19) and (by Section 20) the items listed in the Second Schedule.</P>
    <P>With regard to the single Section 21 forming Part III of the Bill, I might mention that Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1943, was designed to combat possible evasion of corporation profits tax, including excess corporation profits tax, by preventing companies from claiming exemption on the ground that they were precluded by their constitution from distributing profits.  It is now considered that the section may safely be repealed.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that an undertaking was given in the prospectus of the 4½ per cent.  National Loan, 1973-78, that stock of the loan would be accepted at its face value, with due allowance for any unpaid interest thereon, as the equivalent in cash in satisfaction of death duties.  Section 22 provides the necessary statutory authority which is in general terms and may, where it is so desired, be extended to any similar loan issued in future.</P>
    <P>The most important sections in <Col N="469" /> Part V of the Bill are Sections 25 and 26. They implement the promise given in the Financial Statement of 21st April last of reduced rates of stamp duty on conveyances, transfers on sale and leases, to Irish citizens, of lands and houses where the consideration lies between £500 and £2,500.</P>
    <P>Section 23 also implements a concession announced in the Financial Statement by abolishing the £5 stamp duty on special licences for marriages in Protestant places of worship.  The section also, for administrative convenience, abolishes the 1d. stamp duty on certificates of birth, deaths and marriages.</P>
    <P>Of the remaining sections in the Bill, only Sections 27 and 28 seem to warrant comment.  The former exempts from stamp duty receipts given for payments under the Health Acts to persons suffering from an infectious disease and receipts for certain other payments to necessitous persons.  Section 28&mdash;which has now become a familiar feature of the Finance Bill &mdash;relates to the amortisation arrangements in respect of borrowings for voted &ldquo;capital services&rdquo; in 1953-54 and 1954-55.</P>
    <P>That, very briefly, covers the technical provisions of the Bill which is now before the House.  Since the Bill was introduced, an amendment to the Second Reading has been put down by Deputy Lemass.</P>
    <P>I made it clear, when I was speaking on the Financial Resolutions last week, that the Bill that would be introduced would be the Bill that was prepared following the statement of my predecessor.  The amendment is, therefore, an amendment not to give a Second Reading to the Bill that was framed by the present Opposition.  I also made clear, when I was speaking last week, that in view of the time factor it was utterly impossible for the present Government, in the time that was made available to them by the previous Government, to introduce completely new financial proposals this year.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to weary the House by again repeating what I said in that connection last week. <Col N="470" /> The position is that if the then Government had acceded to the motion that was proposed here in this House on the 11th March last by the present Taoiseach, then Leader of the Opposition, it would have been possible to have had a Government elected in sufficient time to frame financial proposals which could have been operative for this year.  The previous Government saw fit to reject that motion and to vote against it.  It is their own rejection of it and their own vote on that occasion which has made it impossible to present complete proposals this year in view of the time that would be available, as I indicated last week, and as I say, I do not propose to weary the House by repeating what I said on that occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;&ldquo;the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill because it fails to give effect to pledges made by Ministers before their elevation to office to bring about the immediate reduction of taxation which they had asserted to be practicable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At the outset, it appears necessary to make it clear that this Bill is represented to the Dáil solely on the responsibility of the present Coalition Government.  It is their Bill.  It is that Government which is asking the Dáil to pass the Bill in the form in which it has been presented to us. Secondly, it seems necessary to remind Deputies that the Bill can be amended during the course of its passage through the Dáil.  Any Deputy who feels an urge to implement any pledge regarding taxation which he gave during the election, can avail of this Bill for that purpose.  It is true that an amendment to increase taxation can under our Standing Orders only be moved by a Minister but any individual Deputy can move an amendment to reduce taxation, any taxation, and if there is a majority in this House prepared to vote for that amendment, it will be incorporated in the Bill and come into effect with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> If the Bill is passed without amendment, it will be because the Government wants it passed without amendment, and because there is a majority of Deputies in this House prepared to support the Government in passing the Bill without amendment.  The Government is not released from its responsibility for this Bill, for every section and every word of the Bill, by asserting that it is similar to the Finance Bill which its predecessors would have introduced if there had not been a change of Government.  There was no obligation on the Minister for Finance to accept the draft Bill he found in his office when he went there. This Bill comes before the Dáil as a Bill of the present Government, one which they considered presumably, discussed amongst themselves, and decided to present unchanged to the House.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Bill confirms and makes effective the tax reliefs which were foreshadowed in the Budget statement of Deputy MacEntee, the present Government and their supporters in this House can take all the credit they wish for allowing these reliefs to stand.  In so far as the Bill fails to give effect to any other tax changes, to achieve any other reduction in taxation of any kind, to implement in any way the pledges for immediate relief in taxation which were given by Deputies opposite during the election campaign, the responsibility is theirs also.  The previous Government never failed to take full responsibility for every measure it proposed to the Dáil.  It never tried to shift responsibility on to the shoulders of others.  The present Government has got to learn to do the same.  It is their Bill now and if its introduction to this House has to be justified, the responsibility for doing so is theirs.  If an explanation why the Bill appears in its present form is required, it is their duty also to provide that explanation.</P>
    <P>The amendment which I have moved gives Deputies opposite an opportunity, if they want to avail of that opportunity, of declining to pass this Bill, to protest against its provisions or to make use of this Bill to <Col N="472" /> give effect to the reductions in taxation which, during the election campaign, they had pledged their word to the people could be carried into effect without any protracted examination of departmental Estimates.</P>
    <P>The amendment has annoyed the Minister for Finance.  He went down to his constituency and said that this amendment indicated Fianna Fáil's obstruction of the Government, that the Fianna Fáil Party, as indicated by this amendment, were engaged on a policy of obstruction.  It is a characteristic of incompetent Governments that they always try to prevent criticism, that they always try to blackmail their critics into silence by alleging obstruction or something of that kind.  These are the tactics the Minister endeavoured to use on this occasion but they just will not work. This is an amendment of a constructive character.  It is an amendment which provides Deputies opposite with an opportunity, the only opportunity they will get in this financial year, to fulfil their election promises.  I hope to have a unanimous vote of the House in favour of it.  That will dispose of the charge of obstruction.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Opposition, the duty of every individual Deputy outside the Government, to criticise every proposal submitted by the Government, if it is open to criticism and to expose its defects and defaults.  The amendment emphasises and publicises the fact that the Government has taken a decision not to fulfil in this year the pledges they gave to the electorate during the election campaign to achieve an immediate reduction of taxation, because that decision has been taken.  That is the significance of the presentation of this Bill, this draft which the Minister found prepared in his office, unchanged to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The members of the Government during the course of the election campaign said that immediate reductions in taxation were practicable.  They went further than that.  They said that there was unnecessary taxation in force.  If that was true, there should be no problem, either of time, drafting, or anything else, in effecting in this Bill any changes which they would <Col N="473" /> like to see.  There is still plenty of time to effect these changes before this Bill will have reached the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>My advice to the Minister for Finance is to stop talking about obstruction.  It is a dangerous line for any Minister to take.  The members of this Party have decided, solemnly decided, that they would co-operate with the Government in securing the expeditious and proper discharge of public business here.  That is a decision to which we should like to adhere but if we get any more talk about obstruction that decision will be open to review.  Have no doubt about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I advise the Minister for Finance to think twice before he intervenes in that form again.  For some reason, the Minister for Finance and Deputies sitting behind him consider that it is an argument in favour of this Bill that it was drafted on the authority of their predecessors, that it is the same as the Bill which the previous Government would have produced to the House, if there had not been a change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is that what they undertook during the election campaign&mdash;to produce here and pass the Fianna Fáil tax proposals unchanged?  Was there a single Deputy opposite who, in the course of any speech during the election campaign, in his election address, in any circular he sent to an individual elector, undertook to do what the Government is now asking him to do &mdash;to pass through this Dáil Fianna Fáils tax proposals without change or without amendment?  That is what this Bill is intended to achieve.  In fact, as you know, what they undertook was quite the reverse.  I have a <Col N="474" /> stack of quotations here, Press cuttings of various kinds, speeches made by Ministers and Deputies opposite, advertisements issued by their various Parties.  I could not attempt to read them all.  I hope to read them all during the life of this Dáil.  I am only giving you a first instalment now and I hope that Deputies will enjoy it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get the Deputy back to that, if I can.  I cannot achieve miracles.  As soon as that Budget statement was made here by the Minister for Finance, a Deputy opposite, who is now a Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Oliver Flanagan at the time, immediately issued a statement to the Press in which he said that the Budget was an insult to the Irish people.  That is the Budget that the Deputy is now going to vote for in this Bill.  As the Minister has just carefully pointed out, this is a Bill to give effect in every detail to the Budget proposals made by Deputy MacEntee here last April&mdash;these proposals which Deputy Flanagan in this statement issued to the Press, described as an insult to the Irish people. It was not a speech; it was a formal statement.  How many Deputies opposite are going to join Deputy Flanagan in insulting the Irish people by voting for this Bill?</P>
      <P>When the election campaign started and, may I say, after the dissolution of the Dáil, not when we were debating the appropriate time for a general election, but when every Deputy knew there was going to be an election and knew that a new Dáil was going to assemble on 2nd June, the leader of the Fine Gael Party, now the Minister for Education, made his first speech, in Carrick-on-Suir, and there he said: &ldquo;The first task of the new Administration will be to lighten the burden of taxation which is now crushing the people,&rdquo;&mdash;the first task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first Bill of the new Administration and this Bill, if it passes to the Statute Book unchanged, will not lighten the burden <Col N="475" /> of taxation which the Minister then alleged was crushing the Irish people. If there are Deputies opposite, or members of the Government, who believe that the present burden of taxation is crushing the people, do not they feel they have an obligation to do something about it?  Do they think they are released from that obligation by producing a Bill here and saying: &ldquo;It is the same as our predecessors would have produced&rdquo;?  If the people are being crushed by taxation, let us lighten the burden now.  As I reminded the Deputies opposite already, this is the only chance they will have in this financial year to lighten that crushing burden.  If they let this chance pass it will not come back for 12 months. Are they in favour of leaving the people staggering under this crushing burden of taxation for another 12 months?  That is the question they have to ask themselves when they come to vote on this amendment.</P>
      <P>The present Taoiseach opened his election campaign at Ringsend on 24th April and he said there:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The present Budget proposals&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is to say the Budget proposals which are now incorporated in this Bill which the Deputies opposite are going to vote for&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;are an admission of the failure of the financial and economic policies of the Government and furnish striking evidence in justification of the charge that has been made of excessive and unnecessary taxation in the Budget of 1952.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the Budget proposals made last March are an admission of the failure of the financial and economic policies of the previous Government, why are Deputies opposite going to vote for them now?</P>

      <P>There is the present Taoiseach: these proposals incorporated in this Bill are according to him an admission of the failure of the financial and economic policies of the previous Government.  Is that why you are taking them up and presenting them unchanged to the Dáil?  Is that why the Whips are going to be busy to-morrow or the next day making sure that every Deputy opposite votes for these proposals?</P>
      <P>The charge that there was unnecessary taxation imposed in the Budget of 1952 was made frequently.  If there was unnecessary taxation, if there is money coming into the Exchequer this year, because of unnecessary taxation, that the Exchequer does not want, let us give it back to the people now.  It is you who said that.  For two years you have been asserting that the Government was taking in more money than it required to meet the ordinary cost of Government administration. Now is your chance to rectify that injustice&mdash;because it would have been an injustice if it were true&mdash;and if you fail to take this chance you are admitting that you were talking nonsense for two years and that you have now discovered that there was no such unnecessary taxation imposed in the Budget of 1952 or in any Budget since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello, the present Taoiseach, was quite convinced of it during the election campaign.  He went from Ringsend to Cavan and on 28th April in Cavan he said that there was in the Budget, or there appeared to be there, &ldquo;a hidden pouch of fat representing over-taxation since 1952.&rdquo; These are the things that you said to the electors.  It was as a result of saying these things to them that the electors voted for you.  Now you have a chance of saying that you were right or that you were wrong and your vote will be a declaration one way or the other.  Now, if you were wrong and if you have discovered that there was no hidden pouch of fat, that there was no unnecessary taxation imposed on our people, that not one penny is available to the Exchequer that is not required to meet the cost of Government <Col N="477" /> services, will you have the manhood to stand up and say so?</P>
    <P>Before I start reading some of these quotations from speeches and election advertisements, I think it would be well to get them into proper perspective. Here last week the Minister for Finance, speaking on the Financial Resolution, made the following statement&mdash;I am quoting from the Dáil Debates, Volume 146, No. 2, for Tuesday, 15th June, column 154:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We never said that we were going to reduce taxation, but we said that we were going to reduce taxes, and there is a very big difference&mdash;a difference which, incidentally, I made it my business to make quite clear at almost every meeting at which I spoke during the election campaign...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a definite statement made by the Minister here last week:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We never said that we were going to reduce taxation...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am going to remind the Minister of what he said and quite a number of Deputies opposite of what they said during the election campaign.</P>

It is going to happen them very often during the course of the next few months in this House.  They will be frequently reminded of what they said and this statement of the Minister for Finance&mdash;&ldquo;We never said that we were going to reduce taxation&rdquo;&mdash;will, I imagine, reappear upon election posters at some date in future.</P>

We are now told: &ldquo;We never said we were going to reduce taxation.&rdquo; That is what the Minister for Finance said last week.  Here is what Deputy Barrett said in his election address.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barrett said in his election address: &ldquo;The policy of Fine Gael is to reduce taxation on the individual.&rdquo;&ldquo;We never said,&rdquo; according to the Minister for Finance last week, &ldquo;that we were going to reduce taxation!&rdquo; Deputy Barrett added in a footnote: &ldquo;A vote for Barrett is a vote for a policy of lower taxation.&rdquo; Deputy Coburn's election address was almost identical in terms to that, but that <Col N="479" /> footnote did not appear in it.  Deputy Esmonde, according to the <i>Free Press</i> on the 8th May, stated: &ldquo;If we are returned to power we will immediately set about the task which the previous Government has completely neglected of reducing taxation.&rdquo;  How quick is &ldquo;immediate&rdquo;?  Here is the Finance Bill for 1954 before us.  If there is to be an immediate reduction in taxation it must be achieved in this Bill. Deputy Esmonde also said on the 1st May, as reported in the <i>Free Press:</i>&ldquo;The Fine Gael policy for the coming general election will be the reduction of taxation and the reduction of the overhead burden on the people.&rdquo;  Their policy now is: &ldquo;We never said we were going to reduce taxation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin, the present Minister for Defence, according to the <i>Sligo Champion</i>, spoke at the Fine Gael Convention in Sligo Town Hall on the 13th March and said: &ldquo;Fine Gael stood for a reduction of taxation.  The Party also stood for a reduction of local rates,&rdquo; and he went on to make a further promise in which the Minister for Finance will be interested.  He said: &ldquo;Fine Gael, if returned to office, will take steps to see to it that the Central Fund would undertake responsibility for all future expenditure and for some of the existing expenditure which are at present being met by local rates.&rdquo;  A speedy implementation of that policy will be welcomed by the ratepayers of the country generally.  The Minister for Finance, of course, spoke in the election campaign and also referred to the Fine Gael policy of reducing taxation.  May I say that if he, as he claimed in the Dáil, carefully explained at every meeting the difference between reducing taxation and reducing taxes, unfortunately that part of his speech was not reported in the local Press?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly before the election took place and before the final rally in O'Connell Street, the Fine Gael organisation issued an official advertisement which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of May 15th.  In that advertisement they made the false claim that the previous Coalition Government reduced taxation by £6,000,000 a year and then stated: <Col N="480" />&ldquo;What has been done before can be done again.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>You are cheering at the wrong time.  The Minister for Finance said last week: &ldquo;We never said that we were going to reduce taxation&rdquo;. The Party line now is that you never said that.  On the eve of the election an advertisement was published in the <i>Irish Times,</i> again by the official Fine Gael organisation, entitled &ldquo;More and More Taxation&rdquo; and stated: &ldquo;The inter-Party Government will give you less taxation, more consultation and less interference as it did before&rdquo;.  We will take the promise of consultation and less interference for granted, if you will start implementing the policy of less taxation in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Must I go through all these advertisments to show these Deputies opposite &mdash;&mdash;<i>(Interruptions).</i>  I can understand your anxiety to prevent me. Deputy Burke of Roscommon&mdash;I am not sure that I know him, but his photograph is here and I am trying to identify him:&mdash;&ldquo;Fine Gael policy is lower taxation&rdquo;; Deputy Manley of South Cork:&mdash;&ldquo;Vote Fine Gael and ensure lower taxation&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The quotations are from the Deputy's election broadcast. The case which the Government is making, as I understand it, against effecting changes in taxation in this Bill is that they had not time to look into matters thoroughly, to examine the position of the various Departments and to get to the bottom of the budgetary position.  With all due respect to the Government, that is nonsense.  The very competent officials of the Department of Finance will tell the Minister, in one hour, exactly what the Budget position is and what the prospects are for the immediate future and they will probably give an estimate accurate to within 1 per cent. of how the Budget will turn out on the 31st of March of next year.  There is no difficulty for any Minister who wants to find it, in getting all the information that will enable him to decide whether there was any unnecessary taxation in the Budget and whether any relief could be given.  We understood&mdash;and the public were given to understand&mdash;that all that had been thought out.  When <Col N="484" /> Deputy McGilligan was making his speech from Radio Éireann, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When State expenditure has risen to its present heights, there must be economies ready to hand for a Minister who is serious in his quest of them and who knows how to go after them.  There is little doubt that savings in the cost of Government amounting to several million pounds a year can be secured without much effort.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what he stated during the election campaign, that is what he said when he was looking for votes. He did not say then he would want time to carry out an investigation before granting the reliefs.  He was promising them.  He was humbugging the people then and he is trying to humbug them still.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy indicated that the Government would effect economies amounting to £20,000,000 a year.  As far as I can discover there was only one other candidate of the Fine Gael Party who had the audacity to repeat that pledge: it was the Deputy elected for Roscommon.  Most of them, like Deputy Morrissey, confined it to £5,000,000 or £6,000,000, but Deputy Burke suggested £20,000,000. There were &ldquo;economies ready to hand for a Minister who was serious in his quest for them and who knew how to go after them&rdquo;.  Is Deputy McGilligan suggesting that the present Minister for Finance is not serious in his quest or does not know how to go after them?  If he thinks the present Minister is incompetent, why did he not take the position himself?  There is no doubt, he said, that &ldquo;savings in the cost of Government amounting to several million pounds a year could be secured without much effort&rdquo;.  He did not say &ldquo;without much time&rdquo;&mdash; that was the snag, that was the catch for the electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> It is said there was no time to prepare amendments.  There is all the time in the world available to the Government to prepare amendments for this Bill.  This Bill has to pass through the Dáil&mdash;through the Committee Stage and Report and Final Stages&mdash;before it goes to the Seanad. We will give the Government time to prepare amendments.  If there is some statutory obligation on the Government to secure the passage of the Bill to the Statute Book before a certain date, we will undertake to pass it to the Statute Book on that date, so far as we are concerned, if they want time to prepare amendments.  We will go further&mdash;we will draft the amendments ourselves, we will save them the time. When the 1952 Budget was presented here&mdash;that is, the last Budget that increased taxation &mdash; every Deputy opposite, every member of the present Government, alleged that in that Budget unnecessary taxation was imposed on the people.  Ten million pounds was the figure put upon it.  It was alleged here that we had asked the people to contribute in taxation £10,000,000 more than was necessary for the purposes of the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any fat in the Budget.  I think that every tax which is now in force, subject only to the concessions which this Bill will implement, is necessary to enable the Budget to be balanced.  As Deputy de Valera, when he was Taoiseach, said in this House when the Budget was being discussed, it will be only with great difficulty that the £4,000,000 by way of savings, assisted by normal overestimation, can be achieved and the Budget brought into balance.</P>
      <P>I do not believe there is any surplus in the Budget: you said it.  I do not believe that any taxation was imposed unnecessarily: you said it.  I do not believe it is desirable to cut down the Estimate for any Government Department, whether you call the cutting down &ldquo;economies&rdquo; or not.  The responsibility for doing these things is yours now&mdash;or else have the decency to say, as Deputy O'Leary would say: &ldquo;These were election tricks.  They got us votes.  They put us into office.  We will forget them now.&rdquo; Repudiate now these promises and pledges that fooled the electorate.</P>

If that money is required to balance the Budget, to pay the costs of Government services, to maintain the social welfare and health facilities, the onus is on the Government to point that out to the House and to the country.  We did it when it was our responsibility.  They cannot say now: &ldquo;This is Fianna Fáil's Bill.

      <P>Deputy Davin, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, addressed his constituents, and his address was reported in the <i>Midland Tribune</i> of the 15th May, 1954.  Here is an extract:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;So far as the Labour Party is concerned, the principal item in our programme in this election is the reduction of taxation on all essential commodities to the same level, or as nearly as possible to the same level, as that at which they stood before the Budget of 1952.  I pledge my word of honour to the people of this area that if I am re-elected, as I hope to be, I will undertake with my colleagues to use that power given to us by the votes of the people to force whatever new Government is elected on the 2nd June to bring down these prices to the lowest possible figure.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not want any misunderstanding of our position.  If the Estimates that were submitted to us by the officers of the various Departments as to the amounts required to defray the cost of administering these Departments during the year were correct and if the Estimate of the Revenue Commissioners as to the probable yield of taxation during this year was correct then no reduction of taxation is possible if the Budget is to be kept balanced.  It is the Deputies opposite who said that a reduction is possible.  It is the Deputies opposite who have the responsibility of making good their undertakings in that regard or of withdrawing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that during the course of the election campaign the Taoiseach and the present Minister for Industry and Commerce occasionally went on another line.  When it suited them, they said that the Government were taxing unnecessarily and that reductions in taxation and reductions in expenditure <Col N="490" /> were easily achievable by any Minister who was anxious about it and prepared to make the effort, to quote Deputy McGilligan.  Sometimes, however, they thought it desirable to allege that the Budget was not balanced at all.  On more than one occasion during the course of the election campaign, the Taoiseach made speeches in which he suggested that the assumption of a balance to be achieved in the Budget on the basis of economies could not be realised.  However, the Government have since decided, if I understand the position, to sanction further expenditure&mdash;to be financed by further economies.  I want the Taoiseach to relate the present policy of his Government and the statement made here last week by his Minister for Finance, and with the statements he made during the election campaign.  More than once he tried to prove that the Budget was not really balanced.  More than once he tried to prove that only the illusion of a balance had been created by the assumption of unrealisable economies.</P>

      <P>I have here an extract from a report which appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 24th April last of a speech by the Taoiseach, then Deputy Costello, when opening the election campaign at Ringsend, Dublin, on the previous evening.  The extract reads as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Budget proposed to make economies amounting to the sum of £5,750,000&mdash;a sum larger than ever before taken into account by a Budget&mdash;for the purpose of securing a balance.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know where the Taoiseach got that figure of £5,750,000.  According to <Col N="491" /> the Table Explanatory of the 1954 Budget, the assumption was that it would come to £4,000,000.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Budget proposed to make economies amounting to the sum of £5,750,000&mdash;a sum larger than ever before taken into account by a Budget&mdash;for the purpose of securing a balance.  Economising was never the strong point of Fianna Fáil. Last year they promised to make £3,500,000 economies but not merely did they fail to secure these economies but to effect any.

Since the present Government has accepted that Budget they have the obligation of bringing it into balance by saving £4,000,000 and, over and above that sum, £1,250,000 to finance the subsidy on butter and some amount in order to meet their promises to the Civil Service out of economies.</P>

      <P>We will leave members of the Government speak about Government policy.  The Minister for Finance said here on the 15th June, 1954, column 154, Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... we are satisfied that we can make savings that the previous Minister was not going to make and that when the out-run comes at the end of the year, it will be quite clear that we shall be able to make those savings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that it is not possible to effect savings to the extent of £1,250,000 and finance the butter subsidy without major changes in policy and, what is more, if savings are to be achieved by economies so as to make it possible to meet that expenditure out of revenue and keep the Budget in balance at the end of the year a start has to be made now.  Savings will have to be at the rate of £2,000,000 per year which is the estimated cost of the butter subsidy over a full year.  Ninety-five per cent. of the Government expenditure goes on wages and salaries.  Is there any <Col N="493" /> Minister who would deny that?  Ninety-five per cent. of all the money spent by every Government Department is spent in the form of wages or salaries to somebody and you cannot save £2,000,000 a year without depriving a whole lot of people of their employment. If you assume the average public servant, civil servant or Government employee gets £10 per week, then you cannot save £2,000,000 per annum without depriving 4,000 people of their jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The £4,000,000 was not savings.  The £4,000,000 was in the main made up on the normal assumption that the various Departments of State in estimating the cost of services tend to overestimate and that many would be unable to complete within the financial year the expenditure they planned.  Ninety-five per cent. of Government expenditure goes on salaries and wages.</P>

      <P>Whatever it was, you yourself are promising to do that plus £2,000,000 more.  You are telling us it can be done&mdash;that plus £2,000,000. Four thousand people will have to be disemployed if you achieve those economies.  Of course, the Minister for Finance was talking with his tongue in his cheek.  Neither he nor the Government has any idea of attempting economies on that scale.  They are going to let the Budget ride this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared for shocks of that kind at any time.  When Deputies opposite are voicing their enthusiasm for economies, I want them to keep in mind a fact that they have ignored up to this.  Whenever any clerk in a Government office was told his services were no longer required, there was always a row in the Dáil and even though the disemployment was due to a desire for economy that did not prevent a row.  If you are now <Col N="494" /> going to economise to the extent of £2,000,000 per annum and cut 4,000 people off the Government payroll, do not think that is going to pass without comment.  How would Deputy O'Leary relate that to his promise about employment for everybody?  The Fine Gael canvassers went round the tenement houses during the election&mdash;it was the meanest thing I ever heard of &mdash;with notebooks taking down the names and addresses of unemployed persons and promising them that if there was a change of Government they would get them jobs.  All these promises are coming home to roost now and will rest heavily as the years go on.  Everybody welcomes a reduction in the price of butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!  The Deputy will not vote against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  Everybody knows that butter is not going to cost any less to produce and distribute than it was before.  The 5d. must be paid for by somebody and we are entitled to ask who is going to pay it? We know the cost is not going to be lessened by any reduction in the margin either to retailers or wholesalers. I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce about this to-day and I got the reply that no reduction in the margins previously in force is contemplated after the price reduction becomes effective.  In fact, they will be getting a higher percentage margin than previously.  The suggestion frequently made was that there was a margin between the production cost and the retail price and that that could be absorbed for the benefit of the consumers.  That argument has been disposed of.  No alteration is contemplated in regard to that matter.  The 5d. has got to be made up either by reducing the return to the producer&mdash; I doubt very much if there are very many who would vote for that&mdash;or by spreading it over the whole of the tax paying community and that means in effect that the money will be taken out of one pocket of the ratepayers to the amount of the subsidy in order to put it back in another.  Are you going to put the whole of the burden on one narrow section of the community, on <Col N="495" /> the 4,000 civil servants whose livelihood will be ended to financing the subsidy through so-called economies?</P>
      <P>Do you not think there is a duty to relieve the anxiety of those people who think they are going to be the victims of this policy and tell them what economies the Government have in mind and what major changes they are going to achieve that will make these economies a reality?</P>
      <P>We were told also that the reduction in the price of butter is the only reduction that is going to be achieved in this year.  The Minister for Finance found out that there are certain consequences to promising widespread and wholesale reduction in prices.  He found out that when people are led to believe that prices are going to fall trade tends to drop.  He is concerned now to relieve any possible impressions he might have created by emphasising that this is the only reduction this year.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce does not agree with that.  He went out last Sunday and said there were going to be further reductions.  Whom are we to believe?  The loss in revenue that the Minister for Finance was complaining about was not due to the election. People did not leave down their stocks of whiskey or tobacco just because there was an election on.  They did that because of the reckless promises of reduced taxation voiced during the election campaign.  That is why traders decided to cut down their stocks, on the assumption that a change of Government would lead to an attempt to effect these promises. Now they know that the promises were only wind, and that loss of revenue will be made up when stocks have to be replenished.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance need not be trying to put the fact that there was an election as the reason that there was that decline in revenue.  It was attributable only to the statements and promises made on behalf of the Coalition while that campaign was in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement that these are the only concessions, the only alterations, the only reductions in contemplation <Col N="496" /> for this year, raises some issues for Deputies opposite and for a few members of the Government.  Let us see-what the Labour Party said during the election campaign or are reported to have said.  Deputy Kyne, who was and presumably still is chairman of that Party, issued his election notice in the <i>Munster Express</i> on 14th May, headed &ldquo;What the Labour Party stands for.&rdquo; It said first of all for &ldquo;a reduction in the prices of bread, butter, tea and sugar&rdquo;&mdash; not butter only &mdash; from the levels at which they stood at 14th May.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Meath for Labour &mdash; Labour for Meath.  The housewives remember what the Fianna Fáil hunger budget did. Issued on behalf of Deputy Tully&mdash;increased prices for bread, butter, sugar and flour.  The Labour Party is pledged to reduce those prices.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Did you say that in County Meath?  Is that what you said in County Meath?  I will say what was said and perhaps the Deputy will remember this because after him an address on behalf of Mr. Tully, at a meeting held in the Market Square at Navan and published in the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> on May 15th, was given by Deputy Seán Dunne, who said the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before the Labour Party would participate in a Government with any Party or group of Parties they would insist that the prices of bread, butter, tea, sugar, cigarettes, tobacco and the worker's pint must be reduced, and reduced immediately. Unless they got agreement on that point they would not take part in the formation of any Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Did they get a promise on that point? Are those prices going to be reduced immediately, or was that pledge given on behalf of Deputy Tully by Deputy Dunne sincerely meant?  Is it now being repudiated?  Deputy Dunne and Deputy Tully did not say: &ldquo;You may get that in five years.&rdquo; What they said was that they would get an assurance that that was going to be done immediately before the Labour Party would join the Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan's little canard about 1947 has to be nailed too.  What I did in 1947 was done in the light of day and was fully reported in the newspapers at the time.  I met the Irish Trades Union Congress, the Congress of Irish Unions and the Federated Union of Employers to try to see if we could get agreement under which a sliding scale would be arranged which would ensure that wages would rise with the cost of living, as the cost of living was rising at that time, an arrangement that would ensure that without friction and without strikes every worker would get increases in wages indicated by that sliding scale.</P>
      <P>That is what I set out to achieve in 1947, and if there was a Bill drafted it was drafted because it was contemplated that some union outside those congresses or some employer outside the federation could not be made to conform to the general agreement unless there was legislation.  I did not want legislation. I told the two congresses, and it was reported in the papers at the time, that I wanted that done by agreement and we were drawing nearer such an agreement when the election that year was declared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is what you promised.  The Minister for Finance when speaking here last week said that the reduction in the price of butter is the only concession to be made this <Col N="499" /> year.  Does that mean, then, that other prices will be allowed to rise if economic factors should cause them to rise?  I think there is an obligation on the Government to expand and amplify this statement that the only concession the people can expect this year is in respect of butter.  There is a possibility that other foodstuffs will go up in prices.  Are they going to be allowed to go up in price?</P>
      <P>I will give as an example for the House the case of tea.  I know that the price of tea up to now has been much lower than the world price because there was purchased early last year a substantial stock of tea before the world price began to rise and that stock is still in use.  There was a hope, a slight hope, that when the new markets opened this month the price of tea would fall again and that stocks could now be replenished at a lower price, but the reports indicate that the new season's tea is dearer than last year's.  What is going to happen?  Is the Minister for Finance going to expand that statement that there will be no further concession?  If there are economic factors affecting prices which would cause them to rise will they be allowed to rise?</P>

      <P>If the Minister for Finance is perturbed about the possible effects on trade and the general public expected to follow any impressions caused by election speeches, and if he is trying to remove that anxiety, to get everything normal again by repudiating these election speeches, should he not go further than he did? He must indicate what the general policy of the Government is in relation <Col N="500" /> to these prices.  Does his statement that the only concession that will be given this year is to reduce the price of butter mean that other prices will be allowed to fluctuate upwards as well as downwards if economic factors should so cause them to do?  I think that Deputies should take these matters seriously into account.

That draft would have satisfied us.  You gave different pledges.  We fulfilled our pledges and you have to produce a Bill in accordance with your pledges or finally and firmly repudiate them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw this resolution on the paper when it was first circulated, I wondered what the motive was.  I still wondered as the Deputy was speaking during the early part of his oration what the motive was, and I got the key in one disreputable comment he made about a Deputy who sits on these benches.  The comment was very disreputable but very worthy of the Deputy.  I assumed that this is an effort of his to procure for himself the position of the office boy who used to write the political notes in the <i>Irish Press,</i> which position, I understand, has been given away to another person and the door to which is bolted and barred against the Deputy.  That was the only reason I could see for this shouting effort of his this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Deputy knows anything about an economist who can at least explain economics in a lucid way and with a certain amount of good humour&mdash;a person called George <Col N="502" /> Schwartz, who writes economic articles in one of the English Sunday papers. He ended one of these with the words: &ldquo;I must stop now.  Both my tongue and my cheek are very sore.  My tongue has been sticking into my cheek for the last half hour.&rdquo; I wonder which is the sorer on the Deputy's side &mdash;his tongue or his cheek.  The other comment that George Schwartz made was in talking about the prairie areas of Canada: &ldquo;Any fool can start a forest fire in five minutes,&rdquo; and he added that it took many people months to get that fire quenched and it took them possibly years to get the evil effects of what the fool's momentary impulse had caused put right.  It is that second quotation I want to call attention to.</P>
    <P>We are faced here with the effects of evil government continued for 15 years and continued for the past three disastrous years which the Party opposite filched from the people when, having been beaten in the countryside, they suborned four so-called Independents whom the rest of the people hit more effectively than they hit even the ranks of Fianna Fáil at the last election.</P>
    <P>The Deputy puts down an amendment and says he can back it by the political promises from the different Parties supporting the present Government to bring about the immediate reduction of taxation which they had asserted to be practicable.  I think he produced one quotation in which the word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; was used.  That was a quotation from a speech by Deputy Dunne.  As for the rest, he produced quotations&mdash;and these quotations we will stand over&mdash;from speeches we made and which set out a policy which we sincerely meant, a policy which we will try to bring into effect, that it would be our first task to reduce the cost of living to the people.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will give me ten or 15 minutes.  If he cannot get the answer at the end of that period, if he sends me a written statement, I will reply to it.  The ex-Minister said that we promised, that we asserted to be practicable, an immediate reduction in taxation.  I have here a number of quotations from various people throughout the country. I have a few from the Deputy and I have a few from Deputy de Valera.  In a broadcast, Deputy de Valera said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In his broadcast last night, Mr. Costello, with indignation, has defended himself against charges we are supposed to have made against himself and Fine Gael.  My recollection is that what he calls &lsquo;charges&rsquo; were questions put to him prompted by statements of his colleagues, which his own vague and indefinite replies on specific matters seemed to support.  Nor did he give any definite replies in his broadcast.  Early in the election, he was asked did he propose to restore the food subsidies to the 1951 level as has been suggested by the Fine Gael and Labour propaganda and if he did so propose, to state where the money was to come from.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera ended that part of his broadcast by saying that he had carefully evaded this question.  Apparently&mdash;that was about two days before polling day&mdash;Deputy de Valera considered that Deputy Costello had not any specific reply to the specific questions put to him about how to reduce prices and reduce the cost of living.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, in either his first or second broadcast, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;When the election campaign opened, Fine Gael leaders said that the main issue was the cost of living.  They issued leaflets and Press advertisements which implied and sent out canvassers who said that a Fine Gael Coalition would reduce prices to the 1951 level.  When the leaders of Fine Gael were challenged to say clearly whether they stood over these promises, to state what they thought it practicable to do or intended to do about prices, <Col N="504" /> they began to retreat.  Their retreat is now a headlong flight.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Through the whole of the broadcast, that note is struck&mdash;promises which the Deputy said Fine Gael people  made but for which he gave no back ing, for which there was no documentation. But he did assert, in a broadcast made in the last week of the election that, as had been said earlier, the Parties were now in full retreat from these promises.</P>
    <P>He said&mdash;I think this was an early broadcast&mdash;that General Mulcahy had failed to answer questions which not merely the public but his own Party followers were asking&mdash;questions which, if he wanted to be straightforward, he must answer before polling day&mdash; and later these were put both to Deputy Costello and General Mulcahy.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;According to Mr. Mulcahy, the aims of a possible Coalition will be to reduce the cost of living and taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The aim&mdash;Deputy Lemass wipes that out.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These are the aims of every Government in every country at every time, but Fine Gael supporters should note the caution and the vagueness which characterised his statement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then spoke of canvassers distributing leaflets which suggested that Fine Gael would be able to bring prices down to the 1951 level and said that they might get votes on the assumption that that is what they were promising. The rest of the broadcast was an attempt to put before the people the opposite viewpoint, that these promises were never intended, that they were so completely impossible of fulfilment that nobody should have made them.  He returned to Deputy Mulcahy and said he had never mentioned the word subsidy and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If Fine Gael intend that prices should be brought down by increased subsidies, Mr. Mulcahy would, I assume, have said so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later in the broadcast, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If, as now seems clear, Fine Gael does not mean price reductions by <Col N="505" /> means of increased subsidies, they must mean reductions by the lowering of costs.  Food prices depend upon farm prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The rest of it was one of what I might call these terrifying alternatives the Deputy was so fond of putting before the country both in the 1948 election and in this election&mdash;that you can only cut down costs by either subsidies, which mean extra taxation, or else by cutting the prices which farmers and industrialists get for their products, and that, his broadcast went on to show in a most voluminous way, would mean increased unemployment and misery and further relief works, meaning further taxation, through the country.  This matter was brought to a head by a series of questions that were supplied both to the then Taoiseach, now Deputy de Valera, and to then Deputy Costello, now the Taoiseach.  One question was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If returned to Government, do you propose, in the coming year, to retain taxation as it is at present on beer and spirits, motoring and cigarettes?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The earlier question was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If returned to Government, do you propose in the coming year, to reduce the cost of living by increasing food subsidies?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The written answer supplied to the newspapers by the present Taoiseach is in these terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An object of our policy is to reduce the cost of living and to relieve the burden of present prices by using all practical means of increasing the real value of people's money.  The extent to which, and the rate at which, revisions in subsidies combined with readjustments in taxation are possible cannot be determined in advance by an Opposition Responsible decisions on these two matters require: (1) access to all relevant facts concerning the condition of the Exchequer, (2) the ascertainment of the effect on the Exchequer of a fundamental reform of the financial policy.  I do not, therefore, propose to repeat the action of our opponents in 1951, <Col N="506" /> when they made specific promises which they subsequently broke.  They failed to keep their specific promises to maintain subsidies and not restore certain taxes.  I am prepared to make only one promise&mdash;to provide good government to the best of my ability.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is on that answer to that series of questions that we fought the election. It was inherent in our whole campaign. We made it clear we believed the people were suffering and suffering unjustly and that there was nothing to recommend the policy of austerity which Fianna Fáil had brought in in 1952 by their Budget.  We made no promises about immediate reductions in taxes.  Nobody who now holds ministerial rank&mdash;and that is what is referred to in the motion&mdash;made any such promises and we will ask the ex-Tánaiste to go through any quotations in every newspaper and nowhere will he find a promise of that kind.  We are entitled to treat the ex-Tánaiste's statement, as most of the country will treat it, as an outburst of anger that the people should have removed from office those who thought they were entitled by some divine right to rule this country and that no one had any right to oppose them.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach's reply brought in a matter that was hardly relevant to the queries but he did speak of the promises that were made and the promises that were broken in 1951.  Deputy Lemass said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Coalition Minister has said that Fianna Fáil if elected would increase the tax on beer and tobacco. Why should such taxes be necessary? There is no reason why we should reimpose these taxes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I said on the 13th May last, they knew how short a period we had to wait until that promise was shamelessly broken.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance, whose absence is to be regretted, said a number of persons were trying to rumour that Fianna Fáil if returned to power would reimpose the tax on drink which was imposed in 1947.</P>
    <P>There is no truth in such a rumour,&rdquo; Deputy Donnchadh Ó Briain made an <Col N="507" /> interjection across the House to-day when he was asked how the promises of 1932 had been fulfilled.  I have not the quotation from the famous poster here but I am sure I will quote it accurately from memory.  There was a promise to reduce expenditure by £2,000,000 in the year without imposing any hardship on any person or without removing a single civil servant from office.  There was no record, I think, in the whole of the Fianna Fáil administration, of any year in which taxation or in which the expenditure of the State went down by £2,000,000 in comparison with the previous year. The Deputy facing me, however, said &mdash;it is a long time ago&mdash;in 1928 in order to get his feet in office in 1932 (Parliamentary Debates, Volume 22, No. 2, column 213, of 22nd February, 1928):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are some people no doubt who think that the evils that exist here are due to the fact that there are a million too many people in the country.  We do not.  We believe Ireland can be made a self-contained unit, providing all the necessities of living in adequate quantities for the people residing in the island at the moment and probably for a much larger number.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>His chief, of course, put that much larger number at the great figure of 8,000,000 that we had round about the famine times.  Deputy Lemass also said with regard to unemployment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy's phrase was then (Parliamentary Debates, Volume 35, No. 2, column 426, of 4th June, 1930):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" />&ldquo;...we find that the outstanding fact concerning unemployment in this country is that it need not exist at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Two years later the Deputy came into power and for all the period that he was in the Government that has been rejected he carried an average of 65,000 unemployed with an emigration total that was rising year by year. At the same time there were people being pulled into both the Army and the police here in order to exhaust those who were otherwise going to fill the ranks of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I said, in a broadcast, some of the things to which Deputy Lemass referred. Some of those things, I suggest, are good enough to bear repetition here.  I referred to a statement made at the start of the election by the national organiser of Fianna Fáil that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If this election is made a bread-and-butter one, it means the Irish people have become a nation of whingers and crawlers weeping over the price of their bread, butter and tea, and so on, and discarding their proud national heritage for a bottle of beer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I quoted that and said I thought it was part of the right of the populace to remove a Government when they thought that that Government had imposed upon them hardships through increases in the cost of living which they believed to be unnecessary.  I did go on to say I did not think myself that that was the whole of the controversy in the election.  This effort on the part of Deputy Lemass in this resolution to concentrate upon promises that were never made about immediate reductions in taxes, is an effort to gloss over the more ugly side of the picture that must present itself to Deputies now in the Opposition. I did recall to those whom I addressed that when the 1952 Budget was brought in it was not based upon any necessity with regard to the balance of payments. That had been referred to and put at one side.  When the then Minister for Finance came to speak of the entire withdrawal of certain subsidies and the reduction of the subsidy on bread, he put it on the basis <Col N="509" /> that the Government had given great consideration to the matter and as they found that the increased salaries and wages that people were getting were in advance of the increase in the cost of living since 1939, there was no moral or social justification for subsidies. On our side we phrased that as a budget proposal to increase taxes on people's food by withdrawing subsidies on the ground that people were too well off, and that was what that Budget meant.</P>
    <P>One can wonder why a Government was annoyed at the people being too well off.  The answer to that is that the policy pursued by Fianna Fáil over the years, a policy which had started before the war and which had been continued during the emergencies of the war, was always a policy of keeping wages and salaries of those who gave their services to the community in return for those wages and salaries at a certain low level and not allowing them to advance.  But when the hardships became so severe that the people were inclined to kick against them, then the policy became one of giving subsidies so that the people would become more dependent still on Government favour and Government aid and the Fianna Fáil clubs could get their enthusiasts going propagating the theory that it was only the efficiency and benevolence of Government that kept the people from feeling these hardships to which the lowly level of wages and salaries had brought them.</P>
    <P>That policy was continued down the years and that policy was put into operation again in 1952.  Nobody listening to me can deny that the philosophy of 1952, and its hardships, was that in the Coalition period the people had become too well-off because in our time salaries and wages had increased and taxation had been lowered; and the people were being paid in coin which carried something more in the way of value than it had in 1947 and, at the same time, they were getting more subventions in the way of increased wages than they had ever had in the days of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>That was the mood in which the Fianna Fáil Government approached <Col N="510" /> their Budget in the year 1952.  The real point that affected the people, as I understand it, during the election was not really&mdash;although it counted with a great many people&mdash;the crushing burdens that the year 1952 and its Budget had imposed upon them.  There came to the people this year a new realisation of what progress should mean and the lack of progress there had been in this country when Fianna Fáil ruled over it.  Remember, they became the Government in 1932 and they ruled continuously until 1948. They always said, as Deputy Lemass said here this evening, that there was no other way of living except according to their system and that no policy would bring more ease to the people's lives than the policy they were adopting. The people were misled by their speeches and their propaganda.  But the chance came in 1948 when the inter-Party Government was formed and in the three years during which we directed things we gave to the people not merely a better performance but an awakening to the realisation of what Government could really mean.  We got home to the people through our performance and through our activities what really could happen if the Government seriously put its mind to making economies in directions in which money was being spent wastefully and extravagantly; we showed the people what could be done if the Government put themselves to the task and applied the savings they got either to a reduction in taxation or to bettering the lives of the people in some way, particularly the lives of those who were living on small emoluments.</P>
    <P>We also inaugurated schemes of national development.  These schemes were met with the most vituperative propaganda ever hurled at any scheme since the days of the electrical development of this country and the inauguration of the national beet factories. We were told our schemes for national development were putting the country into pawn and we would see the sign of the pawnbroker displayed all over this city in respect of our proposals. We were told that the projects were either not fit for capital to be employed upon them or else our capital was being extravagantly used.  There <Col N="511" /> was even criticism of where that capital came from.</P>
    <P>In 1951 the Fianna Fáil Government returned to power, with the aid of a few Independents, and immediately on their return they accepted our entire programme of national development and stopped criticising our projects and the way in which we had procured money for them and the objects to which we had applied that money.  But in 1951 there was a comparison upon which the people could play their minds.  It was no longer a question of pledge against pledge or promise against promise.  There was then the possibility of comparison, for one could see the advances that had been made in the three years of inter-Party government and these could be put in balance and weighed against the failure to achieve during the years 1932 to 1947.</P>
    <P>I prophesied that the recent election would show a new development of political view in this country.  I believed that what happened in 1948 was no mere accidental interruption of Fianna Fáil rule but meant in itself a decisive change in the Party affiliations of a great many people.  If one analyses the reason why that decisive change took place I believe it will be found that a certain part of it can be rested upon the promises we made, promises in which we glory and which we will in time carry out, to reduce the cost of government and the cost of living to the people.  As far as the people are concerned they realised from the comparison with our three years that there had been no development nationally in this country from the years 1932 to 1948.  They looked at the old-time promises and they saw how they had been deceived.  They looked at our modest promises in 1948 and they saw the record of achievement.  It was easy for the people to make a comparison.</P>
    <P>Let me put it in this way: I think it is the easiest way in which to get the people to realise just what the difference between the Parties was. From 1932 to 1947 the Government ruling in all those years borrowed from the community something in the neighbourhood of £20,000,000 for <Col N="512" /> national development at something over £1,000,000 per year.  We came to power and we found unused material, unused resources, unused men and unused money.  We put all these things together and in our three years we went to the people three times for a loan at easy interest rates and we got enough money to carry on our projects. Here and there, we skimmed off an odd bit as we required it from American funds that had come to our hands.  In three years we had not merely a programme but an achievement in the way of national development unequalled over the 15 years of Fianna Fáil rule.</P>
    <P>In 1951 when Fianna Fáil came back to power they accepted our programme. They could not get money after they had spent what we had left behind us. They tried to get money and eventually they had to put themselves into the hands of the money-lenders at exorbitant rates of interest and even at those exorbitant interest rates they failed to get the full amount they required to carry out their programme.</P>
    <P>Again, we find as we did in 1948 a position entirely different from the position we left behind us in 1951.  In 1948 we found debts awaiting us and the proceeds of our first National Loan had to go to the payment of the debts that our predecessors had left us. When we left office in 1951 we did not leave behind us what Deputy de Valera, first of all, called debts but subsequently agreed were commitments; we left the Fianna Fáil Government in 1951 £24,000,000 of American money and their own capacity to borrow, if that was a real capacity.</P>
    <P>Once more, we find ourselves faced with enormous debts left to us by our predecessors, they having run themselves into the position where they apparently had succeeded in terrifying those who were the owners of savings because of their repeated requests for money.  Having done that, they decided to finance themselves by enormous short-term borrowing.  This has led to the load of debt that we have now to take upon our shoulders.  That is what we have to meet.  Once again we are faced with the problem that we had to face in 1948 of having a programme of development and of not having funds <Col N="513" /> but a debt left behind by our predecessors instead of the easy situation in which we left them in 1951.</P>
    <P>When Deputy de Valera in the old days talked, as he did, of our debts in relation to balancing the funds of which he had been put in charge, but eventually changed his word to &ldquo;commitments&rdquo;, let us see what these commitments were.  They were commitments to spend money on building houses, on building schools, on attending to the telephone system of this country and the electric and turf development of the country, reclaiming land, promoting industry and looking after the harbours of the country. Those were, if he likes to call them that, the debts.  We are glad to call them a programme of schemes of development, schemes that apparently had never occurred to him during fifteen years of uninterrupted power. Then he set himself to carry out the plans that we had made and to follow the particular schemes that we had initiated.</P>
    <P>The only thing he could not do was to get, in the easy way in which we got it, the finances, so that these schemes could be carried out in an easy way for the community.  It was that, I think, which struck the populace at the last election, that there were people who had not merely promised, but had performed, people who had shown that this country was in need of development, people who had definitely put to work idle men and resources with the plentiful money that there was, and who got results from all that.</P>
    <P>Those three years can be compared, and will always bear comparison, with the 15 arid years of Fianna Fáil.  As far as schemes of development are concerned, they woke up to only one or two things when the war came. When the meagre resources of this country, undeveloped as they were, were found wanting during the war period, then there was a hurried, bustling, expensive and extravagant move of trying hurriedly to extemporise what should have been done by plans, early made, and in course of fruition and of being carried out, when the war came.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> It was that comparison which, I say, struck the people, and it is that comparison which has got the Deputies across from me where they are.  As long as that comparison lasts, and that comparison will be deepened by future achievment, Deputy Lemass and those around him will have many weary years in which they can read back through the quotations from our speeches.  But these will be discarded as time goes on, as achievement matches the promises that we made.  We await the people's verdict eventually on that.</P>
    <P>We have no reason to believe that anyone is going to be fooled by this motion.  We do not believe that anyone who reads the motion or the list of quotations will believe that there was anybody on this side foolish enough to say that big reductions in taxation, immediate reductions in taxation, were practicable.  We believe they are practicable.  We believe they can be achieved in a certain time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass did me the honour of quoting from a broadcast of mine. He said that I had made this remark, that &ldquo;economies amounting to several million pounds could be secured without much effort for the relief of the community&rdquo;.  He stopped at that.  I want to put my view on the last Budget this way.  Deputy Norton, the Tánaiste, to my mind, put the correct phrase on the Budget that was introduced by the Minister for Finance in the last Fianna Fáil Government early this year.  He described it as &ldquo;a bucket-shop arrangement&rdquo;.  It was a bucket-shop arrangement.  We are going to make it an honest Budget. That is going to be a terrifying task, but it will be done.  Did anybody who listened to the then Minister for Finance speaking of £4,000,000 of economies unspecified think that he was going to make them as well as the near-million pounds of specified economies?  Did anyone really credit it, that they were going to be secured by that Minister?</P>
    <P>There is the quotation from the present Taoiseach at Ringsend that &ldquo;it was not a Fianna Fáil habit ever to economise&rdquo;.  I myself had promulgated to the electorate, to whom I <Col N="515" /> spoke, the view that the Budget would only be balanced if these £4,000,000 of economies of an unspecified type could be secured and if, in addition, the £1,000,000 from C.I.E. and the other things could be brought into hand.  I said that, if Fianna Fáil were returned, the pretence at economies would be abandoned, and that the country would then be faced with a Supplementary Budget in the autumn in which frankness would then develop on the Fianna Fáil side, and they would say that they found it impossible to secure these economies and that there must be a further reduction in the subsidies.</P>
    <P>I myself believe that economies, when State expenditure rises to such a height as it is at, can be achieved, but do not forget what we have got to achieve.  We have got honestly to get the economies which the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance never intended and never believed he could get.  I believe they are there.  I believe, in addition to that, that the £1,500,000 required this year for the butter subsidy can also be found.  I believe that can be done by a Minister who is anxious to achieve economies, who looks for them and tries to insist on getting them.</P>
    <P>We are told by Deputy Lemass that the whole thing is impossible.  I think it was somewhere about 1947 that he first thought of this particular explanation which he gave to-night, that 95 per cent. of the whole expenditure of the State carried in the Estimates is on wages and salaries.  If that be correct&mdash;of course it is not correct&mdash; then Deputy Lemass comes to his immediate conclusion that any economies made must be made as the expense of the wages and salaries item in the Estimates.  That means, naturally, the sacking of civil servants, economising on the personnel of the Civil Service, and in no other way. While he was making these remarks we interrupted to ask if that was the way in which it was intended to achieve the £4,000,000 of economies? Of course, that had to be evaded, and we were told &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;that that was what was called overestimation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> It appears to be peculiar that the ex-Tánaiste can accept £4,000,000 as being the correct figure for overestimation, and say that he will not accept £5,500,000 as being also fairly correct in regard to overestimation.  He told us that the only way in which we can economise is by savings, and that the only saving we can do is in the personnel of the Civil Service.  In my broadcast, I said that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While, however, there can be little doubt that savings in the cost of Government amounting to several million pounds per year can be secured without much effort for the relief of the community a distinct change of policy is required and a new outlook on the part of Ministers demanded if the reduction in Government expenditure of £20,000,000 and upwards, desirable in everybody's interests, is to be achieved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I had said earlier that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When State expenditure has risen to its present heights there must be economies ready to hand for a Minister who is serious in his quest of them and knows how to go after them, but when Mr. MacEntee, in emphasising his attitude towards such economies proclaims that every Government Department has been instructed to &lsquo;review its personnel to this end&rsquo; he not only shows that he has the wrong approach to this matter but he must arouse in the minds of civil servants the fear that they, with C.I.E. employees, are marked out as brands for economies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have spoken several times on this matter in this House, on this and on the other side.  I want to repeat briefly again my view with regard to the considerable reduction in Government expenditure which must be achieved if the people of this community are to be allowed to live decent lives.  I believe that can only be achieved by a considerable reduction in the interference that has now taking place in the people's lives by Government.  That was the policy which Fianna Fáil had, a philosophy which they accepted, a policy which they pushed year after year with the result that we have what I have described as mammoth <Col N="517" /> Government Departments interfering extravagantly and uselessly in the people's lives, and which are not a help to them in their search for better conditions.  I have said that to carry out the programme which I think is possible, but only possible over the years, that a reduction of these Departments may appear to mean a reduction in Civil Service personnel.  I myself, when I had anything to do with the Civil Service, gave a promise that, as far as any economies that I was inclined to seek were concerned, they would not be at the expense of the personnel of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I pointed out to the people who appeared to have qualms about the practicability of that programme that there is an annual wastage in the Civil Service&mdash;you have those going out on pension, those coming up to retiring age and womenfolk getting married&mdash; of somewhere about 1,500 people, and that that wastage can be utilised towards a reduction of Government Departments without doing any single serving civil servant any wrong.  As far as I am concerned, and as far as I have any influence with the present Government, if there are any economies, I think the civil servants can take it from us, and I will urge this, that there will be no economies made at the expense of the servants of the State in any Department or in any sphere of government.  But it is possible to get, as I said, these mammoth Departments put back where they belong.  We can stop their interference with the lives of the people, which can, I believe, give desirable economies of the £20,000,000 to £25,000,000 type.  But let nobody believe&mdash;nobody can believe &mdash;that the programme can be carried out this year or next year. If it is done at the end of our time&mdash;if we have made some progress towards achieving it in our first period of office, we will carry it to completion in our second.</P>
    <P>I need not ask Deputies not to be alarmed by the hysterics we have listened to on the other side with regard to this motion.  It is not believed in.  Deputy Lemass&mdash;at the tail end at least&mdash;had the honesty to <Col N="518" /> admit that.  He said he did not believe there were any economies that could be made unless you do certain things which, of course, you would not allow us to do.  Therefore, moving this motion of his is complete hypocrisy. He does not believe it could be carried out.  It was a pretence to show that we said certain things and that we will be met by the recoil of our own promises.  To-day's debate shows that there was no quotation&mdash;or only one&mdash; in which the word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; was used, and very few in which there was any setting of time to this programme we have and intend to carry out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass is simply&mdash;as he was in 1948&mdash;something in the nature of a shell-shocked person.  One would have thought his experience in 1948 would have put him in better form to meet adversity.  It was explained to me at that time that certain of the Deputy's early speeches in Dáil Éireann after the 1948 election could not be regarded as coming from the real Deputy Lemass and that he was an election-shocked&mdash;the equivalent of a shell-shocked&mdash;person. One would have thought experience would have bettered him and that he would be better able to meet the experience of a change of Government, more particularly when the result has been so decisive.  It was proportional representation, and most people, with the exception of the ex-Taoiseach and one recruit think it desirable to keep proportional representation going.  With that there cannot be a landslide in a community like ours but the nearest thing to a landslide occurred in the last election.  It was a result far beyond even the fears of the Opposition Party and beyond possibly the expectations of some of ourselves.  But it was a good result and a result which will give us time to develop, slowly and cautiously but with plenty of appreciation of the people's needs and the hardships they are suffering, the programme for their betterment.  That programme we will carry out and we will not be bustled or rushed into a wrong approach by any hysterical tactics such as we heard when the present motion was being moved to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>One is reminded of Deputy McGilligan's record of retrenchment when he became Minister for Finance in 1948.  At that time the Fine Gael Party, in their passionate desire for retrenchment, announced that they were going to effect substantial reductions in the public expenditure and &ldquo;if we cannot get them this year,&rdquo; said Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance, &ldquo;I can assure you I am not going to be satisfied with a few millions.  I am going to pursue my inquiry and wield my surgeon's knife upon the excrescences, so to speak, left by Fianna Fáil until we reach a sound healthy bedrock position in regard to national expenditure.&rdquo; And what happened all the promises, all the gestures and the pronouncements in Deputy McGilligan's Budget speech of 1948 in the succeeding years when the marriage of convenience with the Labour Party provided an opportunity for the Deputy to show that, far from being a man of steel, he was simply a wooden lath?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He conveniently forgot his previous declarations and undertakings and he found out that in fact no retrenchment was possible in regard to the administrative costs of the central Government and the administration.  He found out that the only economies that could be found would be by way of reorganisation, modernisation, mechanisation; and the personnel, as he had announced this evening, of the administration was not to be interfered with because, of course, as his eve of election speech in Dublin City showed, the Deputy is not likely to be forgetful of the fact that in the Dublin constituencies the civil servants form a substantial section of the electorate, and it was therefore to Deputy McGilligan's advantage that in his broadcast over Radio Eireann he should suggest that Fianna Fail through the former Minister, Deputy MacEntee, was proceeding to wield the axe on the Civil Service and he had no hesitation in going out of his way for mean, petty, political purposes to try to get such persons of the administration as might be listening and as might be affected by his remark into believing the Fianna Fail were about to <Col N="520" /> effect drastic reductions in the numbers of public servants.</P>
    <P>When we promised economies in 1932 we carried them into effect in every Department of State when we came into office.  We were not like Deputy McGilligan who promised retrenchment and reductions and now tells us that economies are possible but refuses to say in what direction or from what source the savings can be effected. The Deputy is hard put to it, because having taken out of the Budget every possible item for which he could make any excuse or a case for borrowing, nothing is left from which savings can be made or reductions effected except by way of general agreement among the main Parties in this House.  The Deputy is fully aware of that position and it is better, I suggest, to accept that the Deputy as Minister for Finance, gave the <i>coup de grâce</i> to retrenchment, and buried the words for ever under a McGilligan tombstone than that we should have ignominy and falsehood foisted on this country and the pretence that these gentlemen have the slightest idea of bringing about any economy or saving that is going to cause a single grouse among the Parties and the Deputies who support them and who put them into office.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has not had enough time, not being a superman&mdash; perhaps some Triton will arise among the minnows&mdash;and not being supermen, the new Cabinet has not had sufficient time to examine the position. They have not had sufficient time to put alternative proposals before the Dáil or even to tell the country after the opportunities they have had since they have taken office, to say what these mysterious economies are which are referred to and which need not be mysterious since, as Deputy Lemass pointed out, if through them the means are to be provided for the financing of the butter subsidy and the payment to civil servants, there will have to be a very substantial economy affecting general national policy.</P>
    <P>It is not to-day or yesterday that the Party in office have been telling us about the burden of overtaxation. <Col N="521" /> They have been at it for years, campaigning up and down the country, fighting and winning by-elections on the good old slogan of &ldquo;lower taxes and better times&rdquo;.  Now they are being asked to justify the slogan and the promises, and we shall see what they have to say and what the country will think.  We rejected their proposal that they should be afforded an opportunity, if returned to office, of bringing in the Budget.  We faced the country and the electorate on the 1952 Budget, and again on the 1954 Budget. We consider it a matter of prime responsibility, even a matter of honour, that a Government that has held office over a period of years, should put its affairs in order, endeavour to put the national finances into a sound position and clear up any difficulties that have arisen and not leave any such mess as Deputy Flanagan, the new Parliamentary Secretary, suggested down the country had been left by the former Government.  If there has been any such mess, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will come along and give us the benefit of his valuable knowledge and that he will not leave us in the position in which we were left in 1951 by Deputy McGilligan, who now comes along to lecture us and tell us what he said on the Radio Éireann broadcast.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, in his Budget of 1951, which neither the Dáil nor the country had ever an opportunity of considering, provided £1,500,000 for expenditure under the Social Welfare Bill, for the mother and child scheme and for other minor purposes.  Had the Social Welfare Bill become law and been brought into operation during that financial year, it is clear that with the additional cost of the provision for old age pensions which was brought in by Deputy Norton, now Minister for Industry and Commerce and then Minister for Social Welfare, expenditure would have run to about £3,500,000 at least.  Assuming that it could be put into operation for part of the year, is it not quite clear that the whole of the £1,500,000, if not more, which Deputy McGilligan had left would have to go towards financing that single piece of legislation?  There was no reference to, and no provision <Col N="522" /> made, for the arbitration award to the civil servants amounting to about £3,500,000 a year, a continuing charge, nor to the losses under C.I.E.  So far as I remember they came to about £2,250,000.  We had to undertake the financing of the Social Welfare Bill and the increase in old age pensions which had been promised but for which provision had not been made. All that had to be done from borrowed moneys in the financial year 1951-52 when we took office, because the cash was not there.  The revenue was not there to provide for these, not to speak of other commitments.  Therefore, in the following year the Minister had to impose the taxation which has been complained of.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance and the Government think that their campaign against the 1952 Budget is going to be allowed to go unanswered in this House, and if they furthermore believe that it has not had very serious repercussions upon financial policy in this country and upon tasks which future Governments and particularly future Ministers for Finance will have to face, then I am afraid the present Minister for Finance is very much mistaken. I regard that campaign as being false and the proof of the pudding is in the eating.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Lemass puts down the amendment he has spoken of to reduce taxation to the level it was at before 1952, it will rest with the present Government and their supporters to show whether they were speaking truth or falsehood when they persuaded, apparently successfully, the electorate of this country that the previous Government were imposing an unnecessary burden on them and that they would take an early, and even as was pointed out, an immediate, opportunity to restore the position and remove the burden.  It was a dishonest campaign from start to finish because the commitments that there were were not created or made by us.  They were made by them but they had made no provision for them.  It was we who had to clear up the mess and provide the necessary revenue to meet these commitments for which they should have provided if they had the true interests of the country, let alone <Col N="523" /> those of the Exchequer and our national economy, at heart.</P>
    <P>It was hypocritical also because it is quite clear that these gentlemen did not believe in food subsidies at any time but it was a convenient weapon to beat the then Government when they had the temerity, in the endeavour to bridge the gap of £15,000,000 which was there, to reduce these subsidies. On the occasion of the introduction of the last Budget, Deputy Norton, as he then was, said that &ldquo;the reduction in the price of bread by ½d. per two lb. loaf and the increased income-tax allowances are merely morsels in a mousetrap provided by this Government for political reasons on the eve of the general election.&rdquo; Deputy Norton's record in regard to subsidies is extremely interesting, because when we introduced additional subsidies on bread, flour, tea and sugar and when these additional subsidies cost £5,500,000 in 1947, this is what the present Minister for Industry and Commerce said about the subsidies:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think these are sham reductions. I do not think they make any perceptible reduction to relieving the plight of the ordinary working people to-day... I took the trouble of trying to calculate hastily what the reduction in the prices of tea, bread and sugar mean to a family of six people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he went on to calculate that this family of six would have saved about 3/10½ per week, about 7¾d. per head per week.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One would think&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;he concluded&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;from these proposals that our people live on bread, tea and sugar, and it would seem that this represents the Government's ambition from the point of view of the average person's diet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Presumably the people are now going to be choked with butter.  As the <i>Irish Independent</i> on a certain occasion said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a rather interesting process, this one of feeding the dog with a piece of his own tail.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> When the last inter-Party Government or Coalition were examining this question of the subsidies, as to how they might deal with the situation, the <i>Independent</i> said, towards the end of 1950, that the subsidies were &ldquo;universal outdoor relief and it would be a welcome day when the Government reached the goal, at which we have no doubt it is aiming, when each of us can eat his bread and butter and take his cup of tea in the sure knowledge that the neighbours have not helped to provide it&rdquo; and, by a not extraordinary coincidence, the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, on the 11th December, 1950, pursuing the same line of argument, declared:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would probably be more economic for the consumer to pay a penny more for his loaf than go on subsidising himself as at present.&rdquo;&ldquo;The chances,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;of any subsidised article finding a lower economic cost level are remote.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, speaking on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, 1950, in the Seanad on the 22nd June, 1950, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was never any intention on the part of the last Government&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that was the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to spend huge sums of money on subsidising these articles.  We are in this position that since we became the Government the rations on the whole have been increased.  The tea ration has been increased.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it was two ounces.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The butter ration has been increased.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it was eight ounces, though it had frequently fallen to six or four ounces and on one particular occasion even, I think, to two ounces.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think the ration is inadequate. It has been announced in the Dáil several times with regard to some of these commodities that the full ration is not being taken up.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton and the other orators who have been spilling crocodile tears over the miserable conditions to which the people had been reduced by <Col N="525" /> Fianna Fáil exactions and the Fianna Fáil Budget and the cost of living, which, of course, according to them, was entirely due to Fianna Fáil policy, perhaps never had their attention called to this important fact, emphasised by Deputy McGilligan, that even when butter was at the former price the full ration was not being taken up.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some people asked me, first of all, to take the ceiling off, so far as the ration is concerned, and keep the subsidised price.  That policy, in the end, would lead to near bankruptcy and it is a policy that I, for one, would not be responsible for.  I think the ration is adequate.  I certainly have heard no complaints seriously made with regard to the inadequacy of the ration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, in <i>The Statist</i> of 3rd February, 1951, we had an article on The National Finances by Patrick McGilligan, S.C., T.D., Minister for Finance, dealing with the question of the proportion of the national income that should rightly go in taxation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Many economists hold that taxation cannot, without ill-effects, be allowed to exceed 25 per cent. of the national income.  Fortunately we are still within that limit, but when the upward trend in prices...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The upward trend in prices.&rdquo; It is forgotten that in the nine months before Fianna Fáil took office in June, 1951, the cost-of-living index figure had risen from 100 in August, 1950, to 109 in May, 1951.  That was an increase of 9 per cent. in the cost-of-living index figure in those nine months.  From May, 1951, to February, 1954, there was an increase of 15 points&mdash;from 109 to 124, of which, as has often been mentioned, only 7 points were attributable to the adjustments in the subsidy for which compensation to the extent of £4,000,000 almost, was provided so that old age pensioners and social service recipients would be no worse off in regard to any increases in foodstuffs. Let us return to Deputy McGilligan and the tax burden:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fortunately we are still within that limit (of 25 per cent.) but when <Col N="526" /> the upward trend in prices, in social services and in debt charges is considered it is difficult to find means of easing the tax burden or even of keeping it within present limits.  In the past two years £3,000,000 has been saved on food subsidies by various means, in particular by marketing quantities in excess of a reasonable ration at economic prices.  This year sugar is no longer being subsidised. Given an improvement in production and relative stability of prices, subsidies&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>says Deputy McGilligan, Minister for Finance,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;could be further reduced without hardship to any class, and the burden of taxation correspondingly lightened.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, those wonderful pronouncements of Deputy McGilligan always fell short of coming into effect or into operation.  He never even tried to bring them into operation but the suggestion and the thought is there&mdash; if the economic conditions remain good, if prices remain reasonably stable, subsidies could be further reduced without hardship to any class and the burden of taxation correspondingly lightened.</P>

      <P>As to the sham reductions which Deputy Norton is now weeping about, he treated us in a statement on the Budget&mdash;cols. 581 to 584&mdash;to a lengthy lamentation that these halcyon days were gone and the prices to which Fianna Fáil had reduced these foodstuffs by the introduction of subsidies were gone.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We come to the Budget and its effects on the cost of living.  That is the only thing that really matters to the ordinary people to-day.  So far as the masses of the people are concerned to-day they are being crippled by the cost of living which has been driven skywards by the Fianna Fáil Budget of 1952.  They have been looking forward to substantial relief in this Budget.  What <Col N="527" /> have they got?&mdash;a halfpenny off the 2-lb loaf.  Look at what they have suffered.  Before the 1952 Budget they could buy butter at 2/10 a lb.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he went on to tell us that they could buy tea at 2/8 a lb., that they could buy flour at 2/8 a stone and so on.</P>
    <P>This gentleman described this present Budget as a mockery of the sufferings of the ordinary people, as constructed on the principle of a mousetrap.  This gentleman is now weeping crocodile tears that we no longer have the level of prices instituted in 1947 and which he described as sham reductions. They were sham reductions because they were of no benefit to the people and because they had to be met out of taxation.  According to Deputy Norton, under Fianna Fáil, the people are either groaning in misery or they are simply unable to make ends meet. One wonders that he has not been able to produce cases of people who have died of starvation which he could possibly attribute to Fianna Fáil maladministration.</P>
    <P>One was reminded during some of Deputy McGilligan's lyrical passages of the famous pronouncement of that Deputy that it was not the duty of a Government to provide work for the unemployed and of when he told the country, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, that people might have to starve in this country.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the people now are to receive butter at a reduction of 5d.  I have always believed that bread was the staple food of the larger and poorer families.  From the nutritional surveys for the City of Dublin and elsewhere, it is quite clear that the families on the lowest level, the large families on very small incomes, scarcely ever reach the margarine stage.  We were told that, before 1946, when these surveys were carried out, the chief food, the chief dish, if I might so describe it, of numbers of these people in the City of Dublin was bread and spread.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton scoffs at the idea of reducing bread by ½d. per 2-lb. loaf. <Col N="528" /> But there are householders in the poorer areas of Dublin in which 20 and 30 loaves are used, because bakers' bread does not require cooking and it is readily available as the cheapest food for the housewife of the type I have described.</P>
    <P>What is the position in regard to butter?  In this country we are one of the largest consumers of butter in the world.  In the year 1951, the latest year for which I have figures available, the butter consumed per head of the population, according to figures provided by the Statistics Office, amounted to 40.8 lb. per head.  The only country higher was New Zealand with 43.5 lb. per head.  In the United Kingdom it was 14.6 and in the U.S.A. 9.7 lb.</P>
    <P>If the payment of subsidies amounting to £5,500,000 to reduce the cost of bread, flour, tea and sugar to the working people could be described by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, some years ago as sham reductions, I wonder what these people think of the present reduction.  I hope their condition has improved, and I am sure it has, but the nutritional surveys, although some years old, are the only definite scientific reports we have as to their condition. I wonder what they will think of this reduction that has been granted to them which, at the rate of 5d. per lb. would amount to about 2½d. per person, assuming that they are now in a position to take up, let us say, a half-pound of butter per week which they were not able to do when butter was very much cheaper than it is now.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The first task of the new Government,&rdquo; said Deputy Mulcahy, Minister for Education, &ldquo;was to lighten the burden of taxation.&rdquo; As I have said, we have had this theme as a battlecry to the country for some years past.  It is difficult to understand why, if the former Government were, as has been alleged, taxing for a surplus in the past, and if they were guilty of the misdeeds and mismanagement which have been attributed to them, the opportunity was not taken to expose this mismanagement and to reduce this burden which we were told in the Dáil and in the country for at least two <Col N="529" /> years was wrongly, deliberately and unnecessarily crushing them.  I might even say immorally crushing them, because, in addition to their other virtues, of course our friends in the Government speak about the moral issues and nothing, I suppose, could be more immoral than for a Government deliberately to impose unnecessary taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello, in the Budget debate on 22nd April, said that he had not the opportunity to examine the proposals in detail.  In that connection, let me remind the House of his statement that &ldquo;the time for that consideration is when there is a new Government no longer in opposition but in full possession of all the facts.&rdquo; Some of the facts that the present Taoiseach&mdash;then Deputy&mdash;was quite sure about were these.  In the first place, he alleged that Fianna Fáil had taxed the people to the extent of some £20,000,000 annually over and above what was got from them by the inter-Party Government.  Allowing for the reductions and adjustments amounting to £1.8 million, he said that this year they are going to be up by £20,000,000, less £1.8 million, that is, £18,000,000 odd of taxation is still going to continue on the people.  And, he continued, what have we got for all that? He went on to deal with borrowing powers.  He was more specific in regard to the question of overestimation. Deputy McGilligan said that the £4,000,000 estimate, including provision for overestimation and such reductions as might be found possible during the financial year, was a pretence.</P>
    <P>The idea that a member of this House&mdash;who tells us that he himself has given up the sponge and failed to bring about any substantial increase in central administration because it would involve reductions in personnel &mdash;should describe the proposal of the former Minister for Finance as a pretence, is simply characteristic of Deputy McGilligan and of the levity, indifference and neglect with which national finances were treated by him when he was charged by Deputy Costello, when he was Taoiseach before, with the portfolio of Minister for Finance.  Deputy Costello went on <Col N="530" /> to say: &ldquo;£4,000,000 is far too much to take into account for overestimation; it is roughly 5 per cent. of the amount of estimated expenditure on public services; no business concern would retain in its service an accountant who tolerated such a high percentage as 5 per cent. as a margin of error for overestimation.&rdquo; I am afraid the Taoiseach is not in close touch with the practice of Government accountancy and the provision of estimates. &ldquo;Yet that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is what the present Government is doing in order to balance its Budget this year and to give the slight and trivial reliefs contained in the Budget.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>When I have completed what I have to say, I will terminate my remarks.  I am reminding the House that the present Taoiseach solemnly declared that the last Administration were taking £18,000,000 over and above the amount taken by their predecessors and plainly there must have been ample room there for reduction. In the same voice almost, he informed us that £4,000,000 of a provision for overestimation and for savings was entirely unjustifiable.  As Deputy Lemass pointed out, if the £4,000,000, roughly 5 per cent. of the annual bill of £101,000,000, is unjustifiable and if it is not going to be feasible to provide that amount, what is the possibility of effecting those other economies which the present Minister for Finance tells us he depends upon to raise the extra £1,250,000 this year for the butter subsidy and the £900,000 for the payment of back money to the civil servants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that Deputy McGilligan, who has obviously a design for higher things in the effluxion of time, is at least extremely grateful that he has been relieved of the responsibility for dealing with this problem and I am sure he is very thankful indeed.  But is not the Taoiseach taking a rather superficial view of our national finances and of the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and of each member of the Government to do his utmost during the whole course of the financial <Col N="531" /> year to review constantly the expenditure in his Department, to prune it and to effect economies where possible and reasonable?  Surely 5 per cent. is not too much to expect, having regard to the fact that you have 66 Votes and that you have changes in policy even during a financial year; having regard to the fact that plans which have been made may not have reached the stage of finding it possible to carry them into operation, and that although the plans are completed there are administrative delays in enabling the work to be undertaken?  We all know that these delays and these changes of policy occur even in regard to much smaller bodies like local authorities.  Is it too much to expect that, with the careful and continuous review that I have spoken of and which we certainly practised during our term of office and having regard to the very large items and very substantial sums that are provided, there should not be savings made during the year?  The Government themselves have admitted that, though they have refused to state wherein the economies can be made.</P>
    <P>They at least have not had the audacity to turn their backs completely on their promises and pledges. They have told us that a rigorous examination of expenditure in the different Departments is under way. It is rather a pity that, in the initial stages, they were not able to give some more practical manifestation of their desire for economy and reduction of expenditure than by creating new offices of at least one additional Minister and one additional Parliamentary Secretary.  It is not merely a question of the cost of the salaries of these gentlemen.  There is the point that in the Departments and offices which have been entrusted to them&mdash;if they want to try and justify themselves to their Parties and their constituents&mdash; they will presumably look for further developments and, I suppose, greater expenditure.  Unfortunately, you can have very little development in Government services or partly-Government services without additional expenditure, sometimes very substantially increased expenditure.</P>
    <P>This matter of balancing the national <Col N="532" /> Budget is not an academic question or merely a book-keeping question.  We faced the browbeating and bullying tactics which were employed against us in order to try and force us to relinquish our responsibilities to maintain the national finances in proper order.  An attempt was made in 1952 to drive us into a position where we would be compelled to permit matters to drift to a far worse stage when there would have been such an unprecedented situation and such a colossal deficit at the end of the financial year that it would have been quite impossible to deal with it and the situation would have become entirely out of control.</P>
    <P>The present Government, who are now telling us that the Budget proposals introduced in April last by Deputy MacEntee are being taken over by them, seem to question the right of the present Opposition to demand that there should be a full discussion and general debate at the earliest opportunity in the national Parliament so that the people will be able to examine the question afresh, far from the prejudices and the bitternesses and the unscrupulous distortions and misrepresentations that have gone on from the hustings.  It is a question of whether the national Government, in providing additional services, will make proper provision for these services out of revenue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall read now a quotation with regard to borrowing:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" />&ldquo;Borrowing,&rdquo; said Lord Beveridge, and it has been quoted in an Irish periodical, &ldquo;enables the Government to escape the unpopular task of taxing and increases the opportunities for general political bribery.&rdquo;  If a Party or a Government deliberately embark upon a campaign of persuading the country that additional services can be provided and that they need not be paid for by additional taxation but that they will be provided for in some magical way by borrowing, then that Government are, as I said in the beginning, not only striking at political morality but they are striking at democratic Government itself.  The seeds of danger are there.  When the time comes when the situation can no longer be avoided, when debts can no longer be piled up against borrowing and cannot any longer be continued and when an effort must be made to straighten out matters, the difficulty will be to get a body of men or a Party that will incur the unpopularity of facing the difficult and unpalatable task of restoring again the national finances to a proper condition.</P>

      <P>The assumption that favourable conditions will continue may not always be borne out.  It happens that in regard to one very importtant branch and aspect of our national affairs, the agricultural side, the prospects are bright and hopeful.  We all trust that agriculture will continue to enjoy at least the prosperity that it has had during recent years.  This country is faced with certain fundamental weaknesses which our friends, in stressing the value of capital investment and pretending you can borrow money for wildcat schemes and that nobody will have to pay, entirely forget.  In the first place, our country is lamentably short of industrial raw materials.  The only source from which we can get these materials is from agriculture, from the land.  To the extent that we cannot secure materials from our soil, we have to depend on purchasing them from abroad in what may be very dear markets and paying for these by exports, largely, again, <Col N="534" /> agricultural.  Secondly, the exports upon which we depend are concentrated entirely in one narrow field, that is, the British market.  Thirdly, we are not in the position to affect the prices of our agricultural products in the international market.  If the international price goes down, our prices are bound to be affected.  We are in a position neither to boost our industrial exports, if we have them, by raising their prices because they are still more competitive, nor to compensate our producers for any change there may be in world agricultural prices otherwise than by producing a larger quantity even at a lower price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>When we tot up all these millions which are expended in the provision of what are called &ldquo;national assets&rdquo;, we ought to examine more carefully than we have been doing what the present value of these assets in fact may be and what allowance we have made for depreciation when we are putting millions of pounds into transport or other big undertakings.  We ought to examine what provision we have made for the depreciation of these assets.  What provision have we made for a fall in the value even of our securities?  Are we taking credit for millions of pounds worth of assets created through the policy of capital development which, in fact, have to be replaced within a short period of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are problems that we can usefully apply ourselves to if we take an honest and objective view of our financial position but I suggest that a Government which announces it proposes to make economies and can make no suggestion as to where the economies are to come from, that embarks upon large items of additional expenditure without any indication of how these are to be financed is not in a position to assure us, as they have attempted to do.  Not only will they do the impossible, improve services and reduce taxation but, over and above <Col N="535" /> that, they will extend further the services which we have at present to an unknown degree.  They will give extended and improved benefits for social welfare.  They will give old age pensions and retiral pensions at 65 for men and 60 for women.</P>

Like O'Rourke's noble feast, it will be remembered not only by those who were there but by those who were not, but those of us who are not likely to be there may find ourselves in the position of having to provide the wherewithal because after these banquets and feasts there generally have to be substantial accounts squared.</P>
      <P>We should like to know where the provision will come from at a time when the population, as has been described by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, is groaning under the weight of taxation.  To such a pass have they been reduced, he said recently, that they were unable to buy the barest necessaries of life.  They were crippled by the high cost of living. The Budget was a mockery of the sufferings of the ordinary people.</P>
      <P>How, then, is that population, overwhelmed by all these burdens and difficulties of the time, to provide the necessary revenues?  Are they to be provided through additional insurance contributions?  Are we to get back to the basis of insurance in regard to our social welfare schemes?  Are they to be provided through taxation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time before we got into office in 1951, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Morrissey, speaking at the annual dinner of the Association of Advertising Agencies, referred to the fact that the standards of living of the people seemed to be very satisfactory.  He could not understand how anybody could believe that away back in 1951 they found it hard to purchase, as was suggested, the <Col N="536" /> necessaries of life.  &ldquo;This question,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is of particular significance at a time when adequate rations of essential foodstuffs are available to all our citizens at prices so low as to require exchequer subsidies of over £11,000,000 this year.&rdquo;  He went on to say that expenditure on drink, tobacco and amusements had dropped since 1948 and amounted to no less than £44,000,000 in 1949, or one-eighth of the national income.  The quantity of beer and spirits consumed in 1949 was nearly 50 per cent. over pre-war.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach was rather worried during the general election about the price of whiskey.  I have just read what Deputy Morrissey, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, spoke of early in 1951.  I have been supplied with figures giving the 1952 Estimate.  That was the year during which the people were groaning under their misfortunes.  According to Deputy Norton, Minister for Industry and Commerce, the toiling masses could not make ends meet.  They could not provide the barest necessaries of life. What was the position in 1952?</P>
      <P>In 1938 there were £22,500,000 spent on drink, tobacco and amusements.  In 1949, which Deputy Morrissey referred to, there were £44,000,000 spent, nearly double.  In 1952 there were £57,000,000 spent on drink, beer and amusements so that it had gone up, although there was a greater national income, from one-eighth in 1948 to one-seventh in 1952.  As regards the quantities of beer and spirits, taking the year 1953 for which we have the figures, we find that in 1949 there were 671,000 standard barrels of beer consumed and in 1953 there were 865,000 barrels.  As regards spirits, the Taoiseach will be reassured to know that, whereas in 1939 we consumed 700,000 proof gallons of potable spirits, in 1953 we consumed 790,000 gallons even at a substantial increase in price.  In 1953, therefore, we were consuming 30 per cent. more beer and 13 per cent. more whiskey than in 1939.</P>

      <P>I listened with some interest to the speech made by Deputy McGilligan, which was the only speech of any length made on this motion.  I threw my mind back a few months ago when we were concerned with getting an estimate from the voters as to what would be in their best interests in the shape of a future Government.  I heard speakers on the Labour platform using the expression which was referred to by Deputy Lemass.  Fianna Fáil, it was said, was the Party that had removed from the table of the working man bread, butter, tea and sugar.  In the constituencies of urban areas the working classes were led to believe that if there could be brought about a change of Government there would be drastic reductions in the cost of living, and the election was, in fact, a bread-and-butter issue.  Now we are told that the only single concession that is to be made in this financial year is to be a reduction of 5d. per lb. in butter. The tea and the sugar and the bread can remain as they are, and as Deputy Lemass pointed out, the tea can very easily become a dearer commodity because the price of tea is beyond our control; and the question has been put to the Minister&mdash;perhaps he will answer it&mdash;even if he does not propose at the present moment to give any further concession by way of relief in the cost of living, is it his intention, and will he make a statement to the country that if commodities such as tea are to become dearer he will safeguard the people against whatever increase may take place, or that at least even if he does not reduce the cost of living he will prevent a further rise in the cost of living?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget on which the election was fought was described here in this House by the members who are now making up the Government as the austerity Budget.  Are we to take it now that the Minister for Finance on behalf of all those groups which make up this present government is donning the mantle of austerity, or is it a fact, as I am prepared to suggest, that what was described as austerity is in fact a misnomer?  I remember the remarks that were passed here about the reliefs in the Budget.  It was called a halfpenny <Col N="538" /> Budget.  Deputy Derrig has pointed out quite rightly that particularly in the city constituencies where working-class people are in the main the mass of the people there are houses into which as many as between 20 and 30 loaves of bread go in every week as the main item of diet.  Five-pence in the lb. off butter in that case is far less relief than ½d. in the 2-lb. loaf.  I have examined this matter&mdash;and I see Deputy Tully laughing.  I have examined it in my own constituency and I am satisfied that if this Government, instead of giving 5d off the butter by way of relief, had given another ½d off the 2 lb. loaf they would have brought far greater relief and benefit to the people.  The Minister for Finance may laugh.  I do not know how it affects his own constituency but I think that he will find as time goes on that the people are not so easily fooled.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, in describing our Budget as containing morsels in a mousetrap will find that that will rebound on him.  It will rebound particularly on the Labour Party.  Certainly 5d. in the lb. of butter is indeed a tiny morsel in a very small mousetrap.</P>

I will admit that a lot of them were very irresponsible, for which I suppose no Government can be held responsible, but I have heard and seen on the eve of the election the machine working, a machine of deception pouring out deceit.  I have seen motions <Col N="539" /> introduced in local authorities, including Dublin Corporation, to transfer from the backs of the ratepayers to the national Exchequer payments which are now made by local authorities. We will see if Deputy O'Higgins will now issue a leaflet, as he did before this election, with a list of names of the city members who, as he put it, voted against the reduction in rates&mdash; a motion by him, a Deputy and a member of the local authority, who in the whole period of his representation of the ratepayers never once attended a finance committee meeting to examine and discuss and show how ½d. in the rates could be saved.  Nevertheless he gets up and in his election address utilises this as a further means of getting the people to support him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey interjected here at least once, saying that there was going to be at least £4,000,000 saved in not going ahead with the Dublin Castle scheme.  First of all, that £4,000,000 is £4,000,000 and no longer £20,000,000. When Fine Gael were on this side of the House, they went throughout the country, particularly in the by-elections in the constituencies not adjacent to the city, telling the people that the Fianna Fáil Government was spending £20,000,000 on Dublin Castle. Now it is £4,000,000.  But it is £4,000,000 over a period of 20 years. I want to ask the Minister was Deputy Morrissey speaking with authority, and has he told the House that it has now become the policy of the Government to abandon this work for the reconstruction and repair of Dublin Castle, because the Dublin workmen, who even in a sense are in very small numbers employed in little preliminary activities, will look to such a decision with great regret and with great disappointment, because after all the people who now form this inter-Party Government have led the public to believe that even if they cannot find work through industrial development to employ all our people they are at least going to end unemployment.</P>

      <P>As many people as can possibly be engaged in the building of houses in the City of Dublin are now fully employed.  If the Deputy would consult with his own colleagues on Dublin Corporation he would find that out.</P>
      <P>Of very special interest&mdash;and I have not heard the Minister make any reference to it; maybe he will&mdash;is the national development fund which was passed by the last Government making available a sum of £5,000,000 per year for four or five years out of which large-scale subsidies could be given to local authorities to conduct certain types of work in order that unemployed people could be taken into employment.  I want to know is that going to continue.  The Dublin Corporation hoped, and still hope, that they will be enabled to continue to make this contribution towards the bringing about of some relief in the employment of some 1,200 to 1,400 men on this kind of special works which is mainly supported out of this particular fund.  I want to know is that going to be a form of relief of expenditures or is it going to be continued.</P>
      <P>I have seen reference to the condition of the people in this last election, that a change of Government will mean an end to starvation.  Either there was starvation or there was not. If there was, how is it going to be ended?  There was to be an end of unemployment.  I do not know to what extent unemployment has been cured since the change of Government.  We were to have the repatriation of external assets to such an extent that capital moneys would be provided for capital works at a very low rate of interest.  I want to know when this programme is to be put into effect and when are these things going to be done.</P>

    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Byrne has left the House&mdash;he is going to have some very difficult explanations to <Col N="541" /> make to his constituents.  I know for a fact that he has more or less committed himself to the loaf being brought down from its present price of 8½d. to something like 6½d.</P>

      <P>From the top of the stick on which he carried it around as his election poster.  He is going to have some very heavy explaining to do with regard to that.</P>
      <P>It is correct to say that the Labour candidates throughout the campaign gave the people to understand that if they were returned in sufficiently large numbers to be a deciding factor in the forming of a Government, they were going to extract a price and that price was to be a reduction of taxation and a reduction in the cost of living. Deputy Lemass has challenged Labour, some Labour spokesman, to tell the House whether that bargain has been struck, or whether the butter is going to grease the palm of abeyance and whether we will know next year what other items is to be used as a further morsel.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan made a reference to broken promises, the promises which he alleged were made by Fianna Fáil all down the years since 1928 to the 1951 election and his intervention in the debate appeared to me to have the implication: &ldquo;Take us&mdash;we are the lesser of two evils because the promises we broke were fewer in number and fewer in effect.&rdquo;  I am not going to make comparisons in relation to broken promises, but I should like to hear the Minister amplify what Deputy McGilligan said.  He has said that this Government has taken over substantial debts and I want to know what is meant by that.  He referred to what is called the debt under short term borrowing.  We will see what the the figures are because in the White Papers we can get details of the State finances&mdash;what we owe by way of scrip and by way of money borrowed on short term loan&mdash;and it would be unfair for the Minister for Finance to allow that statement to go without giving us some figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that there is a very <Col N="542" /> poor hope for young people when we hear Deputy McGilligan giving as one example of how economies are to be effected&mdash;he estimates that there is a wastage in the Civil Service of some 1,500 persons per year&mdash;to have no take in to the Civil Service.  That is a very poor outlook for the young people who may have been hoping to make their careers in our Civil Service when they find that for a great number of years that opening is no longer available.  I do not know what alternative employment can be made available for that type of young person, male and female.  However, that is a matter about which we will hear more.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, although he denied when Deputy Lemass was speaking that he had used the figure of £20,000,000 as a possible saving, inadvertently referred to the possibility of a £20,000,000 per annum saving when reading his broadcast speech.  I do not know how that is to be done. Are there to be economies and savings to the extent of £20,000,000 in one year, or is the saving to be at the rate of £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 a year, culminating at the end of the five years period for which the Government hope to remain in office in a reduction of national expenditure of £20,000,000? There is no use in our trying to badger each other as to what was promised and what was not.  The public will react when they get the first opportuntity.  They know what they believed was being promised and there is no use in Deputies coming here and saying: &ldquo;We did not mean that,&rdquo; and &ldquo;We did not mean this&rdquo;. Every house in the City of Dublin was canvassed on behalf of most of the Parties and every canvasser told in detail the results that would flow from a change of Government.</P>

      <P>The main burden of the propaganda, in the advertisements, in the canvassing and in the public speeches was a reduction in the cost of living and a reduction in taxation. <Col N="543" /> I have said, and I now repeat, that if Fine Gael and Labour combined could do what they promised to do and did it, I would say that they deserved the confidence of the people and deserved to be the Government, but that if they promised to do something and failed to do it, they deserved the thrashing they will get from the public at the next general election.</P>
