      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether Aer Lingus are making arrangements to open their own office in Cork City; and, if so, whether he is prepared to represent to Aer Lingus that such expenditure should not be incurred, having regard to the fact that the company has already three regular agents in Cork who are capable of handling all the business available in the Cork area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the fact that only five Irishowned ships of a total dead weight tonnage of 435 tons are engaged in traffic between Irish ports, it is proposed to review the construction programme of Irish Shipping Limited, so as to provide vessels suitable to such coastal trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the fact that the percentage of <Col N="546" /> Irish registered vessels engaged in direct trade between Irish and British ports represents less than 30 per cent. of the total tonnage of all vessels engaged in such trade, it is proposed to review the construction programme of Irish Shipping, Limited, with a view to providing the Irish mercantile marine with vessels suitable to such trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together, because it is not practicable in this context to distinguish between vessels suitable for the cross-Channel and coastal trades.</P>
      <P>The possibility of further participation by Irish tonnage in the cross-Channel and coastal trades has been under examination by Irish Shipping, Limited, for some time.  When the examination has been completed and I have had an opportunity of considering the report that will be made to me by the company, I propose to review the question fully.  I should inform the Deputy that the company have acquired a coastal tanker of 3,350 tons dead weight and a collier of 1,400 tons dead weight.  A second collier of the same tonnage is under construction and the acquisition of a third collier is contemplated.  All these vessels are suitable for the cross-Channel and coastal trades, and they are, of course, in addition to the deep sea tonnage which the company have acquired or will acquire and which will provide for the import of our minimum essential requirements in the event of war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the maximum tonnage of ships which can enter the following Irish ports to load and discharge cargo:&mdash;Wicklow, Arklow, Wexford, Waterford, Dungarvan, Youghal, Kinsale, Tralee, Limerick, Galway, Westport, Sligo, Dundalk, and Drogheda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The size of vessels which can be accommodated with safety at Irish ports is determined by each harbour authority concerned. The principal determining factor is the draught of vessels, but length, breadth <Col N="547" /> or tonnage may also be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Particulars of the depths and the range of tides in the principal Irish ports, including those referred to in the question, are shown in the Shipping Handbook, 1954, published and issued under the direction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Copy of the handbook has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that the price of pigs at present is at an uneconomic level for farmers; and, if so, what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the prospect of lower feeding costs, I consider that pig production will be maintained on a profitable basis.  Under the Pigs and Bacon <Col N="549" /> Agreement of 1951 with Britain, the price paid by the Ministry of Food for our exports will continue to be linked for at least two years with the price guaranteed to the British farmer. Arrangements were made under that agreement last month whereby our exports to the Ministry of Food will in future take the form of bacon, as the bulk purchase of fresh meat is ceasing in Britain.  These arrangements preserve the fundamental price relationship established by the 1951 agreement and there will be no limit to the quantity of bacon that may be sold to the Minister of Food.  There is, therefore, an assured market for our entire exportable surplus.</P>
      <P>In addition, the British authorities have now agreed that, after decontrol, pork carcases may be sent to Britain on a trader to trader basis without restriction as to the weight of the carcase.  The position with respect to the weight of such pork carcases may be reviewed from time to time.</P>

      <P>Last night, I dealt with the position confronting us here.  We are arguing here as to whether promises were made during the election campaign and as to the extent to which these promises were understood. It has been suggested that no promises were made.  I suggest that the electorate must have understood that some promises were made, and I have here a report in the <i>Irish Press</i> of May 21st of a speech made by Deputy Alderman Alfred Byrne, when returning a vote of thanks to the Returning Officer in his constituency.  The heading is &ldquo;People Expect Promises to be kept.&rdquo; Obviously, Deputy Byrne, who is, if I may say so, in external association with the Coalition, believed promises were made, because he says according to this report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Alderman A. Byrne, returning thanks to the Presiding Officer, Mr. W.G. Fallon, B.L., after the count in Dublin North-East, said he had entered the election on a bread and butter issue alone and wanted his colleagues, who were going to make a new Government, to understand that the public would expect from them some fulfilment of the promises given by them and by most of the candidates that the cost of living must come down.  Something must be done to give those people some expression of practical thanks for putting those who were going to support the Coalition Government in the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>

      <Col N="554" /> I take it from that that Deputy Alderman Byrne, like those of us over here, believed promises were made.  It is now suggested no promises were made and that the earnest expressed and demonstrated by 5d. off the lb. of butter is all that will be done in this financial year.  I told Deputy A. Byrne last night that I would not like to be in his position, facing his voters, if all he can do for them in this year is to tell them that 5d. off the lb. of butter is the beginning and end of all he understood was going to be done.</P>

      <P>That interjection was made last night&mdash;&ldquo;not a bad start&rdquo;. My answer is that it is a start, but that it is going to be a very slow run movement.  The people are not going to be satisfied, from what I know of the voters of the City of Dublin, and, mind you, it is the cities that accepted those promises and acted on them and gave the return, if you like, that brought about a majority of the inter-Party people.  These are the people who will demonstrate, when the opportunity arises, as to whether they were fooled or not.  I feel that when they do get the opportunity the decision will be a final one on their part with regard to accepting promises made by the groups which make up the inter-Party Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Deputies have a very great responsibility, and I do not know whether they are going to be satisfied with this position.  As well as reading the speeches of our opponents, those parts of them which were reported, we also listened to their speeches.  We heard Deputies who are in this House saying that they were going to end the present starvation of the people, the undernourishment of them, the present unemployment and so forth.  But all that the people who were addressed in those terms are going to get is 5d. off the lb. of butter.  We are told it is not a bad start.  I say that Fianna Fáil recognised their responsibilities and did their best to try to get the people to understand the things they knew they had to do in the best interests of <Col N="555" /> the people and the country, and that they were not going to seek office on irresponsible suggestions, statements or promises.  They stood over their policy, and now the people have the result.</P>

      <P>My conscience is quite clear.  I wonder if the conscience of the Deputy who has interrupted is as clear as mine on this issue?  I did not fool the people.  I told them not to believe our opponents.  I told them that when the results came, if our opponents got into office, they would recognise the extent to which they were being fooled, and of the contempt those candidates had of the ability of the people to judge them.  I described the election campaign as one of contempt by the members of those Parties.  I can see no reason for changing my opinion.  During the campaign, I engaged in a debate with a Deputy from a Dublin constituency in the university.  I challenged the Deputy on that occasion to tell the students of the university&mdash;he is a lecturer in economics&mdash;how you could reduce taxation and reduce the cost of living at one and the same time.</P>

The answer to the question was his promise that the price of drink would be reduced to such a level that revenue would be so much greater that the subsidies could be paid out of it.  My recollection is that my answer to the Deputy was that the people who had given their lives and their freedom for this country would not have died happy if they had thought that the future of Ireland was to depend on a beer drinking and whiskey sodden people.  I said that in the presence of the Deputy in the university.  What about a reduction in the price of beer and spirits now?  Were not the people led to believe that the working man's nourishment, the pint, was going to <Col N="556" /> come down in price?  There is no use in saying now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In 1948, shortly after the introduction of a Budget by the Fianna Fáil Government, the Coalition Government which succeeded it did not hesitate to remove what they call those penal taxes on beer and whiskey. Therefore, they have a precedent to do that again if they wish to implement that promise, on the hope and calculations of the lecturer in economics that the additional income to the revenue might help them to bring about a situation of being able to meet the difference.  I say do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass yesterday gave an undertaking, particularly to the Deputies on the Labour Benches, that he will introduce certain amendments to this Bill on the Committee Stage, amendments which they can then vote on.  We shall then have the spectacle, not by a paid advertisement in the newspapers, of being able to record the names of the Deputies of this House who voted against a reduction in the price of bread and a reduction in the price of drink.  That will not be done by a paid advertisement to mislead the people, but will be a factual demonstration of how easy it is to mislead the people on the eve of an election. I have always had regard for the seriousness of some Deputies with whom I have contacts not only here but in another place, and of their efforts for the welfare and well-being of the people.  I work with some of them in another place.  We are concerned <Col N="557" /> about some matters at this moment.  I want the Minister for Finance to answer me this: whether he is going to continue the means of giving employment from the new Capital Development Fund, or is that also going to be stopped?  Are we going to see the small number of people whom we have been able to assist into employment in our local authority effort continued in that, or is that also going to go by the board?  Are the unemployed who were promised full employment with a change of Government going to be continued in the condition they are in?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan had better not make that reference.  I would have hesitated to make any reference to it because I am not going to invite them to lie down on O'Connell Street.  With regard to what the Deputy has said, they may be induced to lie down again and may invite Deputies, as they did on a previous occasion, to meet them outside Leinster House and address them again.  The weapon is now in your hands and you can give them the employment that you promised them. Again, all this is unfair treatment to the people who cannot be expected to believe that a situation such as occurred could again occur.  I believe that the vast number of people who supported the inter-Party groups believed that they were going to get some reliefs, and some benefits, from the situation to which they had been accustomed, and as a Deputy said, were groaning under.  Now, they will have to continue the groaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to delay the House. I feel very serious about this.  I feel disappointed, not because Fianna Fáil are no longer in office, but because there are so many people who have been so disillusioned that the whole approach to democratic government is being reconsidered by a great number of them.  That is how they feel when candidates of supposedly responsible Parties come forward, print literature and make speeches, and then, when <Col N="558" /> they are questioned on these, give a legal interpretation and say that they never said they were going to reduce taxes, and never said that they were going to reduce the cost of living.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to put again this question that I put last night to the Minister for Finance in clear form. We are not going to have any further reductions in foodstuffs this year, certainly not by Government action. I want to know from the Minister for Finance or possibly from some spokesman on the Labour Benches if commodities rise beyond the present prices &mdash;essential commodities&mdash;will the Government give an undertaking that the people will be protected from the impact on their week to week existence? Will the Government undertake that if tea goes up beyond its present price, if it goes up beyond the price that our opponents were shouting about, will they reintroduce some form of subsidy to keep it at the present level?</P>

      <P>It was pitiful last evening to see Deputy Lemass, who is well known as being very well able to put a good face on a very bad case, endeavouring to make it appear that he was sincere and honest about his motion.  Nobody knew better than Deputy Lemass that his motion was simply a cheap political trick.  It was an endeavour to say and to induce the people of this country to believe that the Parties forming this Government, because they secured a majority and formed the Government, had immediately thrust upon them the responsibility of carrying out immediately every point in their several programmes. The Labour Party published a programme of 14 points and that was a programme that the Labour Party Government, if elected to office, would implement or strive to implement during the term of office of five years, or, perhaps, if necessary, a longer period.  We never implied and never said that immediately we became a Government we would nationalise the flour mills, reduce the cost of living and put everyone into employment and do all the things that we aimed at doing for this country when and if we had secured the office of Government. Nobody in this country believes that. Then the Opposition attempt to put down a form of motion as if we had broken our undertaking.  That, I suggest, is a cheap, mean political trick <Col N="560" /> which will not fool the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak only because I wish to take advantage of the opportunity of saying that I stand over every word of what the Labour Party stated in their programme and what I said on behalf of the Labour Party in this House.  We will implement, as quickly and in as good a way as we can, by every means in our power the general points we printed and spoke about here.  We are a common-sense people.  The last Government were challenged by us and by Fine Gael and by other Parties in this Government and told that they had obviously lost the confidence of the country.  Their leader had said that the general election was imminent. We said: &ldquo;Do not wait until you form a Budget to have the election but give our people an opportunity so that if they are returned to power they will have time to introduce a Budget to implement the programmes they have promised to the people.&rdquo; What happened?  Fianna Fáil refused to do that with the help of four Independents who have since got their answer from the people of this country. Fianna Fáil held on and put us in such a position that in order that the economic life of this country could carry on and so that undue hardships would not occur we were forced to make-do with the Budget they had prepared and this Financial Resolution is simply the implementation of their programme.  We will endeavour to modify and alter it as we have already indicated in as many ways as we see fit.  But we owe no apology to anyone for doing what we do by using the material we have now and later seeing where we can make changes.  This Government was formed not by the Fine Gael Party catching a group of Labour people and saying: &ldquo;We will become a Government and you must help us.&rdquo;  As was well known and published before the formation of this Government, Fine Gael and Labour Deputies, representatives of both sides, sat for hours to discuss an agreed, common programme.  I can assure Fianna Fáil, if they are interested, that the Labour Party when it decided to go in went in with <Col N="561" /> the unanimous vote of all the labour people of this country.  I presided at a conference attended by 500 delegates from all parts of the country and they were told the exact terms on which they could go into the Government. We are quite satisfied that the Fine Gael portion of the Government will keep their word with us.  We have no worries, and we are equally satisfied that Labour's present 14-point programme will be implemented in the majority of cases.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Briscoe that the costs of essential foodstuffs for the people are not going to go up.  It is the duty of the Government to see that they do not.  On the question of tea, it is well known to members of the Government that tea should normally have been increased in price in the past couple of weeks, but, due to the action of the Government, that increase has not been passed on to the consumers.  There is always a place, there is always room and always somebody whereby the impact of an increase in prices can be avoided or delayed and, thank God, we have people in the Government who are more interested in seeing that the ordinary poor people of this country are protected and sustained than that industrialists and manufacturers will not be curtailed in their profits.</P>

We shall not have enough people in the country to do all the work that we shall provide.  We shall have to send to America, to the Dominions, to Great Britain, and to all the other places where there are emigrants from this country, to get workers to carry on all the industries that will now be started.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Speaking on behalf of the Labour Party I wish to repeat what I said here last week and earlier, when I gave the promise here on behalf of the Labour Party, that we will not take part in any Government nor will we <Col N="563" /> associate with, or sustain any Government or any group, that will not undertake to reduce costs of essential foodstuffs to a point at which the ordinary people are able to buy a sufficiency thereof.  As I said last week we welcome, as an instalment, the reduction of 5d. per lb. in the case of butter which is the most essential of the essential foodstuffs for our families and children.  That is the kind of pronouncement the working man has been looking for; it is something with which the people are delighted.  I have met Fianna Fáil supporters who have said to their own representatives: &ldquo;Why could you not have done it?  How can they do it if you could not do it?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As to the question which Fianna Fáil frequently asks: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo; mind you, it is coming from somewhere and the people are not interested in where it is coming from. So long as the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Cabinet take the responsibility for reducing the price of butter by 5d. per lb., that is all the working man is interested in.  The responsibility for running the Government rests on the Cabinet.  It is not for me or other people, who do not hold Cabinet rank, to answer these questions. Neither is it a question for the ordinary Labour supporter.  I can assure you that in my constituency I am not worrying about the question of where the money comes from.  Sufficient for me is the fact that, as an instalment, butter has been reduced by 5d. per lb.  I can say further, that there is an assurance that the question of the price of bread will be examined and, having examined wheat production in August, the need for importing wheat and the price of bread prevailing at the time, it may again be possible within a reasonable time to effect a further reduction in the cost of living. If it should be possible, I am sure there will be none more pleased to hear it than the ordinary people of the country, none more pleased to announce it than the Taoiseach and none more displeased to listen to it than members opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stood up here simply because <Col N="564" /> I understand that Deputy Lemass paid me the compliment of particular personal mention.  I want to say that I stand over what I said three years ago, what I said in my election propaganda and what I signed as a Labour candidate.  Our programme will be implemented in due course.  We are satisfied that the implementation of that programme will be welcomed by our supporters and that no tactics, designed to rattle us or confuse us, will succeed in their aim.  May I ask Labour supporters not to be fooled by the cheap fooling tactics?  Let members opposite propose a better programme if they can but we will not be fooled by their tricks; neither will the country.  We shall endeavour, with the help of the various groups supporting the Government, to work towards prosperity, happiness and employment in this country.  I hope, God willing, that we shall see our objects achieved within our five years of office.</P>

During the period of the general election campaign, there was apparently no difficulty in reducing the price of butter from 4/2 per lb. to 2/10 per lb. but to-day he is highly delighted that butter is down to only 3/9 per lb.

      <P>I am sure the Chair is. I just wanted to note the matter from the point of view of the public outside, that the efforts of the Fianna Fáil speakers to examine this Finance Bill are being made almost impossible by disorderly and continued interruptions on the part of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>We want to examine this thing as quietly as possible, because there is a lesson to be learned, not for this year, 1954, but for very many years to come&mdash;there is a lesson to be learned by the Irish people in what happened during the election and what is happening now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that the people had every right to expect that there would be a Coalition formed, if the various groups, Labour and Fine Gael, got the majority to form a Government.  They did not know exactly what the policy would be because the Fine Gael people <Col N="566" /> were very careful in their speeches throughout the country to pretend to promise the sun, moon and the stars and yet keep themselves free so that, if they got a sufficient number of candidates to form a Government independent of Labour and Clann na Poblachta, they would be free to pursue the policy that some of them would like to pursue.  During the election, however, they pretended that they were promising that butter would be reduced from 4/2 to 2/10; they pretended they were promising that tea would be reduced from 5/6 per lb. to 2/8; they pretended that they were promising that sugar would be reduced from 7d. to 4d.; that bread would be reduced from 9d. to 6½d.; that flour would be reduced from 4/2 to 2/5.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the pretence by Fine Gael that they were promising to reduce these prices to the amounts which I have stated.  The leaders kept themselves free, as far as they could, to act quite differently from what they were pretending to promise.  To leave prices for the moment, take the question of taxation. The Minister for Finance said here, as quoted by Deputy Lemass yesterday many times, that they &ldquo;had never promised to reduce taxation.&rdquo;  I would ask the people in the country to recall, <Col N="567" /> if they can, whether they voted in the belief that Fine Gael was promising, was assuring them, that they would reduce taxation.  Do the people of the country remember the poster, that was as large as the side of a house, on every hoarding round every town in the country, showing a sailor throwing boxes overboard?  What was he throwing overboard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>High taxation and high prices.  There was no time limit to it. They pretended they were promising that high taxation would go overboard immediately, and many of their speakers said they would throw it overboard immediately.  They gave colour to this promise&mdash;let us call it pretended promise, if you like&mdash;they gave colour to this pretended promise by pointing to their record in February of 1948.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, speaking here on 15th June&mdash;Volume 146, No. 2, column 95&mdash;said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We inherited a situation which it was too late to change.  Two months of the financial year had gone and obviously the year would be far advanced before Ministers had an opportunity of making a thorough study of the problems facing them in their respective spheres of administration. By then it would be too late for different financial proposals to have real operative effect in this financial year...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Too late in this financial year&mdash;but they pretended that they were promising immediate reduction in taxation by referring to what was done in February, 1948, when, within a week of taking over government, they reduced the taxes on tobacco and cigarettes, even though there was only a month or so of that financial year to run.  It was not too late to reduce these taxes, even though the financial year had only a month to run, but it is too late, according to the Minister for Finance, to fulfil the promises to reduce taxation, even though there were nine months at least of the present financial year to run when they took over office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let the Minister for Finance drop <Col N="568" /> that sort of pretence about its being too late and recall the speeches that they made throughout the country, that they were going to reduce taxation, that it only took them a week to do it before and let the people vote for them and they would see that they would do it again and do it in double quick time.  There was nothing on the poster that was all round the country that it would be too late to reduce taxation&mdash;they were going to throw it overboard immediately and there was no time limit stipulated.</P>
    <P>As to the statement by the Minister for Finance, which I quoted, that it would be too late for different financial proposals to have real operative effect in this financial year, surely if they were to reduce the price of beer and cigarettes and reduce income-tax and all the rest of it for nine months of the year, it would merely be carrying out what they pretended to promise and it would have operative effect for nine months.  Had they been as quick off their mark on 15th June this year as they were on 18th February, 1948, beer, cigarettes and tobacco would have been reduced for this last couple of weeks and would remain reduced for the rest of the financial year.</P>
    <P>The lesson the people have to learn from all this is that they should not take the Fine Gael promises at their face value, or the promises that they were pretending to make, if they say they were not making promises.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael attitude during the election reminded me of a gentleman who used to visit a fair that I used to frequent when I was young.  He had a piece of paper.  The first thing he put into it was a gold watch.  Then he would offer it for £1 and, if there were no buyers, he would take out a £1 note and pretend to put the £1 note in the piece of paper and say that all he wanted for it was £1.  If there were no buyers for that, he would put in another £1 note and offer the whole lot for £1.  I saw a young man buying the piece of paper for a £1 expecting he would find not only a gold watch but a couple of pounds in it as well, but all he got in the piece of paper <Col N="569" /> for his £1 was an old brass thing worth 1/- or 2/-.</P>
    <P>That is what the Fine Gael people were trying to do.  They offered an alternative Government to the Fianna Fáil Government.  In addition to that, they pretended that with that alternative Government they were going to reduce all these prices back to the level of 1951 and to reduce the taxation on beer and cigarettes immediately, as they did in 1948.  The people will parse their statements on the next occasion as the Minister for Education, Deputy Mulcahy, asked us to parse his statement that he made during the election, &ldquo;The first task of Fine Gael would be to reduce taxation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>But we have not only to look at what Fine Gael pretended they were promising while, as they claim, keeping themselves free, but we also have to look at what all their fellowtravellers were promising around the country.  This is a rather typical speech which was made by a Clann na Poblachta candidate as published in the <i>Western People</i> on the 15th May. He gave undertakings, according to the report, &ldquo;that, if returned to Dáil Éireann, he would reduce the cost of living, which was crazy, and, above all, reduce the tea, sugar, bread, porter and tobacco, as these are commodities upon which the poor and middle class exist.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass yesterday pointed out that Deputy Dunne, who is one of the leaders of the Labour Party, promised in County Meath, as published in the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> of the 15th May:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before the Labour Party would participate in a Government with any Party or groups of Parties they would insist that the prices of bread, butter, tea, sugar, tobacco and the workers' pint must be reduced and reduced immediately.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact is that as far as their promises were concerned, Fine Gael and their satellite Parties played a very despicable trick&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All we can do on this occasion is to point out to the people how they were fooled so that they may keep their eyes open and be looking out for similar deception in the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan, when his own particular constituency was at stake, was a little bit more outspoken in his promises than the other members of Fine Gael.  Of course he had made up his mind that he was not going to face the music as Minister for Finance if he got back, that he would try to get on a soft and permanent seat, and he left Deputy Sweetman to hold the baby and fulfil the promises that he made.  One of the promises that Deputy McGilligan made was published in the <i>Independent</i> of May 17th: &ldquo;There is abundant money to pay the arrears and Fine Gael is pledged to the payment&rdquo;.  Not only were they going to pay the arrears which they said were due to the civil servants, but they indicated that there were tons of money to pay them and that they would be paid on the nail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance to parse this statement just as the Minister for Education asked us to parse his statement, that it would be the first task of Fine Gael to reduce taxation.  Deputy McGilligan said in his letter to the <i>Independent:</i>&ldquo;There is abundant money to pay the arrears &mdash;it is lying there&mdash;and Fine Gael is pledged to the payment&rdquo;.  A lot of civil servants, some of them at any rate, after having seen this statement, wanted an extra £10 or £20 and they wanted it quickly, thought that all they had to do was to see that Fine Gael got in, that there was plenty of money that Fianna Fáil would not give them and that Fine Gael was pledged to give it to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the Labour Party were, as I said, more outspoken in their promises than Fine Gael.  Fine Gael pretended that they were promising <Col N="571" /> to reduce prices, but the Labour Party committed themselves quite openly about it.  The Labour Party programme published in the <i>Independent</i> on the 5th April says: &ldquo;The Party will, according to Mr. Norton's statement, seek to reduce food prices by the use of subsidies on essential foods and to reduce the prices of tobacco, cigarettes, beer and spirits and to exercise a strict control of prices&rdquo;. The Labour Party would not be satisfied unless Fianna Fáil would reduce tea from 5/6 to 2/8; butter from 4/2 to 2/10; sugar from 7d. to 4d.; bread from 9d. to 6½d., and flour from 4/2 to 2/5, but they were quite prepared to take a very slight reduction in the cost of living by the additional subsidy on butter.</P>
    <P>The question that anybody must ask is, how is this £1,250,000 going to be raised?  It is not going to be raised, I take it, equally off all the butter consumers, but somebody has to pay for it some time.  If the farmers are to get the present price for milk, somebody has to pay the farmer's price, plus the manufacturing costs, plus the distributing costs.  That amounted to 4/4 and that 4/4 has to be paid.  If it is not paid by the consumer, then it has to be met either by the farmer or the taxpayer.  Taking it that the present price is paid to the farmer, if it is not paid by the consumer it has to be paid by the taxpayer.  The taxpayer need not think he can avoid paying it simply because it is not charged this year.  If it is not collected in taxes this year and is met by borrowed money, it will be paid on the double next year and the following year.</P>
    <P>Where are the Fine Gael people going to stop in this?  This is a time when the Minister for Finance should answer this question fairly and plainly for the people as a whole.  Many thinking people are worried as to how this country is going to progress in future. Are we to continue mounting up the dead weight public debt until the interest charge upon it mounts to as high as the present budgetary income which we use for all purposes?  It will not be too many years if we continue <Col N="572" /> mounting up debt charged with 3, 4 or 5 per cent. interest, until the interest and the Sinking Fund will require a large proportion of our present income from taxation.  In fact, the dead weight national debt added by the Coalition in three and a half years required £4,500,000 to pay the interest and Sinking Fund upon it.  Is that to continue? Are they going to add within the next few years dead weight debt to pay for butter subsidies to please the Labour Party, to increase Civil Service salaries to please the civil servants, and to pay other sums that might be pleasing to various sections?  Are they going to add another £90,000,000 to the dead weight debt?  Is it going to require another £4,500,000 taxation to pay the interest and Sinking Fund upon that dead weight debt for the next 40 years?</P>
    <P>It is all very fine for the Fine Gael lawyers, the 15 of them, to sit upon the chest of the Irish nation for the next two or three years with the support of the Labour Party and Clann na Poblachta.  Some of them may get permanent jobs out of the arrangement. There is no doubt Deputy McGilligan hopes to do that.</P>

      <P>When the Minister is concluding this debate, I want him to indicate not only why he is not implementing the promises they made but to give some reasonably clear statement of the financial policy for the coming 12 months.  That would be in order on the Budget.  We gave the Minister for Finance plenty of time to make up his mind about it.</P>
      <P>Anyone who listened to the various debates here and the election speeches would think the Minister for Finance or any member of the Fine Gael Party would require no time to put down clearly the financial policy which they intend to pursue.  When the Financial Resolutions were passed last week, we did not drag the matter out.  We passed them with a very cursory debate, hoping that, by this week, we should hear something from the Minister for Finance on the long-term financial policy of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Finance quite clearly if the intention of this Government is to avoid collecting sufficient taxation to meet the current expenses of Government and to pay the butter subsidy, the civil servants and a lot of other things, by adding to the dead weight debt of the country.  If that is to be the situation, I want to point out to the supporters of Fine Gael that not only will the consequences of that policy be felt by Fianna Fáil supporters but it will be felt by supporters of all Parties and that if there were to be competition between the various Parties in this Dáil as to which could become the most popular, by avoiding the ordinary responsibilities of government to collect what they spend, it would be a very bad day for this country and it would not be very long until some caretaker Government appointed, as in other countries, from month to month would have to be begging on the doorstep <Col N="575" /> of some foreign power for the money it needed to meet its current liabilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the main point in this debate is to develop the idea that the Irish people will have no opportunity in the future to judge the economic issues of the day if the Parties come before them and make utterly irresponsible statements in regard to the responsibility of the Government of the day for the increases in the cost of living and, by means of panic statements and wild promises, succeed in deluding a portion of the people who have neither the time nor the inclination to study economic documents, to read about what is going on in the world outside or to make any comparisons as to how they have been treated in relation to other people in the matter of prices.</P>
      <P>Since the end of the war, we have been through this period of wild talk about prices on two occasions.  This is not the first effort of the inter-Party Government to secure office by telling wild untruths and making exaggerated statements about the cost of living. Apparently they decided that, as it succeeded fairly well in the 1948 General Election, they would try it again.  I should like to make a certain comparison between the two periods.</P>
      <P>In 1948, the position was that the cost of living had previously risen rather sharply&mdash;in 1946-47, I think&mdash;by about 10 per cent.  It rose because money became more quickly available than goods.  That happened not only in this country but in every country in Europe.  In the period 1943 to 1946, as a result of measures taken by the then Government and of war-time controls everywhere, the cost of living remained stable.  But, beginning in August, 1946, the cost of living here rose sharply.  The Coalition groups thought they would take the opportunity of spreading panic among the people by giving them the impression that the cost of living had gone out of control, that the Government had ceased to be active and had ceased to consider the interests of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> For a period of three or four months, there was the wildest lying and filthy propaganda designed only to deceive the innocent.  During the course of that propaganda campaign, promises were made not to make the cost of living stable, not to prevent it from going up further, not even to put a brake on it or to reduce it by whatever small modicum could be found possible: the promises were to the effect that the cost of living would be slashed.  The impression was given that it was like a balloon that could be pricked with the pin of Coalition policy and burst almost overnight.  The people were given to understand that all that was required was a Government sufficiently vigilant to prosecute a few key profiteers in every industry, sufficiently vigilant to bring them to a court of law and there prove that they had profited excessively and that they had been protected by the Fianna Fáil Government because they had paid lavish sums to the Fianna Fáil Party funds.  The impression was given that the moment price control machinery was put into operation by the new Government, prices would be slashed, the cost of foodstuffs would go down and it would be proved that, by 1947, the Fianna Fáil Government were tired out after a lengthy period of office&mdash;that they were old men unfit for their job who had been guilty of the gravest corruption through the use of funds obtained in a corrupt way from leading industrialists and trading groups in the country with the object of maintaining high prices and high post-war profits.</P>
    <P>We had the present Minister for Industry and Commerce telling everybody in Dublin that there were rich men going around in big cars who deserved to be prosecuted and who would be prosecuted if he had a chance of doing so.  Deputy MacBride, who was Minister for External Affairs in the Coalition Government, made a solemn promise, many times repeated, that he would reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent. if he secured office. Although he was informed that the subsidies to effect that would amount to £30,000,000 a year, it did not deter him from making these extravagant statements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> Let us examine the record of those Parties who formed the first Coalition Government.  What happened?  There was not a single reduction in the price of any important commodity either immediately or thereafter for the ensuing three years.  At one time, they produced a list of commodities whose prices had been reduced by 3 per cent.: these commodities included knife sharpeners and similar articles of no importance.</P>
    <P>Not a single person was prosecuted by a court for profiteering, as a result of the first Coalition Government's taking office.  They searched the files in the Department of Industry and Commerce for profiteers but could not find any.  They could not find any group of profiteers and no industrial group or trading group was prosecuted either individually or collectively.  Nobody was brought before the bar of public opinion and told that they had illgotten gains, that they would have to pay for it and that the cost of their commodity would have to come down with a bang.  None of those promises whatsoever was fulfilled.  You had the extraordinary spectacle of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the course of his speeches, continuing to decry the community of merchants as profiteers, and of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, going to banquets and saying to these same merchants that only a negligible percentage of them ever engaged in profiteering.  We heard Deputy McGilligan, the then Minister for Finance, saying in the 1948 Budget that, as far as he could see, the increases in wages had gone far enough for the present to satisfy social justice, and recommending that there would be no further effort to inflate the rate of wages at that period.</P>
    <P>We saw Deputy Larkin, in September, 1948, saying at the Trade Union Congress that he was not satisfied with the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce and that he did not believe prices could not be broken.  We heard him utter the first faint murmur of protest on the part of the Labour Party that these downward prices had not been effected&mdash;promises that had so formally <Col N="578" /> and so floridly been made to the electorate.  Three or four months later, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Morrissey, suddenly admitted the grim truth.  After freeing a whole group of commodities from price control, he said at a banquet of merchants that, after all, the remedy for price control lay in the hands of the public.  In other words, his final solution of fulfilling all these wonderful promises was that the public should stop buying the goods because that was the only way in which the prices could be made to come down.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, in other countries, the tide of post-war inflation was momentarily arrested until the outbreak of the Korean war.  Labour Deputies who wish to learn the truth about all these matters would do well to study the <i>International Labour Review Statistical Supplement,</i> Vol. 48, Nos. 4 and 5, in which are recorded, mainly in the interest of the working people, all the facts about the increases in the cost of living that took place from the time the war ended. They will find a brief period between the immediate post-war inflation and the devaluation of the dollar&mdash;indeed, a period lasting, I think, from the end of 1948 to somewhere about June 1950 &mdash;when the price rise was arrested not in all countries, because conditions vary in the different countries, but in countries where there had been some reasonable price control in operation, where the value of money was preserved by wise fiscal and economic policy and where they had been able to control their finances so as to avoid, what every country dreads, a rise in prices due to the flow of money being far greater than the volume of goods becoming available.  These figures can be examined.  There can be no gainsaying the fact that the price changes that took place were of a marginal character up to the beginning of the Korean war and were also marginal in other countries.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government could take no more credit for the stabilisation of prices which took place during those first two years than any other <Col N="579" /> Government in Europe could except to the extent that the same sort of fiscal and financial policy was adopted.  In 1949 the £ was devalued and the inter-Party Government over-anxious to show how concerned they were with prices, and not having fulfilled their wild promises that they would smash the price of commodities, fell over themselves to point out that there was not any likelihood of an increase in price as a result of the £ being worth only two dollars, 80 cents instead of four dollars, 25 cents.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon proclaimed to the whole world that although the £ had been devalued he could see no foreseeable increase whatever in the price of maize.  The Irish £ would be able to buy maize at the same price although the £ itself had been devalued.  And so for a period everything continued fairly well for the inter-Party Government because the effect of devaluation was slow.  It caused subsequent and ancillary changes in the financial position of countries throughout the world.  People adjusted their price levels for the time being and the effect of buying goods and raw materials did not result in an increase in price for them.</P>
    <P>The Korean war began.  I think it is a shameful thing that in this country the inter-Party groups are not sufficiently adult-minded to argue economic issues by admitting the general effect of the Korean inflation as being valid in this country as in every other country throughout the world.  It is a most interesting thing that if you examine the political disputes and controversies which have taken place in most European democratic States such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Great Britain, you will find that, however they may disagree, you will not discover one entire group of Parties virtually denying there ever was such a thing as the Korean inflation.  This was felt throughout the length and breadth of the living world and was evident from China to Peru and backwards east and west.</P>
    <P>During this period we had to listen to the economic arguments of petulant <Col N="580" /> schoolchildren unable to start on a reasoned basis of controversy whereby you admit the Korean inflation, start from that point, and argue whether one Government was likely to do better than another Government in combating it.  It would have been an intelligent approach to discuss how the situation could be best met and whether it could be met better by one Government or by the policy suggested by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>There may have been a small handful of people who approached the matter in this fashion.  I would like to give credit where credit is due.  During some period of the actual examination of the position, Deputy Costello, the Taoiseach, did refer to the Korean inflation as though it actually had taken place to some extent in this country, but he was alone and completely isolated among the rest of his Deputies in the Fine Gael Party.  Certainly, we never heard of the Korean inflation from the Labour Party.  Across the water and in the Six Counties, the Labour Party could discuss whether they were doing their best to deal with the Korean inflation or whether the Conservative Party was more capable. Just across the Border, where the same currency was being actually utilised, where there was roughly the same level of prices paid for agricultural goods, and where the value of money was the same as in England and the Twenty-Six Counties, the matter was discussed; but so far as the Labour Party here were concerned, they never believed that such a thing as the Korean inflation existed.</P>
    <P>The price rise analysis, in actual fact, is based generally on the year 1948, which is the standard year used by every international organisation in Europe as the basis upon which to study the post-war Korean inflation. The price level in our index rose, from August, 1950, to August, 1951, by about 11 points.  Naturally, the inter-Party Government were worried about it, but they did not have to bear the full brunt of the price rise as by that time they had left office.  They were so disturbed about it, however, that in December, 1950, we had the astonishing spectacle of two Ministers of State advocating <Col N="581" /> different policies in their water-tight compartments which must inevitably conflict with each other and which had absolutely no effect whatsoever in substantially reducing or preventing the price rise.</P>
    <P>I refer to the fatuous and idiotic price freeze Order established by the inter-Party Government in December, 1950.  No sooner was it established than category after category of goods were taken out of the list of those subject to the price freeze Order and why? Because Deputy Norton in his water-tight compartment could not conceive that prices could rise in Ireland.  They might rise everywhere else.  The price of every commodity on earth might rise but Deputy Norton in his water-tight compartment could not conceive of prices rising in Ireland.  He was like King Canute who sat on the edge of the sea and said the waters must recede.</P>
    <P>He instituted this price freeze Order and came to the Dáil.  Forgetting all that had passed since 1948, he started to talk about the profiteers and labelled them as far as he could Fianna Fáil profiteers who in some mysterious way had escaped prosecution for three long years but, by heavens, he was going to get them now and have their throats cut as a result of the price freeze Order.  At the same time, Deputy Morrissey in his Department was encouraging a spree of stockpiling which went on continuously.  We all remember what happened.  We were told by every living international economic authority that the price rise would be steep and continuous so long as the Korean war lasted and so long as the rearmament policy continued in every country. Many importers asked Deputies whether they were really supposed to obey this Order knowing that every single raw material they wanted to buy would be at least 60 per cent. higher in six months' time.  They asked whether they should buy or wait until Deputy Norton gave permission for the price freeze Order to be modified or eliminated their particular commodity from the list.</P>
    <P>Other importers said they would simply go ahead and buy, that they would not wait for the price freeze Order to be repealed.  They knew it <Col N="582" /> was crazy and they went and bought. Those traders who were supremely honest enough to wait for the price freeze Order to be repealed so far as their category of goods was concerned had to pay a great deal more three months afterwards than they would have had to pay in December, 1950. That was all because there was a lack of collective responsibility in that Government and because it was unpopular to admit that prices would rise.</P>
    <P>The Government was unable to restrain one group and make them realise that there was a time and place for a price freeze Order and that such an Order could have been established a little bit later.  At that particular moment when there was a war scare all over the world it was obviously not the thing to do to establish a price freeze Order.  That was what was supposed to be intelligent control of prices.  As I have said, following on that, the same Government decided to throw £45,000,000 of American money into circulation, and in all their speeches trying to show how much more advanced they were in economic thought than the Fianna Fáil Government they talked as though there was a classic period of recession with a fall in prices, in the cost of materials and the cost of goods, and they yelled and yelled to us from every platform about how much money they were pumping into circulation at every possible moment while the price level was rising and how they were spending £45,000,000 of American money, throwing more money into the pool and having the effect of raising prices still more.  In other words, they were applying the theory of Lord Keynes in reverse, at exactly the time when he said it should not be applied.</P>
    <P>We went through all that.  Then we had to face the same kind of propaganda in the recent general election, propaganda suggesting that all the price rises were due to the acts of Fianna Fáil, that they bore no relation whatever to the world outside.  We had, for example, an advertisement issued in one constituency which said: <Col N="583" />&ldquo;The Fianna Fáil Government increased the price of every loaf of bread by 3d., every lb. of sugar by 3d., every stone of flour by 2/-, and every lb. of butter by 1/4.&rdquo;  That was typical of thousands of pounds' worth of advertisements, money for which was expended by the inter-Party groups and published throughout the land.</P>
    <P>I asked some of the Deputies in my constituency on the Opposition side to give a factual explanation of how it was that in a neighbouring country using the same kind of money, having the same kind of agricultural prices, the same kind of prices for goods bought abroad, the price of sugar could rise during the same period as during our period of Government from 5d. to 7d. a lb., that the 2 lb. of bread could rise from 6d. to 9d., that butter could rise from 1/10 to 4/2, and so on and so forth&mdash;to answer in simple terms to the people how they could rise there and why they would not rise here.  I challenged Deputies on the Opposition side during the election to explain how it could be that five other countries, including two neutral or undamaged countries, could reduce subsidies and announce publicly that they were reducing subsidies for exactly the same reason that they were reduced here&mdash;that they could not afford to pay them, that they had become to a considerable extent unreal&mdash;how it was that those five other countries, two of which were either undamaged or neutral and one of which had made a fortune out of the war and I think three of which were run by socialist-liberal type Governments, could reduce subsidies, could do exactly the same thing as we did, reduce subsidies either the year before us, the same year as ourselves or the year after, and give higher social service benefits in part compensation for the reduction of subsidies.  I never got an answer.  No answer was ever given.  An answer was made by one Labour speaker, I think, in the election that we could not compare ourselves with any other country because other countries were at war and we were not.  Then I repeated the next week, asking why it happened in <Col N="584" /> countries that were neutral in the war but had reduced subsidies, countries that were neutral or undamaged, where the cost of living had gone up in the same measure as it had here in the same period roughly by 23 to 28 per cent. between 1948 and 1953.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is a fair period to take, as the period recognised and acknowledged, for example, by the International Labour Organisation, which is an international organisation designed to help largely the working man to improve his status and his conditions of livelihood.  The I.L.O. decided, like other organisations, that if we want to study post-war trends in living costs, we take the year 1948, that is, the year before devaluation, as the basic year, and then proceed to examine the situation and compare how various countries fared.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the implication was given quite clearly that if the inter-Party Government was elected to office they would nullify all the evil they said had been done through the increase in the price of commodities which they had published in the form of millions of pamphlets throughout this country in which 1951 and 1954 prices were compared. They blamed us entirely for those increases, made us not, shall we say, even 10 per cent or 20 per cent. or even 50 per cent. but 100 per cent. responsible for that entire inflation in prices, as though we could remain completely isolated from the rest of the world, as though every commodity could rise daily in price during that period.  As I have said, in the case of this country, we and we alone were supposed to be responsible; no other Government was responsible, no other influence was responsible, no outside influence played any part; and, of course, they very cleverly included, so far as they could, the increase in prices that took place between August 1950 and 1951, which was as great as that which took place between August 1951 and 1952.</P>
    <P>I think one must admit that it was a very difficult situation to face, to be able to explain to the public all the difficulties.  To explain to the people that prices had risen outside in the world, that they had risen for the same <Col N="585" /> reason, was a task of no uncommon magnitude.</P>
    <P>There were other promises that they made.  Deputy General MacEoin, for example, speaking in Sligo Town Hall and reported in the <i>Sligo Champion</i> on the 20th March, 1954, made a promise that they would take steps to see that the Central Fund would undertake responsibility for all expenditure which might otherwise require an increase in the rates.  We shall have to wait and see whether that promise made to the people of Sligo is implemented and the rates position will be stabilised from now on and all Government grants which are for services carried out by the local authority will be subject to any rate of increase whatever, that all Government grants whether for health or hospitalisation or anything else will be a full 100 per cent. grant and to that extent the rates will be stabilised. So far as I can gather from the recent deputation to the Minister for Health Deputy General MacEoin's promise has already been broken in regard to health matters, and the Minister for Health accepted an increase in rates as likely to take place as a result of County Westmeath's share of the burden of paying the interest and sinking fund on loans in respect of hospital improvements which are now taking place and which will be completed in the course of the next 12 months or the next three years.</P>
    <P>I might add that on that occasion Deputy General MacEoin also said that the Fine Gael Party were never the Commonwealth Party, but that is not a matter for consideration in this debate so there is no need for me to discuss that particular subject.</P>
    <P>Then we had a particularly scandalous form of propaganda in the <i>Evening Echo</i> on Tuesday, May 18th, in which the answers given to a certain newspaper by the leaders of the Parties in regard to their plans for reducing the cost of living were altered so as to make it appear that the Fianna Fáil Party was indifferent to the increase in the cost of living.  That is what I describe as very near gutter politics.</P>
    <P>The advertisement was captioned by the words &ldquo;Reduce the cost of living. <Col N="586" /> Fianna Fáil says &lsquo;no&rsquo;; Fine Gael says &lsquo;if possible we shall do so&rsquo;.&rdquo;  Then followed&mdash;&ldquo;Last week Mr. de Valera and Mr. Costello were asked to answer the question &lsquo;If returned to Government do you propose to make an Order to reduce the cost of living?&rsquo;.  The answers were given as follows:&mdash;Mr. Costello&mdash;&lsquo;The object of our policy is to reduce the cost of living to relieve the burden of present prices.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, if Deputy Costello's canvassers and all the minor members of his Party had not been rattling down all the back streets and promising that they would reduce the cost of living and slash the price of the lb. of butter and the loaf and the lb. of sugar and everything else, his statement by itself would be the rather wise and cautious statement of any Minister, of any person who had been a Minister before and who had read the whole panoply of information available to him about the levels of world prices, about the levels of Irish agricultural prices, about the general economic position of the country; but unfortunately.  Deputy Costello's supporters and the minor members of his Party did not follow his advice and see that the reductions in the cost of living were merely objects, even hopes, if you like.</P>
    <P>The answer which Mr. de Valera is alleged to have given to the question: &ldquo;Do you propose to reduce the cost of living?&rdquo; was &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the implication being clearly given that Deputy de Valera was obstinate to the point of indifference, that he did not intend to do anything about the cost of living, that he was an austerity merchant, a person who seemed to take a peculiar and sadistic delight in making people face increases in living costs and in piling taxation upon them, a person who gained some personal pleasure from that and from seeing his Government lose elections and lose by-elections. Apparently he chortled with joy on every occasion when that Government lost a by-election and he apparently suffered from some peculiar form of neurosis which resulted in pleasure in other people's unhappiness.</P>
    <P>What were the facts?  The question as put to Deputy de Valera was: If returned to power, do you propose in the coming year to reduce, the cost of living <Col N="587" /> by means of subsidies?  Deputy de Valera simply said that he did not propose to reduce the cost of living by means of subsidies.  That is flagrant and, I think, vile dishonesty on the part of an election committee to issue an advertisement in that form when the facts were that Deputy de Valera said that, with the growth of production, the stabilisation of prices abroad, the stabilisation of prices at home and the beginning of greater production all over the world, and with all the measures put into force by Fianna Fáil, most of them in 1947, to enable the farmer to increase production, he hoped that purchasing power would go up and that living costs would come down and that he thought that was the best and most profitable way of dealing with the price situation.  In this advertisement, however, he is simply alleged to have said he did not propose to reduce the cost of living.</P>
    <P>We had to face that all over the country, so we can hardly be blamed for deciding to have this debate to bring out all these facts, to try to get a sense of proportion into the whole argument concerning price increases, taxation increases and everything affecting subsidies. This Government will find it difficult, unless there is a world price decrease, to reduce living costs substantially. There may be marginal changes, but I should say that, unless there is a very drastic decrease in the price of imported wheat and in the prices of many other commodities, it will be quite impossible to implement the implied promise that prices would be brought back to the 1951 level.  In that connection, we had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, in the course of a speech made during the election, pledging himself to reduce the cost of living to as near the 1951 level, the pre-Budget of 1952 level, as he could.  That is rather like somebody promising to increase the old-age pension to the nearest he could get to 40/- and then increasing it from 21/6 to 22/6 and saying he had fulfilled his promise.</P>
    <P>Anybody can make statements and promises of that kind and, if the people get used to accepting promises at that level, we shall always have this state <Col N="588" /> of confusion in the minds of the people in regard to economics, in regard to our future economic policy, because promises made as loosely and as vaguely as that will confuse the mind of the people and they will find it difficult to make decisions, if they are not inclined to study economics at the end of their day's work and if they want to get the facts, as most of them would and as most of us would, as rapidly and as easily as possible. The people will naturally spend as little time as they need on studying the economic facts and the facts will have to be presented more truthfully to them or we will never have any real meritorious economic advance in this country.</P>
    <P>It is very important when discussing this whole subject that we should say something of a final kind on this question of the level of living costs, because there is no doubt that, if world prices should come down, if there should be a measurable decrease in the price of imported wheat and if, as a result of that, the price of home grown wheat should be reduced, if there is a continuous decrease in the price level between now and next Budget, unless it is accompanied by a recession, we may face a situation in which there is £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 with which to play, with which to provide decreases in taxation.  I am going to prophesy here and now that, when that Budget comes, although the Minister for Finance may possibly, like Deputy McGilligan in 1951, make a Budget speech which is fully in accordance with the facts, so far as world conditions are concerned, the members of his Party will do their damnedest in going around the country to take full credit for the reductions in taxation which may be the result of reductions in world prices.  Again we shall hear nothing of what goes on in the world outside.</P>
    <P>The price of American wheat might collapse by many cents a bushel and the whole of the credit for that will be taken by the inter-Party Government, except that the Minister for Finance may follow the good example of his predecessor, who, although he did leave an unbalanced Budget for <Col N="589" /> us, when presenting the international economic facts of the day in 1951, warned the House against inflation and warned the House that the Government was not paying its way and that there would have to be a radical change in economic policy.  That part of his speech made in May, 1951, was a duly correct and accurate statement, but so far as our own finances are concerned, so far as our own immediate expenditure and receipts are concerned we claim that he did not balance the Budget.</P>
    <P>The general economic analysis portion of his speech, however, was correct, and moreover in 1950, even before the Korean inflation and devaluation had had their full effect he made a speech which, in itself, was reasonably correct, but of course his supporters ignored the speech.  Deputies around him ignored his speech; Deputies down in the country ignored it; and Deputies at the by-elections ignored it.  Everybody ignored it and later, when Deputy McGilligan spoke in opposition, he ignored his two speeches&mdash;the speeches he made in regard to international facts and in regard to the general economic position of the country.</P>
    <P>We had to face these difficulties, as I have said, and it is well to remind members of the House of what has taken place recently and of the tremendous effort that will have to be made by this Government if they are to bring prices back to the 1951 level, unless there is a world collapse in prices and a substantial reduction in agricultural prices here.  Although it may perhaps bore some members, I intend to place on record in the annals of this House the figures given in the statistical statement of the <i>International Labour Review</i> setting out the increases in the cost of living which took place since the year acknowledged to be the basic year by all international organisations, the year 1948, the year before devaluation and before the Korean war.  These figures will show the position in which we left this country at the end of the Korean inflation and when stabilisation had taken place.  They will indicate <Col N="590" /> fully the difficulties any Government will have in bringing prices back, unless world conditions or home conditions aid that Government, as they will aid other Governments, by a normal reduction in the price level which I am willing to prophesy, if it takes place here, will take place in other countries in Europe as well.</P>
    <P>Taking this international statement and taking the base year 1948 as 100, the figure, by the end of 1953, for Belgium was 106.  The figure, I might add, even at the end of the inter-Party Government régime was 105. Belgium was a country where the cost of living had gone up about three times as much as it had here in the period from 1938 to 1948 and where, through a stronger currency and through enormous dollar credits from the purchase of uranium, they managed to restrain the cost of living from rising.  During the whole period of the Korean inflation they did a better job than we could possibly do because their currency was not devalued.  At the end of the period the whole world owed them money and their difficulty was getting paid for the goods they had sold.</P>
    <P>Take a country such as Denmark where, with the index base at 100 in 1948, the figure had gone up to 123 by 1953, an increase of 23 per cent.  I should, I suppose, give our figures so that people can bear them in mind in making comparisons.  Our figure for 1948 had risen to 126 by August, 1953. The Danish figure had gone up nearly as much.  I think one of the reasons perhaps why their cost of living went up a little bit less than here was the fact that their subsidies had less effect because the cost of their production of various kinds of food was slightly less than ours through longer experience in scientific methods of production.</P>
    <P>In the case of France the cost of living went up by 46 per cent. and had already gone up by very much more in the period of the great war. In Germany the cost of living had gone up by 8 per cent.  There is an example of the futility of the argument of the inter-Party Government that a country <Col N="591" /> devastated by war must have living costs greater than ours.  It shows how dangerous it is to make generalisations of that kind.  The restriction of the increase in the cost of living was due largely to the deliberate effort of their people to reconstruct their country, to the voluntary restriction of wage rates increases.  Although foodstuffs were by no means plentiful their cost of living increased considerably less than ours notwithstanding the fact that they were a devastated country, and that, I might add, would apply to the whole period from 1948 to 1953.</P>
    <P>The cost of living in Italy went up by about 16 per cent. in the same period but there again they had virtually no subsidies.  Therefore there was no automatic increase in the cost of living because no subsidies were effective as they were in most West European countries.  Furthermore the cost of living had gone up immensely more in the previous period.  They had, so to speak, taken the full measure of inflation in the previous period.</P>
    <P>In the Netherlands, the cost of living went up by 22 per cent.  The Netherlands and the whole of Scandinavia are in a group with Ireland and the United Kingdom, where the cost of living went up by approximately the same amount. In Norway the cost of living went up by 36 per cent.  I would not say that the Norwegian Government were guilty of grave inefficiency and neglect of the people because the cost of their living went up more than ours did during that period.  I merely mention the fact that there was some sort of parallel.  In Spain, the cost of living went up by 27 per cent.  Then we can take a thoroughly efficient country like Sweden where you have the kind of streamlined democracy and economic discipline that has not been found possible or desirable in this country, a country that was neutral, a country that made a fortune from selling steel to the Germans, and where the cost of living went up by 30 per cent. between 1948 and 1953 compared with our 26 per cent., compared with the Danish 23 per cent., the Norwegian 36 per cent., and the Netherlands 22 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> The cost of living in Switzerland went up by 4 per cent.  It hardly went up at all during the inter-Party period of Government or later.  The reason we were unable to emulate the Swiss, a neutral country like ourselves, was the fact that they, like the Belgians, did not devalue their currency.  They have possibly the strongest currency in the world, and for that reason they were able to buy other people's goods at far lower prices than ourselves.  I would not accuse any Government in office here any more than I would accuse the Swedes for having an austerity policy because their cost of living went up by 30 per cent. as a neutral nation compared with the Swiss increase of 4 per cent.  That would be a ridiculous argument. It would be just as ridiculous to accuse us of being responsible for increases in prices as it would be to accuse the Swedes of having neglected their excellently run country, as compared with the Swiss, because the cost of living went up by 30 per cent. in Sweden and only 4 per cent. in Switzerland. It was a matter in some cases of the comparative purchasing power of money.</P>
    <P>Last let us take the cost of living in Great Britain which went up by 30 per cent. in the same period.  I might add that in the case of Sweden, Norway, Great Britain and Ireland, although the period is not used for purposes of comparison by the International Labour Office because they do not regard the period 1950 to 1953 as a good basis of comparison, but in that period it so happened that the cost of living went up by roughly the same amount in Sweden, Norway, Great Britain and Ireland.  I would like to hear an argument showing that the Governments of any of these four countries showed scandalous neglect of their people, particularly the people of Great Britain who during that period had at their head a Socialist Government, people who showed an astonishing power of restoration at the end of the war.</P>
    <P>I have heard people in the Labour Party say that you cannot compare English prices with Irish, because the British suffered economically in a war. In actual fact anyone who knows anythink <Col N="593" /> about economics knows that so long as the two countries use the same money, pay the same prices for raw materials or semi-manufactured goods, so long as the British pay their farmers an increase in prices in the same period, in roughly the same degree as is paid here during the same relevant period, the argument that they were in a war is no argument.  If living costs went up in England by roughly 30 per cent. during that period recognised by the International Labour Organisation, it went up for reasons that were parallel to those here.  Whether or not there was a war in Great Britain and whether or not they were the victims of a war I should like to find any sane economist in the country, particularly the economists advising the Fine Gael Party, who will make the statement that the cost of living, in so far as it can be controlled by the country, should have increased less here between 1948 and 1953 than it did in England, bearing in mind, as I said, the purchasing power of the money concerned and the approximate increase in agricultural prices that took place in Great Britain and here during the parallel period, a parallel in price increases which was inevitable when we were selling to Great Britain agricultural produce of the kind that they needed and most of which they themselves were also producing.  If those facts are admitted then, of course, the parallelism in price increases is a genuine parallelism that cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>If the price of butter goes up in Great Britain from 1/10 per lb. to 4/2 over the years 1950-1953, then it is no wonder no one was able to give me an answer during the general election in my constituency as to why there should not be at least some fairly big increase in the price of butter here.  We are not talking about the margins affected by small subsidies and the 10 per cent. reduction that will take place now.  We are talking about a measured increase of some note.  As I said, I never got the answer during the whole course of the election.</P>
    <P>It is rather difficult to explain all these facts to the people down the country during an election.  We have <Col N="594" /> had experience of what we thought would take place when a new Government took office.  Once again there can be no slashing in prices.  There can be no general break-down in taxation levels.  Whereas some of the Fine Gael leaders in their speeches were careful and conservative in their statements, the promises made by their supporters and their canvassers, and the promises made by the Labour Party, are not likely to be fulfilled immediately.  There was no Fianna Fáil balloon to be burst, so to speak.  There was no frightful scandal to be unearthed and no desperate extravagances to be eliminated because there was nothing of that kind to be found, nothing which could result in any immediate improvement.  Therefore, when Labour speakers went round Westmeath and Longford and asked: &ldquo;Would you like butter to be 2/10 or 4/2 per lb.; if you want it to be 4/2 per lb., vote Fianna Fáil; if you want it to be 2/10, vote for the Labour candidate,&rdquo; the people who listened to that kind of propaganda will be grossly deceived.</P>
    <P>I will make this prophecy: the world level of butter prices will remain high in the future; butter will be, to some extent, replaced by other commodities as a feature of consumption in a great many countries.  If the consumption of butter in the United States is nine lb. per head per year, and if butter there costs something like 6/- or 7/- a lb. and if the consumption here is 39 lbs. per head per year and the costs of producing milk go up in every country in the world, I prophesy that the Labour Party speakers will not find their promises fulfilled, namely, that butter will be 2/10 per lb. a year, or even two years, hence.  It will remain one of the scarce commodities.</P>
    <P>So far as other commodities are concerned I think I had better deal again with some facts provided through the medium of the International Labour Organisation.  I mention this organisation because it can be regarded from the point of view of the working man as one that is on his side, an organisation that is not likely to be prejudiced in favour of the employer or of the farmer.  From the International Labour Organisation one can obtain figures <Col N="595" /> showing how long it takes a builder's labourer in any country to earn his main rations.  It is an interesting form of computation because if one, for example, takes the price of butter in French francs and translates that into English shillings, while that may be a rough guide as to comparative prices, there are distortions created by currency relationships and the International Labour Organisation which desires to protect the interests of the worker and present trade unions with information on how far their members are being protected in their struggle for existence and their ability to buy rationed foodstuffs decided to find out how long it would take a builder's labourer earning a basic wage, without overtime, to earn the main commodities essential to life.  That is a very fair comparative method because builders' labourers occupy roughly the same place in the economic and social life of all the main European countries and their wages are indicative of the purchasing power of the less privileged of the comunity.</P>
    <P>The statistics which I propose to quote are based on the month of October, 1952, after the Budget rise had taken place here and I think it will be somewhat difficult for the inter-Party Government to improve upon them very much.  They may make marginal improvements as a result of price decreases throughout the world, as they have done in the case of butter though they have not told us from where they are getting the money.</P>
    <P>Here are the figures.  In October, 1952, the time taken for a builder's labourer to earn 6 lbs. of bread in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark and Switzerland averaged 45 to 50 minutes.  Ireland is actually one of the two lowest of that group of five well-run, modern, democratic States, all countries with good Governments.  In the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Portugal and Italy it takes from one hour to two hours and 20 minutes.  Ireland is one of the best in Europe as evidenced by the International Labour Organisation and from that point of view it is one of the best in Europe in relation to the <Col N="596" /> capacity of a builders' labourer to earn the bread necessary for his family out of his wages.</P>
    <P>We will now take sugar.  Here, the Danes beat everybody else.  It takes a Danish builder's labourer only 21 minutes to earn 6 lbs. of sugar.  It takes Ireland, Sweden and Norway 55 to 60 minutes to earn 6 lbs. of sugar. The Swiss and the British are more or less the same with 65 to 70 minutes. Other countries take from one hour and 20 minutes up to seven hours to earn 6 lbs. of sugar.  There, again, the Irish and Danish builders' labourers are in a very good position so far as their earning capacity is concerned.</P>
    <P>We will deal with butter next.  At the time these figures were prepared, in October, 1952, we were actually fifth in Europe.  We were more or less the same as the British, but both the British and ourselves were thoroughly beaten by the Danes, the Swedes and the Norwegians, in all of which it took 37 to 45 minutes, as compared with 65 to 80 minutes in the case of Great Britain and Ireland.  That situation has been improved by the announcement made of the reduction in the price of butter by some 10 per cent., but that reduction still leaves this country fourth in Europe.  There are three countries where the builder's labourer can earn 6 lbs. of butter more quickly than his colleague is likely to do it here.  I will not blame the inter-Party Government if they cannot get down to the Scandinavian level, because I do not believe in isolating this country from other countries in making political comparisons.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why the Scandinavian level is so low is because the milking herds there are high yielding, giving 800 to 1,000 gallons per year.  As a result of that butter can be produced and sold more cheaply than it is likely to be in any country which produces cattle on the hoof for sale as beef because in such circumstances, no matter what improvement is made and irrespective of the milk yield of our cows, Ireland cannot easily be brought up to the level of those three countries.  It will still be fourth and not the best from the standpoint of how long it takes a builder's labourer <Col N="597" /> to earn a lb. of butter.  Milk is roughly in the same proportion as butter and I need not give any more figures.</P>
    <P>In connection with potatoes and sirloin beef, the Irish builder's labourer can earn his potatoes at the third quickest rate in Europe.  Denmark and Norway beat him by a slight head.  These figures are there for all to see.  I would be delighted if someone would take the trouble to get the figures for last year.  Taking sugar, bread, butter, beef and potatoes together we are not in an unsatisfactory position.  Naturally we would like the position to be better.  Perhaps when agricultural production is increased and the output per acre is greater we will find ourselves level with the Scandinavian countries in relation to milk products.  I doubt if we ever will in the case of beef so long as the British are willing to pay a price for our beef which is related to some scarcity value.</P>
    <P>I want to put these facts on record to show how difficult it will be for the inter-Party Government to get back to the 1951 price level.  Quite clearly, the import of all their promises made not, as I have said, by the more sober leaders when making official statements in the Press but by many of their canvassers, minor supporters and canditates throughout the country was to give the impression that we and we alone were responsible for all the increases in prices which had taken place since 1951, and that if we were defeated all that would be set aside.</P>
    <P>As I have said, my prophecy is that, although some slight marginal changes may be made if the Budget is balanced next year or balanced as a result of this year's financial operations, unless there is a major decrease in world prices it will not be possible for the inter-Party groups to fulfil the implied promises which they made that prices would come down not by 10 per cent., 5 per cent., or 15 per cent., but by a margin sufficient to show the utter, complete and reckless disregard of the people's interest which was alleged to be shown on the part of a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with some of the statements made by speakers on the Opposition Benches. The implication in them was that the Labour Party had betrayed the trust of the people who supported it at the recent general election.  Because of these statements from the Opposition Benches, I should like briefly to relate some of the facts of the case, so far as the Labour Party is concerned.  When we went into this general election, I think it can be honestly said that we were not guilty of any lying propaganda, Deputy Childers notwithstanding. We put the full Labour policy before the people and took care to say that we could not implement that full Labour Party policy.  We did, as Deputy Childers has said, rattle it down the back streets.  It is nothing new for the Labour Party, Labour Party spokesmen and their candidates to rattle their case down the back streets, because the Labour Party has been striving to air the grievances of, and find the solution of the problems for the people in the back streets. They have been doing that for a long time and, please God, the Labour Party will continue to do their best for the people in the back streets, not at election times only, but during the intervening periods.</P>
      <P>As I have said, we did place our policy before the people.  We said that we felt, having regard to wage levels, that the current prices of essential commodities were too high, and stated that we did not accept it as inevitable that thousands of our people should have to emigrate each year in search of the employment which could not be found for them at home.  We did not accept the last speaker's theory and say to them that there would always be the neighbouring country ready and willing to give employment to our surplus population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We said we did not accept it as inevitable that thousands of our people should have to go to the labour exchanges morning after morning to sign on for work, especially at a time when millions of pounds were being spent on Government schemes, either in contemplation or in course of execution, which were of little more <Col N="599" /> than prestige value.  We said we could not accept it as inevitable that those people would not have a basic right to get work at home to enable them to raise a family, especially at a time when goods and services are still urgently needed for all our people. We do not deny that we said that the maximum old age pension of 21/6 per week is inadequate for the people who qualify for it, and that they could not be expected to eke out an existence on that sum.  Similarly, we made statements in regard to widows' and orphans' pensions, blind pensions and other social welfare benefits.  We do not deny that we said that was our policy.  We still say that it is the policy of the Labour Party whether it is in Opposition or in Government.</P>
    <P>There was a significant omission in the statements made by speakers from the Opposition Benches.  It was this, that none of them referred to the fact that something happened between the time of the election&mdash;the announcement of the results&mdash;and the formation of the Government in this House. Between these two dates the Labour Party, in a democratic fashion, called a convention of their delegates from every Labour branch in the country and from every trade union affiliated to the Labour Party.  There could be no false promises made at that convention which was attended by over 500 delegates.  The Leader of the Labour Party came to that convention. He said that, in accordance with the policy which we had pursued at the general election and which the people had supported to the extent of sending 19 Labour Deputies to the 15th Dáil, we had negotiated with the Fine Gael Party, and the Clann na Talmhan Party, and that these Parties were prepared to implement the policy which he outlined on the 12 points.</P>
    <P>There was no such thing as promises which could not be fulfilled.  There was placed before the Labour Party delegates and the trade union delegates at that conference precisely what appeared in the Press after the Government was eventually set up here.  The <Col N="600" /> delegates at the convention, representing the people who supported the Labour Party by returning 19 Labour Deputies to this House, voted unanimously for the acceptance of that policy.  We did not say that the price of bread was going to be reduced immediately or the price of tea or sugar.  The delegates were told that the price of butter would be reduced, and that steps would be taken to tackle other price problems.  We gave no promises, but pledged ourselves, as far as lay in our power and as far as the economic situation would permit, to reduce the prices of essential foodstuffs. We told them that at the first opportunity we would increase old age pensions, blind pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions, and that we would increase the payments under workmen's compensation and tackle the everyday problems confronting the man in the street, the wage earner and the housewife.  The delegates assembled at that convention, representing the people who supported us in the general election, gave us the go-ahead signal to form a Government with Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan and any other Party wishing to participate in a Government that was ready, able and willing to carry out that programme.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it must be abundantly clear to anybody who wishes to examine the situation intelligently that, as far as the Labour Party is concerned, we have not fooled the people who supported us in the recent election. We have no apology to make to those people because they made the decision for themselves.  Neither have we any apology to make to those who voted for Fianna Fáil because obviously those people were genuine in their intention of voting for the policy that was put before them by the Government Party of the time, that prices would not be reduced.  No doubt many of these people have received the news with amazement that the price of butter is to be reduced by 5d. per lb.</P>
    <P>There is this fact to be remembered, that this last election was contested clearly on the issue as between an inter-Party Government and a single-Party Government by Fianna Fáil.  On <Col N="601" /> that issue the people gave a clear decision in favour of an inter-Party Government.  Therefore, I think the sooner the speakers on the Opposition Benches get that fact into their heads the better for all concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers made a very interesting speech here this evening.  I think it can safely be said of it that it is one which was made by him many times up and down the country during the election.  The people, the electorate, have already heard that speech, and they rejected that policy.  They rejected that explanation, and it was that policy and explanation that sent the outgoing Government Party into the Opposition Benches.  Deputy Childers, apparently, doubts the ability of the Labour Party to examine the economic situation intelligently and seriously.  He is quite entitled to doubt the ability of anybody else to do that, but I would seriously suggest to him that the only examination of the economic situation that need be carried out by a wage earner is to take a peep into his wage packet and try to assess the amount of goods that can be purchased by the wages now and compare that with the amount of goods that could be purchased at 1948 level. The Labour Party does not look down its nose at the electorate and say that the electorate is incapable of carrying out an intelligent and serious examination of the economic position.  We do not say that to the people, nor do we set ourselves on a pedestal as economic messiahs and say to the people: &ldquo;You cannot examine the situation as we can from our lofty height.&rdquo; We believe that basically and fundamentally the people are intelligent and quite capable of returning to power the Government they find is in their very best interest.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think all the Deputies returned to this House are in the main men of goodwill, genuinely moved by the desire to do the best thing for the country.  I will freely admit that.  The fact is that we differ in policy, differ in the way we feel things should be done.  Bearing that in mind, I would ask the people on the Opposition Benches&mdash;they were rejected by the people&mdash;that the present Government made up of Clann na Talmhan, Fine Gael and the Labour Party should <Col N="602" /> have the fair trial to which they are entitled.  I am convinced if we get that trial we will carry out the 12-point programme we set before the people and when we go back to the electorate in five years' time, mark you, they will approve of the work we have done in this House and the present Opposition will resume their seats in the Opposition Benches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter to which I would like to refer is the charge made by the Minister in his speech in his constituency over the week-end, that the motion is nothing more than obstruction by Fianna Fáil. I would like to remind the Minister of the length of time it took to discuss the various items on the Dáil Order Papers over the past three years.  I would like to remind him that even in the term before the dissolution of the last Dáil we were still discussing the Estimates for the year 1953-54 that would normally be completed as far as discussion in this House is concerned at the end of July or the first week in August of 1953.</P>
      <P>I do not have to remind him of the attitude of his Party to the passage of the Health Bill in this House which was the main cause of the delay in having these Estimates passed by the House.  I would again like to remind him that over the past few days almost half the Government's Estimates have been passed in this House without a division.  We do not claim any great credit for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>They were your Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They were Fianna Fáil Estimates: nevertheless, if we were to be guilty of the obstruction with which we are charged, there is no reason why we would not have delayed the House in discussing these Estimates not for one, two or three days, but for several weeks, as those who formed the Opposition up to a few months ago did during their term of opposition.  I think, also, his suggestion of obstruction goes completely by the board when he realises&mdash;as he knows well&mdash;that the Finance Bill must <Col N="603" /> pass through this House and through the Seanad before a day early next month.  Therefore, any suggestion of obstruction even on that score is completely unfounded.</P>
      <P>The Attorney-General, who led off for the Government side&mdash;apart from the Minister&mdash;in this debate yesterday described what happened in the last election as a landslide.  I take it I am in order, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in referring to it.  He said so far as there could be a landslide with proportional representation a landslide took place in the last election.  I would like to remind him that Fianna Fáil were returned with almost as many first preference votes as they were originally returned as a Government in 1932 and with more first preference votes than they were returned with as an Opposition in 1948.  I do not think there was any suggestion of a landslide in 1948 except what took place afterwards in the manoeuvring that went on in the formation of the first Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>The first plank of this Government, if we ignore the question of the cost of living, the first promise they made was to make economies in administration. It is rather significant and paradoxical that their very first act was to increase the cost of running this State at the very formation of this Government.  They gave us one extra Minister and one extra Parliamentary Secretary and there is a promise of another Ministry.  It may be a small matter.  The Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries appointed will no doubt have plenty to do in their respective jobs but for a Government pledged to economy in administration it is rather paradoxical that their very first act should be the very reverse of economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Casey made a speech which contained many implications.  The first implication that I could pick up was with reference to the last speaker, Deputy Childers, suggesting that he was thankful that there would always be an England to absorb our surplus unemployed in this country.  I do not think it could be suggested against <Col N="604" /> Deputy Childers that he thanked God or anybody else that the unemployed could go to England.  I do not think that suggestion is fair.  I think Deputy Childers did fairly say there was a trend in this country for people who became unemployed or not permanently employed to go and find employment in England.  I think that is an historic fact and I think there is more than an historic basis to it&mdash;it has an economic basis.  However, it is the intention of the present Government, as it has been the intention of the last, in so far as it can be achieved, to go nearer and nearer towards the goal of full employment in this country and avoid the necessity for people to emigrate to England or anywhere else in the world for employment.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out when he was Minister for Agriculture before, there would always be some emigration in this country.  I do not think anybody will seriously dispute that with him.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Labour Party Convention referred to by Deputy Casey, he asserted that the outcome of that convention was, among other things, a promise to bring about reductions in the price of foodstuffs but not immediate reductions.  I wonder was Deputy Seán Dunne present at that convention and, if so, did he tell the delegates there of the speech, as read out here by Deputy Seán Lemass last night, which was made at an election meeting in Navan when he said&mdash;and I quote again:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before the Labour Party would participate in a Government with any Party or groups of Parties, they would insist that the prices of bread, butter, tea, sugar, tobacco and the workers' pint must be reduced and reduced immediately.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I presume that if Deputy Seán Dunne were there, and if he adverted to the fact that he made this promise to the electorate before the election, he was told conveniently to forget it in the hope that Fianna Fáil might not have read the report of his speech.</P>
    <P>We have read the report of his speech; we have read and retained the advertisements and various forms of propaganda which, we suggest, were largely responsible for bringing about <Col N="605" /> the change of Government.  If these promises do not come home to roost now, they will, perhaps, come home to roost in 12 months, 18 months, or two years' time.  We are not suggesting by any means that the people did not vote for a change of Government.  We realise quite well that there was some suggestion before the election took place about the formation of an inter-Party Government.  The Labour Party were quite frank about their intentions in that regard.  They put up a programme which was a rather extravagant one but nevertheless one that might appeal to a large section of the electorate in which they clearly indicated that they were prepared to join Fine Gael, on certain prior conditions being accepted.</P>
    <P>During the course of the election campaign we blamed Fine Gael for failing to give a clear indication of their acceptance of the invitation put up by the Labour Party.  That campaign on our part was continued throughout the entire election because we felt that it was due to the electorate from a Party that represented themselves as a responsible political Party, to have some indication of what its policy was before the votes were cast and not afterwards.  It is for that reason we suggest that the formation of this Government, in its present structure, was not the type of Government of which the people were asked to approve before the election.  The Labour Party Convention, to which Deputy Casey referred, took place after the election, and it was only then that the people knew positively that Labour were prepared to take part in a coalition Government with Fine Gael and other smaller groups.  If Fianna Fáil held itself out as a Party which might take part in a coalition, or even if it had failed to do so and, subsequent to the election, decided to join with some groups capable of commanding a majority in this House, could we not equally say that the electorate had voted for that particular type of Government, if we found a sufficient number of Deputies to support us? Therefore, to suggest, after all the events that took place after the votes were cast, that the formation of this Government was justified, is to expect too much from the average person. <Col N="606" /> Again I want to say that I am not suggesting that by their votes the people did not indicate that they required some change.  There was certainly an increase in the Fine Gael poll and in the Labour poll.</P>
    <P>With regard to some of the more specific promises made, there is no doubt that the reduction of 5d. per lb. in the price of butter comes as a distinct relief to the people so far as the cost of living is concerned but, contrary to what Deputy Casey suggests, Fianna Fáil did not believe, and does not believe, in high prices or the maintenance of high prices, just for the sake of having high prices.  With regard to butter, I think everybody knows that the cost of producing the amount of milk that goes to make a lb. of butter is 3/9.  The selling price is 4/2 and the margin between that and 3/9, 5d., went towards the cost of processing, distribution and wholesalers' and retailers' profits.  We suggested, during the course of the election that, as far as we could see, there was no margin between the cost of production and the selling price which would justify a reduction in the retail price.  We tried to tell the people that if a reduction, not only in the price of butter but in the price of other commodities, were possible, it could be brought about only in two ways&mdash; either by the reintroduction of subsidies or by increasing production.  We felt that our method directed towards the latter end, that of increasing production, particularly in relation to butter, by subsidising fertilisers&mdash; ground limestone, etc.&mdash;and subsidising their transport and distribution throughout the country, was the most effective and the most permanent way that we could suggest and implement to bring about a reduction in the price of foodstuffs generally and particularly in the price of butter.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody will deny that the bringing back of subsidies, no matter how small, must at best be considered only a temporary expedient.  With regard to the reduction of 5d. per lb. in the price of butter, so far as we can see from the Supplementary Estimate which the Minister for Agriculture proposes to <Col N="607" /> introduce in conjunction with his main Estimate, it is expected to cost in the current year £1,100,000.  That, I take it, is the estimated cost for the balance of the financial year from the time at which this reduction will take effect.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind Deputies opposite who have acclaimed this reduction as a wonderful relief to the average wage-earner that that reduction, compared with the reduction of ½d. in the price of the 2-lb. loaf of bread, is not so very significant.  The cost to the Exchequer of the reduction of ½d. in the 2-lb loaf was something short of £900,000&mdash;£893,000&mdash;in a single year.  The Budget was described for that reason by Deputies opposite as the ½d. Budget.  There is not a big difference between £893,000 and £1,100,000, in the parlance of State finance anyway, but the manner in which that relief to the wage-earner was written off during the course of the election campaign bears no comparison to the manner in which this £1,100,000 relief is now being acclaimed by Deputies on the benches opposite. Everybody will admit that the approximate weekly relief given to the average family by a 5d. decrease in the price of butter will range between 1/- and 1/3, assuming the average family buys something less than 3 lb. of butter a week.  Very few of them buy more than 3 lb. of butter.  The same reduction in the weekly bill of the average family is being given by the reduction of ½d. in the 2-lb. loaf of bread.  Therefore, from that point of view, there was a substantial relief given in the last Budget if we are now to believe that the 5d. reduction in the lb. of butter is a substantial relief, just because it was brought in by this Government.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputies opposite that there were reliefs given in the &ldquo;Halfpenny Budget&rdquo; which were a more substantial saving to the people than £893,000.  Most Deputies will remember that the then Minister for Finance read out some very substantial reliefs which he was able to give to persons whose salaries were liable to income-tax.  He mentioned the case of the married man with two children <Col N="608" /> who, in 1951, if he earned £627, was liable to £10 income-tax.  As a result of the reliefs given in the last Budget that man saved £10, which was certainly of much more value to him than the £3 and a few pence a year which the reduction in the price of butter now gives him.  Prior to the last Budget a married man with four children, who earned £900 a year&mdash;and I am sure there are quite a few in that category&mdash;paid £19 4s. a year in income-tax.  As a result of the reliefs given to him in that Budget he saved £13 4s. a year&mdash;again a very substantial increase compared with the relief given by the reduction in the price of butter.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that it is possible overnight to reduce the price of some of the commodities set out in this now well-known Fine Gael pamphlet but I do suggest that there was a fairly clear indication to the people&mdash;and many people believed&mdash;that the prices under the heading of 1951 would be reverted to very quickly if a change of Government were brought about.  The price of butter, at 4/2 in 1954, will revert, not to 2/10 but to 3/9.  The people expected a very early reduction in the price of many other commodities, a reduction which the Minister has failed to give and which he has stated positively will not take place in the current year.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it is difficult to assess what the income will be, taking one month with another or one year with another, from many of the taxable commodities.  It is very difficult to assess the income from beer, spirits, petrol and cigarettes but there are two or three other commodities on this famous list, the tax income from which is readily available and, if there was to be a reduction, the reduction could be put into effect without any searching or long-drawn-out examination. However, in the last couple of days the Estimates for the Department of Local Government and for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have been passed and no reference whatever was made by either of the Ministers in charge of these Departments to the halfpenny increase on the postage rate, to the increase in wireless <Col N="609" /> licences and in the tax on cars.  It would have been easy last week to ascertain what the result of a decrease in the postage rate and in the 17/6 wireless licence and in the tax on cars would be.  There would have been no difficulty for the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or the Minister for Local Government in assessing exactly the effect of a reduction, if they had decided to make that reduction.  We did not hear one word from any of the Ministers about possible reductions and I would like to know now if the Minister is prepared to say that in the foreseeable future he proposes to reduce the postage rate from 3d to 2½d., the price of the wireless licence from 17/6 to 12/6, and the tax on motor cars as, again, I suggest, there was a clear implication in this pamphlet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers mentioned an advertisement that appeared in the <i>Cork Evening Echo</i> on Tuesday, May 18th, the evening of polling day.  Everybody will remember the ten specific questions that were put to the then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, and the present Taoiseach, Mr. Costello, some time before the election.  Mr. Costello's answers appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> on the 13th May and Deputy de Valera's appeared on the previous day. The first two questions were clear and specific, the first being: If returned to Government, do you propose in the coming year to reduce the cost of living by increasing food subsidies? Deputy de Valera's answer to that question was &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  The second question was: If returned to Government do you propose in the coming year to retain taxation as it is at present on beer, spirits, motoring and cigarettes? Deputy de Valera's answer again was &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but Mr. Costello lumped the two questions together and made what I consider was not an answer but a prevarication, amounting to 155 words.

      <P>I shall not refer to that in detail but will revert to the <Col N="610" /> advertisement that was inserted in the <i>Cork Evening Echo</i> on behalf of the Fine Gael candidates.  The first question was paraphrased in the Fine Gael advertisement, without any dashes or dots or commas to indicate that it did not contain the full context.  It said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Last week Mr. de Valera and Mr. Costello were asked to answer the question: If returned to Government do you propose in the coming year to reduce the cost of living,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I will read again the full question as published by the <i>Irish Times:</i>&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If returned to Government do you propose in the coming year to reduce the cost of living by increasing food subsidies?&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress yesterday I was discussing the housing position in Cork and the derelict sites we have there and I was asking the Minister to give <Col N="612" /> speedy sanction to the building of flats for the Marsh area.  I hope that he will do all in his power to speed up sanction for any schemes submitted by the corporation because, as he said himself in his opening statement, he is concerned with the housing position in Dublin and Cork.</P>
      <P>There has been an application for the extension of the borough boundary in Cork, and the Minister, being new in his Department, may not be aware of the urgency of that extension.  The Department is well aware that the corporation had to build thousands of houses outside the borough boundary, with the result that considerable hardship is suffered by a great many of the tenants who were shifted out there from tenement houses within the city. I am referring to people who were in receipt of T.B. benefits and of blind welfare payments from the corporation. I am sure the Minister is aware that the difference between T.B benefits in the city and county is 2/- for each child, 5/- less rent allowance and a difference in the payments on the house.  During Dr. Browne's time in office I made a request to him to try to level up the rate of benefits to people in corporation houses outside the city to the amounts payable within the county borough and the best thing he could do at the time without introducing legislation was to ask the county authority to waive the abatements on national health and other items in order to try and bring those corporation tenants outside the borough up to the city rate of benefit. That did help in a big way but not sufficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could also give a list of people in receipt of blind pensions who receive payment from the county council and from the corporation.  There is a big difference between the welfare grant paid by the county council and the grant paid by the corporation, with the result that these people who were-shifted out suffer a big hardship.  I have given one case in point of a son of a blind pensioner who moved to a house outside the borough.  Later on he brought out his father who had been living in a lane in the city to reside with him in the corporation house outside <Col N="613" /> the borough until such time as he got over an illness he had and the result was that there was a reduction in the welfare grant and the rent was increased because the income from the father's blind pension was taken into account under the differential rents scheme for corporation houses.</P>
    <P>I think the officials of the Department are pretty well aware of the urgency of this matter.  The Minister in reply to a question by me last week said that he hoped to have the result of the inquiry in his hands very soon and that he would see there would be no delay.  That may be so, but if the Minister knew Departments as well as some of us do he would know that it may not be so easy as he thinks and I would impress on him to push as hard as ever he can because of these difficulties. We have a scheme of housing at Gurranebraher which is partly in the city and partly in the county with the result that next door neighbours could be receiving different T.B. benefits and I am sure everybody will agree that that is very aggravating.  I would therefore urge the Minister to do all he can to make his officials speed up the extension of the boundary.</P>
    <P>During the elections in Cork City and County there was great comment on the amount of money being spent on the improvement of a roadway leading into Cork City.  It is called the Dunkettle-Tivoli Road and my colleague, Deputy Barrett, had a question down yesterday about it.  I have seen the reply to the question, which stated that £41,473 has, to date, been allocated for the improvement of this road and, of that allocation, £23,711 has already been spent, but out of the sum of £41,473, £40,283 was provided out of the road grant. That is the most important roadway leading into Cork City.  It is the main road from Dublin, Fermoy, Mitchelstown and Cashel.  It is also the principal entrance into Cork City from Waterford, Youghal and Cobh.  All those roads converge on this particular section.  There is no doubt that it is the principal entrance to the city.  On that road there have been numerous accidents for years back, including several fatal accidents.  Anyone who <Col N="614" /> has driven from Dublin to Cork must remember the terribly dangerous bends and the blind corners on that particular section of the road.</P>
    <P>I maintain that in Cork we have one of the most efficient deputy county engineers in the country.  He has done wonderful work in improving the roads leading into the city.  In my opinion, this was the most necessary job and the best job I have seen done yet. Why Cork Fine Gael Deputies in the city and county have criticised that improvement I cannot understand. They talk about unemployment.  This work has given a great deal of employment. I understand that in road improvement the labour content is about 40 per cent.  Not alone was this a great improvement to the main entrance to the city but it also gave that very useful employment.</P>
    <P>A couple of years previously, the same deputy county engineer carried out many improvements on the other side of the river, on the Cork to Crosshaven road, which is leading to a very popular seaside resort.  He certainly made a great job of that road.  With all due respect to Deputy Desmond and his colleagues of the South Cork area, however, the main road from Dublin to Cork was just as important as the road to Crosshaven.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It used to be said it carried a lot of traffic out of Cork at one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It carries a lot of traffic both ways.  I do not know whether the road to Crosshaven brings them in the right direction or not.  I am not objecting to what was done on the Crosshaven road.  I hope that the same deputy county engineer will go further and improve the remainder of the Crosshaven road, from Douglas into St. Finbarr's Hospital at the top of High Street which is just in the city and which in parts is not much wider than a boreen.  Any money spent on the improvement of important roadways like that is money well spent.  The Cork County Council has been pressing to get grants&mdash;and to get £40,000 out of the Road Fund for a £41,000 job is a pretty decent instalment. <Col N="615" /> No matter what the expenditure is, I hope that all these main roads into our city will be improved for present day traffic.  The one I have mentioned, the start of the road to Crosshaven from Cork City, is badly in need of attention.  If any suggestion comes up for that particular road, I sincerely hope that sanction will not be delayed.</P>
      <P>There is only one other matter, the question of pedestrian crossings.  I was given two replies by the Minister's predecessor in the span of a couple of years, that it would require legislation. I suppose the Ceann Comhairle will be ruling me out, saying that I am not entitled to advocate legislation on an Estimate; but I can assure him that I will not spend many minutes on it.  In my experience in Dublin and Cork, there is no respect at all for the pedestrians crossing the road.  The Gardaí do not seem to look at them at all&mdash;if you get half way across the road in Dublin and traffic comes the other way, there is no safeguard at all.  In other countries, once a pedestrian puts his foot on the recognised crossing I understand all motor traffic stops.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should consider that legislation very soon.</P>
      <P>I will finish by wishing the Minister every success in his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has heard a great deal about housing needs in Cork City during this debate.  I make no apology for adverting to the same subject.  He told us to-day, in reply to a question I put to him, that there were 2,600 families still to be rehoused in Cork.  You can take as an average about five people to each family.  That means there are 13,000 people at the moment, at a minimum&mdash;and I think the Minister's estimate of 2,600 families is conservative&mdash;living under conditions which have to be seen to be believed.  They live in hovels, under conditions which are scarcely fit for animals.  We are told in the Constitution that the family is the fundamental unit of society but in Cork 2,600 families are living under conditions which make it almost impossible to <Col N="616" /> maintain family life.  We who live in decent respectable homes find it hard enough to put up with our families when we go home after a hard day's work; but when the bread-winner has to go in to a poky, smelly, dirty, small room where there are four or five children tired and getting near their bedtime, to a wife who has been looking after those children during the day in those surroundings, his natural reaction is to get out of the home again as soon as possible.  It is hard to bring up children in a family atmosphere if you have four or five in the one room. It is most likely that they will end up playing around in the street until all hours of the night.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on giving hope to those 2,600 families in Cork.  He has told us that one of the first things he has done under his aegis is to give an undertaking to send important officials of his Department to Cork to look into the matter on the spot.  I hope that the result of the visit of those officials will be that, when we ask the Minister again the question I asked him to-day &mdash;how long should Cork Corporation take before they are over their housing problem&mdash;he will not have to say eight to ten years.  I hope he will be able to say that within five years' time Cork Corporation will have tackled the housing problem as they should have tackled it all along.</P>
      <P>We were told recently at a rates meeting that the corporation intended to build 400 houses.  We pressed them to build 500.  It was suggested, at all events, that that ideal could not be attained.  If that idea continues, the housing problem there will not be solved in 25 years.  The social consequences are really dreadful.  At the moment a young married couple cannot hope to get a corporation house, because men and women with two, three or four children are clamouring for the type of house which such married couples should get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed to find that the Cork Corporation officials did not know how many families of over five persons are at the moment each accommodated in one room.  One would think that if the officials interested and in charge of <Col N="617" /> housing in Cork were really trying to solve the problem the first section of the community towards which they would turn their eyes would be families with four and five living in one room. I am certain that the citizens of Cork would be amazed to learn that not since 1946 has an effort been made to find out how many families in Cork are living four and five in one room.  I urge the Minister to have such an inquiry carried out without delay because, in turn, it will mean that fewer families of four and five will be living in one room in Cork City.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister also to see to it that those derelict sites in the centre of Cork City will be used for housing purposes in the immediate future.  For some considerable time past, members of the Cork Corporation&mdash;indeed, members of all Parties in the corporation&mdash;have been pressing to have that done.  We have always found, however, that our hands have been tied by red tape either in the Department of Local Government or locally in Cork.</P>
    <P>There are churches and schools ready to absorb the population there but, as the centre of the city is steadily becoming denuded of families, neither schools nor churches are being built in the new areas for them.  Any Cork Deputy who is interested in housing must agree that people have a decided objection to living two, three or four miles outside the city because it means increased bus fares for them or the purchase of bicycles to enable them to get to work, to the churches and to the schools.  We in Cork feel that the sensible way to tackle the problem would be to build on the derelict sites and also to destroy the horrible and filthy hovels which there are in some parts of the city and build there instead of buying new land farther and farther away from the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that a set plan for a certain type of house is demanded by the Department and that nothing the local authority might say to the Department can induce the Department to change their mind.  The most usual complaint which we come across in Cork is that the people cannot pay <Col N="618" /> the rents for their houses, that in many cases the houses are larger than they need be and that they are difficult to heat and to furnish.  I suggest that the Minister should ask the officials whom he is sending down to Cork to take a look at some of the older housing schemes there&mdash;schemes which were not as ambitious as some of the present-day schemes but in which families are to-day living healthy and happy lives&mdash;families which are a credit to the city in which they are being raised.  These older houses are not large and they are quite unpretentious but they are what the people want.  I urge the Minister to bear that fact in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath evidently thinks that so long as you have the money you can spend it on anything you like. He thinks that if there is money in the Road Fund it might as well be wasted on, say, a road from Dublin to Cork which travels through Clonmel, and so forth.  I agree that some of these new roads are excellent technical jobs but I suggest that we are making the roads unsafe for posterity.  It is true that there was some necessity to do something with the road to which Deputy McGrath referred.  However, I feel money is being squandered when I see a perfectly good house about to be demolished in order to make room for a road which it is intended will be 100 feet wide, or maybe even wider than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my duty to protest, not only from election platforms but here in Parliament, against the squandering of public money which is taking place in relation to that road. I simply took that as a particular case in point to illustrate the general waste on road construction.  You find the same on several parts of the road <Col N="619" /> from Cork to Dublin.  Despite the tradition which exists, the volume of traffic on that road is not so large as to require such wide roads as are now being constructed throughout the country.  In my view, roads which carry vehicles three or four abreast would be quite adequate.  If you travel on the road between Cork and Dublin I think you will find that seven vehicles can drive abreast.  I would ask the Minister to inquire into that matter with a view to discovering whether, in fact, there is any necessity for the over-ambitious schemes in relation to road construction which are in progress at the present time.</P>
      <P>I do not think we should build roads simply with a view to providing employment. I believe we can find more useful ways of spending the money than on schemes of the type to which Deputy McGrath has referred.  The Minister has given a good start to the solution of the housing problem in Cork and I trust that he will take speedy steps to cut down the squandermania in relation to the construction of roads throughout the country which has been a feature of the previous Government's administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to congratulate the new Minister and to wish him success in the very onerous task which lies ahead of him.  He is in charge of one of the most important Departments of State and one which, to my mind, has more connection with rural Ireland than most of the other Departments.</P>
      <P>A great responsibility rests on this new Minister who has come in with an open, fresh and vigorous mind to tackle the many problems that await solution.  At this stage and so early in his term of office, I do not propose to bring many matters to his attention. I feel sure that at the present time he is concentrating on getting a grasp of the administration of his Department. There are, however, one or two matters which I feel I must refer to&mdash;one, especially, that occurred during the past 12 months and which concerns the administration of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> It may seem a small matter to many Deputies but to my mind it is significant that, while Deputies in this House and public representatives outside this House talk about fair play and security of employment, officials of the Minister's Department and possibly of other Departments can put regulations into operation which adversely affect the unfortunate employees of local authorities down the country.  At this point I should like to refer the Minister to circular letter No. E.L. 6153 of the 25th June, 1953. I presume that circular letter, a copy of which I have before me, emanated from the Minister's office as a result of advice.  It relates to rules governing temporary appointments, especially clerical appointments, to local authorities and limits the period of employment to a maximum of nine months in any one year.</P>
    <P>When that circular letter was issued, it immediately affected not only local authority employees such as clerks, typists, and so forth, but also other sections of our community such as nurses who, actually, do not come under the administration of the Minister's Department at all.  That is an extraordinary circular letter to issue to any local authority.  I know for a fact that employees on county council staffs in all parts of Ireland who had been employed constantly for four or five years were told last year after nine months' service: &ldquo;Sorry, we cannot employ you any longer this year.  You must knock off for three months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That has happened.  I brought this matter to the notice of a particular county manager.  I cannot understand any possible reason for a circular letter like this unless it is a question of officialdom trying to protect itself to the extent that if a person is employed in a temporary capacity for a period of years he then has a right to demand permanent employment from the State. As far as I can judge one of the reasons for the letter is to ensure that temporary employees of local authorities will not have at any time in the future a claim to permanency or compensation if their services are dispensed with when they are employed in a temporary capacity.  Some years ago I think a temporary clerk in the <Col N="621" /> Civil Service took action against the Department in which he was employed in a temporary capacity for 18 years. I understand that there is a record of that case on the files in the Department and the Department does not want any similar claims to arise.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Local Government is concerned with protection for its own permanent staff, I would suggest that it is quite sufficient to notify a temporary employee that his services are terminated for the period of one day per year which is for the sake of breaking the service.  That, to my mind, would be sufficient.  If there is a question of a right of way on a road all the body which has control of that roadway has to do is to close that roadway for one day in the year and that will give them the right to close it at any time in future.  In the same way, if the Department of Local Government feel that people employed in a temporary capacity would have a right if kept on continuously over 12 months, why not knock them off for a week at most?</P>
    <P>A serious situation arises out of this. If we have a man or woman employed on a particular matter in a local authority and if they have spent three or four years carrying out certain specified tasks they need skill and experience; but just because they are in a temporary capacity they are knocked off and somebody raw and new is taken in to do the very same work.  I will not pursue that matter further except to ask the Minister to get the circular letter.  I should also like the House to remember that it affects not only the clerical staffs employed in local authorities but it goes further afield.  I have already had occasion to bring this matter to the notice of the former Minister for Health and I was assured that in regard to one particular institute the circular letter did not come into operation and that the girls employed as nurses were allowed to continue their services in a temporary capacity and were not dispensed with.  I will refer to this matter on and off during the course of the year in order to see what has happened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> Another point I should like to mention concerns the local elections.  I want to be very brief.  I presume that within the next 12 months or so the local elections for the county councils will take place.  If the Minister is considering, as I think he is and rightly so, introducing changes in the Managerial Act, I would suggest that those changes should come about prior to the next local elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that because we will have an opportunity of getting a good type of councillor because he knows that functions will be restored that now lie, to a great extent to my mind, in the hands of petty dictators.</P>
      <P>I do not suppose the Minister will have any chance at the present time or during this year of increasing the allocation of money for local authorities under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It may not be possible. I do think that tremendous work was done in the rural areas under the Local Authorities (Works) Act as far as drainage is concerned.  Certainly, if the Minister is not able to do it this year I hope he will be able to do so during his second year in office, if the Government lasts that long.  I hope he will take steps to ensure that more money is made available to local authorities for the very important work of drainage.  If we have not got the land in a suitable condition to carry crops and an increased number of live stock, then we will not be able to get that expansion in agriculture which is so desirable and essential to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point in connection with the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  There was always a delay in notifying the various county councils with regard to the allocation.  It leaves the engineering staffs in a dilemma.  I am speaking now for my own county. I cannot, of course, speak for other counties but I presume the same complaint has been made by other local authorities.  If they had an idea in time of the amount of money to be allocated, even a rough estimate, they <Col N="623" /> would be able to prepare schemes for submission to the Department instead of, as at present, where it is all a rushed job.  I hope the Minister will remember that.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask him to bring the fresh mind he has to bear on the question of roads generally.  The question of grasping the problems that must be faced in connection with road improvement generally is a tremendous business.  I know that in the past Ministers have gone into office with great ideas of what could be done, but after a short period they were enmeshed in the red tape and formalities that exist in the Department. I think that the present Minister, while he is really fresh on the job, should take steps to ensure that the same standard of road is laid down in every county.</P>
    <P>I know that the Department have laid down standards, but anybody who travels the road from here to Galway knows, by looking at the road, where each county council comes in.  I think it is necessary that the engineering staffs, not only the county surveyors but assistant engineers, in most counties should be brought together and given a course, if necessary, on what the Department engineers believe is the proper method of surfacing and laying down roads.</P>
    <P>At the present time a great deal of controversy exists amongst engineers in this country and Britain with regard to the proper foundations which should be made for roads.  I do not know if the Minister is aware that in his own Department everything is not too happy in that regard as far as the technical advice is concerned.  Doctors differ; so do engineers.  Up to a few years ago the expert idea that was prevalent in connection with the laying of the foundation for roads was that you would want to have at least a bed of nine to 12 inches of rough stone and so forth before other layers were laid down.  A good many engineers have since changed their minds on this, and quite a number of them now say, and have authority from abroad on it, that <Col N="624" /> a much finer type of stone and much lighter layer will do the job.  It is quite possible that this has not been resolved yet in the Department, and the reason I am mentioning it is that you may have engineers in the South of Ireland prepared to go ahead on one line and engineers of more conservative views in other areas who will stick to the old one.  I think it is essential that all engineers in this country who deal with roads should be brought together and given a course of instruction, if necessary, on what the Department wants done.</P>
    <P>I am not going to give specific examples here, as that would be unfair, but I do know that when officials and departmental engineers come down the country their patience is often strained at the type of work done under the supervision of assistant engineers in various counties; and it is a tragic thing to say that local representatives can do nothing to remedy this, because we do not get a copy of any report that comes from the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>We are not entitled to look at it.  As far as these complaints are concerned they are handled by the county manager and county secretary, who are in direct communication with the Department of Local Government, and the local authority appointed to know what is going on and to guard the people's money and to raise money for these works does not know anything about whether these men are efficient or not.  If we are going to get what I call a good return for money spent, every local authority representative must be satisfied in his own mind that the money laid out is well spent, but not one of us can give any proof at the present time whether it is well spent or not because we have no access to the appropriate reports.  We would nearly want to employ our own private technical staff to supervise both the Department of Local Government engineers and the local authority engineers.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say, except again in conclusion to wish the Minister well in his new appointment and to ask him to bring that fresh and <Col N="625" /> vigorous mind that he has to bear on those problems that face him.</P>

His predecessor set a fairly high standard, and I know that if he follows in his footsteps he will not be going far wrong.</P>

      <P>There are other counties in Ireland as well, and I am sure that in the course of his work he will remember that there is a place also called Donegal and there are a few other counties.</P>
      <P>I am not going to deal with matters so parochial, having sounded that note, but I would like to say that this question of local government which is debated here every year usually follows the same pattern and the same discussion takes place, and I do not know whether it affects policy for the coming year to any great extent. Personally I feel that the burden of local government is becoming heavier as years go on and it does not merely concern one Minister alone.</P>
      <P>In a full-dress debate on local government, one would like to see here the Minister for Health, the Minister for Social Welfare and, the most important Minister of all, the Minister for Finance.  These are Ministries which place a considerable lot of work on local authorities as well as the Minister directly responsible for local affairs.  The most important one of all is the Minister for Finance, and the Minister who has just taken over the important office of local government will find his success will be largely governed by the amount of money he can extract from that other Minister, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that it is not necessary to <Col N="626" /> appeal to our new Minister to ensure that every penny available in the Road Fund will always be used for the construction of roads throughout the country, which is, after all, our number one need; and the more money he can get the better will he be able to carry out the important task which falls to his lot now.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the previous speaker in one thing he said when he exhorted the Minister to bring in an amendment to the Managerial Act before the next local elections, when he said that it would have the effect of inducing a better type of candidate to go forward for the county council.  My experience is that with the coming into being of the Managerial Act we actually got a better type of councillor to offer himself for election.  I will assert that it took place in Donegal and a few other counties that I know. I do not think we could in any way complain of any deterioration in the type of local representative we have secured since that Act came into force.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the question of amending the Managerial Act is a rather tricky thing indeed, and without going outside the bounds of this discussion or in any way discussing legislation which is still only contemplated I would say that those functions which are the reserved functions of the elected representatives are not always the best-carried-out functions under a local authority.  The Minister would be well advised to consider seriously what functions he would place in the hands of the elected representatives before he takes any drastic action with regard to the amendment of the Managerial Act.</P>
    <P>All of us would like to have powers in the local authority.  Individuals would like to be able to wield as much power as possible, thereby proving to the people who elected them that they are capable of doing this, that and the other thing, but we have certain functions already reserved and when it comes down to the question of who is the best canvasser to secure appointment I do not think that that is the best means of making that appointment. At least the county manager is responsible to the local authority and <Col N="627" /> to the Department of Local Government for each appointment he makes, and he must show the reason he has selected a particular individual to be a tenant of a house or for any other appointment.  I think on the whole it has worked out reasonably satisfactorily. It is quite possible, human nature being what it is, that if the power of appointment were in the hands of the individual elected members appointments would not always be made on merit.</P>

      <P>That, I thought, was something like what the Deputy had in mind when he spoke on this question.

I think councillors should have some authority in the allocation of grants to roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the local councillor is a better judge of what road really requires improvement in his area than is any newly appointed surveyor coming from some other county to take over charge in a particular area.  Then we have the added difficulty of the break in continuity of the service of these local engineers, particularly in places like Donegal. When we get an engineer his one ambition is to see if he can get some job nearer Dublin as soon as possible, with the result that we have them coming and going.  One man has a particular scheme in mind and when a fresh appointee takes over he has another scheme and he proceeds to pursue his scheme.  After a year he has gone to some other place where he will be near better schools for his children or something like that and a new appointee has a further scheme in mind.  The suggestions of the local councillors in most cases are ignored.  It would not be any harm to give the local elected representatives more say, better individual powers, if you like, with regard to the allocation of money on roads in concurrence <Col N="628" /> with the assistant and county surveyors.</P>
      <P>There are many other things one would like to deal with on this Estimate, but one must have consideration for others who may wish to discuss particular matters.  The important point about local government, to my mind, is that the local council, the county council, has become something to which the people look for benefits all the year round, but, when the annual estimates come along and the rate is struck, they proceed to condemn the high rate which they are called on to pay.  During the rest of the 12 month period, they expect to be able to get money for roads, for hospitalisation services, for water works and sewerage schemes and for all the other amenities.  The people who comprise the present Government did not fail to make all the propaganda they could out of the increasing rate during the recent elections, but that increasing rate is the result of the greater demand for improved amenities, for housing and so on and I cannot foresee that upward trend being arrested.  The public have to be made aware that, if they want these amenities and these improved services in connection with local government, they will have to pay for them.  The public, furthermore, do not fully realise that what they pay in rates alone is only a fraction of the total cost of the services.  They do not realise that a very great percentage of the cost is recouped from the Central Fund, but we have to make up our minds whether or not we want these services. If we do, we must be prepared to face increased rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to my final point, the question of the unfair way in which that burden of local rates is carried. We have a system of haphazard valuation under which a man who has had the misfortune to improve his premises has his property revalued and, as a result, has to pay a much higher share of the local rate than his neighbour who is content to leave his premises as they were and who has not carried out any improvement which would necessitate a visit by the valuation officer. The result is that a section of the <Col N="629" /> people is carrying an unfair burden&mdash; the section which has been unfortunate enough to have its property revalued in recent years.  If the Minister can do anything to bring about equality in this matter, if we could wake up in the morning and find that everybody had been revalued, the burden on each and any individual would not be any greater, but, so long as you have this system of an occasional revaluation here and there, so long will this inequity continue.  I know cases of business premises with a valuation of £30 while the premises next door, the owner of which has the same income and who is probably doing better business, carry a valuation of £5.  That is a very unfair allocation of the burden of rates and it is due to this whole question of valuation getting out of line.</P>
    <P>All the other speakers referred to some local matter and I will be forgiven if I appeal to the Minister to consider the position of tenants of new cottages who are complaining about the rather high rents they have to meet.  In the town of Ballyshannon at the moment there are a large number of tenants who are compelled to pay a rent which in many cases they are unable to meet.  That is proved by the fact that, when cheaper rented cottages become vacant, the number of applications from tenants of the higher rented houses is colossal.  I need not stress the matter in any detail because the Minister is personally aware of some of the hardships about which I complain and I feel he will make some effort to find a means whereby these rents may be lowered to a point more in keeping with the average income of the tenants who live in these houses.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success in the office he has taken over.  I am sure he will get every co-operation from this side in any worthwhile proposals he makes.  His predecessor has set a fairly high standard, which, I am sure, will be a guide for him in finding his feet in this important office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A matter of vital importance to people in rural areas is the <Col N="630" /> present system under which people make application for grants for reconstruction work or otherwise.  In or about 1948, a system was introduced by the Minister for Local Government under which local government meant local government in regard to these housing grants, in that there was a true sense of decentralisation.  When a person wished to apply for these grants, he could go to the local county council office, get the necessary forms and complete them there.  That system, which was in operation roughly from 1948 to 1952, was changed and I believe that change was a retrograde step in relation to helping people in the matter of these reconstruction grants and housing grants generally.</P>
      <P>In order to help people who are anxious to help themselves by improving their own homes, without depending on local authorities to provide them with local authority houses, it is vitally important that they should get the grants to which they are entitled with the least possible delay and I earnestly ask the Minister to consider reintroducing the system of having these grants completed through the local authority offices and not to leave us faced with the problem of the bottleneck in the Custom House which arose in 1952&mdash;not the fault of the officials but the fault of the system which was reintroduced and which meant that the officials in the Custom House were snowed under by the enormous number of applications which should have been dealt with locally but which, by reason of Government or ministerial Order, had to come to Dublin.  The less we have of Dublin in the matter of local government and the more we have of real local government, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are still faced with the problem of people who cannot make out where they stand with regard to the supplementary housing grant.  Some years ago, a Labour Minister for Local Government, the late Mr. T.J. Murphy, introduced legislation which made it clear that people were entitled to a supplementary housing grant from a local authority on certain considerations. That Act has been amended since, and, as a member of a local authority, I am firmly convinced, as are many of my colleagues, that the <Col N="631" /> amending Act means more complications and heartbreaks for many applicants than anyone will ever realise, because the introduction of three means tests in this amending Act has created for these people a problem they cannot get over.  It has also brought in its train a new system under which the attitude of local officials in certain areas has been anything but commendable in dealing with applicants on the basis of these means tests.</P>

      <P>While I was speaking before I moved to report progress I referred to some of the propaganda which the Parties now forming the Government published before the election, and I referred in particular to the fact that, despite the crippling burden that Fianna Fáil was alleged to have placed on the people, despite the fact that the Parties opposite always maintained that it was unnecessary, the sum total of their reliefs to date amounts to approximately 1/3 a week in the case of the average family, and I think it could be contended that it is even less in the case of the majority of the families of the country.</P>
      <P>There has been, however, as well as the published pre-election propaganda, a pamphlet published in the past few days which I think is the official Labour journal, at least for the Dublin area.  Its title is <i>Labour</i> and it is issued by the Dublin Regional Council of the Labour Party.  The first heading is: &ldquo;Labour Keeps Faith with the People: Prices to be Cut.&rdquo;  It is worth while quoting some of the contents of this front page article.  It carries, of course, photographs of four of the Labour Deputies, all representative of Dublin constituencies, Deputy James Larkin, Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll, Deputy Denis Larkin and Deputy Seán Dunne.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They are very good looking people I must admit.  The journal says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The first point in the election programme of the Labour Party was &lsquo;reduction in food prices and use of subsidies on essential articles of food to achieve this objective.&rsquo;  Our Party fought the election mainly on that pledge, to reduce prices.  It made it very clear that it would not support or take part in any Government which did not undertake to lower the cost of living.  Labour was the only Party which gave this pledge to the electorate.  Fianna Fáil took the line that nothing could be done about prices.  Fine Gael insisted that it would make no promises.  Well, Labour said that something would have to be done about prices and it made very definite promises.  Labour has kept faith with the people.  It has honoured the pledge given by it to the electorate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I will agree that it has honoured that pledge to the extent of being instrumental, I take it, in bringing about a promise at least that butter will be reduced from a date in August.  It says lower down:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Soon butter will be cheaper and we are confident that the outcome of the Government's review of the prices of other commodities will be further reductions.  Let there be no mistake about it; Labour is serious when it says that prices must come down.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I take it that it has at least swallowed the pill that there will be no further reductions for the balance of the current financial year but I think I can take it also, from the context of this document, that there will be wigs on the green if at the end of the financial year there are no further price reductions. Further on there is a little qualification:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are under no illusion as to the margin available for reducing prices.  We do not expect this or any other Government to work miracles or achieve the impossible.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that understanding or well-informed approach was very <Col N="633" /> evident when Labour Deputies were speaking from this side of the House before the last election.  If one listened to their speeches and read them one could only take from them that there would be no difficulty whatever in bringing about the reduction in prices and, as Deputy Dunne promised, an immediate reduction in those prices.  Deputy Dunne's photograph is, of course, here too and apparently Deputy Dunne's immediate promise has now gone by the board. I presume that is the first of the many promises that will be thrown overboard as Fine Gael has done in regard to the high cost of living.  The pamphlet goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Apart from the question of prices, there are other points in the Government's programme which the people will welcome, in particular the undertaking to increase social welfare benefits (old age pensions, widows' pensions, etc.).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has reasserted the Government's intention in that respect.  It will be interesting to know to what extent he can get agreement from his Fine Gael colleagues to increase those benefits still further.  It will be more interesting to get from the responsible Minister the source of the moneys which will go to provide those increased benefits.  I assume that, since it has been put forward as agreed policy by the Government, Fine Gael are in agreement on increasing those benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a complete fallacy.  The old age pension, when Deputy Dillon left office as Minister for Agriculture, stood at 17/6 and prior to that the old age pension was 15/-. When one takes in other supplemental benefits that were payable, I am sure the Minister will agree that there is no truth whatsoever in the suggestion that they were instrumental in doubling the old age pension.  But it is a fact that before the Minister left office in 1951 <Col N="634" /> he was given the opportunity by the Fianna Fáil Party who were then in opposition, that if they brought legislation in to increase the old age pension still further, no opposition would be offered on this side.  Deputy Norton and his colleagues failed to take advantage of this offer.  Within a month of resuming office Fianna Fáil had in fact increased the old age pension to 20/- and later 21/6.  However, Fianna Fáil had to find the money somewhere and the increased taxation that followed was inevitable if we were to pay for those increased pensions.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael seem to have gone one better than their previous declared policy in regard to social welfare.  I refer to an advertisement which appeared in the <i>Southern Star</i> of the 15th May, 1954, which advocated the candidature of Deputy Seán Collins and his colleague, Councillor John L. O'Sullivan and in which they stated in point 5 of their published propaganda: &ldquo;Old age pensions for all with the abolition of the means test.&rdquo;  I am sure Deputy Murphy in his assiduous reading of the <i>Southern Star</i> noted that with particular care and put it aside for future reference so that at least as far as the Fine Gael Party representative from West Cork is concerned he will have no difficulty in enlisting his support to persuade the Government to abolish the means test.

I take it that if Deputy Dillon found himself surrounded with a sufficient number of Fine Gael Deputies to form a Government, without the support of Labour or anyone else, he would not hesitate.  I take it the same applies to Labour if they found themselves sufficiently strong numerically to form a Government.</P>

      <P>I think this is a very nonsensical discussion.  It is a sheer waste of the time of this House and I believe there is not an atom of sincerity in the amendment put down by the former Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass.</P>
      <P>We appreciate that the Fianna Fáil Deputies on the Opposition Benches are very dissatisfied.  We appreciate that they are disgruntled because the Irish people expressed in no uncertain terms through the medium of the ballot boxes on the 18th May last that they wanted a change of Government, an inter-Party Government, to again control the destinies of this State. That was the democratic right of the people and Deputy Lynch and those associated with him in Fianna Fáil should appreciate the people's right to elect an alternative Government to theirs.  Fianna Fáil was here too long. I am sure that they will never again find themselves on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main argument advanced by the Opposition speakers is in relation to promises made by the Tánaiste and others.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in an endeavour to bolster up their case that the inter-Party Government got in by making false promises.  I have much more faith in the Irish people than the Deputies in Fianna Fáil have.  The Irish people examined the position as it was put before them by the then Government Party and by the Opposition groups, which now comprise the Government.  The then Opposition groups told the people that they believed the inter-Party system of Government was a better and more beneficial system for this country. They told the people to weigh side by side the achievements accomplished here during the inter-Party régime from 1948 to 1951 with the achievements of Fianna Fáil from 1932 to 1948 and from 1951 to 1954.  They asked the people to judge which Government gave the best service to the country and the people, adjudicating on that issue, decided that the inter-Party system gave the best service; it is on that basis the people decided in favour of the inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>There was no duplicity.  Neither was there any deception.  In West Cork, as indeed throughout the entire country, we put it clearly before the people that it was most unlikely that any Party would get an over-all majority in the recent election.  We told the people that the system of Government which obtained here from 1948 to 1951 was the most beneficial system.

      <P>That is what the Deputy is hoping will happen, but I am satisfied that the destinies of this country are once more in safe hands and that the Government is constituted of men of ability with a thorough knowledge of the people's needs and requirements.  I am equally satisfied, as are the majority of the people, that they will introduce beneficial legislation here.  They do not expect to introduce that legislation overnight, but in the course of time it will be brought in. We can afford to think over the problems confronting us.  We have no need to rush hasty legislation through the House because we have a solid majority which we got from the Irish people on the 18th May and we will utilise that majority for their benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who are these Fianna Fáil Deputies to castigate anyone about false promises?  Have not Fianna Fáil existed on false promises?  My colleague, Deputy Kyne, had occasion to refer to the promises made when Fianna Fáil first got control of this <Col N="639" /> country's destinies in 1932.  The people were told then that if Fianna Fáil was elected and made the Government of the country Ireland would become overnight a kind of heaven upon earth. Fianna Fáil would bring back all the emigrants from England and Canada and the United States of America and provide them with employment at home.  The former Taoiseach said that Ireland could maintain 17,000,000 people.  After 20 years of Fianna Fáil Government it is not to-day able to maintain 3,000,000 people never mind the 17,000,000 about whom the former Taoiseach boasted.  Fianna Fáil must recognise that it scarcely ever honoured a promise it made to the people.  You came in as a Government in 1951 under false pretences.  As you have been told by Deputies in the Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta and Labour Parties, you got in on the votes of a few Independent members who had been elected by the people to support the inter-Party system of Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I dislike very much referring to former members of the House who are not here to defend themselves, but the fact is, as we have maintained here time and time again, that those particular Deputies misinterpreted the views of the people who supported them at the previous election. That was clearly demonstrated on the 18th May last; at the first opportunity which their constituents got of determining the matter, they did so in no uncertain manner by removing those people from this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the justification for the statements which have been made time and time again here by the Deputies who sit in the Parties on this side of the House, that the Fianna Fáil Government during the period 1951 to 1954 enjoyed office because of <Col N="640" /> misrepresentation by four Independent Deputies that we had in this House. They had been elected to support the inter-Party system of Government but did not do so.  Therefore, I say that the last Government had no mandate.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the time of the House.  Since the change of Government a wave of contentment and satisfaction has swept throughout the country from Cork to Donegal. The people now realise that they have a representative, responsible and democratic Government in charge of the affairs of the country, and that the one-Party dictatorial system of Government which obtained here during the past three years, and for a number of years prior to that, has ended.  The people know very well that the ordinary rank and file members of the Fianna Fáil Party had little say in regard to policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind Deputy Lynch that I prefaced my remarks by saying that it was the considered opinion of the Labour Party, and indeed of every Party forming the inter-Party Government, that it was most unlikely that any Party would get an over-all majority in this election. The issue was put before the people as to whether they were in favour of a one-Party dictatorial system of government, such as we had under Fianna Fáil, or of a democratic inter-Party system of Government. The Irish people decided in favour of the inter-Party system of government, and that is why we are here and you are on the other side.  The Irish <Col N="641" /> people expressed their approval of the inter-Party system, and that is the position.</P>
      <P>So far as promises and assurances are concerned, the people were told that the inter-Party Government, if elected, would continue the policy which it had pursued during the period from 1948 to 1951.  I feel sure that Deputy O'Malley cannot but agree that the country prospered very much under the inter-Party system of government, and that we had a much more prosperous time between 1948 and 1951 than we had from 1951 to 1954.  I believe the people are satisfied that this Government will act as the former inter-Party Government acted.  The people are satisfied that this Government's handling of the country's affairs will be competent and capable, that it will not arrive at any hasty decisions but will consider closely and carefully every piece of legislation, and will see that there will be no wanton or wasteful expenditure such as occurred under Fianna Fáil for a number of years. This Government will ensure that every penny of public funds will be used to the country's advantage, for the advantage of the people in providing them with gainful employment, and will cut out wanton schemes such as had been envisaged by Fianna Fáil. I suppose if Fianna Fáil had got back the last time they would have started on the building of a new Parliament at a cost of £12,000,000 and throwing away money on racehorses and schemes of that sort which were of no benefit.  At present Fianna Fáil has no propaganda left except in newspaper cuttings.  I was rather surprised to find Deputy Lynch, a former Parliamentary Secretary, going around looking for these newspaper cuttings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good job for the Deputy, but these newspaper cuttings have no bearing whatever on the present position.  No member on this side of the House, no matter what Party he belongs to, made any false promises to the people.  Deputies did point out to the people the marked increase <Col N="642" /> that there had been in the cost of living.  The former Minister for External Affairs, in the course of his speech to-day, produced a number of these quotations and said that Deputies on this side had assured the Irish people that they would reduce prices to the 1951 level.  He was not, however, able to name one single Deputy on this side of the House who had made any such statement.</P>
      <P>What we pointed out to the people was that we believed that the marked increase in the cost of living was quite uncalled for, and that we would endeavour in so far as we could, if successful in the election, to halt that increase in the cost of living and make reductions wherever possible.  That was the general promise which those on this side of the House made to the people.  It is one that we are going to implement.  We have already given an earnest of our intention to do so.</P>
      <P>I should like to make an appeal to some of the new Deputies, and in particular to my friend Deputy Moher who comes from County Cork, to adopt a more progressive policy and to cut themselves away from disruptive tactics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">

      <P>The Party opposite should bear in mind that they have been rejected by the people and that this Government is here by the will of the people, and I believe will be here for the next five years.  I do not think there can be any doubt about that.  There is an obligation on the Opposition Party to give as much help as possible to the Government, help such as we gave to them when they were in office.  Any criticisms that we made in our time from the opposite side were of a constructive character, their object being to stop the then Government from pursuing the wasteful and wanton policy which they had embarked on.  That should be the line of the Opposition to-day as it was our line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have little more to say.  The people gave their verdict a very short time ago.  That verdict is more powerful and more expressive than any statements that can be made in this House six <Col N="643" /> weeks after the election.  I should like to say, in conclusion, that I have no doubt the present Minister for Finance, the most responsible Minister in the Government, is a man who will prove himself well capable of his job. He has had experience as a member of the House and enjoys the confidence of every Deputy irrespective of whether that Deputy is a member of the Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Talmhan or Clann na Poblachta Parties.  We stand firmly behind him in his difficult task, knowing the financial problems that he has to face.  We are quite confident that he, with his other colleagues in the Government, will succeed in bringing about an era of peace, contentment and prosperity to the country.  In my opinion, the condition, so far as people are concerned, will have changed very much for the better when the term in office of this Government will have ended in four or five years' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to congratulate the present Minister for Finance on his appointment, and to say that, much as I may differ from him on many matters, I hope he will be a great success in his capacity as the new Minister for Finance.  He has the most important Ministry of State.  The success or otherwise of the policies which each Minister would like to bring into operation depend to a great extent on the financial backing and support they are going to get from the man who holds the purse. Personally I am more concerned in this House with the measures that are going to be taken by the Government over their period of office towards stemming emigration and increasing employment than in dealing with the immediate questions of who said such a thing should be brought down or who made promises on certain lines prior to the election.  Speaking as an independent Deputy I could very well forcibly remind all the Parties in the House that they have all made political promises in the past and many of these promises were more honoured in the breach than in the observance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a motion here before the House and frankly I was rather <Col N="644" /> surprised to see a motion of this nature so early.  I feel that we should recollect&mdash;those of us who were here in 1951 when the change of government came&mdash;that the Government which took office at that period made it clear to many of us that they had no intention of interfering with food subsidies or similar things and yet because when they took up office they found it was essential that money be raised they had to take the step they did not believe would have to be taken prior to the election, and in the following year they reduced the food subsidies.  In that connection that particular Government got 12 months to work.  They took over Estimates that had been prepared by the inter-Party Government and those Estimates were worked on by the incoming Government for 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Estimates of this year were prepared by the Fianna Fáil Government and I think it is a bit early to get a complete overhaul on the lines suggested now by the Opposition.  I do not for a moment believe that they expect anything revolutionary to take place now and possibly this motion is designed more to embarrass certain members of the Government Parties and make them a little more careful in future about statements they make.  If it is for that purpose it is perhaps no harm as a reminder to individual Deputies that when they do make promises the people are entitled to some return.</P>
    <P>One point I should like to mention first of all is in connection with the reduction in the price of butter.  I think it is a great thing to say the price of an essential commodity is going to come down.  I also feel that we must approach this reduction from another angle.  When this reduction in the price of butter takes place we must take into consideration that in many of the houses here in Dublin, in Cork and in all towns, there are many people living in poor areas who can ill afford to buy butter even at the reduced price.  Many of these families are to-day using margarine and I can foresee that in a short time the problem will arise in that there will be a surplus of butter in this country and on the cost of production of 1 lb. of butter we will <Col N="645" /> have to pay a price to the British or some other people to take this butter off our hands.  From one point of view I think it is wise to reduce the price of butter, but if we examine carefully into the problem of who is going to benefit most by the reduction we will find it is not the poorer section of the community.  The family that can afford to buy but 1 lb. of butter will save only 5d. but if we go and look at the luxury hotel using maybe 1 cwt. of butter in a week, we will see whom the reduction in the price of butter benefits most.</P>
    <P>I would prefer when a reduction in the price of an essential foodstuff takes place that the benefit of that reduction would be given mainly to the very poor sections of our community.  There are two ways of doing that: one is by a system of rationing&mdash;I am not suggesting that that should come into operation&mdash;and the other is by giving increases in allowances through children's allowances, through old age pensions and through increases in wages if necessary, so that those people who are on the borderline so far as the cost of living is concerned will be able to purchase this commodity and so that the well-to-do sections of the community, the hoteliers and possibly the tourists will bear a fair share of the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I will bet, as far as the Minister is concerned, that in three months' time he will not find a reduction in the charges for hotels for guests staying for a night in spite of the reduction in the price of butter.  That is not going to be passed on to the public.</P>
    <P>I mention that as a criticism of the manner in which the reduction took place.  I know it is very difficult when you do something in a hurry to satisfy everybody and possibly I am very hard to satisfy.</P>
    <P>I am, however, satisfied that efforts are going to be made by this Government over a period of time to solve some of the major problems that face the country, and that the key to success lies in the hands of the Minister for Finance.  It is an old saying that the man who holds the purse can control the destiny of the nation, and I have listened on many occasions to <Col N="646" /> the present Minister for Agriculture and other colleagues of his on the Front Bench when they have time and again pointed out that the power to create credit should lie in the hands of the State and that rates of interest on money for development should be lowered especially as regards money for capital development.  If we are going to get the expansion in this country in agriculture and in afforestation that we need it will take money and that money must be made available at a low rate of interest; otherwise future generations will not be able to bear the interest rates that will lie heavily upon them.  There is a heavy bill to be met now out of the Budget, to be raised out of revenue for the repayment of interest charges.  That is mounting each year.  We are paying to private moneylenders a huge rate of interest so that the country may be developed.  If we are going to leave power in the hands of those private groups they are going to choke off the lifeblood&mdash;which is money&mdash;for the development work.  I make no bones about it when I say that every time there was an increase in the rates of interest for money in Britain a similar change took place here.</P>
    <P>If Britain wanted to clamp down on credit and if the British Government wanted to make a decision to reduce credit they ordered the Bank of England to take the necessary steps and no sooner had that taken place in England than our commercial banks here followed suit.  It is a significant thing that whenever the question of finance or of control of credit came up in England the decision with regard to increasing the rates of interest was always announced in the Budget speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the British House of Commons.  All decisions with regard to interest rates and money were made and announced in the House of Commons.  Here in Ireland, when a change in the rate of interest is contemplated, the commercial banks merely politely notify the Government that they are about to increase their rates of interest.  In other words, the Government or the State have no say whatever in the matter and, when <Col N="647" /> they have not, all our hopes for the expansion that is so essential in our economy can never be realised, while that power lies outside the control of the State.</P>
    <P>I am going to take a rather long-term view in connection with the present Government.  I am watching to see the steps they propose to take in connection with financial matters. If the necessary steps are taken, I see no reason why the Government should not get solid support.  They will get it certainly outside the House if the people see that fundamentals are being tackled.  However, it will take time to do these things.  So far as the Opposition are concerned, they are entitled at the present time, I suppose, to make capital out of everything they can.  At the same time I do not think it fair, at such an early stage in the lifetime of the present Government, to hold up the business of the House on an amendment of this kind.  If an amendment of this kind were put down in 12 months' time, I could see every reason for the Opposition pursuing their tactics tooth and nail, provided the necessary adjustments and changes that have been suggested were not brought about then.  I see no reason why in 12 months' time, after a close examination of the various Departments, the present Government should not be able to make certain improvements and reductions in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>At the end of 12 months the excuse will not be available to the Government that the Estimates were prepared by a previous Administration.  After 12 months, the present Government will have the responsibility for the preparation of next year's Estimates. I think that is the time that the criticism that is now being levelled against the Government should be levelled, if it can be justified.  I personally do not favour a motion of this kind at this juncture.  Even though amendments may be introduced here on the Committee Stage which I should like to support, I do not intend to support them because it would not be practicable at the present time to take steps to bring them into operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> There is one matter that strikes me in connection with the tax on drink. Suggestions were made by prominent members of the present Government that if the penal tax imposed on spirits were reduced, we would be able to get more money into the Exchequer.  If that proposition has been examined by officials of the Department since the change of Government, I should like to know whether the views of the experts in the Department of Finance coincided with the views expressed by members of the present Government who stated on numerous occasions that if these penal taxes were reduced more money would come into the Exchequer.  I want to get an answer to that as a matter of information.</P>
    <P>I also want to make it clear that I think this Government or any other Government would be very foolish, either now or in the future, to take any steps to reduce the tax on spirits or whiskey.  I think that under no circumstances should any reduction be made.  If any reduction is to be made in the tax on drink, let it be in connection with the pint, the poor man's pint as it is called, though it is not the poor man alone who drinks it. If there is to be any reduction made, let it be in connection with that particular drink but certainly not in connection with spirits because if we allow a reduction to take place now in the tax on spirits, whatever chance we have of expanding our export trade will go up the spout.</P>
    <P>The distillers are only too anxious to increase their output and their sales on the home market if we give them the opportunity to do so, but it is quite different with the export market, the dollar market that stares us in the face if we would only try to develop it.  Personally, if necessary, I should prefer to see the Minister losing money for the Exchequer by increasing the tax on spirits so that these distillers would be forced into the foreign market and forced to bring much needed dollars into this country to help to balance our economy.  I repeat once more that although the new Minister and I may differ on many matters, I wish him the very best of success in the onerous undertaking he has before him.</P>

      <P>Perhaps one might think that a new and young Deputy like myself coming in here for the first time, might be overawed and consider it necessary to bring in a number of files, newspaper cuttings and statistics. I do not view it in that light.  I think the issue in the motion before the House is a very simple one.  The Parties represented in the Government know only too well that what we desire is an opportunity of exposing their tactics to the Irish people, to the electorate.  I came in here, I suppose, with a certain amount of ideals and principles but I was certainly very quickly disillusioned, even on the very first day the Dáil met to elect the Taoiseach.  I think that if we are to do business here we, as an Opposition, must offer constructive criticism at all times and it is certainly not the policy of this Party to go in for destructive criticism or to do anything which would retard the progress of the country.  On the day the Dáil met here first we had Deputy Mulcahy, now the Minister for Education, proposing Deputy Costello as Taoiseach. In doing so he held him up as an example of a man who had given up so much for so little.  Did they forget or did the proposer of the Taoiseach forget, how much Deputy de Valera, Deputy Lemass, Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Dr. Ryan and other men who have rendered service to the country, have given up for so little?  That kind of hypocrisy, in my opinion, should not be tolerated.  That is on the point of honesty; I am afraid I am very much disillusioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can, I think, sincerely say to the Minister for Finance that I heard him utter only two true words: &ldquo;I move&rdquo;. We here shall expose on every possible occasion the falsehoods which Fine Gael have tried to put over on the people of this country.  The Taoiseach came in here and said: &ldquo;Before the election we gave no promises.&rdquo;  Yet, last night the Attorney-General, Deputy McGilligan, said: &ldquo;Yes, and every one of our promises will be implemented.&rdquo; Notice should be taken of that by the Minister for Finance.  The Taoiseach said: &ldquo;We gave no promises&rdquo; while Deputy McGilligan said: &ldquo;Yes, we did and we shall implement <Col N="650" /> every one of them.&rdquo;  It is easy for Deputy McGilligan to talk.  Perhaps he hopes that he will not be there to have to answer the electorate at a future date, that he will be looking down upon us from the Supreme Court.</P>

That is soon forgotten.  Then we had Deputy McGilligan last night saying in this House that only for proportional representation we would see a landslide. How little he knows about proportional representation.  In fact, if proportional representation did not exist in this country, we would be returned to power with something like 104 seats. There was no landslide in this election. The election was decided by certain elements in Dublin and certain elements in Cork City.  You could call the election, in fact, A Tale of Two Cities&mdash;and that got the hammer yesterday at, the Curragh&mdash;it did not stay and the Coalition will not stay either.</P>

Their Party leaders and their canvassers went around the housing schemes of Limerick City together with their Fine Gael allies and they promised the poorer classes down there&mdash;if I am challenged outside the House I can prove it&mdash;that without a shadow of doubt all the social services would be increased immediately.  Now we can see the attitude they adopted: &ldquo;We are in now.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Consider the way in which the civil servants up here were bought by the Fine Gael Party&mdash;by Deputy McGilligan&mdash;a night or two before the elections.  I recall Deputy Norton speaking on the 21st April in this House, when he described this <Col N="652" /> present Budget and said: &ldquo;A few morsels are being set as bait in the hope of deluding simple electors.&rdquo;  Yet Deputy McGilligan turned around and, to buy the votes of the civil servants, he offered them this bribe and possibly with some success.  He made the statement last night that he would do all in his power to see that no civil servant became redundant but, <i>sotto voce</i>, he spoke of the 1,500 who go out every year through marriage or death or for some other reason and he did not say whether the 1,500 positions would be filled.  I wonder what the Labour Party's attitude is on that matter.</P>

      <P>We had the option under the arbitration of making it retrospective if the money was there. The question is that this country has been sold by Fine Gael before.  It was sold in the past.  There are young people in the country to-day who, unfortunately, are not politically educated to that fact.  Besides selling us out politically, as they did when they sold the Six Counties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there is a thing which could be just as serious, it is to sell the country economically.  The Government have been asked by speakers on this side of the House where are they getting the money. They did not give a coherent answer yet.  I will give the Minister the answer&mdash;he is going to borrow it.  Can I ask the Minister &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, is not that right?  Of course it is right. They are going to borrow the money and the day will come when this country will be a bankrupt nation if you continue in office and we will have to go with our hat in our hand to Britain and America for credits and <Col N="653" /> they will say: &ldquo;All right.  If you want certain facilities from us, we want certain facilities from you.&rdquo;  You know what the facilities will be.  You could throw overboard overnight, so to speak, all that was won and fought for so dearly in this country.</P>
      <P>I have no statistics here.  The Minister must agree that that is what he is going to do&mdash;borrow&mdash;because the Minister well knows who is keeping him in office, who is keeping the Government in office.  The man who is keeping the Government in office to-day is Deputy Jim Larkin and when he pulls the string that is the end of the Coalition Government.  The Labour Party turned around and they said that they genuinely thought and they genuinely would see that all these promises were implemented.  The Minister knows who can bring him down and the Minister, if he is honest, will have to face facts and face them very quickly.  He can offer the children of this nation bankruptcy in future or he can say to the Labour Party: &ldquo;I am sorry.  I have to tell you the truth. The money is not there.  I did the best I could.  We are in power.  Pull together.  Try and stay for five years and then we will hope for pot luck.&rdquo;</P>

It gave a lot of concern to us in Limerick and I put down a question about it.  Brave as you like, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said no, the Government had no intention whatever of nationalising the flour industry. Therefore the first point of the Labour Party programme goes like that.  It does not worry them any more.  They are delighted amongst themselves. They are all feeling very happy to be there for five years.  I uttered a very ominous few words to-night.</P>

      <P>One Minister who was kicked out by Fine Gael and taken back again is the man who recently involved us in a nice position. <Col N="656" /> I would say that Deputy Morrissey would not agree with that, no matter how bad things might be otherwise. As I said, this country will be brought to the brink of bankruptcy in a very short time if the policy of the Minister for Finance which I have prophesied is put into operation, and it is the only policy, as far as I can see, that he can put into operation to fulfil his promises.  Borrow, borrow, that is what he is going to do.  He is going to borrow, without any shadow of doubt, and when he is concluding this debate he should have enough guts to admit to the Irish people that that is what he is going to do.</P>
      <P>It was thrown at me, on my first appearance in this House, that I had a lot to learn.  I may not have the forensic ability of the Minister for Agriculture and I may not be a lecturer in economics, but I have enough common sense to see that this country is being led to ruin.  As I said before, the Fine Gael Party has brought us to political ruin and they are trying now to bring us to financial ruin.  But I cannot see how, in their hearts, the Labour Deputies who are not members of the Government can support this. I can visualise the day coming very shortly when there will be a break.

We are not going to taunt the Government that they promised this and promised that. We say that the money is not there to implement the promises.  We say that even after a short time the people who voted for you and put you here now realise without any shadow of doubt that they were codded, that they were gulled.

I ask the Minister to bear in mind that it is but a step from the Capitol to the Tarpeian Rock and, when it comes to the day of reckoning, if he does not do what we are trying to ask him to do constructively, then the Minister for Finance can rest assured that the inter-Party Government and the Coalition cliques will be wiped from the political map of this country forever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that day is too far distant.  We heard a lot during the election campaign about the repatriation of external assets.  Those opposite were going round in my area promising they would bring back those millions of pounds from England immediately they got back into office&mdash;£41,000,000 and £127,000,000&mdash;and reinvest it here. The Minister for Finance knows only too well that is a physical impossibility. The Labour Party should face up to the facts, now that they have responsibility for the national well-being and when they realise that the Government cannot implement those promises they should not do anything <Col N="658" /> which would damage the country.  I will conclude by repeating my prophecy to the Minister for Finance that he will be brought down by the small percentage, 13 per cent. of the electorate, by that Party who put him into power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to intervene for long in this debate.  In the past two days the House has had submitted to it considerable documentary evidence of the various promises made and broken by the Coalition.  It started fairly early on last year during the by-election in East Cork of which this House heard so much.  My constituency was invaded by the itinerant soapbox orators of Fine Gael and the people were subjected to a psychological blitz.  In my constituency one morning I was speaking at the church gate at Coolagown and two members of the Fine Gael Party spoke there before me.</P>
      <P>On that particular morning they were telling the farmers of Coolagown that Deputy de Valera was building a new jail at Chapelizod to meet the creamery milk producers when they came to Dublin the following spring. That sounded very well at a church where the entire congregation consisted of dairy farmers.  A very strange thing happened that night, when another team of the itinerants spoke in the town of Fermoy and piped a very different tune, saying they did not know how the housewife or the mother of a large family could buy milk at 5d. a pint or butter at 4/2 a lb.  That is a sample of the duplicity which we had then and in the recent election.  In that instance they wanted dear milk in Coolagown and cheap milk and butter in Fermoy three miles away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an argument yesterday evening by the lawyer members of Fine Gael on certain statements quoted from this side of the House, that they did not contain the meaning which the speakers on this side put on them.  One has to remember that many of the statements and advertisements were ambiguous, but one has also to remember that the Front Bench of Fine Gael found its place because of the reckless promises made by the various Deputies who succeeded behind them.  It was the majority of the legswhich sent the heads to the Front <Col N="659" /> Bench.  I listened to the Attorney-General, Deputy McGilligan, talk of the arid years of Fianna Fáil adminisstration and then, looking across at the Labour Benches, I thought that the lingering shadow of Deputy McGilligan must look very like Banquo's ghost to the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I will cite another instance, the case where the price of eggs dropped, through external circumstances.  We had been warning the people as far back as 1948, when Deputy Dillon, the present Minister for Agriculture, was stalking the country telling the people he would drown the British with eggs. We were warning the people then that, in view of the considerable subsidy which the British were giving to their home producers, they should be very careful that the amount of capital which they invested in the poultry industry would be recoupable within a certain limited time.  However, Deputy Dillon placed no reserve or limit, he stated in his usual extravagant way that he would drown the British with eggs.</P>
    <P>What happened?  In a short time, encouraged by the subsidy, the British produced something like 85 per cent. of their total requirements in eggs, leaving 15 per cent. for competition between all-comers; and the bottom fell out of the price.  Last year some of those opposite were saying in the towns that the policy of Deputy Dillon reduced the price of eggs to the consumer, but in the rural areas they blamed Fianna Fáil for the fall in price.</P>
    <P>That was the kind of duplicity to which the people were subjected.  That is one of the reasons why I am here&mdash; because just one year elapsed when I fortunately was given an opportunity to return to those same constituents and to expose the duplicity and the false promises made by the people opposite.  I have always maintained that our people are an intelligent and politically mature people and that they will very soon punish those who deceive them.  That accounts for my presence here.  I missed no opportunity of recalling the speeches made and of reminding the people of the various <Col N="660" /> promises made by that concentration of Deputies opposite which invaded the constituency of East Cork on that occasion.  I repeat that if our people were intelligent enough between the years 1953 and 1954 to punish Fine Gael for its duplicity on that particular occasion, when they are given the opportunity again they will certainly mete out a like punishment for the deception of which the people opposite were guilty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I had not the opportunity yesterday to listen to the ollagoning of the Fianna Fáil Party over their loss of office.  I am quite sure that, like the rest of the people of the country, it would to me have been entertaining.  It is very ironical, when you think of it.  We have the Deputy-Leader of the Opposition coming in here and complaining &mdash; complaining, mind you&mdash;that a more speedy reduction in prices has not taken place.  It is a sad commentary upon the development of political thought in the Fianna Fáil Party that we have had this exhibition of ineptitude on the part of the former Tánaiste.  Surely he does not think for a moment that the people of this country, who recently had an opportunity of expressing their view as to the right form of Government for the Republic of Ireland, have forgotten the actions for which his Government were responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could make many excuses for the large number of new Deputies in this House who were not present when the 1952 Budget was introduced and who, consequently, can have no recollection of the impact of that Budget upon the House and upon the people of the country.  In saying that, I should like to make it clear that all of us welcome the infusion of new blood into this House.  One can excuse, therefore, the lack of recollection on the part of the new Deputies.  Those of us who were here, however, remember very well that, within the short space of a few hours, the whole economic fabric of this country was ruthlessly interfered with by the Minister for Finance of the Fianna Fáil Government.  People who had been living not well but fairly well, workers who had been finding it possible to <Col N="661" /> cope with the cost of living during the three years of the first inter-Party Government found themselves overnight in an impossible position when the prices of essential foodstuffs particularly and, after that, of commodities which are described by many as &ldquo;luxuries&rdquo;&mdash;that is, cigarettes and the worker's drink&mdash;were increased to such an extent as to put them out of the reach of the working people of the country.</P>
    <P>I have often thought that the Opposition, when they were in Government, were so out of touch with the feelings of the people that they did not really appreciate what they were doing. They did not appreciate, for instance, that in the built-up areas&mdash;areas such as Ballyfermot, Cabra, Kimmage and other areas around the City of Dublin with which many of us are particularly acquainted&mdash;they put butter off the table of the working people and for the three years of Fianna Fáil mismanagement there was nothing within their reach except margarine.  Many will think that that is an exaggeration. If anybody doubts what I say, I suggest that he should go around these areas, talk to the people there, go into their houses and see for himself whether or not what I have said is true.</P>
    <P>The people then got an opportunity of expressing their view upon the actions of Fianna Fáil in Government &mdash;and they expressed it in no undecided way.  They said they wanted a change.  They have got a change. I committed myself to the policy of reduction in prices.  I believe that prices can be reduced and I believe that if we have to reduce them by way of subsidy&mdash;and at the moment it seems there is no other method of doing it&mdash;it should be done.  In every democratic country in the world where Governments are found who consider the welfare of the working people, the policy of the subsidisation of essential foodstuffs is accepted.</P>
    <P>This Government have given evidence that they propose to reduce prices.  Inside the short period of a month, they have already announced a very substantial reduction in the price of butter.  The best reply that Fianna <Col N="662" /> Fáil can make to that is to come into this House and to ask us to reverse their policy&mdash;not our policy but their policy&mdash;and to reduce prices immediately still further.  I believe that this Government will bring the cost of living down to a level somewhat similar to that at which it was before Fianna Fáil assumed office under false pretences in 1951.  Fianna Fáil, at that time, were a minority Government. They had not the support of the people.  They were here by virtue of the votes of Deputies who were not elected to uphold Fianna Fáil&mdash;and, when the opportunity came, the people of Ireland gave their verdict in no uncertain way on the actions of those particular Deputies.</P>
    <P>Some of us will recall, too, that in the 1951 election certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party pledged themselves openly and in writing to the continuation of the policy of reduction of the price of essential foodstuffs by way of subsidy.  No sooner did they achieve office than they went back on that promise.  Reading the newspapers to-day and reading the comments of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, I think it must be admitted that he summed up the situation fairly accurately.  What we have witnessed on the part of the former Tánaiste, the present Deputy-Leader of the Opposition, is no more than an outburst of anger at the loss of office. Let nobody allow himself to be misled: the people of Ireland will recognise it for what it is, an outburst of anger.</P>
    <P>The people of this country await the progress of stable Government and the improvement of their lot, and I have no doubt that this Government will bring about that improvement.  God knows, the people deserve it after having endured three purgatorial years of Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>For cool, cynical, reaction to the public confidence it would be difficult to beat Deputy Dunne's contribution and, in fact, that of the other Labour Deputies who have spoken here to-day.  It is notable that Fine Gael refuse to defend this Finance Bill and leave the job to the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> What Deputy Dunne has not told the House, however, is that the provisions of the 1952 Budget, with all the hardships which it imposed on the Irish people, are still in force&mdash;and they told us here in 1953, speaker after speaker, that we had re-enacted the 1952 Budget.  Anybody who looks up the speeches made in 1952 will find as colourful and, I might say, sulphurous a collection of adjectives describing that Budget as one would get anywhere in the world.  &ldquo;Savage,&rdquo; I think, was the one most frequently used.  That savage Budget which imposed savagery with a cool, calculating hand is still in operation and was re-enacted, according to themselves, in 1953 and has now been adopted by Deputy Sweetman, the present Minister for Finance.  Deputy Dunne recants everything he said in 1952 and 1953 and defends the same proposals here to-night.  Is it not within the public memory, short and all as it is, that there was a public meeting called outside the General Post Office in O'Connell Street, that people were injured and motor cars damaged in a violent Labour Party protest against the 1952 Budget?  That Budget is being adopted and recommended by Deputy Dunne, Deputy Kyne and all the other Coalition speakers who spoke here to-day.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder, therefore, that this Party would, with all the vehemence at its command, show up the hollowness and the hypocrisy of this attitude? Is it any wonder that the name of politician stinks in the nostrils of a great many people of this country?</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that the Deputy cannot take any kind of criticism.  I have here a document issued by Fine Gael which was supported by the Labour Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very fine document, indeed, because it succeeded in getting votes that the Coalition set-up would never have got otherwise.  What I want to stress about it is the footnote to it which says that all these rises in prices were due to the deliberate action of the Fianna Fáil Government. It is quite obvious that that document was meant to convey and did, in fact, convey to the hard-pressed housewives that the deliberate action which brought about these prices would be reversed and that a Supplementary Budget would be introduced and that the 1951 scale of prices would be back within a month of the Coalition taking over.  That was the understanding, although the words were not so palpably obvious as the picture on the document says.  There was no doubt whatsoever in the mind of the average <Col N="665" /> voter that this document was meant to convey that this scale of prices would be reintroduced within a short time of the change of Government.</P>
      <P>If that is not so and if the Fine Gael and the other Coalition speakers say that that was not the impression, we have no less an authority than the present Minister for Finance for the truth of the statement that that was, in fact, the public expectation.  The Minister for Finance told us here that in the first two months of the financial year revenue dropped by over £1,000,000.  Everybody knows how that drop was brought about.  It was brought about by the anticipation of people in business of an immediate reduction in the taxes and in the things which were spoken of from every platform in the country and by every candidate in the country who advocated the Coalition.  That is the obvious answer to the quibbles now as to the time in which the reductions are to take place.</P>
      <P>We will have a duty in our speech making to the country to retain the speeches which have been made in this House on this Bill and we will ask the people in the various places where we speak as to whether the speeches made in this Dáil were understood by them to be the truth in regard to the promises that were made to them when their votes were being sought.  I have no doubt whatsoever as to what the public reaction to it will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to intervene briefly to make a few comments. It is difficult to understand why the Government are perturbed because we use our right in this House to express our opinion of the shortcomings of the Government at our first opportunity to do so.  Some Deputies tried to suggest that we are opposing the Financial Resolution brought in by ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind Deputy Dunne, who admitted he was not present in the House when the debate began, that the motion which we are discussing is that: &ldquo;The Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill because it fails to give effect to pledges made by Ministers before their elevation to office to bring about the immediate reduction of taxation which they had asserted to be practicable.&rdquo;  That is the motion which we have a perfect right to put before this House and which the country expects us to put before this House in order to expose the shortcomings of the Government and their betrayal in the first instance of not merely a promise or promises but a blitz of promises which enabled them to secure that small margin of support which secured for them sufficient votes to form a Government.  As one of the previous speakers here has said, 13 per cent. extra votes is all <Col N="667" /> that has to be swayed one way or another to upset that which is claimed to be a very decisive result in the election.  On this occasion some of us ask ourselves, do the people expect reductions in prices or do they not.  The Deputies opposite seem eager to deny that they made promises of any kind. Did they make promises or did they not?  Those of us who had to fight the election and went around the country&mdash;do they think that we are unaware of the actual blitz of promises that was launched on the electorate on this occasion not merely from platforms or by advertisements?</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass yesterday was careful to quote not merely one but several advertisements and to quote from several speeches made in order to put the facts before the people in this House, to convince you people that you definitely made promises; but the people throughout the country who were awaiting results did not need to have definite facts quoted to them from advertisements or from the Press because they know that your canvassers lifted the knocker on every door and at their own fireside promised them everything, and Heaven, too.  Nothing was too much.  The sky was the limit&mdash;better social services, lower prices, higher wages, lower taxation. Heaven on earth was promised to those who were prepared to swallow it at the first opportunity, and there was no doubt left in the minds of the people as to what those promises meant.  That is the reason why we want to expose the attitude of the Government in their very first opportunity to implement that blitz of promises which they made by which they have hoodwinked a margin of the people to support them on this occasion. It is surprising that so few were fooled.  When one considers the promises made, it is surprising that so few were fooled into supporting the Coalition groups.</P>
    <P>Now what have they got?  We all remember the interruptions across the floor after the ex-Minister for Finance concluded his last Budget speech when some of the Deputies from this side <Col N="668" /> said it would never come into effect&mdash; the electorate would deal with that. Now you are standing over it and you are telling the same people whom you told during the election what you could do and would do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the extent to which subsidies will go and we were assured last night by the previous Minister for Finance in the Coalition Government, Deputy McGilligan, that any further reductions are going to be effected by means of economies; and this is what he said about economies, because he knows perfectly well that the Coalition do not intend doing anything further.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Let no one believe that these economies can be achieved this year or next year.  If it can be done at the end of our period of office we will have done good work.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are the promises now.  That is what they amounted to.  Deputy Dunne was not in the House to hear that, but that is the extent of the promises made by the various groups.  That is what they amount to when boiled down.  But we had to listen in every constituency to this absolutely impossible programme that was preached off every platform&mdash;lower taxation, a higher standard of living, lower prices, better social services.  Then naturally we questioned &ldquo;where will the money come out of?&rdquo;  Some of the speakers found the answer to that, too, and they actually said: &ldquo;We are spending <Col N="669" /> £8,000,000 on an army.  One hydrogen bomb would wipe out the entire Army. There is £8,000,000 to be saved right away.&rdquo;  Was that a serious statement or was it not?  No matter whether it was or not it is typical of the depths to which they stooped in order to find something with which to attract that margin of support to enable them to secure the extra support in this House.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, when Deputy Lemass was proving in his usual logical manner how they had already run away from those promises at the first opportunity, the Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;Be prepared for a shock to-morrow.  You will get a shock to-morrow morning.&rdquo; I bought a copy of every section of the Press this morning to see where we are going to have prices brought down to the 1951 level, whether we were going to have the pint reduced; and I waited for the shock, but I have still got no shock except that he was referring to the failure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We know that these promises were made.  We read the advertisements to the people that they inserted and we heard their pledges, and so the question arises; do the public expect reductions in prices or do they not?  Those of us who move around among the people in rural Ireland know what their supporters even expect.  We know what the supporters of the Fine Gael Party even expect.  We know that the travellers for the wholesale spirit <Col N="670" /> premises and distillers have hardly been able to book up an order prior to this debate because the people amongst whom they moved expected a reduction in spirits and beer.  You have only to discuss the matter with them to prove that the public were actually waiting on a complete reversal of the Budget which you are now putting before the House with your approval.</P>
      <P>We think that we have not merely the right but the duty to expose the shortcomings of the Government in failing to give effect to the speeches they made and with which they captured the support of the people on this occasion.  As I said here a few days ago, that may be all right&mdash;for the Deputies merely to say: &ldquo;We fooled them.  We are here now for five years and we do not give a hoot what those people think.  We succeeded in getting here.  We will have five years out of it and then Fianna Fáil can take over if they wish&rdquo;.  That is all very fine, but it is more serious than that.  Those people who think that we should remain silent instead of exposing these things fail to realise that we have not merely a right but a duty here.  We shall exercise that right and shall perform that duty on every occasion to expose until the day this Dáil is dissolved, their failure to implement the programme with which they purchased that small margin of votes which enabled them to sit on those benches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The question we are discussing mainly to-night is one which is agitating the minds and thoughts and study of the people of the world&mdash; the cost of living; and how to bring that cost within the level of what the people are prepared to pay is seemingly an insoluble problem. Philosophers, learned men and politicians put forward their views and their suggestions, but apparently with little result.  Politicians say: &ldquo;We are the solution,&rdquo; but usually the section of politicians who proclaim most loudly that they are the solution are those who are in opposition at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> I do not know if any solution has been put forward and I cannot say that I see one myself, but I know that one school of thought claim very strongly that the solution is greater production. I know, however, that very often in many parts of the world over-production has led to greater disasters than the opposite, and therefore I have come to the conclusion that, while greater production must naturally provide a greater range of goods for the people's needs, it, in itself, can also be very disastrous.  What, then, about the other alternative, lower production and a greater scarcity of these commodities?  This must inevitably result in higher prices and increased cost of living.</P>
    <P>Where does the solution lie between these two schools of thought?  I am afraid that somewhere in between there must be some hidden hand which somehow and in some way determines what is the cost of living and what is the value of goods.  Could it be this mysterious thing to which we often hear reference made, but which we are told is a dangerous subject to discuss &mdash;almost as dangerous as a discussion of the tenets of our religion&mdash;finance?</P>
    <P>Is it world finance, the hidden control that controls every effort of the human mind and drives people and nations into internal squabbles, discontent and economic disaster?  I do not know, but there seemingly is, somewhere in the life of nations, an influence which is beyond the control of the mind of the average person and it is not worth while seeking a remedy in that direction.  It is an important question, but we are told to hush, to be quiet, when we seek to speak of it. It is apparently some deep mysterious subject which can be discussed only by the higher minds and more sensitive brains the world knows.  I have been told that the number of these is very small and meanwhile our problem remains unsolved.</P>
    <P>If our policy, as seems to be the policy of Governments to-day, is to increase our production and sell a little cheaper than the other fellow can sell in the world markets, so that we sell more goods and acquire greater <Col N="672" /> revenue from outside sources, how far does the Budget we are discussing contain the requirements for development along these lines?  Is there embodied in the Budget such plans as will enable the Government to raise, by scientific or other methods, our rate of production per unit and reduce the cost of that production, and if so, what range of products does the Government aim at developing on these lines?  Personally I think the greatest possibility is offered by a development of the land of the country and by maintaining more people on the land than we have maintained in the past.</P>
    <P>I welcome this motion because it will have the effect of drawing from the Government some indication as to their general policy and thus provide a steady outlook for the community for the next 12 months.  The present degree of uncertainty, with the promise of a reduced cost of living and so on, does enfeeble the efforts of the average business person in relation to making purchases, because of the fear that the goods he buys to-day may, if a price reduction takes place during the year, leave him in the position in which he will suffer a loss.  A clear statement on that issue is vital.</P>
    <P>This motion also is welcome because it will have the effect, not now but in the future, I hope, of compelling those people who go to the electorate and seek their votes to be more candid and honest in their statement of the facts and of the distance they are prepared to go to improve conditions.  A policy of reckless promises is a devastating policy which can lead only to disillusionment and, in the long run and over a period of time, to the people placing no trust in the promises of public representatives.  That could be a very destructive result and it should be carefully guarded against.  At present, we have any amount of that&mdash;people can get on to platforms, make reckless promises and seek to persuade the voters by lies and other means to vote for them and lead the community into supporting any &ldquo;ism&rdquo; they wish.  It is the duty of the Government to make a clear statement as to the lines on which they propose to proceed for the <Col N="673" /> next two years or three years with a view to making conditions easier for the people.</P>
    <P>How is this cost of living to be reduced?  We know well that it is easy to reduce the cost of commodities by the use of subsidies, but surely no sensible Government will advocate a course of borrowing to reduce prices for the time being, with the dire results that usually follow for the borrower. I suggest that the policy of the Government should be a policy of spending money on education and on the training, even in the primary schools, of the youth of the country into a knowledge of national economics. Let them understand them and let them know the fallacy of the idea which has prevailed and which has been advocated and promoted here, that somehow Governments can work miracles and that money can be made in some mysterious way by the Government in office.  I am afraid that notion has been promoted for political purposes.  Let us educate our people to understand that no more can be taken out of the pool than is put into it, and, in the long run, we will get our people to understand and to co-operate in the provision of the reasonable requirements of the people.</P>
    <P>At the moment, there is no plan other than increased production, except the plan of getting the people to accept a lower standard of living, to take less out of the pool so that the pool will require less to replenish it. Which of these courses is to be adopted?  The people of the country are entitled to know from the Government what line of policy they propose to pursue.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a reduction in the cost of living is it to be achieved by tightening our belts, living on less and spending less and thus reducing business; or are we going to achieve it by increased production and, if so, by what methods?  Give us this information and we will be in a better position to face the realities.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, another means but I am afraid that is not generally accepted.  Christianity has taught a means by which we can achieve our <Col N="674" /> objectives, by goodwill, fellowship and charity&mdash;these principles to provide a means of securing equitable distribution.  The adoption of a spirit of goodwill and forbearance has been taught for 2,000 years but all that time we have had wars.  Nations have refused to accept these principles and I see no indication at present that we are more likely to adopt them than humanity has been for the last 2,000 years.</P>
    <P>It is up to this Government to tell us what their plans are and how they are going to solve the problems which face us.  Does this Budget contain anything in the way of a new departure? Responsibility rests with those who sit in the front bench of the Government. It is not by remaining silent or by smart answers across the floor of this House that our problems can be solved.  There is no way other than by earnest thought and honest action, by taking the people into their confidence and telling them what they intend to do.</P>
    <P>I must speak as one who represents an area that has not alone missed the opportunity of development but has suffered destruction as well.  I come from the West of Ireland, where the congests were many some years ago but are now few, not because of Government action to remedy their position, to encourage youth to marry and children to grow up around their own homes, but because the youth are being forced to leave the country due to the fact that there is nothing to entice them or justify them in marrying and rearing their families as their fathers did before them.  Is that the policy that is to be pursued?  Is the problem to be solved by the elimination of large numbers of the population in the West of Ireland?  I want the Government to show me that they are handling this matter in a sincere way and that they intend to remedy the grievances that exist and stop this national suicide.  I will vote for no Budget until it embodies a Christian attitude towards a community that has suffered severely under the economic policy adopted here.</P>
    <P>The needs of the people in the West <Col N="675" /> of Ireland were few.  They lived in a meagre way and never acquired expensive habits.  They depended a great deal on home industries and one of the primary industries was the hen roosts.  The small profit they acquired from eggs and poultry provided them with the ready money to buy their weekly needs.  We all know the value of eggs to-day.  They have dropped to an uneconomic price and I want to know what steps the Government intend to take to have that industry reestablished.</P>
    <P>As regards cattle, the price which small farmers in the West are able to obtain is more of a deterrent than an advantage.  The number of cattle would not amount to more than three or four per year and the margin of profit would, therefore, be very small. The price of pigs is also uncertain again and cannot be depended upon to provide an adequate return.</P>
    <P>There is no use talking about finance and about national needs while we are watching the decay of our people. Tariffs have been applied protecting industries in the big centres and this has meant an increased cost of living to those who are not benefiting in any way by employment.  The people who are engaging in small home industries, such as poultry keeping and pig production, have had to sell at world prices in order to protect industrialists who have been favoured in every way by Government assistance as well as protection.  The result has been the annihilation of the real Irish in this country, the wastage of their farms and homes, small church attendances and schools closing steadily.</P>
    <P>What do the present Government intend to do about this situation?  If they intend to change their policy we want to know in a general way what that change will be.  If they are going to sit back and allow this destruction of which I have spoken to continue, they should not be in office.</P>

      <P>The speech we have just heard is the most damning indictment that could be made of the Fianna Fáil Party which has been in power in Ireland for 19 out of the last 22 years. <Col N="676" /> I shall at a later stage comment on one other matter that the Deputy mentioned. Before doing that, may I go back somewhat to the beginning of this debate.  It has been noticeable that in the debate on the amendment &mdash;there was no debate on the Bill&mdash; this week, as last week, we have found the Fianna Fáil Party speaking with two voices.  I suggest it would be easier for the country to understand them, as well as easier for the members of this House, if they kept to one line of argument.  Deputy Lemass, first of all, when moving his amendment yesterday rated me soundly because last week I had been too specific.  Deputy Aiken came along to-day and rated me soundly because I had not been specific enough.  Deputy Lemass yesterday made it clear that, so far as he was concerned, he believed the promises that had been made were false promises.  Yet, he would have us try to put these promises into effect.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera said last Tuesday that so far as he was concerned he would not make any such effort.  He was quite clear and quite specific on that matter at column 146 of the Official Report, should anybody wish to check the reference.</P>
      <P>The plain facts of the matter is that the Deputies on the Opposition Benches do not yet know what hit them when they went to the country. What did hit them was something very simple.  It was not anything that was said by the Deputies who now comprise the Government Parties; it was the fact that the people remembered what Fianna Fáil themselves had said in 1951 and the shameless way in which they subsequently broke the promises they had given to the people at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in an effort to throw a smokescreen over that decision of the people, we have this amendment.  Of course, this amendment is primarily based on the contention that it should have been possible for this new Government to introduce new financial proposals in the very short time that has elapsed since its formation on the 2nd June last.  I do not think that those of us who know Deputy Lemass, and know the case that he is capable of making, <Col N="677" /> can have any doubt whatever, from listening to him yesterday, that Deputy Lemass, of all people, knows quite clearly that the case he was making was entirely without justification and entirely without foundation. The Deputy was long enough in Government to know and realise, and understand and appreciate that it would have been utterly impossible for the newly elected Government of 2nd June last to reframe the budgetary proposals and come in here with new Financial Resolutions in the short interval that has elapsed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also knows, no one better, that unless such proposals are brought in at an early stage in the financial year, they will not have in my own words&mdash;I believe the Deputy quoted them yesterday&mdash;really operative effect and will not be worthwhile. It is, of course, common knowledge that any Budget introduced by any Minister for Finance must be built up over a certain period of time.  It is common knowledge that a Minister for Finance does not produce a Budget in a matter of weeks, He certainly does not produce it in a matter of a couple of weeks, which is all the time that we have had at our disposal.</P>
    <P>I have got quite clear evidence of that fact here should anybody wish to challenge me on it.  I have got quite clear evidence of the manner in which my predecessor very properly over many months considered the line he should take in his Budget statement when examining the different aspects of it and it is cynical, to say the least of it, that there should be any suggestion now that what was always done even by the Fianna Fáil Administration in relation to taking adequate time to prepare financial proposals should not be done now because Fianna Fáil are over there and we are here.</P>
    <P>The position is that it was quite impossible to do any such thing and the Deputies over there know that. They turn then from that in an effort to get out of their responsibilities for that situation.  I cannot stress sufficiently the fact that the responsibility is theirs, and theirs alone.  We made it quite clear, those of us who now sit on this side of the House and who were in the last Dáil, to the <Col N="678" /> last Fianna Fáil Administration that the one main reason why it was necessary to have an early election was to enable the new Administration to have sufficent time and opportunity to put its own proposals before this House when the new Dáil met.  That was clearly set out in the motion of Deputy Costello on 11th March last; it was clearly set out in the arguments that were then put to the House and negatived by Fianna Fáil in the Division Lobby when they refused to give the new Administration that chance and that opportunity.</P>
    <P>Now, having themselves, and only themselves taken that responsibility, they are endeavouring to set up this smokescreen in order to shift the blame from where it really belongs, namely, on their own shoulders. Deputy Aiken, when speaking here to-day, said he wanted a clear statement of our financial policy.  Even taking the expression of opinion that was put upon the statement I made by Deputy Lemass, I thought that what I said last week was clear enough. A few minutes ago Deputy Maguire asked a question more or less on the same lines.</P>
    <P>I thought last week I was as specific as I could possibly be.  So far as we are concerned we want the people to know exactly what the position is and exactly what the position will be during the current financial year because of the inheritance to which I have already referred.  I made it quite clear last week, and I make it quite clear again now in reply to Deputy Aiken, that so far as this Government is concerned we believe it is proper that current expenditure should be met from current income. It was for that reason that I made it clear last week that the additional subvention that has been given towards the cost of living will be met out of the economies which we propose and which would not have been proposed by our predecessors.</P>
    <P>As part of the criticism that has been made we are told by this amendment that we should have specified the particular proposals.  What happened on 21st April last when my predecessor introduced these proposals?  May I digress here to say that, no matter <Col N="679" /> how we may differ in politics or outlook, I sincerely hope my predecessor will be soon restored to health and back again in this House so that we may have an opportunity of discussing his proposals and my proposals across the floor of this House.</P>
    <P>My predecessor in his Budget statement indicated that he was proposing to make an economy of £4,000,000.  Did he give any indication of where that economy would be made on the 21st April last?  He did not.  Did he give anything other than a general direction as to where these economies would be made in the subsequent six-week period during which he remained in office?  He did not.  Is it reasonable, therefore, that when he did not do that having had months in which to prepare and to consider the matter, to suggest that we in this Government after a couple of weeks in office should give a specific indication?  The fact is we have already instituted searching inquiries into certain aspects&mdash;indeed, into all aspects&mdash;of Government expenditure with a view to ensuring that appropriate expenditure will be met in the appropriate way.</P>
    <P>We were told by Deputy Lemass yesterday when he was introducing this amendment that in order to carry out the economies that had been mentioned, economies to the extent of the concessions which we have announced, there would have to be an appalling cut in and an appalling hardship inflicted on the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, of course, knew quite well that, when he was talking yesterday and saying that 95 per cent. of all expenditure went on salaries, he was speaking with his tongue in his cheek.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the social welfare service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Even with that proviso which was not made yesterday, the Deputy still knows that he is speaking with his tongue in his cheek.  Suppose, for example, the Deputy was right, why did he not put that same point of view to his colleague, my predecessor?  My predecessor, in his Budget statement on the 21st April last, indicated that he was going to <Col N="680" /> find savings of some £4,000,000 in this way.  Of course, we know quite well that this is another of the inconsisten cies which we have seen from the Fianna Fáil Party.  We will see more of them from now on from that side of the House.</P>
      <P>It was interesting, too, to hear Deputy Lemass, as the spokesman of his Party, coming out as the defender of the Civil Service.  The Fianna Fáil Party had, in the last Government, a Parliamentary Secretary who came out on this subject with such views as Deputy Kennedy came out with at Collinstown on the 19th April, 1953. Deputy Kennedy told us at that time that there was a 20 per cent. redundancy in the Civil Service.  Apparently that was then part of the line and of the argument that he wished, and that the Party wished to put out as regards the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to hear that Party now come out as the defender of the Civil Service in view of the fact that they have left us the burden of honouring the commitment in regard to the arbitration award to which they gave their accord when they were the Government, and which, as I indicated last week, will be honoured by this Government.  Of course, we know quite well that the speech which was made by Deputy Kennedy when he was dealing with the 20 per cent. redundancy was merely one of those speeches which is made down the country for the purpose of getting a particular type of vote there, but that a different speech altogether would be made by the Deputy when speaking in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told, too, by speakers on this amendment that we only had to&mdash; shall we say?&mdash;shell out the £10,000,000 extra that was put there by the additional taxation that had been imposed in 1952.  I only wish that the £10,000,000 that was there in 1952 was there now, because if it was there now, as it was then, it would be a very simple operation for anybody sitting in this seat.  The fact, of course, is that if you compare the estimated current expenditure for this year with the actual revenue intake for 1952-53, you find that there is a difference of <Col N="681" /> £9.7 million, which is miraculously near the £10,000,000 about which we were talking two years ago, on the Budget at that time.  It is unfortunate that expenditure has risen to the extent it has since that day and has, as I say, swallowed up the gap that was there then and about which we were speaking at that time.</P>
    <P>It is significant also that, in criticising the proposals that were made by this Government in introducing the financial proposals of our predecessors, not one of the Deputies on the other side made reference to what they did in 1951.  They came in here in 1951 and adopted the Budget of their predecessors; they adopted the Financial Resolutions of their predecessors; they adopted the Finance Bill of their predecessors and, in addition, they, too, made a couple of slight variations. The variations that they brought in were brought in in exactly the same way as we have introduced the variation to which I referred last week.</P>
    <P>No doubt, Deputy Lemass remembers that the Minister for Agriculture of that day brought in at once a Supplementary Estimate for £400,000, and that the Deputy himself, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, brought in a similar Supplementary Estimate on food subsidies, of which £250,000 was specifically referable to the change in policy.  There is an exact analogy between what they did then and what we are doing now and, merely because they are on that side of the House, they bring in this motion for the purpose of throwing a smoke screen around the fact that the election is over, and that they were beaten and soundly beaten in that election.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot, too, during this debate about the cost of living, and, again, we find the Fianna Fáil Party speaking with two voices.  During the election campaign they were at the very greatest pains to make it clear&mdash; Deputy de Valera, Deputy Lemass and right down along the line&mdash; that the Fine Gael Party were promising nothing&mdash;that there were no promises being made.  Time and time again they said that.  Now they come into this House on this motion and suggest that we were promising all round.  The <Col N="682" /><i>Sunday Press</i> of the 2nd May has this banner headline: &ldquo;Mr. Costello has been saying that he is making no promises, declared An Taoiseach at Tuam last night.  He speaks wisely.&rdquo; Deputy Traynor, who was then Minister for Defence, speaking at Parnell Square on 1st May said that: &ldquo;A Fine Gael election leaflet compared the prices of goods in 1951 with the prices of the same goods to-day....  There was not a word in the leaflet to suggest that these prices would be reduced.&rdquo;  To-day they are telling us that in that leaflet we were promising the sun, moon and stars.  Deputy Lemass himself at Banagher on 4th May said that &ldquo;Not one Fine Gael leader has committed himself to subsidise prices.  That fact has at last been made clear.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very clear now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy was saying yesterday that we had promised to subsidise prices.  We come along finally to no less a person than the editor of the <i>Irish Press</i> speaking, not during the turmoil of a meeting during an election campaign when perhaps there may be rival meetings going on, but speaking quietly from his editorial chair on the 6th May, when he says: &ldquo;Mr. Costello stresses in every speech that he will promise nothing.&rdquo;  But the whole basis of this amendment is that promises were made at every corner, and that the Deputy wants those promises put into immediate operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said a moment ago, so far as the cost of living is concerned we made it quite clear that we were going to shape our policy along lines similar to the lines that had been adopted by the inter-Party Government between 1948 and 1951.  We made it quite clear in the election, both in the hustings and in the canvass, that we were going to remind the Fianna Fáil Party on every possible occasion of the line they had taken in the 1951 campaign and of the manner in which they had duped the people on that occasion and of the manner in which they had gone back on the election promises they made.  I think I am speaking not only of my own experience and the experience of my Party, but of the experience of all <Col N="683" /> Parties on this side of the House when I say that the real feeling of the people was their resentment not merely in the general election but in the by-elections, that they had been fooled by Fianna Fáil in 1951 by those undertakings so solemnly given on that occasion.</P>
    <P>We heard from Deputy Childers to-day their explanation of why they had had to go back on those promises.  We heard from him that it was solely a world consideration and that it was only a world trend.  Of course, the facts are that it was the spring of 1951 which showed the peak of world prices and that is clearly shown from this&mdash; that when you take the record, the index of import prices produced by the statistics office, a couple of months from that peak you will find that it was within two or three months after the last Government got into office in September, 1951, that there was the highest peak of import prices and after that date the curve had tended downwards&mdash;the import prices, the prices of things that had to be brought in from outside were all the time falling gradually and that it was the converse in regard to our own cost of living here at home.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Childers was speaking I thought of the current issue of <i>The Economist.</i>  It so happens that in the current issue, dated June 19th, we have a table available to us of the prices&mdash; the cost of living shall we say&mdash;in various European countries.  We have in that issue the cost of living for 1952 and 1953.  Unfortunately this particular issue that I have in front of me does not go back to 1951 because I venture to say if it did go back to that the comparison would be even more striking.  The countries that are given here are set out in alphabetical order and it so happens in that alphabetical order Ireland is seventh.  And what is the position?  In Austria between 1952 and 1953 the cost of living has gone down one point; in Belgium it has remained static; in Denmark it has remained static; in France it has gone down one point; in Germany it has gone down two points; in Greece it has gone up and in Ireland it has gone <Col N="684" /> up seven points.  So that out of the first seven picked out alphabetically, in five it has not gone up, in Ireland it has gone up; and in Greece alone of the other seven countries it has also gone up.  I think that somewhat demolishes the argument we had here from Deputy Childers at some length to-day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig spoke last night and referred to the fact that we were not taking sufficient account of depreciation in our capital schemes.  He knows, I am sure, and the House knows, of course, that there is included in the Finance Bill in Section 28 a specific provision that was brought in for the first time by Deputy McGilligan in the period in which he was Minister for Finance in the previous inter-Party Government by which the cost of these capital schemes is amortised by annuity over a period of 30 years and, indeed, far from that being too liberal a method of finance I have heard people say that in making the provision that these capital services should be paid back over a period of 30 years we are being far too strict and conservative rather than the reverse.</P>
    <P>Again, on that small point that Deputy Derrig raised, we hear the two voices speaking for Fianna Fáil, because Deputies of this House will all remember that my predecessor based part of his Budget on the fact that there had been too large an account taken in for depreciation by C.I.E. in their accounts and that my predecessor considered that it was wrong that as much depreciation should be taken in as had been taken in, in earlier years. The basis of my predecessor's Budget, in which he provided for repayment by C.I.E., was the repayment of moneys for which credit had been taken for current depreciation when my predecessor considered that that depreciation should not have been charged to current income but should be charged to capital&mdash;exactly the reverse of what Deputy Derrig said last night.</P>
    <P>While my predecessor took that line for 1952-53 and 1953-54, the members who were in the House on the last occasion will remember when we were discussing the out-turn of the Budget for 1951-52 and when we were on the <Col N="685" /> opposite side of the House, we alleged that there had been deliberate loading of the out-turn of that financial year by my predecessor.  One of the things by which it was then suggested that there had been such loading was the charge for depreciation and for renewals put in for C.I.E.  If what my predecessor did in regard to the years 1952-53 and 1953-54 is correct, it would have been equally correct to do it for 1951-52, because exactly the same principle is involved, and it is quite clear in that alone that the charge that was then made by us that the Minister was deliberately loading the out-turn of that Budget for the purpose of discrediting Deputy McGilligan has been clearly proved now that we are on this side of the curtain to see the facts and figures.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember also that there was a by-election in Cork City in March last.  I have here one of the posters that were put out, put out, of course, not merely by a local organisation but by Fianna Fáil headquarters itself.</P>
    <P>It was suggested in this poster dealing with the National Development Fund that £5,000,000 a year for five years had already been provided for such development.  That is one of the reasons people were urged to vote No. 1 for Fitzgerald.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe last night made exactly the same suggestion, that the money had already been provided.  I only wish that the money were in fact there&mdash;£5,000,000 a year for five years. Again, it would make the task much easier for whoever might be sitting in this seat.  All that happened was that the Government of the day indicated that there was power in the Act to do that.  There was no question of the money being left available for it to be done, as there was when £22,500,000 was left in the Loan Counterpart Fund when my predecessor took up office from Deputy McGilligan in June, 1951.  We are not in the same happy position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe last night also tried to suggest by implication&mdash;I am not certain he did not go even further than implication but I content myself by saying by implication&mdash;that he had an assurance from the previous Government <Col N="686" /> that they were going to provide funds to enable the Dublin Corporation to expand, by approximately three times, the employment content of the schemes for the current year as compared with last year.  I think he mentioned a figure of 1,200 men last night. The employment content for last year was 400 and 1,200 is three times 400. He suggested that the previous Minister had made all the necessary arrangements, that all the necessary machinery was there and that the only danger was that we might stop it.  The unfortunate part of it for him is that I have the record and the record, far from showing that, shows indeed a very different story because on the 21st May last, three days after the election, my predecessor not merely did not increase the provision that was going to be made from the National Development Fund for this Vote, but actually decreased it by £100,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Lemass has forgotten the allocation that his Government made, I shall willingly send him a little note giving him the effect of the decision.  Deputy Derrig <Col N="688" /> last night used the phrase &ldquo;wild cat schemes&rdquo; about the capital programme. Let me be quite clear that that phrase &ldquo;wild cat schemes&rdquo; is Deputy Derrig's, not mine.  I did not coin that phrase in respect to anything that might be there.  I took the precaution, however, at a very early date of ascertaining what some of the proposals were that were pending at the time that we came into Government for the purposes of allocation from this National Development Fund.  I found that some of the proposals that were pending were: a proposal to rebuild one barracks at a cost of £266,000; to rebuild part only of another barracks at a cost of £220,000.  I found there was a proposal still standing&mdash;though proposals had been knocked down&mdash;this proposal was still standing and presumably was being retained for implementation or consideration at a later stage&mdash;to spend no less a sum than £200,000 on this building in which we are, Leinster House.  I found there was another proposal to spend a similar sum of £200,000 for a new headquarters for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Apparently that was not considered sufficient and there was to be another £100,000 provided for new headquarters for the Dublin Metropolitan Division of the Garda Síochána.  I found that in addition there was a proposal pending to spend £1,890,000 on new Garda barracks throughout the country, that there was a further proposal to spend £2,100,000 on building 700 houses at no less than £3,000 per house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For whom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of the Guards&mdash;£3,000 a house for 700 houses notwithstanding that we all know on all sides of the House what is the cost of a house for the ordinary person who wants to build a house, to get married and to start his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went on from that and I found that, apparently, it was believed that the arrangements for the criminal courts in Dublin were not sufficiently satisfactory.  Maybe they are not, but I find it difficult to understand the provision that was put in in respect of them, the provision that was proposed, presumably, by the authority of the <Col N="689" /> then Minister, for a central criminal court, a court of criminal appeal and district courts and a new prison. Perhaps the idea was that there would be people protesting at their other expenditure and they would want therefore to make certain that they had adequate provision for them in such a new Bridewell.  The amount for that set of new criminal courts was no less a sum than £600,000.</P>
    <P>Some of these things that I am mentioning&mdash;and I am not suggesting otherwise&mdash;are no doubt excellent ideas in their own, excellent things, but there is a due and a proper priority in respect of a country such as this and we must in our country cut our cloth according to our measure.</P>
    <P>Then I went on and I found that the predecessor of Deputy General Mulcahy in the Department of Education had submitted there certain further schemes which, again, I say may be excellent, excellent in their conception, but they are not things that will help to produce at this stage more wealth for the country.  I suggest that the figures indicate that they were being planned in a way and in a manner that was and is and will be far beyond our means&mdash;a new national library, for example, at a cost of £1,000,000, a new historical museum in Kilmainham Jail at a cost of £100,000, additional accommodation for the National Gallery in Merrion Street at a cost of £500,000 and a Folk Museum in Kilmainham Hospital at another cost of £500,000.  However desirable those things may be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We will approach this question of national development in a different way.  We will ensure that the resources that there are of men, material and of money are made available for things that will not merely give employment in the interim period while they are being produced, such as these, but will give a sound and a lasting contribution towards increasing production and, in that way, increasing the wealth of our people.  It is on that basis and on increasing the national wealth that we believe we will be able to ensure that we will get into the Exchequer sufficient moneys to be able to carry on the business of Government.</P>
      <P>We had a discussion&mdash;perhaps discussion is the wrong word&mdash;we had a speech last night, several speeches, on the meaning of the words &ldquo;reduced taxation&rdquo; and &ldquo;reduced taxes&rdquo;. Deputy Lemass quoted a statement which I made a week ago.  He did not quote the context in which it was made.  The context was quite clear. It was in the context of the questions put by Deputy de Valera as to what was in our Government policy.  &ldquo;Reducing taxation&rdquo; Deputy de Valera on that occasion was trying to say meant reducing the total volume of tax that was collected.  &ldquo;Reducing taxation&rdquo; so far as the people understand it means that they have to give less to the Government out of every £ of their own money and that the rates of taxes are lower.  That is the way the people understand it and it is towards that aim and that object that we propose to push our policy.</P>

      <P>Earlier this evening, when speaking on this Estimate, I mentioned how important it is that the Minister should review the three means tests which operate in the Housing Act.  If the matter is reviewed by the Minister, I believe that the beneficial results which the people of rural Ireland desire, will follow.  It is vitally important for us to realise that those people who are anxious to improve their homes by way of reconstruction should get the best possible co-operation from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention the problem of housing sites.  Coming, as he does, from a rural area, the Minister will realise that it is no pleasure for members of local authorities to know that, after they have informed the Department that sites have been selected, they must wait a long period before the sanction is given.  We are all aware of these delays.  I quite appreciate that it is necessary to make a thorough investigation as regards the suitability of sites, and so forth, but I fail to understand why it should take&mdash;as it has taken in the past&mdash;two years for a Minister for Local Government to decide to reject a site or to sanction it.  Substantial fees are paid by local authorities to qualified architects who, naturally, know their job and when a local authority gets the opinion of these men in the matter of the selection of housing sites I fail to see why it should be necessary to have to wait two years for sanction by the Department&mdash;having, in the meantime, by way of contact with the Department and Parliamentary questions <Col N="698" /> been endeavouring to obtain an earlier decision.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will tackle this problem, I believe it will bring about an early improvement in the living conditions of people who, at the present time, are condemned to live in hovels and very unsuitable homes in various parts of the country and who must continue to live there simply and solely because we cannot get speedier decisions from the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of roads.  Deputy McGrath spoke on this particular matter, as well as other Deputies.  I agree that it is very important to provide decent roads but, at this stage, I do not intend to comment on the amount of money a certain road may have cost and which had a direct bearing on a question asked in this House this week.  I shall not comment on that matter now because I am convinced that the surveyors who were responsible to the manager and, perhaps indirectly, to the members of the local authority will be well able to account to us for the money they spent.  Until this matter is put before us in our own local council, I do not intend to comment on it either here or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In my view, the proper approach to the improvement of the roads of this country was that of the late Deputy T.J. Murphy, when he was Minister for Local Government in 1948.  He considered that the time had come when the Government and the local authorities should realise the importance of providing more money for county roads.  In Cork, we have between 6,000 and 7,000 miles of county roads and it is well to know that the main roads are being put into good condition.</P>
    <P>In areas where the roads have been left in a bad condition for some years, as much money as can be available through Government grants to the local authorities should be given for their improvement.  In that connection, I might say that if a little more freedom were given to the local authorities and the responsible engineers as to where that money should be spent in these <Col N="699" /> rural areas, I believe it would be much more advantageous in the long run. If we could give that freedom as regards the improvement of certain roads then I think we should get quicker results.  The Minister may tell us that it is after consultation with the local authorities and their engineers, and after the submission of their plans and the numbers of the roads on which they want improvements carried out, that the money is allocated.  I am convinced that the surveyors, the engineers, the local authorities and the county managers, where they are good &mdash;and we have a good county manager in Cork&mdash;are not getting enough freedom of action as regards the spending of this grant money.  We are satisfied that, in all the years back, they have been doing their best as regards the way they spend the money which is allocated through the amount coming in from the roads.  If the responsible officials are able to utilise the money coming in through the roads, I believe there should be greater trust in and co-operation with them as regards Government grants.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy McQuillan who mentioned here to-night the importance of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  In spite of the fact that opposition was offered by the Fianna Fáil Party to the introduction and passage of that very important Act, it gave better results than many Acts which passed through this Oireachtas in the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>If the Minister finds it possible, even <Col N="700" /> within the next 12 months, to get back to the stage of making full use of that Act in the way of grants then, in my view, greater advantages will accrue to the various county councils and the various local authorities.  Whatever may be said as regards the labour content on roads, the amount of money given under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and the ratio of the labour content as regards the money expended means, in addition to advantages in the rural areas, greater employment and a greater return in wages to the men concerned.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, we must admit that even in 1954, as in all the years back, the one hope of providing employment in many of the various counties of this country is through work under the local authorities.  If, therefore, there can be greater co-operation as regards the Local Authorities (Works) Act between the Department of Finance and the local authorities I believe that Act will yield the beneficial results which it was yielding before the amounts of money allocated under it were drastically reduced in the past few years.</P>
    <P>From time to time, many of us who serve on local authorities become aware of the terrible system of red tape which operates in the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 25th June, 1954.</P>
