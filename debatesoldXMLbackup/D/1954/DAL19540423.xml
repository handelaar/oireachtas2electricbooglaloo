      <P>Last night I adverted to the position of the Leader of the Opposition as I saw it, and as it appeared during the course of the speech which he made on the Budget. I was contrasting the difficulty of his position with the position of some of his predecessors in the same benches in former times, and I could imagine how vigorously he, on the same lines as his predecessors, would have approached this Budget if it were not for the fact that Fine Gael had completely changed its dress in bringing the Coalition into being and that he now finds himself hampered not merely by <Col N="818" /> that but also by the fact that an election is on and he has to be careful that he will not in his criticism of the Budget appear to be advocating a reduction of social services or using any of the arguments which I know in the past would have been used by Fine Gael when they wanted to suggest that the Budget was demanding too much from the people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello showed a disposition to attack on the same lines as were followed by Fine Gael in the past, but he quickly retreated.  In the old days every item that was down to be met by borrowing would have been questioned by the Opposition.  We would have had long extracts quoted here from the Banking Commission Report; the reduction of our external assets would have been pointed out, and we would have had passages from the reports of the Central Bank declaimed here in thundering tones. We have none of these things now for the reason that I have indicated. Whenever the Leader of the Opposition was advancing on these lines he saw the point which he would inevitably reach and quickly changed his course and reverted, naturally, to the old theme which has been the subject of debate here since 1952, the theme that we were unnecessarily overtaxing the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said in 1952 that we were looking to the people for £10,000,000 more than was necessary to meet expenditure. Of course that statement was absurd and proved to be absurd at the time.  It did not need proof of any kind, because it was unthinkable that an ordinary democratic Government having to face the people would make itself unnecessarily unpopular by imposing taxation that was not required. We have many times pointed out that such a course would be unthinkable, and that argument has never been answered.  Why should any reasonable Government set out to extract £10,000,000 from the pockets of the people unnecessarily?  The whole thing was ridiculous.  The figures on which Deputy Costello tried to support his statement were proved to be absurd at the time, and the final proof came when the transactions of the year <Col N="819" /> 1952-53 were closed and the accounts made up and it was shown that, instead of having £10,000,000 more than was required, having a surplus of £10,000,000, we had instead a deficit of £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>My view at the beginning of the year proved correct.  I knew from long experience that, as the year progresses, the Minister for Finance is met with demands from every Department leading to increased expenditure and that it requires a man of tremendous tenacity, supported by the head of the Government, if the head of the Government understands his position properly, to see that the original provisions are so far as practicable adhered to and that expenditure does not get out of bounds.  I know how hard it is to do that.  I know how hard it is to keep down expenditure, as I have often stated.  Man's desires are unlimited.  The desires of every Department, of every Minister who sees an opportunity for doing good and who is interested in doing that good but who is at the moment not quite conscious of the difficulty of providing the required financial means, are unlimited.  But the means to meet our desires are very definitely limited, and we have to relate our desires to the means we have of satisfying them.</P>
    <P>Now I knew that, and I stated that, from my experience, the likelihood was, not that we would have a £10,000,000 surplus, but that we would possibly have a deficit, and so it turned out.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition talks of the £4,000,000 which the Minister is allowing for overestimation and for economies.  I said last year, when he made a similar allowance of £3,500,000, and I said in 1952 that experience had proved up to that time that unavoidable Supplementary Estimates come in and that they eat up any economies or any savings that there are.  Last year a great effort was made to restrict Supplementary Estimates, but unfortunately unforeseeable things do happen, and it did happen last year that, in spite of our efforts, certain supplementaries had to be introduced.  But nevertheless we have in 1953-54 reduced the deficit.  Again, <Col N="820" /> I want to point out that we have not overtaxed, that in fact last year we did not provide fully to the extent of £702,000 for our current expenditure. It would therefore be a reasonable charge against us that we did not balance our Budget, and it is not a reasonable charge, it is quite an absurd charge, to go in the opposite direction and say that we are overtaxing to meet our current expenditure.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister I think is optimistic in the matter.  He hopes to secure £4,000,000 through the usual economies and the usual savings from overestimation&mdash;not being able to spend the full amount which it is contemplated in the beginning is necessary to meet expenses&mdash;and he is possibly over-optimistic in thinking that we will secure that sum.  It can only be secured, as I said last year, if we turn a stern face against supplementaries and, as far as I am concerned, as head of the Government, I will support the Minister for Finance in resisting to the utmost any demands for supplementaries during the year. I think it sets at nought the whole budgeting system, the whole intention of the Constitution in requiring annual budgets to be prepared, if Supplementary Estimates are introduced to the extent that they had to be introduced in order to meet the demands that were entered into by our predecessors and that were not provided for in the 1951 Budget.  However, the Minister and his advisers think that the saving can be effected, and it is on that basis that we are balancing the Budget.</P>
    <P>Another point has been raised about the additional £1,000,000 which the Minister hopes to get by adjustments concerning C.I.E.  The Minister for Finance has explained how that figure of £1,000,000 has been arrived at&mdash;the improved conditions and also the repayment which is possible.  The adjustment is made possible by the improved financial position of C.I.E. and the fact that it is felt that certain renewals and replacements were proper to be treated as capital expenditure and not as operating charges.  These two together enable the Minister on the one hand to reduce the estimate for this year by £1,000,000 as well as to allow, as he <Col N="821" /> has done, £500,000 for repayment in the estimate for non-tax revenue.  It would not be legitimate to impose taxation for these purposes when it is not necessary to do so, and, so far from proceeding along the line that has been suggested all the time by the Leader of the Opposition, we are proceeding on the opposite line, that we do not want to have any unnecessary taxation. We know, and we have said from the time we returned to office in 1951 that the limit of taxation which can be met with production at its present level has practically been reached and every effort should be made by the Government to try to relieve the taxpayer to the utmost extent possible.  That is the reason why the Minister is careful that there should not be any taxation for anything that is not properly regarded as current expenditure.  It is his reason also for endeavouring to the utmost to give any reliefs that are possible, and to give these reliefs to the classes that deserve them most and in the widest way possible; when he found that it was possible for him to make sums available he set out to relieve the sections of the community which seemed to be most hardly pressed, giving certain reliefs in regard to income-tax and also to reduce as far as possible the price of bread.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of subsidies.  Subsidies on an extended scale were introduced here by us when we were the Government in 1947.  They were introduced to meet a very difficult situation.  Nineteen hundred and forty-seven was in many ways a bad year.  The outlook was bad: there had been two successive bad harvests, and the outlook was certainly dark.  Nobody could tell what the international situation was going to develop into, and it was in these circumstances, in the belief that they would not be lasting for a long time, that we brought in the Supplementary Budget and tried to diminish the cost of living at the time and to meet what appeared to be a situation that demanded attention and that would not be lasting.  Now, when we did that we had to find the money to do it.  We reduced, for instance, tea from 4/10 per lb. to 2/8 per lb.  The ordinary price at the time would have been 4/10.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> We had to subsidise the family budget to the extent of bringing tea from 4/10 to 2/8 per lb.  We also brought sugar down from 6d. to 4d. per lb.  We brought bread down by I think it was about ¾d. or so per 2-lb. loaf.  All these reductions were completely abnormal. These subsidies were abnormal.  We have never had them before in this State on such a scale&mdash;to tax the community as a whole to come to the relief of individuals, every individual who drank tea or ate bread, used tea and sugar and bread.  There had been subsidies before, but the general subsidising of the individual by taxing the community on such a scale was something that had not occurred before and did not occur in most countries at any time except during an emergency period of war.  Therefore, we did not think that it was a type of operation which should be continued indefinitely; but the marvellous thing about it was that those who are now altogether in favour of subsidies were the people who attacked them most when they were introduced because they had to be met by taxation.</P>
    <P>Is it going to be suggested that they are to be met by borrowing?  Are we to meet them from taxation or borrowing?  Will the Opposition tell us that?  We therefore did our best to meet the current expenditure involved by current revenue, and the only way in which we were able to get the current revenue at the time, the necessary taxation, was by taxing such commodities as tobacco and beer.  Of course then we had the cry from the other side.  The benefit that was given was ignored.  It was said to be slight. But the reality, we were told, was the taxation which was going to meet the benefits.  Of course the Opposition will always have it both ways.  They will have an craiceann agus a luach, the skin and its price, to use an Irish phrase, always.  They will always want to increase services and then they will at the same time want diminished taxation.  The thing cannot be done. We do not pretend to be magicians who can do that.  If your expenditure goes up, your taxation, the total amount you extract out of the pockets of the people, will have to go up too, <Col N="823" /> and the sooner we make up our minds about that the better.  Every time any benefits are brought in the question ought to be asked, how are these benefits to be paid for, what burden do they impose, are these benefits worth the money?  These are the questions that should be asked here in any assembly like this whenever any question like this arises.  If they are worth the money by all means have them.  If they go to increase production that will enable us to lower rates of taxation, to get higher yields in revenue, by all means take them if they are themselves desirable things; but let us not go and live in a dreamland that we can have increased benefits of various kinds of a current character without meeting them from current revenue.  The money has to be found and there is no gold coffer into which the Government can put its hand in order to find it.  We have tried to face up squarely to the issue, and we faced up to it in 1952 when we found that there was some £15,000,000 of a gap between the amount that could be expected from revenue and the amount that was required in order to meet the current expenditure. We were never told how that £15,000,000 could be met.  We were told: &ldquo;Oh, spend and you will get it in again&rdquo;.  A certain amount undoubtedly does come back when you spend like that, but the revenue that comes back is generally far less than the amount that is spent.</P>
    <P>We, then, did not overtax the people in 1952, and we did not overtax the people in 1953; and I would like to see those who are speaking on the Opposition Benches tell us what are the items in this account, what are the benefits, which, in their opinion, we ought to cut out.  Will they tell us that?  They will talk about unnecessary expenditure, but here is the place during the year, and not out at the cross-roads, to come along and say to the Government: &ldquo;Look here, that expenditure should not be incurred. If you incur that expenditure, it will be necessary to tax the people to pay for it.&rdquo;  We do not hear any talk from the Opposition in these terms.  Whenever <Col N="824" /> any question of that kind comes up here, the usual cry from them is: &ldquo;You are not giving enough.&rdquo;  If it is a question of old age pensions, they will say: &ldquo;You should give them 10/- a week more,&rdquo; or if it is a question of unemployment assistance, they will say: &ldquo;You should give them another few shillings.&rdquo;  Every time any question of social benefit comes up, you will not hear them saying: &ldquo;You are spending too much&rdquo; or &ldquo;it will be necessary to demand too much to meet it in the way of taxation.&rdquo;  The cry all the time is: &ldquo;You are not giving enough.&rdquo;  Then, of course, when the bills have to be met, when the unfortunate Minister for Finance, whoever he may be, has to come in and try to exact through taxation the sum necessary to meet these bills, the cry is different: &ldquo;Why is taxation so high; why cannot you lower it?&rdquo;  If you try to lower it, for instance by economies in the personnel of the services, the next thing you will have will be appeals from everybody crying out: &ldquo;Why are you putting these people out of employment?&rdquo; Let us have common sense and straight dealing in these matters of finance, anyhow.</P>
    <P>We did not, then, overtax the people either in the Budget of 1952 or the Budget of 1953.  In fact we did not quite get by way of taxation the sums that were necessary to meet current expenditure.  There was no austerity policy.  No austerity policy has been adopted by us, unless you call it austerity to try to meet your current housekeeping expenses from current wages or revenue.  If that is austerity, it is the only type of policy that will keep any community, any individual, or any family going. We have to meet current expenses from current revenue.  If we want to cut down the amount of taxation we take from the people because it is diminishing their purchasing power, as is suggested by some Deputies, then the way to do it is to diminish the services.  You can achieve certain economies, as the Minister has been trying to do, throughout the various services but these economies are very far from the millions spent either on social services or capital services. There has been no austerity, then, in <Col N="825" /> our policy.  It has simply been a policy of trying to make ends meet.  We believe that is the best policy in the long run for the nation.  We believe that any other type of policy will ultimately damage the nation.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the question of our capital programme.  I think it was the Leader of the Opposition who used the phrase that we were sacrificing capital projects to &ldquo;the sacred cow of sterling.&rdquo;  We shall hear a good deal about the increase in capital expenditure that has taken place during our period of office.  We shall hear a good deal of that from the hustings. They boasted, of course, that it was the policy of Fine Gael, the policy of the Coalition.  &ldquo;When we were in office,&rdquo; they boast, &ldquo;everything was splendid&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Buaileam sciath&rdquo; is the grand motto for them.  Everything is splendid as long as the Coalition is in office; all things are well.  If we have a huge deficit in the balance of payments, then that huge deficit is all to the good.  As was suggested by a speaker in the Seanad, we have a grand nostalgic name given to it, the grand nostalgic title of &ldquo;repatriation of external assets.&rdquo;  It is only repatriation of assets when a deficit is incurred by the Coalition but it is all wrong when a deficit is incurred by us. When they are in office it is simply to the nation's good, they tell us, that these reserves should be exhausted.</P>
    <P>I remember their attitude in the early days when we were trying to develop capital projects, and it amuses me now to hear Fine Gael talk about their having introduced the policy of capital development.  Housebuilding in this country, in any extensive way, was begun by us.  If you call that capital development, there it is for you. Count the numbers, take the statistics, take any other evidence you like, and you will see that the greater part of the work has been done by us.  Take the development of electrical power, the utilisation of our rivers for power. I will admit that that work was initiated away back in the 1920's by the former Cumann na nGaedheal Government. That was one of the few things of a constructive kind they did.  As I <Col N="826" /> pointed out at the time, we would have begun otherwise.  We would have begun with the Liffey where, under a smaller scheme, we would have our own people trained.  However, that is past history, but one thing to their credit is that they began that.  We have developed electrical power until it has gone far and away beyond what was thought of in those days.  We did not, as was suggested by Deputy Dillon, set out to destroy it because it was started by our predecessors.  We set out to make the best we could of it and to bring in the Liffey, the Erne and other rivers as quickly as we possibly could.  It was we who developed Bord na Móna and the various activities connected with it&mdash;the utilisation of our bogs not merely for the production of domestic fuel but also for the production of electric power.</P>
    <P>It was we also who went ahead with the development of forestry.  We had already set 10,000 acres as an annual target when we were leaving office in 1948.  We always pointed out that if land were available, if we could get land for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why could you not get land anywhere?  Why could not land be got for forestry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the people were utilising the land otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, apparently, is an expert in these things, but we have to make sure that large sums of money are not wasted and that when trees are planted they will continue to grow.  The experts we had at the time were not satisfied that they would grow on some of this land. Nobody would be better pleased than we if some of the bogs which could not be used more beneficially for other purposes could be planted.  I hope they can and that science will reach a point at which they can.  That was not the type of land we had in mind.  What we regarded as soil fit for planting was the hillsides which were being utilised by the people who owned them as sheep ranges, such as one finds in <Col N="827" /> Wicklow.  It takes a considerable time to induce people to give up sheep raising in such areas and to adopt forestry as a livelihood.  You can do these things in Russia or somewhere else where private interests and private property are completely ignored.  I hope that is not going to be our attitude.  It is not now I am saying this for the first time&mdash;I said it long ago&mdash;that the effort should be to get public opinion in favour of using land for purposes like that, to get the people who own land to agree that it be used for these purposes, to enable the State to acquire it at an economic level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look over the whole range of development and you will see immediately that during our period we were following a policy of capital development. It is true that most of the development took place on schemes authorised by Act of Parliament and they appear not as voted capital from year to year but &ldquo;below the line&rdquo;. During our previous period of office the net borrowing has been estimated I think at £51,000,000.  What was that used for?  It was not used for financing deficits in Budgets.  That was the time in which every step that was taken, every question of whether an item was of a capital nature or not, was examined up and down.  It was only where it could be proved that it was capital, that it was for a productive purpose or was of a non-recurring character, that it would have been treated as a capital item, under the conditions of those times.  Most of the capital expenditure was authorised by Act of Parliament and the expenditure appeared below the line.  As a result of that, some £51,000,000 was the net borrowing in 1932-33 to 1947-48, taking all into account.  I am not talking alone of the public loans of £38,000,000. I asked for an estimate and the estimate given is £51,000,000.  That included some £10,000,000 paid at the time of the Agreement of 1938 with Britain.  There was also, I think, about £7,000,000 which was used for conversion of loans.  A certain part of the £7,000,000, no doubt, included some new money.  On the whole, however, <Col N="828" /> a net sum of something about £34,000,000 was devoted to capital development in those years.</P>
    <P>Multiply that by two and a half.  The present cost-of-living index figure is about 231, on pre-war figures; the industrial earnings figure is 254; and the index of agricultural wages is about 299, or about three times the original. The ratios are roughly two and one third, two and a half and three.  Let us take the middle one, as it would correspond roughly to the prices we would have to pay for the materials that had to be used in capital development generally.  If you multiply the £34,000,000 by two and a half, that gives about £85,000,000 as the equivalent to-day of the money spent during our time in capital development. Is it not all nonsense for the Opposition, then, to be pretending that the idea of using national capital for the development of the resources of the country was theirs?  The money we spent in the development of the E.S.B., Bord na Móna, the sugar industry or others&mdash;was that not capital?  Of course it was.  The point is that there was a complete change in the attitude of Fine Gael.  In order to meet the exigencies of their Coalition, they in fact adopted in the main the outlook of Fianna Fáil. The only thing they did, when they talked about &ldquo;a double Budget&rdquo;, was to segregate items in the Supply Services that had not previously been segregated.  They took items that we would have regarded as capital and put them into a separate table. That was the only difference in the double set of Estimates.  We have done that this year, too, of course, in effect.</P>
    <P>It is not true, then, to suggest that there has been any sacrifice, on our part, of capital projects to &ldquo;the sacred cow of sterling.&rdquo;  The amount of money spent on capital development since we came, this later time, into office has been far higher than the level reached by our predecessors.  That in itself was putting purchasing power out into the community.  Is there any suggestion that the putting out of that purchasing power into the community was diminishing their opportunity to purchase the ordinary needs of life? The attitude of the Opposition is <Col N="829" />&ldquo;buaileam sciath&rdquo; as long as they are in office &mdash;&ldquo;let us make a big noise, a big pretence, and the people ultimately will come to believe us; let us repeat the falsehood often enough in the hope that a lot of unthinking people will believe that we would not repeat it if it were not true.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Most of the statements made by the Opposition about our policy during the period in which they have been in opposition are fundamentally untrue. There has been no austerity; there has been no reduction of the capital programme. Quite the contrary, in the latter respect.  Where, then, has been the austerity programme, if that means the programme of budgeting for a surplus?  That did not exist.  The accounts prove it did not exist.  If it is suggested that there has been austerity through a diminution of the capital programme and a consequent withholding of purchasing power that could usefully be put out into the community, that does not exist.  Where is the basis for this pretence that a policy of austerity has been practised since we came into office?</P>
    <P>Of course, the obverse to &ldquo;buaileam sciath&rdquo; is, when they are out of office, to play the part of the &ldquo;cráiteachán&rdquo;&mdash;everything is miserable when they are out of office.  They claim credit for what happened in 1951.  They are due no more credit for 1951 than they would be due for the changes in the moon.  What happened in 1950 and 1951?  Everybody knows&mdash;you have the same pattern in every country&mdash;that there was a boom in anticipation of a possible third world war.  Then there was overstocking and, following the intense activity in anticipation of a third world war, when it became obvious that that war was not going to take place&mdash;or at least when it became obvious that it was not going to take place immediately&mdash;you had in every country the same problem. The work for the next year or even for some years had been done and the activities, in factories particularly, diminished and you had a slump, after the boom of 1950-51, continuing into portion of 1952.  The same thing has happened in every country.  The Opposition had nothing whatever to <Col N="830" /> do with the artificial situation which existed here from 1950 to 1951.  They were fortunate from the point of view of industrial output and employment. Then they go out and say that in their time they had given full employment. Of course, that is ridiculous.  There was no full employment.  If they mean by that that there was nobody on the unemployed register, of course there were and, as I pointed out many times, the curve showing unemployment week after week during the years shows that the lowest point in unemployment did not occur when they were in office.</P>
    <P>Anyone who wants to see a graphic picture of changing quantities will try to have the points as close as possible. It is not the averages of the years he will take but the averages of months. The averages of days would be better. In the case of unemployment the closest points in the curve giving the picture show weekly averages.  The lowest point on record was reached during the time when we were in office in 1947.  At that time there were certain activities which led to that, but, in fact, the truth is that if there were to be boasting of low unemployment at any particular time, the lowest point on the curve would be that which was reached on September 6th, 1947, when it was 34,978.  The lowest point reached in the time of the Coalition was some 3,000 higher.  It was 37,991 or just under 38,000, and was reached in July, 1950 If you take the average for the years the lowest annual average that was reached was 51,600 in 1951.</P>
    <P>I have told you the particular conditions, the particular feverish activity that was on at that time as a result of the fear of a third world war.  It is nonsense to say that there was full employment when 51,600 were unemployed, on an average, and when the lowest point that was reached for a particular period was, in their time, 37,991, close on 38,000.</P>
    <P>Our position was that we came in at the beginning of the slump.  We were unfortunate in that, just as our opponents were fortunate in coming in in an artificial boom situation, if you call it fortunate.  They were able to <Col N="831" /> use it as a basis for boasting that there had been a great deal of activity, a good deal of industrial production, and so on, at that particular period.  But, as I have said, their attitude when in office is one thing and their attitude when they are out of office is, of course, quite the reverse.  Everything in the garden was lovely, everybody was having a splendid time, everything was splendid, as long as the Opposition were in office, but now, of course, everything is gone to the dogs and every index, every indication that there is that the year 1953 was a year of recovery and progress is scouted. These figures and indices are all-important when the Opposition happen to be in office.  If we were to do as they are doing at the present time we would be told that a statistical office has been set up at great public expense with the best statisticians we can find, that they are there to take a general record so that we may know how the community, taken as a whole, is faring. Are they to be believed or are they not?  If they take responsibility for issuing figures with regard to industrial output, employment, and so on, are they to be believed or are they not?  If they are not to be believed, let us point out where the errors lie.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has been attacked because in the introduction of his Budget statement he spoke of the year that has just passed as being a year of prosperity, relative prosperity. Prosperity is by the very nature of things relative.  I call it a year of recovery.  We are challenged and asked will we say these things at the cross-roads.  Of course, we can say these things at the cross-roads. The difference is that they are counting on human nature not to listen to statements that things are good, that cráiteachán, the poor mouth, will be listened to with more attention.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are exceptions in every community.  Nobody wants to say that in this nation, any more than it can be said in regard to any nation, everybody is well off and everybody is happy.  We are taking the community as a whole.  Looking at it from the point of view of the greatest good of the greatest number, <Col N="832" /> who can dispute that the year that has just passed has been a year of recovery and a year of progress?  Our opponents think it is better to say the opposite at the cross-roads.  Every one of us has something which is not exactly as he would like it to be. Unfortunately, with human nature, we count our evils; we do not count our benefits.  It is on that basis that we are being challenged to repeat at the cross-roads what we say here.</P>
    <P>We will repeat it.  It is a fact, proved by all the statistics.  It was a year in which national income has increased by every evidence.  We have the figures for 1952, which showed the first rise, I think, after two years of decline, in real value of the national income.  It went up in 1952 and all the indications are that it must have gone up in 1953.</P>
    <P>We are sneered at.  The Minister was sneered at when he referred to the past year as a year of progress and relative prosperity.  Is it or is it not a fact that industrial production increased in every quarter of that year until it reached the highest limits that have been reached so far in the records of industrial production? Is that a fact or is it not?  If there is an increase in industrial production surely industry, to that extent, has been prospering.  Increased production may be due to increased organisation, improved equipment.  It may also be due to increased numbers employed.  Which has it been?  Generally you will find both.  In our case it can be proved that it is both and that this increased production has meant also increased numbers employed, so much so that the highest figure that was reached at any time in transportable goods industries&mdash;some 142,000 odd&mdash;was reached again in the last quarter of the year that has just passed.  In each single quarter of that year there was a record high production. Can that be disputed?  Is it true or is it false?  If it is true, is not it a fact that in that sense industry has prospered?</P>
    <P>Now let us turn to the farm.  The suggestion from the Opposition always has been that we never think of the farmer.  From the first day we were formed as Fianna Fáil we set out to <Col N="833" /> have particular care for the interest of the small farmer and the interest of the worker.  We have not changed our coats about it.  We have pursued it whether we were a complete majority, as we were for the greater part of the time when we were formerly in office, or whether we were the biggest Party but not a complete majority.  We will do it again and continue doing it.  It is our set policy because we believe it is good national policy.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about industry.  What, then, has been the position with regard to agriculture?  Is it or is it not a fact that last year more milk was delivered to the creameries, notwithstanding the milk strike, than had been delivered in any year since 1936?  With regard to prices, I am sure the farmers will not regard the price as satisfactory whereas the townspeople will evidently take a different view&mdash;and, again, the Opposition will have it both ways. When they are talking to the farmers they will say: &ldquo;You are not getting enough for your milk&rdquo;, while in Dublin they will say to the townspeople: &ldquo;You are paying too much for your butter&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is the fact that more milk was delivered to the creameries in 1953 than in any year since 1936 not a sign of prosperity as far as the dairying industry is concerned?  Of course, when members of the Opposition are talking at the cross-roads in the country and see a few farmers present they will tell them that they are not getting enough for their milk&mdash;and hope that such statements will not be reported to the people in the towns.  When they are talking to the farmers they say one thing and when they are talking to the townspeople they say another thing. They want to have it both ways.  They are speaking with two voices.  We cannot do that and no Government can do it.  If it is a decent Government it will have to decide on a policy in the best interests of the country as a whole and do its best to arbitrate as between one section of the community and another. As a rule, they cannot satisfy both sections but sometimes&mdash;exceptionally&mdash;they are able to do that. Generally, however, they will succeed in having both sides dissatisfied.  If we fix the price of butter, determining the <Col N="834" /> price of milk, the farmers will be dissatisfied and say that they have not got enough and, on the other hand, the townspeople will be dissatisfied and say that they have to pay too much. Sometimes you will satisfy one section and not the other and sometimes, by a miracle, you get both sides reasonably satisfied.</P>
    <P>However, is it a fact, or not, that more milk was delivered to the creameries in 1953 than was delivered in any year since 1936 and is that not a sign of prosperity in that particular commodity so far as those who are depending on that commodity for a livelihood or those for whom that commodity is a factor in their livelihood are concerned?</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact, too, that the number of cattle in the country was greater than at any time, I think, back to 1921? Is that not a sign that there is prosperity in that particular trade?  You have the cattle, you have the export trade and the export prices are reasonable. That, accordingly, shows an increase in prosperity.</P>
    <P>I come now to tillage.  Tillage, which had been declining for some years, increased in 1952 and again in 1953.  We believe that one of the ways of turning the farm, to use Deputy Dillon's expression, into a &ldquo;minor factory&rdquo; for producing and processing things is to use the land to grow the things we require here in this country as its primary purpose.  We are ready to fight that battle over again, if Deputy Dillon wants to attack our tillage policy, as he attacked it before, and if Fine Gael want to attack it.  We stand now, as we stood at the beginning, for this policy for our country of keeping a certain home market, to the greatest extent possible, for our farmers and of endeavouring, whilst doing that, to get surpluses from the farms which we will be able to export. However, in the first instance, we must make sure that the home farmer has got the first option of supplying the home needs.  Of course, that has been done in increasing measure.  Not so very long ago about half of what was produced in this country was consumed at home.  I think it has gone up to <Col N="835" /> about two-thirds now.  There is the difference&mdash;a secure market not dependent on world conditions.  An arrangement here at home on the basis of a better exchange on fair terms of services and goods between the different sections of our people can be managed internally.  But, as was the case long ago, if we are depending on the outside market it goes up and down according to international conditions.</P>
    <P>We are giving stability to our farming industry when we set out to secure for our farmers as much as possible of the home market.  That is why, time after time, I have tried to point out the position to farmers when some foolish people say that it is against their interests that industries should be built up here.  I have tried to point out that the development of industry here is one of the things that help the farmer.  It gives him an increased home market.  More people will consume his goods and the things he produces. It provides an opportunity for his children of getting employment here in industry and production so that they will not have to emigrate, to that extent, anyhow.</P>
    <P>We still believe that the best policy in this country is to use our land in the first instance to produce for our people the things they require.  In doing that, we know we are helping to meet this dangerous position that can arise with regard to our balance of payments. To that extent, we do not have to import from outside because we produce our requirements at home. After that is done and you get everything possible from your soil, then, to a certain extent you can follow part of the path that has been suggested by Deputy Dillon.  Nobody is against that, except to the extent to which it is used in opposition to the more fundamental thing for which we stand, that is, that the soil of this country should be used primarily to produce for our people the things they require.  Incidentally, by exporting our surplus produce we can obtain abroad some of the things which we cannot produce here.  If we are to have that position, we must have tillage.  If we are to get the best results from our farms, these farms must be tilled</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> On the Continent, lime and fertilisers are used much more extensively than here and their use there is understood and appreciated.  In addition, on the Continent there is a far higher percentage of tillage.  I would say that our percentage of tillage is probably the lowest in Western Europe.  Certainly, it is lower than it is in Holland or Denmark or any of the other countries that I know of.  Ours is a very small percentage, probably only about 15 per cent., or so.  It is a much smaller percentage than that which obtains on the Continent.  Some of the countries there have as much as 66 per cent. of the land&mdash;two-thirds of it&mdash;under tillage.</P>
    <P>We have not enough tillage in this country and if we have not enough tillage we shall not be able to get the most that can be got out of the soil.</P>
    <P>Tillage and proper fertilisation&mdash;the use of lime is one of the prerequisites for proper productivity from the soil&mdash; have to go together and we want tillage both for that reason and because it is essential if we are to produce the things we require.</P>
    <P>We require here food for man and beast and our aim ought to be to produce that from our own land.  If we do it, we can carry more cattle and not less cattle as used to be suggested by the people who opposed our policy of tillage, of wheat-growing and beet-growing, in the earlier years.  We still stand for that.  We still believe, as we have always believed, that agriculture is the primary industry and that on the prosperity of agriculture will depend the prosperity of the country as a whole.  We are glad, very glad, that the farmers did get a break in recent years. What we are hoping is that they will co-operate with us in trying to get from the soil all that can be produced by the soil.  If they do, it will be equivalent to an increase in their holdings of at least 50 per cent.  If an ordinary farmer were told that his farm would be increased by 50 per cent., how delighted he would be, but he can get as good results as if that were done and he were to continue at his own methods by turning over to applying fertilisers and tilling the soil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> We stand then for the development of agriculture.  We are glad&mdash;because it was a difficult task&mdash;that industry has made the progress it has made and it is comforting to know that there are twice as many people employed in industries covered by the Census of Industrial Production to-day as were employed when we first came into office.  Whatever may be said about emigration, we know that at least that number of people have been saved from emigration.</P>
    <P>I was dealing with the question of whether the last year had been a year of prosperity or not and I suggested that we look at the increase in tillage which does mean and has meant an increase in productivity.  The wheat grown by the farmer has brought millions of pounds to the farming community and the growing of beet has brought in millions of pounds.  Is that to be put aside?  Is that not an evidence of prosperity?  There has been much more in that particular line than before and if we take practically every element of what the farmer's activity produces, we will find that there has been increased productivity, increased wealth on that account, which proves that both in the factory and on the farm we have increased activity and prosperity.</P>
    <P>We are told that there is unemployment and emigration and unfortunately these things are true.  I remember when we were conducting the 1948 election campaign, there were pictures shown of a slum and the existence of a slum was used to pretend that Fianna Fáil had done nothing. Until this world ends, it will always be possible to get exceptions in any community, and if you take an exception and pretend that it is a general feature and not an exception, you can create the impression that things are bad.  Those who showed that single slum did not show the tens of thousands of houses built to relieve the slums.  Those who showed that single picture took great care not to point out the fact that, when we came into office, according to my recollection, there were some 20,000 families in this city living with one room to the family.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> That was the position we had to deal with.  Could it be dealt with overnight? If we had the magic wand which they apparently have in the opposite benches, we would have had only to wave it, and lo!  the slums were changed into proper flat dwellings or cottages in the suburbs of the city. We have no such magic wand and neither have our opponents, but not merely were there built or reconstructed through our urging very many more houses than were built during the ten years of the previous Government or the three years of the inter-Party Government, but we have the highest record in respect of the single years.  Last year, more houses were built or reconstructed than at any other time since the record figure of 1937 or 1938 when over 17,000 houses were built or reconstructed.  Last year, 1953, over 15,000 houses were built or reconstructed, and, if one wants the next highest figure, one must go back to the year 1952-53.</P>
    <P>Was it a fair picture of the activities of Fianna Fáil to pick out a single slum, to show that and to pretend that it represented the whole?  It was simply playing a cruel trick on the electorate and on the people generally. We had the case here of the man in the public gallery&mdash;an unemployed person, presumably.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Even supposing that it was a genuine case, is that to be taken as a picture of the whole?  Is it to be suggested that any Government ever can so arrange things that one person or two persons cannot be got&mdash; honest people, as apart from those who can be procured&mdash;who will find themselves in difficulties?  No Government can do it.  It requires the Almighty&mdash;and He has not so arranged it&mdash;to arrange that in a community you will be able so to order things that there will not be a single individual who will not be an exception to any general rule.  No matter what is done in relation to health, there will be sick people amongst us, sick people whom the doctors will not be able to relieve. If they were, we probably would have no deaths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> In spite of anything any Government can do, in spite of any system or organisation of society, there will always be exceptions and if people point to these exceptions and pretend that they are illustrative of the whole, these people are perpetrating a fraud. That fraud was perpetrated on the people in the elections of 1948.  There are exceptions, then, and if you proceed on the basis of the exceptions, you can prove that 1953 was not a prosperous year, but all the indications that are usually taken of the prosperity of a country are there, and they all prove that what the Minister said is true.</P>
    <P>Let us come now to the exceptions. It has been suggested that in former days there was full employment.  I pointed out that is not so.</P>
    <P>In the latter part of last year, there was an improvement in the unemployment position.  When figures are quoted about the early part of 1953 not merely is the slump that had to be met conveniently forgotten but it is also forgotten that a Social Welfare Act had been passed which came into full effect at that time.  It was estimated at the time that some 10,000 more were put on to the register than would have been registered on the old basis, so that you would have to subtract 10,000 from the number in order to get comparable figures for the previous corresponding period.  There has been a reduction in unemployment as well as an increase in employment.</P>
    <P>We did not ignore that a problem existed and it was in an effort to meet that problem that the National Development Fund was introduced.  We were asked why there should be people unemployed as long as there was profitable work to do.  It is not so easy to get profitable work for people of different classes and of different capacities.  It is not so easy to get profitable work in the ordinary sense but there are classes for whom you can find employment. Generally speaking, the way to beat unemployment is to develop industries, develop production on the farm if you can and give employment on the farms, in the workshops and in the factories. <Col N="840" /> That is the most lasting and best way and it is in that way we hope to do it and we have already had considerable success.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be better to deal separately with the question of emigration but as far as trying to meet the unemployment situation is concerned, we started to get after immediately profitable work and work of an amenity kind&mdash;useful work that would otherwise be engaged on but at a more remote period perhaps.  While work of a more productive than amenity character was available we went after that.  We went after things that would not come along for a number of years.  We brought these forward.</P>
    <P>In order to meet unemployment in the building and construction industries, we have always thought it a good thing to have some pool of work in hand that was of public use and which would be likely to be engaged upon at some time or another to meet some public needs.  One of the schemes for doing that was the development of our roads to meet modern transport requirements. Of course, that is sneered at by rather unthinking persons&mdash; people, perhaps, who do not travel very much and who do not engage in industry and who do not see what the value of good roads means from the point of view of saving time and wear and tear on vehicles.  All those things are of course not apparent to the person who it not responsible for seeing that these are provided but the Government is responsible for seeing that public needs of that character are reasonably provided.  One of the things we had in mind was to go ahead bit by bit, having planned ahead to see how the requirements in the future were likely to develop, and use the pool of public works to employ people who would otherwise be unemployed.</P>
    <P>The only great difficulty about that plan is that once you engage people on these works they expect to be continued on and on and when the works come to an end there is a demand that the Government should find alternative employment for them.  It would be a blessing if it could be otherwise, because then you could go on planning having a pool of public works to take <Col N="841" /> up the lag in times of unemployment. Unfortunately, that does not happen. The trouble is that when people are employed on works of that sort they think they ought to be continued, even when the work on which they are engaged is finished, or that alternative work should be given to them.</P>
    <P>With regard to housebuilding, I think that about 50 out of 116 local authorities are coming to the end of their housing programmes envisaged in 1947.  Employment will have to be found for these people&mdash;alternative work locally, because you are not going to transport them over long distances. One of the troubles in this connection is that, in the main, work has to be arranged near the homes of the people who become unemployed. Consequently, if you are going to deal with the unemployment caused through the completion of housebuilding locally, the Government will naturally be anxious to see whether any alternative employment can be provided in the neighbourhood which could be given to these people.  It would be much better if they could get work on the farms and on the bogs.</P>
    <P>In the case of capital projects, the question is how much capital you can afford to give to improve amenities and how much of necessity must be devoted to directly productive work. All these things are problems and it is no use for members of this House to think you can have some cut and dried solution for them.  We have tried to arrive at the best possible solution. The difficulties in the city were pointed out here by Deputy Briscoe.  The past year saw an improvement in the situation and we hope there will be a continued improvement as there has been since the slump period was past. Certainly, the Government will do anything they can reasonably do which will not harm the rest of the community or impose on them burdens which would bear so heavily on them as to injure their own productive activities.  Unemployment is a problem but the position is improving. We have tried to get some measures to meet the position as it stands.  We do not want by any means to give the impression that it is solved and we do <Col N="842" /> not believe our opponents have any solution for it either, because they have not.  The things that happened in 1950, 1951 and 1952 are paralleled in every other country in the world.</P>
    <P>With regard to emigration, I have tried to get from the Central Statistics Office figures that could be regarded as reliable.  There were certain figures published in connection with the inter-censal period from 1946 to 1951; in 1946 it was 3,000; in 1947 it was 10,000; in 1948 it was 28,000.  It was 34,000 in 1949, and in 1950 it was 41,000, with a margin of error some thousands on each side.  I asked them was there any way in which we could get reliable figures for subsequent years.  Sampling methods were tried and proved to be inadequate.  Of course the difficulty is obvious.  It has been suggested by some people that you can get the figures from passenger movements. You could get some sort of an indication perhaps but when it comes to any attempt to get reliable figures you cannot get them.</P>
    <P>Passenger movements by sea do not tell the whole story and the difficulty of estimating the amount will be seen at once if you bear in mind that the total number going in and out of the State is about 5,000,000 each way, a total of 10,000,000. It is the difference between those two we want to find and you can easily see that a very small percentage error on either side will give you a considerable difference in the remainder. What we are looking for is in some thousands and the difference being very small in comparison with the figures in question, a very small error in the estimation of either of the two figures can give you a considerable error with the remainder.  They tell me that, consequently, the only period for which they are able to give accurate figures is the inter-censal period.  They have been able to check the annual figures for the years 1946 to 1950 with the inter-censal figure, and they are reasonably certain that the 3,000, 10,000, 28,000, 34,000 and 41,000 are accurate.  At the present time there is no reliable figure for later years.  I want them, and if <Col N="843" /> they can give them to me I will publish them as I have done with the other figures, but they will not give them to me because they say there is no figure they can stand over.</P>
    <P>That is the position with regard to emigration.  Of course, for the Opposition that is a splendid position.  Back in 1946, when emigration was only 3,000, and in 1947 when it was 10,000, we had people on the Opposition Benches crying out that there was greater emigration from this country at that time than there had been at any time since the Famine, and the truth was the very reverse.  When they came into office they set up a commission to examine into the causes of emigration.  We all knew fairly well that it made no difference what commission was set up to examine it.  Though there were certain psychological and other factors which might come into it, one of the fundamental factors was that 25,000 new jobs have to be provided on an average every year to meet those who are coming to the employment age. Unless we are unable so to develop as to absorb 25,000 new people every year there will be unemployment.  If there is unemployment here and there is employment elsewhere that they think they can get and if they have relatives who are inducing them to go away, they go away.  Therefore, the only remedy for emigration is to increase employment and increase industrial activity and activity on the farms.</P>
    <P>I am worried, I may admit, about the farms.  I have not been able to get so far&mdash;I have asked for it&mdash;an estimate as to how far the introduction of modern machinery and the general scientific development in the working of farms is going to increase employment or do the reverse.  I hope it will increase employment on the land but there is just a big question mark in my mind as to whether it actually will.</P>
    <P>At one time some Deputy in the House suggested we should go back to horses and perhaps the next thing that will be suggested is that we should go back to the spade.  I do not think there is any hope in that <Col N="844" /> direction.  You cannot put back the clock like that.  If you are going to increase employment you will have to increase the productivity of the farms so that they can if necessary maintain a greater number of people than before.  There has developed a movement from the land which has taken place in every country.  In fact we are probably a more rural community than will be found in many countries in the world.  We have a greater percentage of our people regarded as rural dwellers than in many countries.  However, the number has been diminishing, partly as industry was built up and partly from this movement that there is in all these countries from the land towards the towns.  Personally, having been brought up in the country, I regret that movement very much.  I often think that there was a much happier form of society than there is now, from certain aspects anyhow&mdash;of course it had its evils too.  But that also would be hoping to put back the clock.  We must advance with the times and do our best to make it possible for the farms to maintain as many people as they can and thus try to preserve our rural community.</P>
    <P>We are also aiming at preserving the rural community by trying to decentralise industry, but there is a difficulty there.  The tendency for those using their own private money is to get near to where there is a big market. We have tried by various ways to offset that tendency and to get industries decentralised.  We do know that from the broader social point of view it is considered a good thing, but from the narrow point of view of economics it is regarded sometimes as undesirable because less economic.  I remember that when the question arose of putting up the extra beet factories, we were told that a single factory in the neighbourhood of New Ross would be able to meet all the requirements and at less cost as a whole to the community.  We had to make up our minds whether to accept that or decentralise the industry, perhaps sending up the cost.  However, we decided on decentralisation and we did it against some of the advice that was given by the experts.  In one <Col N="845" /> period one of my fears was that the value of the factory was not being appreciated by the local farmers and that the supply would not be forthcoming. I think that fear has vanished from my mind for the moment.  I hope there will not be any need of entertaining it at any time, but the example I have given is indicative of our policy of attempting to keep as many of our people as possible in the country districts.  As far as emigration then is concerned, we have no figures and it is nonsense for anyone to tell us there are more people leaving the country now than at any time since the Famine.  They can say that, as they said it in 1946 and in 1947, when the figures were in fact low, but we have no figures we can give.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>I think I have said enough to indicate what the general policy of the Government is and has been and to point out that it is all nonsense to talk of a policy of austerity.  It is true to say, as the Minister has said, that the year that has passed has been a year of relative prosperity.  It is my belief that the people know that. We shall see.</P>

      <P>Before I comment on the Budget statement proper I would like to refer to the Taoiseach's remarks in relation to afforestation.  I do not know whether he meant to imply, because on various occasions here I have seen fit to criticise both the Government and the Opposition point of view on afforestation, that I should thereby be branded as having tendencies of a dangerous nature and views of a subversive character towards the country.  The suggestion in the Taoiseach's remarks was that it is very difficult to get land for afforestation and, consequently, if Deputies like myself advocate a new approach to this problem of procuring land for afforestation purposes, we are treading on dangerous ground and trying to bring in here Communistic tendencies.</P>

      <P>Having got the point cleared up, I want to suggest to the Taoiseach that the policy of his Government and the policy of the Opposition in relation to afforestation has been lacking in earnestness, initiative and drive.  The suggestion is that there is very little land available and that the people who live on land suitable for afforestation purposes are not willing to part with it.  I do not suggest for a moment that the people living on this land are prepared to part with it on easy terms.  The fact is they do not appreciate the value of afforestation.</P>
      <P>I have not yet heard of any Government propaganda in the rural areas explaining to the people whose lands are suitable for afforestation the immense benefits that would accrue if they gave over to forestry that portion of their lands which is not fit for tillage and is of very little use for grazing purposes.  I am talking now from personal experience.  I have gone around many areas in the West and explained in great detail to the people what the benefits of afforestation can mean.  Many of them have told me that that was the first time in 25 years that they heard what afforestation could mean to them and what it would mean in relation to potential employment for their sons, thereby helping in no small measure to relieve the unemployment problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is that as far as the Forestry Section is concerned, they must be approached first by the people in the locality.  If an approach is not made there is no danger of the Forestry Branch bothering its head to visit the area and see if the land is available.  I have again had practical experience of that.  I brought to the notice of the Land Commission certain areas in my own constituency where the land is suitable for afforestation.  I found in one particular instance that <Col N="847" /> the attention of the Forestry Branch had been drawn to an area in 1949. This is 1954 and the Forestry Branch has as yet made no move to start a forestry centre in the locality although land has been made available to them.</P>
    <P>If there is a difficulty in obtaining land in these areas&mdash;I am speaking now with special reference to the West of Ireland&mdash;would it not be possible to extend the activities of the Land Commission proper to these areas and provide alternative holdings for the people whose lands are acquired for afforestation purposes?  We have a body known as the Land Commission. Their activities are confined to certain areas.  Would it not be possible for the Land Commission to work in conjunction with its own Forestry Branch and remove people who are willing to make their lands available for afforestation purposes?  I can assure the Taoiseach that there are many people in the West who are willing to move out provided they get alternative holdings.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that the policy pursued by this Government or the inter-Party Government in relation to afforestation has been in any way successful.  There is no question that the benefits that would accrue from afforestation would play a major part in solving the unemployment problem. We are assured by experts that commercial timber can be grown on the lands to which I have referred and matured on these lands in 25 years.  The comparable period in Sweden for timber to mature is 75 to 100 years.  The number of people engaged in afforestation and allied industries in Sweden exceeds 150,000. Here, little over a couple of thousand are employed on afforestation, to say nothing of the few employed in industries based on afforestation.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Budget statement proper, if it is any consolation to the Government I do not believe the Budget can be described as an election Budget.  I describe it as an anaemic Budget.  It holds out very little hope for the future development of the country.  It is a cautious conservative Budget, thought out and <Col N="848" /> planned by conservative and cautious men who have lost their energy and their initiative through the passing of the years.</P>
    <P>All the matters that have been discussed here in connection with the coming election and in connection with certain hardships that have been apparent in our economic life can be traced to a great extent to the infamous Budget of 1952.  When that Budget was being discussed here I pointed out that I did not dispute for a moment that the money was needed.  I did not dispute the fact that it was necessary to obtain this money and, consequently, I was not prepared to accept in full the views of the Opposition that the budgetary penalties were imposed for the purpose of raking in an extra £10,000,000.</P>
    <P>I did not accept that view.  If this evil existed, and if we were living beyond our means, my view was that it was no good to put on the lash too heavily.  My belief is that, in this particular instance, the cure was worse than the disease, and that the Government could have applied at that time better remedial measures. There was no need to impose, in the one year, that huge load of taxation on the people because, whether the Taoiseach or the Cabinet believe it or not, it did impose a severe hardship, especially on the poorer sections of the community and did tremendous damage in certain lines of business. It did cause a great deal of unnecessary hardship and considerable unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in the course of his speech to-day, said that there was no question of austerity.  I do not know what his idea of austerity is.  I am afraid that the two of us would disagree on that, because, in my view, it is austerity when a young man with a family gets notice that his employment is about to cease, and when he has to face a bleak future on unemployment benefit.  That is a hardship on that man and his family.  It is a hardship on a man and his family when he gets notice that he is to be put on short time.  It is a hardship on young men and women who are anxious to work in Ireland and have security at home <Col N="849" /> when they have to emigrate to the ends of the earth.  I venture to suggest that, bad and all as the position was in 1951, the attempts of this present Government to solve it made it still worse.  That is the view that I want to express here in an independent manner.</P>
    <P>I think that, in a general way, we are coming to the end of an era in this country.  The situation is not too hopeful after 30 years of native government. We had the Taoiseach in his speech outlining what is being done by his Party, and suggesting that they have not changed their views in any way.  I do not know whether they have or not.  I know that, if they hold the same views now as they did in 1932, they are making very little effort to put a heart into that effort or to get their views put into operation.  If we examine the picture generally and broadly over the last 30 years we must admit, in spite of the developments which may have taken place in the industrial field under the capable leadership of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, that we still have the sorry picture of emigration and unemployment and the problem of Partition.  Let me put the matter this way.  We can say that, in the last 30 years under native Governments, we had more emigration in that period than in any similar period under the British régime, with the exception of the Famine years.  My remarks are based on facts which I have taken from the census report covering the period 1947 to 1951.</P>
    <P>Anyone who cares to study that report will find that, under native Governments in the last 30 years, more people have left Ireland than had ever left it under the British régime with, as I say, the exception of the Famine years.  If anyone thinks that, in the last nine or ten years the situation has improved, or that, as a result of Budgets passed in this House, we had turned the corner towards prosperity, let him look at that report again and see that in the five-year period between 1947 and 1951 more people emigrated from this country than in any previous ten-year period. In other words, we doubled the rate of emigration in the five years between <Col N="850" /> 1947 and 1951 over what it was in any other period prior to that.  There cannot be any dispute or contradiction of these figures.</P>
    <P>What is the position, apart from emigration?  Take the unemployment figures.  The Taoiseach and the Government may take great consolation from the fact that the unemployment figures this year are 12,000 less than they were last year.  That is poor consolation for the other 70,000 who are still on the unemployment list.  I do not suggest&mdash;it would be very unfair to do so&mdash;that all those people could be given work, or that all of them are suited for work, but what I do suggest is that the big unemployment problem that existed 30 years ago is still as bad as ever to-day, and that, in fact, very little change has taken place in the figures over that period of years.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party people take credit for this, that the unemployment figures reached their lowest during their period of office.  I do not know whether, if they had got another three or four years, they are prepared to suggest that they would have solved the problem. But, at any rate, there is one thing that can be said for the view of the inter-Party people.  It is that they hold out more hope, that they have more confidence in their approach and seem to have a greater belief that the necessary expansion can take place more quickly in this country to absorb more of our unemployed.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned emigration and unemployment.  There is a third black mark against the régimes which we have had here in the last 30 years, and that is the condition that obtains in the West of Ireland.  I am sure that at times Deputies get bored because I speak so often in the House on the West of Ireland.  I am convinced, however, that most of our problems which exist to-day, under-development and so forth, are due to the fact that the West of Ireland has been so completely neglected over the last 30 years.  When I say completely neglected, I mean as far as fundamentals are concerned, that is that industries based on the land have been neglected.  So far as the West of Ireland is concerned, one can say that there are three great things <Col N="851" /> which count.  One is the fisheries.  We have heard nothing about it.  Another is afforestation.  Very little of it has been done in the West.  Any afforestation that has taken place has been in the East of Ireland, in County Wicklow; but in those areas where unemployment exists, where the land is suitable for afforestation, where congestion exists and where emigration is highest, one can say that no serious approach has been made to end that situation through the development of afforestation.</P>
    <P>As far as I am personally concerned, I am going to give no guarantee to any single Party in this House that it will get the unlimited support of Deputies in the West of Ireland for any policy unless we know beforehand that the policy is going to be put into operation and that it holds out hope for the people of the West.  I do not want to develop this point too much.  In speaking about the West of Ireland, we have had, from time to time, long harangues about the necessity for preserving the Gaeltacht and the revival of the Irish language.  When it comes down to brass tacks, let us see what is being done in the West of Ireland in that direction. We find that there is a special children's allowance for those homes in which Irish is the spoken language. There are allowances for unemployment, allowances and reliefs of all sorts made available to people in the Gaeltacht areas.  There are special facilities available for housing grants, but when it comes down to the question of employment, or industrialisation or big afforestation in these areas, we see very little development.  I do not know whether it is due to the fact that it has been suggested that if industrialisation takes place in the Gaeltacht areas we are likely to lose the Irish language.  That seems to be the fear in most people's minds when we talk about setting up industries in, say, Galway, and places like that&mdash;that if we do that we are going to anglicise the Gaeltacht.  If we have to shelter the people who speak the language in the West of Ireland by not giving them employment, why do we not look at the other side of the <Col N="852" /> picture and see that for every one that still exists in the West of Ireland&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;exist&rdquo; deliberately&mdash; a number of his relations have to go to England and America and send home pay packets year by year in order to help other members of the family to leave their beloved Gaeltacht also?  It is no good trying to turn that area into an Indian reservation.</P>
    <P>It is admitted here by all Parties that taxation has now reached its highest limit and that we cannot afford to impose any more taxation on the people of this country.  I think that is agreed.  We have now reasonably good social services.  It costs quite an amount of money&mdash;apart from all the various services and social services&mdash; to run the State here and this burden seems to have got heavier each year up to the present.  An extraordinary thing is that while all these new services are coming into operation and have to be paid for there is very little increase in the amount of money available to pay for these services.  In other words while we all agree that these services are essential or desirable, at the same time we must take the necessary steps to make money available to pay for them.  As far as I can see we have reached the stage now when we are not in a position to give any further services to the community. All this boils down to the fact that our main industry, which is agriculture, has made very little progress not alone in the last ten or 15 years but in the last 100 years. All these services of various types that we have must be paid for in some way or another and our real wealth lies in agriculture, and so far the expansion that is essential has not been made in the sphere of agriculture.  We have possibly the greatest agricultural potential in Europe and yet it is undeveloped. That is admitted by the leaders and the responsible members of all Parties.  I remember the Minister for Industry and Commerce in a speech&mdash;I am not going to quote his words exactly&mdash;some time ago stating that very little progress had been made in agriculture, and I think it can be agreed by all Parties that in spite of&mdash;shall we describe it as the <Col N="853" /> benevolent guidance and help of native Governments&mdash;the volume of output now is no greater than it was in the worst days of the landlords.  All Parties in this House agree that agriculture is our key industry.  Yet, when it comes along to a general election and the hustings are taking place, agriculture is the one industry that is shuttled about, thrown from one platform to another by the Parties.</P>
    <P>I have suggested on many occasions to this House that there should be a non-partisan approach to agriculture. I have heard Deputies on both sides&mdash; the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Childers, on the Fianna Fáil side, and Deputies on the Fine Gael Benches&mdash;saying we should have a united policy on agriculture and that it should be taken out of the political arena for at least five years and that we should agree to get the best possible skill, the brains available to hammer out an agreed policy for a period of, say, five years.  It is coming to the time when that will have to be done. It is useless for people to suggest in this House that if such and such a man is made Minister for Agriculture the sun is going to shine for 24 hours a day because, God knows, we could lose the services of any Minister or any member of the House through death in 24 hours and the country would still have to go on.  It is not a matter of the individual but of policy and the problem of agriculture should not be subject to party political opportunity.</P>
    <P>Tied up, of course, with agriculture we have the problem of land, and here, I think, most people seem to forget that we have one of the biggest State bodies in the country known as the Land Commission and it might interest this House to know that when that body was set up it was set up as a temporary institution to get rid of congestion.  I am speaking in general terms on this because there is money being made available for the running of this very important, huge body and I think the time has come when there must be a complete and thorough overhaul of the Land Commission.  I have said that one of <Col N="854" /> the reasons for its establishment was to get rid of congestion and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with the policy of the Government in connection with land division and not with the actual activities of the Land Commission.  My belief is that a direction was given to the Land Commission <Col N="855" /> by the Government at one stage to put as many people as possible on the land and so far they have failed to carry out that policy on the lines directed.  We heard the Taoiseach here this morning telling us of their efforts on behalf of the small farmers.  I suggest that whatever Government is in power in the future will have to pay more attention to this most essential State service, the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>I was very interested last night listening to Deputy Dillon on the question of the importation of raw material into this country.  I do not intend to delay the House entering into a controversy with Deputy Dillon, but I think he is wrong in his outlook to this extent.  He mentioned the Gentex factory in Athlone and asked if it is right for that factory to import raw materials from the far ends of the earth and have it processed in the factory, why is it wrong for the Department of Agriculture to buy raw material abroad and have it processed at home here on our small farms and then export it.  That was the problem he posed last night.  Personally, I think that before we start importing raw material for processing on the 25-acre farm we should produce as much of that raw material as we can at home.  But there is no need for going to the ends of the earth to buy, we will say, barley or wheat if our land can produce them.  If all our arable land at the moment was being fully utilised for tillage purposes and we were able to carry some cattle and live stock on the farms, then at that stage I would agree that we should import raw material from abroad and process it here.  But until we have reached that stage let us concentrate on growing on our own land the raw materials that can be processed on our own land. In other words, my view is that not an ounce of raw material for agricultural purposes should be imported from abroad while we are able to produce that raw material at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that question some of us are aware of the fact that the small farmer is doing his job in this country, but that we have all over the Midlands and elsewhere many so-called farmers who do not do their duty to the State but <Col N="856" /> just utilise the right they have to these large farms for the purpose of supplementing their retirement pensions from the British Army or some other service.  Most of them give very little employment.  I remember a couple of years ago a certain commissioner stating publicly in Galway that he was shocked to see that over 100,000 acres of the finest land in the Midlands had passed in recent years into the hands of aliens.  If you go down to the town of Mullingar and go into any of the hotels there you would swear you were in London if you listened to the accents of the residents who live on these farms around Mullingar.</P>
    <P>I therefore suggest that as far as agriculture is concerned we should try and have an agreed policy put into operation.  That will have to come, although my efforts and the efforts of others in regard to this matter have so far borne very little fruit.  I suggest to the different Parties that the public are getting very fed up with the abuse that goes on in this House and the criticism from each side of the other side.  Each of them in turn say that they are the only Party which has a policy for agriculture.  The people have been listening to that for 25 or 30 years.  At the same time we have not got the development or the expansion which is desirable.  Some time, I hope it will be soon, both sides of this House will have to agree on an agricultural policy.  At the moment we have the position that we have a body like the Land Commission set up which is not subject to day-to-day criticism because they have a job to do.  Surely we can do something similar in connection with the most essential of our industries, namely, agriculture, which should be kept free from day-to-day petty Party politics.</P>
    <P>As far as the West of Ireland is concerned, I suggest that it has been neglected.  I do not know whether we will have a change of Government or not, but at least we will have to have our minds clarified in connection with policy in future as so much neglect has been the lot of the people that I represent and that other Deputies from the western seaboard also represent.  I want to know what hope <Col N="857" /> can he held out for people in the rural areas under the terms of this Budget. What hope can be held out for an electoral division where there are 400 holdings in one townland, 300 of these holdings having a valuation of £5 and 48 of them a valuation of £3.  The land which these people have is very poor. There are no factories within 40 miles of the locality.</P>
    <P>What hope is there for these people under the policy which has been outlined by the Government?  All I see given to these people is a few small reliefs.  They get from November and December some work putting a few cartloads of stone on a boreen. Then they get nothing from February until June or July when they may get work for a fortnight clearing a drain at the back of their house or a drain in the bog.  Then they go back on unemployment benefit again.  Nobody could blame young fellows who are reared in this area for flying out of the country as fast as they can.  I suggest to the Government that the parishes in such an area like that should be inspected by Government experts on afforestation, that they should get going in such areas and give a little hope to these people that they will not have to become emigrants.  Some Deputies will argue that they can get work with Bord na Móna.  Of course they will get work for a short period in Bord na Móna, but the bogs Bord na Móna were using in the West are nearly all closed down. Bord na Móna are concentrating on the larger bogs with the big machines, and that means that those young men may have to move 70 or 80 miles and live in digs or in the Bord na Móna hostels.  I see nothing wrong with that, but I see a lot wrong with the rate they will be paid for doing that.  They find it a much better proposition at the present time to go to England.  They will be able to send home more money by going to England and working in some industrial concern than if they were working with Bord na Móna 60 or 70 miles from their own village, and have a better time as well.  We cannot blame them for that either.</P>
    <P>I have said that the Budget to my mind was conservative, made by <Col N="858" /> conservative men.  I believe that it is clear that we must have a new approach.  If the recovery that is talked about in this House is going to take place at the slow rate this Budget would suggest, it is time we packed in.  There will have to be a dynamic approach, and if the different Parties in the field show that they have initiative and courage to put forward a new policy then they will get the support of the public.  I do not know, of course, whether the Opposition are prepared to launch a new policy and have an energetic drive behind that policy.  If they do, then Fianna Fáil will have seen the last of their days as a Government on the one-Party system.  So far we have had very little to go on as far as the policies of the different Parties are concerned, but I feel that at any rate this can be said, that the public are not satisfied with the conditions as they are to-day, and that we are going to have a change of Government. I am not satisfied, and I think many people are not satisfied, that we will be on the right line even then.  I am not going to swallow the suggestion that because the present Government is put out the sun is going to shine 24 hours a day, but this can be said, that there is more room to get things done if we have a change of Government.</P>
    <P>The difficulty that I have seen with the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, and his Party is that they want a blank cheque going into office.  They want to rule the roost and put into operation their policy and nothing else.  They will close the door to co-operation with other Parties, and as long as they pursue that line they will not meet with the success they expect. That viewpoint might have been acceptable, and was acceptable, to the people for 16 years, but they are getting tired of it and they want to see more co-operation in public life to-day; and if that co-operation is not available, if that hand of friendship is not held out by the members of the present Government to other political Parties, then they can expect very little co-operation from those Parties in <Col N="859" /> putting into operation a common policy for the advancement of the nation, and if they do not do it others will do it.</P>
    <P>I will conclude with this suggestion or this remark, that I think it is possible that the coming election we are going to have will be only one of many in the next few years until the people finally clarify their own minds as to what is conservative in this House and what is progressive.  We have on both sides of this House at the moment men with very conservative views and men with progressive views.  There is a general mix-up.  There is a fog there, and I think it will take a couple of elections before they are sorted out, and we have on one side of the House men with a progressive outlook, a progressive policy, not afraid to speak out, and on the other side we can put into their own category those people who are really of a conservative nature and we can see where they stand.  It will take time before that comes into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach treated us to a pretty long speech this morning, and when we sift what he has said we find that the gist of his remarks or his outlook is that what has happened should have happened, and if Fianna Fáil goes back to power again things will be the same as they were for the last three years and, perhaps, a little bit worse.  I gather from his remarks that there is every possibility that the one relief that was given in this Budget, that is, the ½d. on the loaf of bread, on account of the gloomy position of world affairs at the moment that ½d. will have to be taken back again and, perhaps, even the loaf of bread might go up higher than it is at the present time at 9½d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He did not hold out any hope whatever that this country had any kind of a bright outlook before it.  He sought to apologise for what his Government has done, but at the same time made it perfectly clear that that is the road they are going to travel and there will be no bright sunny hours ahead anyhow. We are not to expect them.  In other words, he has put it pretty <Col N="860" /> clearly to the people that if Fianna Fáil are returned to office the next three, four or five years are going to be as black and as gloomy and as austere as the last three years were, and if they do not like that they can put them out and have a change of Government.  I expected that he would at least have got away from the gloomy outlook that this country cannot prosper and that all the time it will be beset with difficulties that just cannot be mastered.</P>
    <P>He has taken up just the very same attitude as the Tánaiste did in Letterkenny in 1947 when he made a prophecy that four of the most difficult years that this country had ever experienced lay ahead.  That was in the month of September 1947.  The Tánaiste then seemed to be steeped in the very same gloomy outlook as the Taoiseach is to-day, and it seems to be part and parcel of the Fianna Fáil policy that there is not one single ray of sunshine in their outlook for this country.  The Tánaiste made one serious miscalculation, or at least it was a pity he had not been gifted with the power of prophecy when he made that speech and ventured that statement in Letterkenny in 1947.  He did not know that there was to be a change of Government the following February, and consequently the fact that the inter-Party Government came into office a few months after he made that statement and completely disproved his gloomy theory&mdash;that instead of four of the most difficult and trying years being ahead, three and a half years of the greatest prosperity that the people of this country ever enjoyed lay ahead instead.</P>
    <P>It seems that they are constantly wearing dark glasses as far as policy is concerned and as far as the outlook of this country is concerned, and those dark glasses that Fianna Fáil wear blind them to the real facts and the real position.  It has had a most adverse effect on this country, particularly during the last three years.  The policy they have pursued has done nothing except to bring privation into every home and poverty into a great number of homes.  That has been the <Col N="861" /> net result of their policy.  They have no explanation to offer of why it was or how it came about that the inter-Party Government was able to do things and get things done and get this country moving along the right road. They seemed to slur over it, and they are trying to make out that this country was actually worse off from 1948 to 1951 than it was from 1951 to the present day.  The people apparently have made up their minds, if we are to take the recent by-elections as an indication, that this country is not the gloomy black pit that Fianna Fáil would have the people believe that it is.  I think the people have made up their minds to have a change of Government.  In so doing they are taking a step in the right direction, because the old out-moded policies that might have been all right 100 or 150 years ago are certainly not the ones for the present day.</P>
    <P>One thing the inter-Party Government did during its three and a half years in office was to prove conclusively, once and for all, that instead of this being a backward poverty-ridden country, it is one of the most prosperous countries in the whole of Europe, in fact in the whole world, if worked and managed in the right way.  Management in the right way implies taxing the people as lightly as possible or at least arranging taxation in such a way that it falls as lightly as possible on the shoulders of the people, and at the same time using that taxation in the proper development of the country, using it in a productive way and not in putting it into stones and mortar on useless buildings that will never pay anything in return. There is no use in raising grand edifices which may be lovely to look at but will never produce anything.  I would like to see our cities and towns, particularly Dublin, provided with as fine buildings as the cities and towns of any other country, but this is a young country that after centuries of oppression got its freedom only 32 years ago and a lot of leeway has to be made up to repair the neglect of centuries.  Until that leeway is made up, I think we should take first things <Col N="862" /> first, the things that really matter and that are reproductive.  These are the things that should get first attention from the Government.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious to anybody that many of the difficulties into which the present Government have run have been created artificially.  The people definitely returned an inter-Party Government at the last election but by some underhand method which has not yet come to light but that will come to light in time, the present Government secured office.  The bulk of the people did not wish the present Government to take office and the fact that they did take office, in spite of them, immediately had the effect of bringing about an estrangement between the people and their Government. The bulk of the people suspected that things could not go right having regard to the way in which the Government grasped office and as a result things began to freeze up.  The Government found themselves in difficulties immediately on taking office because of the fact that they had not the confidence of the bulk of the people.</P>
    <P>Then within about six or eight weeks after taking office the present Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste came out with a series of gloomy statements to the effect that national bankruptcy was round the corner. Subsequently in the month of October, 1951, a few months after the Government had taken office, the announcement of a restriction of credit came as a bolt from the blue from the banks. While the Taoiseach and some of the Ministers have denied that it was on their instructions that the banks followed that policy, I believe, from the experience we had in the inter-Party Government, that the banks, and particularly the Central Bank, will always act in accordance with Government policy.  The Government may not have statutory powers to give a firm direction in certain cases but, nevertheless just, like any judicial or quasijudicial institution within the State, none of the banks will run counter to the wishes of the Government.  After all, it is the Government of the day which is responsible for running the <Col N="863" /> country, and if the Government express a desire that credit should be curbed, the banks will immediately take the hint.  They will take their cue from the Government.  I have not the slightest doubt that if the present Government did not issue very strict instructions they at least said it was their desire that credit should be limited to a very large degree.  Then in 1952 we had the Budget, which increased the price of almost everything.</P>
    <P>The combined effect of these two moves, the restriction of credit and the increase in the cost of commodities, was that small shopkeepers, or people in business in a small way, found themselves virtually paralysed.  They found that it took more capital to replenish their stocks of goods because of the increased costs.  Secondly, when traders went to the banks they found that they would not get the same credit as formerly.  Then their customers, the working people and the farmers, found that because of the increased cost of food and commodities, they could not purchase as freely as they had been accustomed to.  These three factors operated to bring about a worsening of conditions.  Business people found that they needed a greater amount of capital to keep going to replenish their stock.  They next found that their credit was restricted while the third factor was that their customers were deprived of the purchasing power to keep them going.</P>
    <P>The Government is wondering where all the money that was in circulation during the days of the inter-Party Government has gone to.  The answer is that it is frozen; it is tied up.  Those who have a few pounds saved have tied strings round their purses; they are not spending the money, and the net result of the action of the Government in taking office against the wishes of the majority of the people is that the whole life-blood of the country has been frozen in its veins.  That is the position as I see it.  It is a very commonplace way to put it, but in this House I think we should talk of the situation in a plain common-sense manner exactly as we find it.  That is the situation which I saw developing in the <Col N="864" /> first year or 15 months of the present Government taking office, and it has brought home to me in a very clear way the shockingly disastrous results of a Government which has not been put there in a democratic constitutional way by a majority of the people claiming office.  The Government have lost the confidence of the people and the people have no faith in themselves, their Government or the country as a result of the trick that was played upon them.</P>
    <P>One of the rumours which the present Minister for Finance caused to be circulated&mdash;I must give credit to the Taoiseach that he has never lent himself to this particular falsehood&mdash; was that the inter-Party Government left debts behind them.  Once and for all, I would ask the Minister for Finance, now that we are about to hear the swan song of the 14th Dáil, to make some attempt to tell the people what these debts are.  Would he tell us, after three years of the most blistering taxation, how much of these debts he has paid off and how much are to be paid?  These are the things the people should know between now and polling day.  These are questions everyone is asking.</P>
    <P>Another vital question&mdash;and now is the time to answer it&mdash;is: &ldquo;What has become of the £24,000,000 Marshall Aid money which Deputy McGilligan, when Minister for Finance, handed to his successor on 14th June, 1951?&rdquo;  The present Minister for Finance told us he spent it in six or eight months and it was all gone.  To use £24,000,000 in six months is pretty rapid spending. We know how irresponsible Fianna Fáil is, but I did not think it could go to those limits.  I do not believe it could be spent in that time.  We spent about £16,000,000 of the £40,000,000 loan during the three and a half years we were in office and that contributed a certain amount to the prosperity we gave the people during that period.  If the present Government had used the £24,000,000 in the same way&mdash;in other words, if they had carried on our policy&mdash;it would have ensured that the prosperity we gave the people from 1948 to 1951 would be carried on for five years more from that period, and possibly longer than that.  The spending <Col N="865" /> of that money in six months needs answering.  It is not Deputy MacEntee, the present Minister, or any member of this House that will have to find the money; it is the Irish people, as it is the Irish people's money that is being spent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello gave the House certain figures yesterday, to show that during our period of office the net borrowing was in the region of £28,000,000.  That included the borrowings by local authorities.  That is true; that is exactly the figure.  Since the present Government came into office, between borrowing by central Government and by local authorities the figure is gone up £46,000,000.  Most of our borrowing was at 3, 3¼ and 3½ per cent. The present Government started with a loan of £25,000,000 at 5 per cent. and followed it last November with another of £25,000,000, of which about £21,000,000 was at 4½ per cent.  They seem to have a flair for big figures, seeing that they could liquidate £24,000,000 of actual hard cash, so to speak, in six months and go through £46,000,000 of loan inside three years and at the same time squeeze from the people about £30,000,000 in increased taxation, in food, bread, butter, tea, sugar; in clothing to some extent; in petrol and in taxes on mechanically-propelled vehicles of all kinds; in additional charges on telephones, postage and telegraphs.  They have squeezed that £30,000,000 apart from the ordinary inflow of revenue from the usual sources.</P>
    <P>When the Government decided to remove food subsidies, to drive up the price of food, under the 1952 Budget, let me admit to the House that I was foolish enough to think they were going to embark on a development programme the like of which no country had ever seen before.  I thought they were starting a big experiment and wanted £30,000,000 over and above the schemes we had started, for the purpose of national development on a scale hitherto undreamt of in any of the countries of Europe or any country we know of.  We have seen the result. They had no intention whatever of embarking on any huge development scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> A short while ago&mdash;and this is looked on by some as a joke, but it is far too serious for that&mdash;there was a £5,000,000 National Development Fund&mdash;which was promised by the Taoiseach at the time of the by-election in Galway last autumn.  Every county manager and county surveyor in the Twenty-Six Counties was instructed to ask the representatives on the local authority to furnish schemes to spend this £5,000,000.  One of the topmost of the schemes was&mdash; what?  Before I reveal what it was, I would refer to the adjournment debate I had with the Minister for Agriculture who is in the House now, on the provision of a little bit of help to farmers who met with unforeseen losses.  The Minister got very hot under the collar about our asking for that help.  He was inclined to tie up the farmer; he wanted two solvent securities and wanted repayment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy that if he wished to become a security for anyone I would accept him but he was not jumping at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a flippant attitude for the Government to take to a serious problem and that attitude has resulted in the two crushing defeats they sustained recently in by-elections. I quite agree that the people have taken their measure, for what they are, the whole bunch of them, and the people know they are not a fit crowd to have on that side of the House.  A certain amount of humour is all right in its own place, but it should not be used in the case of serious matters affecting our own flesh and blood.  We were sent here to protect their interests and to help them over difficulties&mdash;difficulties that might mean their banishment from the country. The matter should not have been treated in the way the Minister treated it last night.  I asked for a small sum for that purpose.  The Minister hinted that it could be done but he would want two solvent securities, interest payments on the money, and all the rest.  Now, when the county managers, on the instructions of the Custom House or the Minister for Local Government, were asking the members of <Col N="867" /> county councils and other local authorities to furnish schemes to spend this £5,000,000&mdash;the Government had so much money that it was bursting to spend it&mdash;one of the schemes was the erection of concrete walks along river banks.  That is a fact&mdash;the erection of concrete walks along river banks.  But what for?  In what way would that contribute to the wealth of the country?  It is a pleasant thing to walk along a river bank, but if there is a concrete walk&mdash;or let us say a terrazzo walk and go one better&mdash;in what way will that bring wealth to the country? It is a grand place to stroll&mdash;provided you are not feeling dead with the hunger caused by the austerity programme of the Government.</P>
      <P>Then the Minister for Agriculture tells us that farmers whose flocks were wiped out in the blizzard of last February cannot get a single penny.  I wonder which of the two uses would be the better, in the case of the National Development Fund&mdash;erecting concrete walks along river banks or trying to help some of the people on the land, about whose increased production the Minister was boasting the other day.</P>
      <P>The Undeveloped Areas Act was brought in by the present Government. They had so much money that they decided to spend £2,000,000 over seven years on the establishment of factories. Down in Mayo we were promised about 15 factories.  Only one has been realised and, to the eternal credit of the business people of the town in which it was established, Kiltimagh, I say that the factory would have come to where it is to-day even if there were no Undeveloped Areas Act or ever a penny from the Government. We have been promised several others. One of the standing jokes in North and South Mayo, and even into Galway, is the carpet factory that Fianna Fáil Deputies have been peddling from town to town.  I do not know where it is parked now but it has been promised to seven or eight towns in my constituency and to a few in Galway.  That is the Fianna Fáil method of trying to gull the people. People want something much more real than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> The Taoiseach said in his speech that in the towns we were growling about the high cost of living and elsewhere we were saying something else.  Let us go back to the three and a half years we were in office and trying to do our best for the country when we were on that side of the House.  I remember one evening going down through O'Connell Street; the Dáil was sitting and I was going to a hospital to visit a patient there.  It was a fine summer evening and there was a Fianna Fáil speaker holding forth on the corner of Abbey Street to a large crowd.  He spoke of the terrible destruction the inter-Party Government was doing; he said that they were shovelling the Dublin people's money down the country in ground limestone, the relief of rates and all the rest of it.  He dwelt at length on the fact that butter had been increased by 2d. a pound and the dreadful disaster that was.  At the same time we had Deputy Corry and others of the Fianna Fáil Party going around grumbling to the farmers and the present Minister for Agriculture promising the farmers 1/9 and 2/- a gallon for milk.  If that was not political duplicity, will somebody tell me what it was?  One group was trying to incense the people of Dublin while other members of the same Party were trying to incense the country people.  That was the sort of thing we had to meet.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, introduced his land rehabilitation scheme and put it into operation, the first reaction of Fianna Fáil T.D.s and henchmen was to tell the farmers not to have anything to do with it, not to touch it, that it was a dirty, foul trick of the inter-Party Government to increase the valuation of their land and to take more from them in rates.  That was vehemently denied by those on the other side of the House now, but it took place.  That was the constructive co-operation we got from Fianna Fáil when we tried to do our best by the country.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government decided on expansion of the forestry programme and was met with nothing but jeers and abuse from the Fianna Fáil <Col N="869" /> people all over the country.  Fianna Fáil Deputies did their level best to kill that scheme.  They failed utterly and completely because the people realised the advantages of the scheme in the particular areas that were being developed.  I have not the slightest doubt that that scheme will be taken up where it was left off.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have done nothing since they returned to office.  They slaughtered every single forest centre that was established.  I can challenge the Minister for Lands to name a single forest centre which I handed over to him on the 14th June, 1951, in which there has not been a reduction in the number of men employed.  I challenge him to tell me the number of new forest centres that have been established since then.  The Land Commission has been frozen stiff in its tracks.</P>
    <P>I would couple Fianna Fáil policy in regard to the Land Commission with the statement of the Minister for Finance that he expects to get £1,000,000 from C.I.E. this year.  I was amused by Deputy Briscoe's difficulty last night when questioned as to how C.I.E. are to find that £1,000,000.  He read and re-read part of the Minister's speech in a vain effort to find how they will do it.</P>
    <P>If C.I.E. are to contribute £1,000,000 to the Minister for Finance in the coming year, there is only one way in which they can do it.  They have either to cut down the number of their employees or increase bus fares, train fares and freight charges.  That seems to be the policy.  The Minister for Finance seems to be using each Government Department and State body for the purpose of making money. The latest body that he has gathered in as a money-making machine is C.I.E.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission is now being used to acquire farms, particularly in the Midlands, ostensibly for the relief of congestion but in actual fact for the purpose of letting.  It is a pity the Minister for Lands is not in the House because I want to ask him is it a fact that farms that have been in the hands of the Land Commission for three years, and which should have been handed back to the former owners or <Col N="870" /> allotted for the purpose for which the Land Acts allow the Land Commission to acquire land, have been let for the past three years, bringing in £25 an Irish acre?  Is this what the Land Commission has been reduced to by the action of the present Government? The Land Commission is another money-making Department for the present Minister for Finance.  That is the system.</P>
    <P>I have seen advertisements of auctions for farms that have been in the hands of the Land Commission for three and four years and which should have been allotted to migrants from congested areas and local congests and which have been let year after year. I put down parliamentary questions this very week about this matter.  A number of migrants were told to get ready to be moved this spring out of villages that are in a shocking condition of rundale and bad housing. They were told at the last moment that they would not be changed this spring. In my opinion the reason is that the Minister for Finance is making too much money out of the land by letting it on the 11 months' system, and, secondly, because these people's votes would be lost if they were changed at this late hour.  I need not dwell at length on that because the end of that chicanery is very near.</P>
    <P>In the last few days somebody quoted in this House that the rates have risen from about £11,250,000 to £15? million.  That is true.  The reason why rates have risen is the increase in the cost of living, the increase in the cost of food and most raw materials that a local authority must purchase.  A second cause for that increase is the fact that since this Government took office they have adopted the practice of stealing the money out of Pat's pocket and giving it to Tom.  They have done that with regard to expenditure by local authorities by passing measures in this House, some of them, perhaps, good and necessary measures, and placing the cost on the ratepayers. The acid test of the sincerity of a Government in providing beneficial measures for the people is the provision of the necessary money to implement the measure by this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> Rates have gone so high that we are nearing a dangerous burst-up.  Something must be done quickly about that, because even the smallest ratepayers are beginning to feel the pinch, while some of the bigger ratepayers are being slowly and steadily put out of action.</P>
    <P>The Minister opened his Budget speech by saying that the year that has just passed has been one of the most prosperous years in the history of the country.  Many people must have asked themselves, if the Minister thinks that last year was a prosperous year what is his idea of a bad year. That statement showed the Minister's complete irresponsibility and his complete lack of touch with the problems of the ordinary citizen.  Bear in mind that the Minister for Finance has provided reliefs in this Budget to the drink industry to the tune of £350,000. None of that will reach the man who buys his pint or bottle across the counter.  The Minister could only give a miserable insult of ½d. off the price of the 2-lb. loaf of bread and yet he could give £350,000 relief to the drink industry.  It is not clear who will get that relief but this much is certain, it will be either the brewers or the traders.</P>
    <P>The Minister could not see his way to give any relief in respect of the price to the consumer of butter or any other article of food but he was able to find £350,000 for the drink industry&mdash; possibly for some of their friends.  I suppose that is just in keeping with this Government's action two years ago of giving back £140,000 to the dance hall proprietors.  Perhaps these people will subscribe heavily to the Fianna Fáil funds.  Perhaps that is the intention. If it is, I do not blame them.  If I were a member of a body getting £350,000, I should not mind subscribing a little of it to the election funds of the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Quite a lot of talk centred on agriculture.  Deputy McQuillan mentioned that it might be better to leave agriculture to those engaged in it.  It is a pity he did not think of that a little earlier&mdash;at the time he made the statement that farmers did not know how to run <Col N="873" /> their farms or holdings.  The sooner the members of every Party in this House realise that every holding or farm is a potential factory, the better.  I do not see any Deputies inclined to poke their noses into the management of any business, firm or factory in this country and tell them how they should run it.  I do not see why they should treat the farmers of this country in a way they are either ashamed or afraid to treat industrialists.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach dwelt at length on the question of tillage.  His attitude reminded me very forcibly of a man who thinks he is a schoolmaster in a school addressing a lot of children and thinking he knows everything and that the children are there for the purpose of being taught&mdash;the children, in this case, being our farmers.  The Taoiseach spoke about tillage and about the advantages that would flow from increased tillage in this country. The Minister for Agriculture might agree with me when I say that conditions vary according to different districts.  The economic method of running a particular farm or of utilising the land of that farm or holding might yield only very indifferent results on a farm situated in another part of the country or even in a different county.  Not all land is suitable for tillage.  Not all areas in this country, because of climate, are suitable for tillage.  Some areas are suitable for tillage and, also, there are areas where the people there have the technique of tillage.  Obviously, there is no use in asking a man who knows nothing about a particular line of farming to change his whole economy overnight to another system. It would be just like asking a factory to change over, overnight, from the manufacture of, say, textiles to the production of machinery.  It just could not be done.  There is as big a difference as that in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers of this country were driven almost desperate by the agricultural policy pursued by Fianna Fáil up to 1948.  We shall not easily forget the time when Deputy Smith was Minister for Agriculture and when he <Col N="874" /> told the farmers that he would crash through their fences and send in Civic Guards and inspectors to ensure that they were doing their duty.  Of course, the man was mad.  He was as daft as anybody could possibly be. That is the method Russia tried and regretted so bitterly when she found herself in a death struggle with Germany in 1941.  They put the gun to the heads of a section of their people and said: Come, you will do as we say, right or wrong, and in the way we say you will do it.  That is exactly the method that brought this country to the verge of disaster.  The agricultural policy pursued by the inter-Party Government was totally different.  Our policy was to ask for the co-operation of the farmers to increase their production and make the best possible use of their land&mdash;and we gave them all the assistance we possibly could. The beneficial results of that policy have been flowing in from the first day the inter-Party Government implemented it&mdash;from the time they took office in February, 1948, to the present day.  There is one thing on which I want to compliment the present Minister for Agriculture and that is that he did not go back to the insane policy of his Party predecessors, Deputy Smith and Deputy Dr. Ryan.  In my opinion, their policy was closely akin to that of the Lenins and Stalins in Russia and their treatment of the peasant farmers there.  First, they deprived them of their land and then they took their produce because the Russian farmers had adopted a policy of passive resistance&mdash;a policy which in the circumstances they were quite justified in adopting.  Having seized their crops, they sold their grain and said: Let them die by the million by the wayside.  That was the same policy as was pursued by Deputy Smith up to the time of the change of Government in 1948.  Perhaps Fianna Fáil have learned a little bit since then, but it does not matter now because it is too late.  I believe that Fianna Fáil are going out of office now and that a lot of water will flow under the bridges before they are heard of as a Government again.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with a matter <Col N="875" /> the Minister mentioned on page 9 of his Budget speech.  He said that the export of agricultural produce, mainly food, had increased by £32,500,000 since 1951.  It has, yes.  An extra £32,500,000 worth of produce has flowed out of this country since 1951.  Some of that increase in exports has been due to increased production.  I submit, however, that the greater quantity of it is due to the fact that our own people have been deprived of the purchasing power to buy the food produced by our farmers.</P>

      <P>The Minister will not evade the issue by making grand circles such as he is now making with his fingers.  Will the Minister tell us whether or not the sales of margarine in this country have increased?  If the sales of margarine have increased in this country, will the Minister tell us who are the principal purchasers of it? Further, will the Minister tell us what weight of butter is at the present time in cold storage?  Will he tell us what weight of butter is locked up in steel freezing rooms&mdash;butter that can be bought at the rate of 4/2 a lb., butter that hungry people can look at but cannot afford to purchase?  These unfortunate people know that behind <Col N="876" /> that steel wall lie thousands of cwt. of butter.  They know that they can purchase as much of that butter at the rate of 4/2 per lb. as they like, but, unfortunately, they are so poor that they cannot dream of purchasing it and can only look at it.</P>
      <P>Last night he was very keen to interrupt Deputy Dillon to tell him that Government policy was to export more and to import less.  That is exactly what we are doing, and we have carried that policy to such an insane point that not alone are we exporting agricultural produce and importing very little in return, but we are starting to export our boys and girls, never to come back.  It will be a grand country when that policy has reached its climax, when everything movable will have been exported and there will be an immense credit to the benefit of Ireland, a depopulated and denuded Ireland, built up in England and elsewhere with nobody here to enjoy it. That is the policy of the Minister and it is just as daft from a national point of view to follow that policy to extremes as it was for his predecessor, Deputy Smith, to adopt the policy he did in relation to the farmers.</P>
      <P>I want to say clearly and emphatically&mdash;the Minister for Finance can deny it when he is replying, if what I say is wrong&mdash;that a great part of the £32,000,000 worth of food exported this year has been procured, not by increased production&mdash;£4,000,000, £6,000,000, or perhaps £10,000,000 worth may have been secured through increased production, because production on the land has increased beyond yea or nay, due to the land rehabilitation scheme which has restored thousands of acres to production and to the proper management started in our time and which this Government had not the courage or the guts to break, much as they would have liked to do so&mdash;but by denying our own people of the wherewithal to purchase the food produced by our farmers.</P>

Although most of the people living in distant parts have not the opportunity of sitting in the Dáil gallery and watching the antics and the carry-on of this Government, they can sense the situation and they know it.</P>
      <P>Emigration has been discussed at some length and there is nothing to be said about it, except that it has increased to an alarming extent.  The Taoiseach has tried to minimise what has taken place, but anybody who looks at the trains from the West in the period from February up to June next will see them loaded with boys and girls leaving the country, many of whom will never come back.  On the Adjournment last night, I cited the case of a young man who spent almost half a score of years in England for the purpose of getting together a bit of money so that, when his father handed over the holding which had belonged to the family for generations&mdash;a poor, mountainside holding&mdash;he would have money to stock it and to buy the necessary implements to run it.  I asked the Minister to come to his rescue, but the Minister was inclined to treat it as a joke.  Between bursts of laughing and of anger, he showed that he had no conception at all of the plight of that man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is one of tens of thousands who have been forced to emigrate in the hope of being able to save a little money to enable him to buy a home or to settle down in this country, with the expectation, unfortunately false, <Col N="878" /> that the Government of the day would come to his relief and would appreciate what he had done&mdash;travelling to faraway lands to put some money together, not to spend it in the country of his adoption, but to come home and try to improve conditions on the holding which his parents had. We find the Taoiseach trotting off to London on St. Patrick's Day and telling the Irish there to be good and obedient subjects of the ruling powers in the country of their adoption.  That was his solution&mdash;a very big change from the time when the Tánaiste was afraid that there would not be sufficient Irish abroad to bring back to assist in the development of the huge schemes Fianna Fáil had in mind.</P>
    <P>The people have been fooled for a very long time, but there is an end of that now, because a bit of realism is creeping back.  For the past three years the position in this country has been the Alice in Wonderland one of jam to-morrow, and, when to-morrow comes, jam the day after.  We do not believe in that.  We believe that any Government facing the people should give the people a clear indication of what they intend to do.  The Taoiseach has not done that to-day, but no doubt he will come back here after the election, and if there is a hope of scrambling into power by a trick as before, he will repeat that trick of 1951.  The Government should make their policy clear so that the people will know it and will have a chance of supporting the people who give them the policy which they think is the best in the long run for the country.  In the final analysis the people should and must have the last word.  It does not matter what we say; it is what the people think and say that matters in the long run, if democracy here is to be something more than a sham.</P>
    <P>The meaning which I take from the Taoiseach's words about ½d. off the price of the loaf is that that is the best the Government could do, but he has not told us that some of the wild schemes which the Government had in mind are to be cancelled.  He has not told us that the rebuilding of Dublin Castle will be left aside until the <Col N="879" /> country is more prosperous, nor has he told us that he has banished from his thoughts the £11,000,000 project for new Houses of Parliament.  The Minister for Agriculture has not expressed any regrets yet about the purchase of that wonderful racehorse in praise of which he was so loud a year ago.</P>
    <P>There is not a penny to spare for any useful purpose, but, at the same time, the people can see a steady accumulation of spending of huge sums on the daftest proposals&mdash;much the same kind of work through which the Pharaohs of Egypt destroyed their country.  They see no sign of a change and my advice to the people is to go back to the system they can rely on, the system which gave them three and a half years of prosperity and brought the country forward.  I think the people are about to do that and the best thing for Fianna Fáil to do is to retire as gracefully as they can from the scene of the perpetration of such disaster on the people whom they say they love so well.</P>

      <P>We have stabilised the finances of the country.  The Budget is merely a housekeeping affair as far the country is concerned.  Our policy has been&mdash;I hope it will always continue to be&mdash;that current expenditure must be met by current revenue and that we are not going to adopt the spendthrift's idea of borrowing whether from home or abroad and using money in that way for building up a huge debt for posterity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking last night, Deputy Dillon made a very true statement when he said that agriculture is and must continue to be, as far as we can see, the basic industry of this country.  Every other industry, and every other type of employment in this country, is dependent upon agriculture, and it is the duty of a Government, whatever Government is in office, to see that agriculture prospers.  If you have not a prosperous agriculture you cannot <Col N="881" /> afford to have people in industry.  You cannot afford to have huge numbers of civil servants.  You cannot afford to give all the benefits that our sick, infirm and delicate people may be in need of.  You cannot afford to provide benefits for the needy, and you cannot afford to give old age pensions or any of these other things.  We must face facts realistically.</P>
    <P>How can we make agriculture prosperous in this country?  It is by utilising to the fullest extent the 12,000,000 acres we have here.  Are we utilising those 12,000,000 acres to the fullest extent? I suggest we are not.  We are making an effort to do it but there is much room for improvement.  We are still a semi-importing country.  We are importing agricultural commodities that we can well produce at home.  We are sending the money out of the country in order to provide these necessities for us.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that that policy was pursued by the Coalition Government and I will try to demonstrate, as far as I can, how they succeeded in pursuing that policy.  Let us, for instance, take our first requirement&mdash;bread. We have people in this country who say, for no reason except a spiteful one&mdash;they have no evidence to substantiate the statements they made in the past&mdash;that this country is not suitable for the production of wheat.  There is no evidence for that. On the contrary, there is evidence in favour of the production of wheat at home.</P>
    <P>Away back in 1942, Fianna Fáil promoted the production of wheat.  It may have been for a two-fold reason. There was one reason at the time&mdash;a security reason.  It was to ensure that if the necessity arose at any time due to any emergency or to war our people would have an ample supply of bread. There was a second reason.  The farmers, as rural Deputies know, had no cash market for their produce. They had no guaranteed market. There was no guaranteed market that could be given to them.  There were very few markets that could be given to our Irish farmers.  There was one in regard to beet but it covered only a small portion of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> Fianna Fáil embarked on a scheme to enable our farmers to find a guaranteed market&mdash;one in which the price would be guaranteed for the farmers and that was in connection with the production of wheat.  I think the reason was obvious to everyone, as no matter what happened our people should consume bread and must consume bread.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of that they were enabled to have a guaranteed market with a guaranteed price, but there were people&mdash;some of them are still in this House and some are still in the country&mdash;who decried the production of wheat here.  The ex-Minister for Agriculture stated on a number of occasions that he was opposed to it, that the country was unsuitable for producing wheat, and that the flour produced from the Irish wheat was unsuitable for bread.  He even went so far as to say that the bread manufactured from Irish wheat would choke and kill you and that he would not like to be found dead in a field of wheat. That was his attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>He had many followers unfortunately.  It is only within the past two or three years that we succeeded in killing that antipathy to wheat which was fostered by my predecessor in office, Deputy Dillon.  What has that been worth to the country? What has it been worth down through the years to the Irish farmer?  In 1948-49 we imported £8,634,000 worth of wheat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the figures for 1947.  It is hardly necessary because the amount of wheat imported in those years was very small, the reason being that during war-time, as the Deputy will remember, we tried to grow our full requirements of wheat at home. Our acreage of wheat at that time has not been exceeded since 1846, prior to <Col N="883" /> the Famine days.  It is true we had to buy a certain quantity of wheat in order to meet the requirements of our people, but notwithstanding that we came along in 1948-49 and imported over £8,000,000 worth.  I suggest to Deputy O'Leary that he would have been better employed out on the platforms in his own constituency in County Wexford advocating the growing of wheat than coming into this House condemning the growing of wheat.</P>

      <P>I am making these references to agriculture simply because he dealt with it and again because I have been dealing with it.  If the Deputy wants me to go out into other fields I will follow him but I am concentrating on this for the moment. Our Irish farmers were willing, able and conditioned to grow wheat but they got no encouragement.  They were abused when they approached the Minister asking for an increased price to cover their increased charges and increased costs of production. Away back in 1949 he was approached, again in 1950 and in 1951 but his answer was to slam the door.</P>

It dropped from 101 to 100 points between 1950 and 1951.  It went from 100 points in 1951 to 106 in 1952, and if we had the figures for 1953 I expect I could show that it is much higher. However, these figures may be available in time to contradict many of the statements I know will come from the Fine Gael cum Labour platform in the coming election.</P>

    <P>I have been dealing with wheat.  I have pointed out the Opposition's objection to it&mdash;the harm it did to the country and the insecurity and instability it established.  But there is another commodity that can be produced here.  We went to the furthest ends of the earth in order to get maize.  Has that been our policy for the past three years?  It has not. There is again a twofold reason for that.  One reason is that we can produce here a good substitute for maize. We can produce barley and it is to our advantage to stop the imports of maize and to grow more barley.  It has been established in those countries which are our chief competitors in the British market that barley-fed bacon is top quality bacon and maize-fed bacon takes secondary place.  If we are to compete with the Danes and the Dutch our pigs must be fattened on <Col N="886" /> barley or a barley ration.  That was not the policy during 1948 to 1951.  The policy was to import more and more maize.  In the financial year 1950-51 we imported 6,246,000 cwts. of maize costing us £7,700,000.  I wonder what the barley growers would have thought if they realised there was a market of almost £8,000,000 waiting for them. We have two markets that can be guaranteed for the Irish farmer, the wheat market and the barley market.</P>

Last year we produced here between 40,000 and 50,000 tons of barley.  That barley has now been consumed and we have to import feeding-stuffs in order to meet our requirements.

      <P>Unless agriculture is prosperous the country will not be prosperous because so many industries depend on it, large and small.  Not only do industries depend on it, but individuals do also.  Even the civil servants are dependent on it.  There is no doubt that agriculture was depressed during the period of the Coalition Government.  Not only are the farmers and others dependent upon agriculture but so are those engaged in the transport of goods, the employees in C.I.E., the employees in garages, mechanics and fitters all over the country.  The small towns and villages could not exist unless there was a prosperous agriculture.  Impoverished towns and villages mean impoverished cities.  Where would the City of Dublin be if we had not a prosperous agriculture?</P>
      <P>The only way in which this country can become prosperous is by making our farmers prosperous.  What was the attitude of the Coalition during their period in office?  They did not want wheat grown.  They did not want barley grown and they did not want milk produced.  Their attitude from 1948 to 1951 was in direct conflict with increased production.</P>

      <P>In 1946 the first subsidy was given for ground limestone.  It <Col N="888" /> was withdrawn early in 1949.  That scheme was introduced to encourage farmers to use more ground limestone. It was withdrawn despite the protests from the committees of agriculture in certain counties.  During the last three years we have encouraged the greater use of ground limestone and, by doing so, we have succeeded in increasing the volume of agricultural output.  We did the opposite of what the Coalition did.</P>
      <P>When the wheat growers looked for an increased price because of the increased costs of production they were refused by the Coalition Government. The price the Irish farmer got for his wheat in 1951 was the price fixed by Deputy Smith as Minister for Agriculture in October, 1947.  The cost of transport had gone up.  The cost of seed, fertilisers and everything else had gone up in the meantime but there was no compensation to cover that cost going into the farmer's pocket and the agricultural worker was expected to remain a serf on the land.  The Coalition Government of 1948 was not concerned with agriculture; it was concerned possibly with more briefs for the courts.</P>

      <P>That is what many of them are still concerned with.  They are not concerned with agriculture or with the condition of the people engaged in it so long as they can draw sufficient money to keep themselves going.  Wheat was one.  No guaranteed price was made available for barley.  The milk producers of the country had been agitating in 1948 and 1949 for an increased price for milk. What were they told?  This is what they were told: &ldquo;We will give you a five-year plan but the price you must take is 1/- per gallon.&rdquo;  That was the solution offered, 1/- a gallon for five years, and the five years have not yet expired.  What is the price to-day? It is 1/8½ and 1/9 per gallon in wellmanaged creameries.  That was the prophecy and these were the promises that were made.  That was called good forecasting and good administration. The person who was primarily responsible <Col N="889" /> for looking after agriculture at that time had no better solution to offer to our farmers than that they should accept his proposal of 1/- per gallon, even though to-day the price is from 1/8½ to 1/9 per gallon.</P>

      <P>The agricultural workers got their rights from us and were placed on a level with other classes.  In my opinion, they are entitled to be placed on a much higher level than they are on to-day.</P>
      <P>We have heard some Deputies on the opposite side of the House talk about the conditions that have obtained here from 1940 down to the present, with particular reference to 1948.  What were the conditions that obtained then?  We were a neutral country.  We had been preserved from the war.  We were an isolated country and had to make provision for the feeding of our people.  I heard Deputy Blowick talk about our Minister for Agriculture and what he did in 1947 in order to get people to grow wheat&mdash;people who to-day are falling over themselves to grow wheat&mdash;in order that the people of Dublin might not starve.  These self-same people, or many of them, are to-day falling over themselves rushing to the mills to bring out seed wheat to sow it.  I think that any Deputy should be ashamed to stand up in this House and say it was right that the people in our towns and cities who are unable to provide for themselves, should be denied the right of getting sustenance for life.  However, I suppose he will be looked upon as being irresponsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me back to the cattle arrangements that we have now made. Reading the report of last night's debate, it seems to me that there are some Deputies who are just edging for the opportunity to get out on the hustings to misrepresent, as they have done on so many occasions before, the true facts.  The true facts, as far as exports are concerned, are that in 1940, when Britain became engaged in the war, it was found necessary to ration foodstuffs.  Britain then adopted the plan of bulk buying in order to make it simple and easy to distribute food. We came into the picture in so far as we were suppliers of food to that market.  All our sales went through the new Ministry of Food which had been <Col N="891" /> established there.  It was necessary, on our side, to have bulk selling, and, consequently, the Government had to take over an arrangement for the sale of our food exports to the British market.  That meant taking over the sale of beef, mutton, sheep, lambs, cattle&mdash;store and fat&mdash;pigs, bacon, butter and all other agricultural commodities. That system has worked down through the years.  An agreement was made covering it.  Annual prices were fixed with monthly differentials. For example, the Ministry of Food paid higher prices for beef in the months of January, February and March than they paid in the months of July, August and September when English cattle became more plentiful and more of them were coming into the market.</P>
    <P>That arrangement continued until Britain found that the time was ripe to decontrol many of these commodities. Last year, for instance, pork was decontrolled and also eggs.  About the 8th of May next, butter is to be decontrolled, and some time in July meat will be decontrolled.  Our agreement of 1948 was made with the British Ministry of Food, and provided that certain prices would be paid for Irish cattle and for Irish food generally. That agreement was terminated in 1953.  We had talks that particular time.  It was continued until they decided that the time was ripe to decontrol meat.  That time will arrive in July and new arrangements have been made because Britain, under the 1947 Act, has decided to guarantee prices to her own farmers.  These cover all agricultural products&mdash;milk, cereals, mutton, lamb, etc.  Our talks were for the purpose of seeing how we could fit into these arrangements.  At the present time the British Government pays about £325,000,000 in subsidies.  If meat was to be subsidised, with our meat going into the market, then the question was how could we participate, or how could the buyers of our stores participate, in that arrangement because I know it was said that the subsidies were not for export but were mainly designed for the general purpose of helping their own producers at home and not for outside producers. <Col N="892" /> We had our discussions and they were successful, because the British Government has made provision to give a subsidy if a subsidy is necessary on Irish-bred cattle fattened in Britain. They have also given us the right without let or hindrance to go into their markets and get the highest possible price without having to pay a fine for getting in there.  Many Deputies on the opposite benches may not realise that even prior to the last war&mdash;in the 30's&mdash;there was a fine on our cattle coming into Britain.  There has been a fine on cattle all down through the years.  It was 5/- up to 1948; since then it was 4/6, but there is no fine on any of our fat cattle sold in the British market now and the subsidy is payable in so far as that the differential is now on a sliding scale. That is the difference and that is where our talks have been successful.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon talked of the pigs and bacon agreement of 1951 and said this agreement was lasting until 1956.  If Deputy Dillon's agreement of 1951 was now in operation and we were selling to the British Ministry of Food what he states we are selling &mdash;bacon&mdash;it would be of information to our people to know the prices they would be getting for their bacon.  It is remembered, I am sure, by the Deputies opposite&mdash;they know the terms of his agreement&mdash;that their price of bacon was based on the Danish price and their price of pork was 2/6 per score less than the English <Col N="893" /> pork price.  That was the agreement of 1951 which I must say I adjusted in 1952 to the benefit of the Irish pig producer.  But if we were taking Deputy Dillon's agreement on bacon in 1951 the Irish farmer would now be getting for his bacon pigs 170/- per cwt.  He bragged last night that Irish pigs make 236/-.  Well, Deputy Dillon must realise that it was because of the adjustment that we made in 1952 that the Irish pig producer is now enabled to get 236/- and the proof of that can be found here.  As far as the agreement made in 1951 is concerned, I think I should say it was unfortunate that we were unable to export any pork at all and there was not one lb. of pork exported, but last year due to the adjustments that were made we sent out 335,000 cwt. of pork to Britain.  So much for Deputy Dillon's 1951 pig agreement.</P>

      <P>When I came into office in 1951 the price of eggs to the Irish producer was 2/- a dozen.  The cost of maize mash was £34 per ton and the price of eggs was 2/- per dozen. The price of chickens and poultry on the British market was far lower than it is to-day.  But&mdash;and again I am not satisfied that it should be so although unfortunately it is so&mdash;although the price of eggs to-day is only 1/9 to the producer, the price of mash is down to £29 per ton.  In case there might be any misrepresentations regarding this matter of eggs, I might say that we have just gone through an abnormal year.  The flush period usually comes in early spring.  This year it came at the end of the winter and we had the flush period in December.  An abnormal supply came on the market at that time and it would have been bad enough if that abnormal supply was <Col N="894" /> confined to these islands, but it was all over the Continent.  The Dutch had it, the Danes had it and the Germans had it, with the result that instead of having to import eggs into Britain she was almost supplying her full requirements herself.</P>

      <P>The Danes were exporting huge quantities and so were the Dutch.  Rather unfortunately from our point of view, the Danes had a longer-term agreement with Britain than we had.  Their agreement does not expire until next September: ours expired last January.  We had to go into that market even though it is a small market because they supplied themselves with 75 per cent. of their requirements. The other 15 per cent. is supplied between the Dutch, the Danes and ourselves and our contribution represents about 3 per cent.  In a market such as that you need to have very special grading, high quality eggs and so forth, but I must say we have been able to hold our own in the market, and if it were not for that abnormal supply that came on the market our egg producers would be getting about the same price, possibly, as they were getting last year or maybe a little less.  But we have to gear ourselves in the future to hold that market, producing better quality eggs at the cheapest possible price.</P>

      <P>We were working at it all the time while you were at the Rip Van Winkle stage, and the amount of money that we spent on it in any year was greater than the amount spent by Deputy Dillon in his year.  That is surprising for Deputies opposite.  You cannot beat figures no matter how much you dislike them.  It is the money that speaks in this case.  When Deputy Dillon conceived the idea of doing big things he thought he could do them in a big way.  He thought the land of this country could not be reclaimed without the introduction of huge machinery.  When he brought in huge machinery he thought there was only one way to direct these machines and that was from his own office.  After 12 months' experience of that direction I discovered that there was very little progress being made and that any little work which was being done was costing more per acre than the country could afford and I decided I would make a change.  There were 22 or 23 contractors in the country at the time and I am now glad to say that we have between 45 and 50 doing the work that in Deputy Dillon's time cost in the neighbourhood of £60 or more. To-day that same work is being done more efficiently for about half the money.</P>

      <P>That is what we call good business, good administration, whatever our opponents may say about muddlers on this side of the House. However, I will give you a few figures that you can bring home to the hustings.  In 1949-50 the expenditure totalled £228,147 on land reclamation in this country.  In 1950-51, after 12 months' experience and avoiding the pitfalls of 1949-50, it was discovered that we were able to spend £568,666. I am glad to say that, without running this huge machinery in the grandiose <Col N="896" /> way which Deputy Dillon had conceived, we were able to reclaim a far bigger acreage in 1952-53 than Deputy Dillon would have done in ten years at the speed he was going, and we spent in that time on land reclamation the sum of £2,260,000.  Mind you, a lot of it did not go to Fianna Fáil friends.</P>
      <P>I have been watching this reclamation scheme very carefully since I went into office and I say&mdash;not because Deputy Dillon introduced machinery, it was necessary to introduce machinery&mdash;that it was unnecessary for the Department of Agriculture to become the contractors.  If was not necessary for this State to go out and do this type of work while we had good enterprising men in the country who were prepared to earn an honest pound, to do an honest day's work and to get an honest return.  As far as the taxpayer is concerned, he will pay less for work which is as well done as the Department could do it.  For that reason, I got rid of the machinery and I gave it to these contractors, and to-day we are reaping the reward.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned about land reclamation.  It is estimated that we have about 4,000,000 acres needing reclamation.  Deputy Dillon stated at one time when he was introducing the scheme or an expansion of the scheme of land reclamation that it would cost about £10 per acre and that he was earmarking £40,000,000 to be spent over ten years.  He was going to spend £4,000,000 per year.  Unfortunately for him, the most he could spend in any year was £560,000.  I have been trying to devise means of reducing costs and of having the work done more efficiently and I have now discovered that land reclamation as it is designed at present is not able to cater, suitably anyway, for many of the counties and consequently I am introducing a new scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that I was not satisfied that land reclamation as at present designed can be properly applied to every county.  The land varies, and the type of reclamation that might be useful, for instance, in <Col N="898" /> the Midlands might not be useful in the West of Ireland; but I might say this before I go any further, that the area reclaimed under Section A in the year just closed is approximately 77,000 acres, and the acreage dealt with under Section B during the same year is approximately 24,000, making a total in the past 12 months of 101,000 acres of land that we have reclaimed under the two schemes.  That is represented in the sum of money that we have spent.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I had deputations from the various committees regarding this question of land reclamation generally, and I had one in particular from County Leitrim.  Many Deputies know the County Leitrim maybe better than I do.  I have been through it on a few occasions and I can see how difficult it is.  It is not, for instance, a tillage county, and I can see how difficult it is to bring in some of the heavy machinery in there in order that work may be done.  I have therefore decided to introduce a new scheme which will be operated in conjunction with the land reclamation scheme and will, in the initial stages, be confined to the rural districts of Kinlough and Manorhamilton.  Full details of the scheme and the necessary application forms will shortly be available at the land reclamation district office at Carrick-on-Shannon, but for the information of the Dáil I will quote the main provisions of this pilot scheme.</P>
      <P>The area to be dealt with on any one holding under the scheme will be limited to five acres or 25 per cent., whichever is the greater, of the area of agricultural land under old pasture on the holding.  For the purpose of the scheme, a holding will be regarded as all the land in the occupation of the farmer concerned.</P>
      <P>Rush-infested pastures only will be considered for improvement under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Grants will be based on the nature and extent of the work to be done and will represent two-thirds of the approved estimated cost of the necessary works, subject to a maximum grant of £30 per statute acre, including previous grants paid or payable for reclamation work on the area to be treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> The scheme provides for the following types of works:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Drainage:</P>
    <P>This work may include construction or deepening of outfall and open field drains; construction of closed field drains where necessary for tapping springs, intercepting seepage water, etc.; making of surface drains; mole draining or subsoiling.</P>
    <P>(b)  reclamation:</P>
    <P>This work may include removal of scrub, removal of occasional rocks or stones.</P>
    <P>(c)  Fertilisation</P>
    <P>Depending on the lime requirements of the soil and the time of application of the phosphatic fertiliser, the occupier will be required to top-dress the land with 6 cwt. of ground rock phosphate or equivalent of other suitable phosphatic fertiliser and with such quantity of ground limestone as may be necessary.</P>
    <P>(d)  Control of rushes:</P>
    <P>The occupier will be required to control the growth of rushes by such cuttings in two successive years as may be specified by the Minister, or such cuttings and spraying with an approved spray as may be considered necessary by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(e)  Fencing:</P>
    <P>This work will be approved only where it is essential for the maintenance of the improvement to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>In order that an area may qualify for attention under the scheme works under headings (a), (c) and (d) must be deemed by the Minister to be necessary.</P>
    <P>All grants approved under the scheme will be paid in two portions, as follows: The first portion, amounting to the approved grant, less a sum of £2 per acre, will be paid to the occupier when he has carried out all reclamation and drainage work, fencing and the preliminary treatment of rushes as specified by the Minister and has applied such dressings of fertilisers <Col N="900" /> and ground limestone as may be provided for in the specification.</P>
    <P>Where the occupier carries out the control of rushes, utilises the area of land treated for grazing purposes only and manages the area in accordance with good husbandry, the Minister may pay the balance retained at the end of the second summer after the specified dressing of fertilisers was applied to the land.</P>
    <P>The scheme is not designed to include any improvement works which would normally come under any other scheme or any statute.</P>
    <P>Applications must be on the prescribed form and will as far as possible be dealt with in order of receipt.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that as this is a pilot scheme I have decided to confine its operation for the present to the two rural districts to which I have referred.  When, however, experience has been gained of the efficacy of the scheme in achieving the maximum possible return from the type of old pasture to be found in County Leitrim, I propose to give consideration to the question of extending the scheme to other districts in the country where pasture land is generally of somewhat similar type.</P>

If it is proved a success there&mdash;it is only in its experimental stage&mdash;we will be able to extend it to other areas later on.</P>
      <P>During the coming few weeks many of the Deputies in the House will place their own interpretation on policy, and I would like at this stage, in the calmness of this House, that our future policy as far as wheat growing in the country is concerned may be properly understood, and that we would not have the whispering during the campaign that we had in 1951 of such things as compulsory tillage, bury the plough and those things.</P>

      <P>The propagandists for Fine Gael can get moving, but I am not going to leave them the same loophole now even though the whispering campaign has started.  Wheat growing is an established fact in this country. It has an established market and it will have a guaranteed price.  Let that sink into some of the Deputies' brains, that they have no use now getting up on a platform and telling the people that it is Fianna Fáil intention to discontinue wheat growing in this country. There is nothing further from the truth.  It will be continued, and the acreage to be grown will be greater, I think&mdash;I am only estimating now, but we are going to get a greater acreage than what we are going to get in this year of 1954.</P>

But what is their intention? Now is the time that the people and <Col N="902" /> the farmers of this country should know what their intentions are regarding wheat growing.  Are you going to repudiate Deputy James Dillon?  Are you going to repudiate the other Deputies who have stood in behind him last night in his statement here in this House?  He stated: &ldquo;Buy in the cheapest, sell in the dearest.&rdquo;  I finished his phrase for him, and I said. &ldquo;And drive the people off the land.&rdquo; Yes, we can buy cheaper wheat abroad. We can buy cheaper maize or feeding substitute than we can produce here at home; but what about the people who have invested their capital in machinery?  Are their tractors, their equipment, going to be fired into the gaps?</P>
      <P>Remember that the farmers of this country have, in many cases, within the past two or three years invested their live savings in machinery.  We know the attitude of the other side in this House in 1948 when our young officers were demobilised from the Army and advised at the time that turf production was going to continue.  Many of them invested their money in the purchase of lorries.</P>

Is this machinery to be put into the gaps?  Is the growing of wheat to be discontinued? Are they to be given a guaranteed price and a guaranteed market for that wheat?  Let those who are going to speak from the Fine Gael Benches and the Fine Gael platforms tell the people that.  I want to go further and put another question in regard to the price of milk.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>You are not the person to answer.  It is your front benchers who will decide policy.  While I am on the question, let me for a moment draw attention&mdash;it might interest Deputy Hughes, Deputy Giles and a few more of them&mdash;to a memorandum issued by the Irish Trade Union Congress on income-tax.  I propose to quote from paragraph 14.  It goes on to speak about the number of farmers who are not paying income-tax, and paragraph 14 states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;From the figures in the previous paragraph we deduce that the great majority of farmers&mdash;say four-fifths &mdash;are not liable for income-tax, but that a relatively small number are. It would seem that a large number of farmers of holdings 50 acres and over, numbering some 80,000, should be liable for income-tax on the basis of their farm income.  Yet only a minute minority are even assessed for tax.  At a rough estimate the net income of these 80,000 farmers would be around £60,000,000.  Yet in 1952-53 the income brought under the review of the Revenue Department under Schedule B (under <Col N="904" /> which farmers as such are generally assessed) amounted to less than £2,000,000....  If this is so, the present method of assessment under Schedule B could be retained as the basis on the assessable value, taken as twice or three times the P.L.V. instead of the amount of the P.L.V. as at present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Hughes, Deputy Giles or some other people over there subscribe to what is in that memorandum? Remember it has been put forward by one of your Coalitionists, Deputy Larkin.  Are you going to stand behind it?</P>

We on this side of the House do not mulct people for money we are not going to use.  We look at it in a realistic way.  We have stated that in the coming year we are going to spend around £480,000 on the subsidisation of <Col N="905" /> lime deliveries.  That figure is about correct.  It may be information for some Deputies to know that we have been making progress in the distribution of ground limestone.  It has gone now from 75,000 tons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to show the progress that we have been making over the years, we have gone from 280,000 tons delivered in 1952 up to 640,000 tons last year and we believe <Col N="906" /> that we should be able to increase that to 750,000 tons in 1953-54.  It will cost the State in subsidy around £475,000. That is the justification for the reduction in our estimates of £120,000. During the period of three years that we have been in office, we have introduced many other schemes.  It would I am sure be of interest to Deputy Blowick if he were here to know that even though he states our exports have increased in value to the extent of about £32,000,000, which is quite true, that increase is represented in two ways&mdash;an increased price for live stock and in an increase in output.  It might be of interest to Deputy Blowick to know that pre-war we were consuming about 10,000 pigs in this country and to-day that figure has gone up to 17,000.  It may also be of interest to know that we are consuming about 40 lb. of butter per head.</P>

In regard to the cost of living, it has been stated on this side of the House and denied on the opposite side that there has been a reduction in the cost of living.  There has been a reduction in the cost of bacon in the City of Dublin, and there was also butter offered at 3/10 per lb.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question I am not going to reply to because we could have a long debate in this House and outside it on the question of the quality of butter.  I do say this, that the <Col N="907" /> New Zealand butter was of a very fine quality, made from the highest grade milk, because it was all Jersey milk that was used in its manufacture.  I just wanted to reply to Deputy Blowick on that point in passing, that our increase in exports was not due to the fact that our people were consuming less than they were prior to this year. There has been a substantial increase in prices and that has been responsible in no small way for the increase in value.</P>
      <P>Let us have a look at the prices in case the people on the opposite side of the House think they did better for the farmers in 1951 than we are doing now.  The price of prime heifers on the Dublin markets on 4th April, 1951, was from 110/- to 115/- per cwt.  I need only give you that figure.  As regards store cattle, best bullocks were 91/6 to 112/-.  The average ranged about 105/- to 108/-.  Let us get the latest figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>These were 1951 as against 1954.  Prime heifers to-day are 113/- to 138/-, an increase of 23/- to 25/- per cwt.  Store cattle at the last market were making from 115/- to 150/- per cwt.  The bulk of the sales took place around 140/-.  There is the difference in the value of our exports. Not merely have the prices gone up but the volume of output has also increased and with the greater use of lime and fertilisers we will further increase that volume of output.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not to get rid of Fianna Fáil because we have brought the volume of output to a higher level than it has been since 1946 which was the best year that this country has had, when the volume was 113.  It is only 106 yet and I do not know what the figure for this year will <Col N="908" /> be but there will be a substantial increase over the previous year.  We had an abundance of everything during 1953.  I doubt if we will reach that figure of 113 that we had in 1946 and that was never reached at any time during the Coalition period from 1948 to 1951.  The prosperity of this country is dependent on agriculture and agriculture to make progress is dependent on Fianna Fáil.  Let the slogan be: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil for farm and factory&rdquo; when you get out on the hustings.</P>

      <P>More than an hour and a half ago, when the Minister for Agriculture began to speak he opened by referring to the Minister for Finance's statement that last year was the record year in the history of this country.  Then with a slight degree of humility he said the whole credit could not go to the administration; there was a little due to Providence.  If he is to have anything to do with agriculture in the years to come we will have to draw very heavily on the benevolence of Providence.  Imagine the audacity of the man who looking back over the wasted years since 1932 just stopped short saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the prosperity of the country depends upon agriculture and the prosperity of agriculture depends on Fianna Fáil.  He might have said it depended on the Minister for Agriculture but he left before that could be rubbed into him.  The Minister, of course, presented a pitiful spectacle in this House over the last couple of days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government were getting into a difficult position in regard to him and it was a monstrous thing to send him to important negotiations in England. He was untried.  He had never taken part in anything like that before and except for being sent down to a place called Callan, in County Kilkenny, he was never made to face negotiators across a table in a serious matter which was likely to affect conditions in this country for years to come.  They gave him a good guardian, a man whose brazenness was quite likely to <Col N="909" /> make up for any incoherence the Minister for Agriculture might show and it would have been a public insult, when agricultural matters were being discussed, to leave him out of the negotiations.  But surely he should have been able at least to have some appreciation of what was going on around the table at which he sat.  It is awkward for the Government that he was left to give the explanation of what happened at the negotiations which he attended instead of having the brazenness of the Tánaiste to gild the picture.  He did not know whether he made an agreement, whether there was an arrangement or whether he had a guarantee and he does not yet know. He merely quoted something that was said to some group of agriculturists in England and this is the best proof he could get of what the English understand of what himself and the Tánaiste did.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister for Finance did not put a tooth in it.  It was an agreement that would clear away all the uncertainty in regard to the price of cattle for years to come.  The Minister for Agriculture wonders about the 1948 agreement, whether the change that was made by Deputy Dillon in 1951 still lasted.  The <i>Irish Press</i> knows, because in their issue of 15th April the Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, is reported as saying, in a prepared statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The fundamentals of the agreement (of 1948) will be preserved so that the Irish pig producer should be in the same position in relation to the British pig producer as he has been hitherto.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture welcomes the thought of an election contest, a contest where the odds are freely being given and where three Ministers and a brace of Parliamentary Secretaries will bite the dust.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a bold man for Kilkenny, one of the very doubtful seats, to say that he welcomes the contest. Let us hope that he will talk on the hustings in the mood which he displayed to-day.  I am convinced that the more Fianna Fáil will have the audacity off platforms to say what the <Col N="910" /> Minister for Finance said here in the last couple of days&mdash;that this country had had a record year, that we are really overcome with prosperity, that there is every sign and index of prosperity&mdash;and the more that is said to people who in their own homes know that the exact opposite has happened, the more will there be the rage of disillusioned, disappointed and exasperated people overflowing against the folk who, for three snatched years of their kept support, have worked such havoc on the good situation left to them in 1951.  In particular, if the Minister for Agriculture decides to quote from the Trade Union Congress Report there will be at least people to remind him that the Minister for Finance, his colleague, last year lamented that taxation pressed so lightly on the land that there was little scope for stimulus under that head and to tell him about the leader of the Party in the Seanad who authorised the policy of a £10 fine on every beast that went out of the country.  If he gets the farming vote after that, the power of deception is something greater than it has been up to date.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spent some 100 minutes between last night and to-day lamenting about the fate of this country.  The arguments that he used, incoherently phrased, were such as would insult the intelligence of an imbecile.  Part of his efforts were to hide the revelation of the results of his own policy of 1952.  I said before that there was a phrase used by an English Labour Member of Parliament about the Conservative Government policy in England.</P>
    <P>He described it as &ldquo;a half-witted policy carried through in a hamhanded fashion.&rdquo;  Is there any better description than that of the policy inaugurated here by the Budget of 1952, prepared for over the months of 1951?</P>
    <P>We warned the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in that year of what was ahead.  We assured him, and we gave him the proofs, that we had built up a situation from which prosperity was likely to emerge and we warned him of the inevitable results of the policy that we saw they were setting <Col N="911" /> themselves to, a policy of taxation, a policy of slowing down trade and business, a policy of credit restriction and all that policy being built upon the lament of the Minister for Finance in 1952 that people were too well off, that the increase in their savings and emoluments over the years had been something bigger than what had been the increase in the cost of living since 1939.  It was, as I described it on another occasion, a policy of the old Standstill Orders but, for the future, it was to operate through taxes, leaving so little money in the people's pockets that they could not buy.  That was the equivalent of the old Standstill Orders restricting any increase in wages or salaries, so ruthlessly and so effectively used against the people during the war years.</P>
    <P>We know that the Minister for Justice lamented at a later stage about the increased emoluments that came in our time to various people.  He spoke of the increase given to the civil servants.  He said that no doubt that would have to be developed out over the Guards, the Army, the teachers, that the officials of local authorities would like to get their share too and would naturally get the same standard and that workers all over the country would get this increase in wages. Having made that gloomy prophecy&mdash; gloomy from his angle&mdash;he then said that this was what Fianna Fáil were determined to prevent and they would have prevented it if the six seats lost in 1948 to the Government had only been secured for them.</P>
    <P>We have the same mood still prevalent. We are told that if this is to be made a bread and butter election, as described by a Fianna Fáil organiser, it would mean that the Irish people had become a nation of whingers and crawlers&mdash;whingers and crawlers because they ask to get some improvement in their standard of living, and that whatever standard they had achieved since 1939 would not be destroyed as it was destroyed in the Budget of 1952.</P>
    <P>When we left office we were told about the disagreeable situation that the Government found revealed to themselves behind the scenes.  We <Col N="912" /> were told that this country had not been making any progress.  We warned them that that was not painting the picture fairly or truly.  We told them that they were doing their best to stop the drive towards production and the impetus towards production that had been started in our time.  We warned them of the results which we said were inevitable if one and the same Budget tried to increase taxes on the things that people buy and increase taxes further on the things we felt they would continue to buy, so that they would have less money in their pockets to spend on the ordinary things sold across the counters of the country, and if to that you had added the obvious and persistent restriction of bank credit through the country, known to the Government and approved of by the Government.</P>
    <P>We felt there was clearly a taking of the wrong road, the road that led to stagnation in the country, as there has been stagnation for a couple of years back.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Taoiseach's efforts were directed to another end, and it is the more important.  I do not believe that this election is going to be won entirely on the fact that the people have been bled so badly as they have been by the 1952 taxes, continuing over 1952, 1953 and, with very slight remission, in the coming year. There is now happening a definite swing of political allegiance.  When General Eisenhower won the Presidential Election in America for a particular Party the question that was posed by some of the commentators in America was as to whether the Republican victory of 1952 was an isolated interruption of Democratic predominance or a decisive shift, valid perhaps for a generation, of political loyalties.</P>
    <P>The same test and the same question lie ahead for decision in this election. In fact, it has been decided.  Ninteen-hundred and forty-seven had three by-elections and there definitely, for the first time, was shown this shift of political allegiance, a break-up of a Party that had ruled this country since 1932, and when the Taoiseach, seeing the tide running against him and feeling that he might still secure something <Col N="913" /> in the way of a majority, stepped into an election in 1948, that shift was more pronounced still and, in 1951, the pattern that was developed over the 1947 by-elections and the General Election of 1948, was still there.  But, that pattern was not clearly shown to the country because four or five people, elected for particular views and policies, swung over to the Government for their own personal, selfish aims and kept in power for three years a Government that had not the sympathy of the people behind it.  The Government know that that pattern will be developed still more in the election that is ahead and we will definitely see, not an isolated interruption of Party rule since 1932, but a definite swing of political loyalties that will certainly last for the best part of the coming generation.</P>
    <P>Why is that switch taking place?  I think it is not because of the taxes.  The taxes are heavy.  The taxes infuriate people who are not at all convinced that efficient management and administration of the country could not have kept these taxes at a lower point but that is not what, to my mind, is causing the main swing in the country.</P>
    <P>The people are now able to review events in this country since 1932. Where before, when Fianna Fáil were here in power over the years up to 1947, it was possible to put forward Party policies and Party programmes and not so easy to get conviction&mdash; not about their worth but about whether they were practicable&mdash;the chance came in 1948.  The people have now a comparison between what was done from 1932 to 1947 and what was accomplished even in the three short years from 1948 to 1951.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke of all the capital development and he spoke of the years over which that had been brought about.  He spoke of the moneys that had been collected and spent on what he called &ldquo;the betterment of the country&rdquo;.  There was a 15-year programme.  In this year, 1954, the Louth by-election took place.  The Taoiseach, who thinks he developed this country over those early 15 years in office, begged the farmers in County Louth to support his Government, <Col N="914" /> saying: &ldquo;We intend to continue the policy that we have only just begun &mdash;the real drive to bring up agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the same time as the Louth by-election there was also a by-election in Cork.  The Taoiseach's Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lynch. took a meeting before a group of accountants in Cork City.  He spoke of the fears which the business community in Cork had with regard to the money spent on what was described as capital development over the years. The phrase was: &ldquo;But our resources were left so undeveloped, our people so badly housed and hospitalised that I think the Government can justify its capital programme of over £30,000,000 a year to tap our water and fuel resources for electricity; to develop our roads and harbours, and, more important, to provide houses, schools and hospitals for our people.&rdquo;  Then he added: &ldquo;We had far too much leeway to make up to tackle these problems in a timorous manner.  In any case, they are a <i>sine qua non</i> of any progress....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why was the real drive in agriculture postponed until 1954?  Over what number of years did this leeway develop&mdash;this leeway that Deputy Lynch thinks we should not be timid about attacking in 1954?</P>
    <P>In any event, we know what was intended.  The Minister spoke as follows, on page 16 of this typescript, of the Capital Budget:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Long-term schemes of national development will again require capital funds on a substantial scale this year.  To complete the programme which the Oireachtas has authorised for the E.S.B. and for Bord na Móna will take about seven years; and a special building programme for national schools will be spread over about ten.  For some time ahead, also, provision must continue to be made by the Exchequer for new and improved hospital buildings as, despite an increasing income from the sweepstakes, the resources of the Hospitals' Trust Fund cannot finance all the new works.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> He spoke of the difference between Dublin and Cork and other areas in respect of housing.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In most areas local authority housing needs are likely to be satisfied within the next five to six years, but in Dublin and Cork the programme of housing is still heavy and will require time and a great deal of money to carry out.  Further investment in land reclamation, forestry, civil aviation and other public enterprises will be called for over the years; and other items, now unforeseen, and contingent liabilities in respect of underwriting will almost certainly make demands upon the capital budgets of future years. Eventually there should be a decline in State capital expenditure and a corresponding slowing down of the rate of increase in the national debt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why were those words not spoken in 1932?  Were these problems not there in 1932?  Why were they left for a Budget in 1954?  These questions are very pertinent, particularly when the Minister, on page 22, comes to the result of this capital development:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The fruits of this capital investment are already appearing in the development of native fuel and power, in better roads and communications, in new houses in their thousands to replace unsuitable dwellings, improved amenities in the home and in farm and factory, modern schools and hospitals and more employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On page 23 of the typescript, the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...and so the State, acting for the community, is called upon to provide the fundamental requirements for economic progress&mdash;such as adequate power supplies, efficient transport by road and rail, encouragement, advice and assistance to farmers and manufacturers....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the programme.  There is the result to be expected.  There are the requirements that progress in industry and agriculture demands should be made&mdash;and that is all the year <Col N="916" /> 1954, 22 years after Fianna Fáil first got control of this country with its undeveloped resources.  We had been told the Government did certain things.  The Taoiseach, at the end of his lugubrious oration to-day, lamented that emigration and unemployment was still a problem.  I am tired repeating in this House those words of his which got him into power in 1932.  Let me repeat now, from columns 851-2 of the Official Report, Volume 143, No. 5, what I told this House on the 25th November, 1953:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Taoiseach at the 1929 Ard Fheis of Fianna Fáil gave his views in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>`The more I consider this problem, the more convinced I become that the problem of unemployment in Ireland is quite capable of solution and the more certain I feel that it was a crime against the unemployed and against the nation to leave it unsolved.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>His present Tánaiste&mdash;then, as now, the great maker of promises&mdash;had plans for the development of employment on which he wrote in a paper called <i>The Nation.</i>  I am quoting again from column 852 and repeating what I said on that occasion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Industry and Commerce, now the Tánaiste, wrote of the great plans in <i>The Nation.</i>  In one copy, dated March 1st, 1930, he detailed the Party's great plan for unemployment, and he said: `Of course there is no reason why unemployment should exist at all in this country and it is not unlikely that after some time the necessity for the Fianna Fáil plan will not arise'.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Emigration was also mentioned by both the Taoiseach <Col N="917" /> and the Tánaiste.  As far as the Taoiseach is concerned, he described this country as one of the unfortunate countries in the world&mdash;a country where mothers reared their children for export.  At New York, he lamented and grieved at the swarms of people leaving the shores of this country. When asked about preventing it, he said it was cruel British policy that had caused it.  He said that no country in the world, more than this country, had the remedy against emigration staring it in the face and that all that had to be done was to take that remedy and get the effect.  Now, in 1954, emigration is still a problem and unemployment is something for which, he confesses to-day, he has not found an answer.  The Taoiseach's main anxiety about emigration to-day is not the stoppage of it, not the getting of plans or the investigation even of the causes to see whether there is a plan to bring it to an end: he is anxious to get the figures, to know how many people are emigrating from the country.  Apparently he has no trouble about the figures for unemployment.</P>
      <P>Let us remember that the Party who got in in 1932 on promises to reduce taxation, to do away with unemployment and to call back the emigrants to fill the jobs which were going to multiply here at home, carried an average of 80,000 unemployed people over all the years and emigrated 500,000 of our people in their 15 years. I made the calculation before that, on one of our census returns, those 500,000 people represented the entire population, men, women and children, of all the counties comprised in Connacht.  The people who started with their plans and the remedies that were staring us in the face, who thought emigration and unemployment could be done away with almost overnight, have thrown away from this country 500,000 people out of a population that stands now around the 2,900,000 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They did say that they spent money. I made a calculation with regard to their capital development programme before.  They were in office from 1932 to 1947, and, when they left in 1947, they left £10,000,000 worth of debts <Col N="918" /> behind them, debts that were mainly Budget deficits over the years.  In that period of 15 years, they looked to the people for loans.  They sought to get £21,000,000 and they got from the people £13,750,000.  Let us say that they saw the necessity for spending £21,000,000 on what could be called capital development.  It is about £1,300,000 per year over 15 years, and how did they spend it?</P>
    <P>The below-the-line services which the Taoiseach said really encompassed everything of their capital development programme for many years until they came back in 1951 have been analysed. Year by year, the items that appeared in this below-the-line effort were the two items of electricity and the telephone and telegraph service.  There was no increase that was worth anything in their early years.  I do not regard the telephone service as any special aid to productivity in the country. Electricity was, or could have been made so, but all that was done by Fianna Fáil in their early years was simply to give in respect of what is called a below-the-line service the amount of money which the Electricity Supply Board required for its year-to-year progress in the way of development.</P>
    <P>The Road Fund became one of these objects of borrowed moneys, but it was 1936-1937 before the Local Loans Fund made it first appearance as a service below the line.  The moneys which go into that fund generally are paid out for housing and public health services, but apparently, for four or five years, Fianna Fáil had no conception of these as anything that should be done in the way of development.  Aviation, which is now so much boosted by Fianna Fáil, made its appearance in 1939-40, and tourism attracted the attentions of this type of service in 1943-44.  The matters so much boosted by Fianna Fáil, turf and the development of the bog lands of the country, made their appearance as a service to be financed in this way in 1946-47, and then to an extent of £400,000.  That was the development from 1932 to 1947&mdash;15 years at £1,250,000 a year, on developments of the type I speak of.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach to-day said that the Shannon had been taken over by them <Col N="919" /> and that they had developed the Shannon.  When did they develop anything in relation to electricity in the country?  The Shannon remained the sole project until the war was about to break out and then there was rushed into this House legislation which was not aimed, either immediately or primarily, at electricity development.  There was the Liffey scheme which is mainly a scheme to provide Dublin with a better reservoir and a better supply of water, but there was some drain off into electricity development and even that was impeded by the fact that it was delayed and became more costly after the war had broken out.  The Erne was a scheme of post-war development and the other schemes that are added together are, of course, all later than the Erne.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke about rural electrification here recently and he gave certain figures.  There was a ceremony at a co-operative creamery in Ballinamult on 1st March of this year and the papers of 2nd March record certain remarks of that Minister at the ceremony. Let me get this into perspective. When the project for the harnessing of the Shannon was brought forward first by the German firm, Siemens Schuckert, they devoted a special chapter to the needs of the rural community in respect of electricity.  They gave statistics to show how backward this country was compared with other countries in regard to that development and they warned that it must come, although they said in those days that it was not a necessary part of the hydro-electrification scheme they had brought forward.  As Deputies, no doubt, know that scheme was submitted to the censorship of four experts of European reputation who wrote a report following the project, chapter by chapter, in the developments that were forecast and speaking of rural electrification, they said that this State had better prepare for it.  They said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In all civilised countries, the electrification of the agricultural districts is regarded as a desirable object.&rdquo;</P>

      <Col N="920" /> Taking up the Siemens Schuckert statistics, they said that we were in those days, 1927, 25 years behind other parts of the Continent, which they thought were comparable in conditions with this country in respect of the development of electricity.</P>
    <P>The electrification of the rural areas was mentioned for the first time in 1945 and it was the result of a report brought forward by certain of the technicians of the board.  At this ceremony of switching on of electricity to the co-operative creamery at Ballinamult, the Tánaiste said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The rural electrification scheme was going to cost a great deal more than they had anticipated originally in 1943.  When the necessary legislation was passed, they were merely guessing how the post-war price level would relate to the pre-war level.  On the basis of pre-war prices, it was estimated that the whole project would involve an investment of £14,000,000.  The present estimate was that it would cost £40,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, one may inquire why was the electrification of the rural areas postponed until 1945, and why were steps not taken earlier to carry it through when the costing of £14,000,000 might have been the proper sum?  Is it a proper conclusion that the delay in moving, where there was a demand and where a supply could be given, is costing the nation the difference between the estimated figure of £14,000,000 and the £40,000,000 which is now the Estimate?</P>
    <P>I said that the Taoiseach's efforts to show development had taken place in the early period of Fianna Fáil was the argument that was most definitely exploded.  People are now cognisant of the fact that there are undeveloped resources in this country.  People have the comparison to make with the progress that was made from 1948 to 1951.  They know the spurt, the jump forward and the impetus that was given in those years.  They see now the frantic efforts of the Government to try and make up for the leeway that developed over the earlier period. Now there is a great rush to borrow.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance does not <Col N="921" /> say in his Budget statement what is required in the coming year.  My calculation is that there will be about £20,000,000 at the minimum required even if the other funds give the same aid as before.  £24,000,000 is the figure put in for the previous year.  The Minister spent £26,000,000 which he was left as the proceeds of the Grant Counterpart Fund in the first six or seven months of his period; £24,000,000 to £26,000,000 of American money; the loan he floated at 5 per cent., the £24,000,000 loan which was partly successful and the £20,000,000 that is ahead.  What rate did he get this money for?  The <i>Statistical Abstract</i> gives certain figures quoted by Deputy Costello here yesterday.</P>
    <P>In our time we borrowed about £28,000,000 on an average interest rate of 3 per cent.  The present Government's borrowings are very much higher than that.  The average is 5 per cent.  If one takes what has to be paid to repay and remunerate these moneys while they were out, we imposed on the community service for interest charges of about £850,000 per year.  The present Government's rush to borrow at this extravagant rate will impose a burden of £3,200,000 every year for 20 years.</P>
    <P>We questioned this matter over and over again.  We asked what rate of interest is likely to be paid.  We were told that the Government found it impossible to get money at less than 5 per cent. the year that interest rate was fixed.  That was the highest borrowing rate in modern times that had been imposed on the community. It put us not where we used to be on the same level as members in the British community.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of foreign countries had no better credit arrangement than ours and their rates of interest compared favourably with ours.  We dropped to the 5 per cent. level or raised it to the 5 per cent. level for the investor, a rate that could only be compared in those years with a few municipalities of no great credit-worthiness.</P>
    <P>Last year we asked what the rate of interest was.  The question remains unanswered <Col N="922" /> but it will have to be put again until the curtain can be raised and an answer given.  Did the banks get 5 per cent. for the £5,000,000 they were going to loan the Government and, if so, is there any justification for that rate of interest?  It is expected that they demanded and got the full rate of interest.  The interest will be given to them as if they were ordinary investors.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget statement speaks of the wholehearted co-operation of the commercial banks in respect of productive schemes and particularly those in respect of fertilisers and ground limestone and the Department of Agriculture advertised his victory in the note he published after the bargain had been entered into.  The scheme is this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Agriculture wishes to announce a new scheme of loans for the purchase of fertilisers and ground limestone.  The following conditions shall apply to the scheme:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  The minimum loan shall be £10;</P>
    <P>(ii)  interest shall be at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum and the loan shall be repayable in full with interest within 12 months of issue;</P>
    <P>(iii)  there shall be no fees in connection with the loan other than the rate of interest.  One solvent surety shall be required.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The two footnotes indicate the mind of the Government in this matter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  The Government has been assured by the banks that credit-worthy merchants will be facilitated in obtaining accommodation for trade in fertilisers and ground limestone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last night, Deputy Dillon referred to that.  It was shameless of the Ministers to parade this.  It is still worse when the Minister for Finance in his important financial statement says that the wholehearted co-operation of the commercial banks was assured in this matter.  Co-operation amounts to the fact that a credit-worthy person would be given credit.  Time was when we <Col N="923" /> used to have that phrase bandied about this House and when people were complaining of the banks restricting credit in different ways.  I am not now speaking of the past three years but of ten or 15 years ago.  The answer used to come glibly from whatever Minister might be there that he had been assured by the banks, and he accepted it, that no credit-worthy scheme had ever been turned down. Immediately the question occurred as to what was a credit-worthy scheme in the minds of the banks, and when you analysed the matter you found there were special conditions attached to loans even for productive purposes. The phrase occurs again in this announcement: &ldquo;Credit-worthy merchants will be facilitated in obtaining accommodation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon asked last night, what does that mean?  If a person is worthy of credit is it not the function or business of the banks to supply credit on terms?  What is the enthusiasm generated over this thing? Why should the Minister speak one complimentary word about assuring the people of the wholehearted co-operation of the commercial banks in this matter?  The banks are going to do business, the business they were set up to do and they will give credit to credit-worthy merchants.  It does not even say that.  It says: &ldquo;Credit-worthy merchants will be facilitated in obtaining accommodation for trade in fertilisers and ground limestone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The second footnote is still more scandalous.  This is part of the advertisement from the Department of Agriculture:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Farmers who have money on deposit in Irish banks may obtain loans on the security of their deposits at a rate of interest of 1 per cent. above deposit rate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This, I am sure, is also part of the wholehearted co-operation of the commercial banks in this scheme aimed at productivity.  Let us think calmly over what that means.  Suppose a farmer has £1,000 and is foolish enough to put it on deposit in a bank, what would he get nowadays?  Would he even get a <Col N="924" /> half per cent.?  What does he do when he wants accommodation on the security of his deposits?  The banks are kind enough to say: &ldquo;We have £1,000 of yours; we will lend you £1,000 at 1½ per cent.&rdquo;  They have his money or its equivalent, and knowing that they are prepared to give the farmer a loan on the security of that deposit and charge 1 per cent. above whatever the deposit was bringing in to the farmer.</P>
    <P>Supposing 1,000 farmers were each wealthy enough to have £1,000 on deposit&mdash;that is £1,000,000&mdash;and suppose it is in the same bank.  Under the scheme on which banking finance works, the banks can lend £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 on that.  They have £1,000,000 from the farmers and on that they are going to draw in 1 per cent. over and above what they are paying.  They will get, say, £10,000 on that.  On the other £9,000,000, if they lend it at the ordinary bank rate of 5 per cent. they will get in £450,000. That makes £460,000 by way of interest on the deposits of the 1,000 farmers. The Government thinks that the banks ought to be thanked and complimented for their wholehearted co-operation in allowing farmers to get accommodation on the security of their own deposits at this interest rate of 1 per cent. only above the deposit rate.</P>
    <P>We have asked over and over again what is the attitude of the Government towards the savings of this country. Do they know what the current savings are?  We have heard so much around this House, even from people who do not understand the phrases they are mouthing, about the country meeting expenses on the capital side out of current savings.  Has anyone estimated precisely what the current savings are? Are the savings that are clearly savings and are put in banks on deposits&mdash; are they calculated as savings?  Are the moneys put into the banks in such a way that those who deposit may get their moneys back quicker&mdash;are they counted as savings?  What part of the savings go to finance industry and agriculture that is competing with the products of our industry and agriculture? What is the financial system adopted in the country in which we sink so much of our money?  Do the <Col N="925" /> English Government modify their demands with regard to capital or any other expenditure according to what they call the current savings of the community?  When they go looking for loans, do they pay 5 per cent. for moneys they ask from the community? How many tens of thousands of pounds are at present on loan to the English Government in what are phrased to be a short term type of accommodation, short term being added to short term, mounting up in the end to a long term loan?  We apparently think it is good finance to allow the moneys of our community to be sent to England and used in that way.  We have not the courage or the confidence in our financial institutions to make them adopt at home the system which we foster by sending our moneys abroad to England.</P>
    <P>The Minister's current Budget has to be examined.  He opens with nine or ten pages of phrases, all indicative of prosperity.  He says it was one of the most prosperous years in the nation's history, that there was progress in industry and agriculture, that there were increased trade and higher incomes. He says the cost of living fell and that the addition to the country's wealth was the greatest on record.  He says there was a combination of higher output and stable prices, which obviously signifies a rise in living standards.  He says it is proof of the capacity of Irish economy to recover external solvency and internal financial stability without sacrifice of living standards, which is a proof of the soundness of the policy of producing more and saving more as a condition of national progress.  We have the establishment of the National Development Fund for projects which in the normal course would not be commenced for some years.</P>
    <P>The Minister says we have an increased national income not only in money but in real terms.  He speaks of the growth of trade and the general expansion of activity over the period being reflected in the rise in bank debits, which were almost 9 per cent. higher than in 1952.  We have a reference to the satisfactory response by the public to the national loan floated in October last.  We have then this commendation of the banks for making <Col N="926" /> available to farmers credit for the purchase of fertilisers and we are told how the co-operation of the commercial banks was readily secured and a special scheme inaugurated.  We find that the gross output in money value per male worker increased from £285 in 1950 to about £400 in 1953, which would be about 40 per cent. higher than the 1950 figure.  The Minister says that the index of the volume of production was 11.2 per cent. higher than in the December quarter of 1952.  There is comment again on the downward tendency in the general price level, and there is the statement that the average earnings of industrial workers have increased by a particular percentage. Our total trade was the highest ever, our increased exports have arisen from an expansion of home production and that made possible a substantial increase in imports.  The Minister says we have evidence of the improvement in living standards, without impairment of our internal or external balance.  We come in the end to this magnificent tot of our exports rising by £32,000,000 higher than the 1951 figure, due to greater volume in the main and not to any movement with regard to prices.  Then we are told that the recent negotiations of the Tánaiste and the Minister for Agriculture were successful in the cattle matter and removed much of the uncertainty as to the course of cattle prices after the British meat market was decontrolled.  The Minister says that the agreement which was reached assures to Irish live stock the benefit of full British market prices and provides our farmers with certain safeguards.</P>
    <P>All that then is reflected&mdash;how?  In the end the Minister is able to knock a ½d. off the loaf and give certain minor reductions by way of income-tax allowances.  If that picture were true, if we had increased trade, greater productivity in industry and agriculture, increases in living standards, decreases in prices so that workers' wages were worth more than ever before, that would be reflected in the revenue returns.  The revenue forecast as set out in the White Paper is that next year in what is called tax revenue there may be an improvement <Col N="927" /> of £1.8 million, £.4 million from estate duties and £1.2 million from the product of income-tax, including surtax, corporation profits tax, etc. Another increase that is forecast occurs in the telephone service, which is the result of an extra tax.  There is the interest on Exchequer advances, which certainly does not in itself mean that there is any increased prosperity in the country, and also the miscellaneous item which brings in about £250,000 extra.  There is no reflection there of the improvement that the Minister has spoken of in these figures. There are certain things that tell against them.</P>
    <P>In Donegal in a recent issue of a paper there was recorded a discussion of the striking of the rate for the year. It was the earliest of the discussions on the new rate that I have picked from the newspapers.  It set the tone for the rest.  There were lamentations about the increase in the rate, but in Donegal a note was struck and that was sounded again in county councils, one after another, down through the country.</P>
    <P>One councillor, while objecting to a very heavy increase in the rates in Donegal, said that the amount paid in home assistance was a barometer of the times, depending upon the amount of misfortune in the country.  He said he could not lend himself for a second to the thought of cutting the demand for home assistance.  A barometer of the times depending on the amount of misfortune in the county!  A large increase has been requested in County Donegal for home assistance.  That is reflected all over the country.  In Dublin, where there are all these increased earnings, better productivity, higher trade and everything else to make a difference, the board of assistance estimate is up by no less a sum than £137,000.  If that is a barometer of misfortune and a test of times in the county, it certainly does not bear out the phrase used by the Minister for Finance in relation to the prosperity that he alleges exists in the country.</P>

      <P>How will the Minister take this ½d. of the loaf?  He says he will save money on the Army.  I have here the statement he made with regard to the Army in his Budget speech of May, 1953.  He spoke about the despair of the Government coming into office and finding the Army so impoverished as far as equipment was concerned.  He said that the Defence Force in its numerical strength must be kept up to date in its armaments. At column 1205 of Volume 138 of the Official Report he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government is concerned above all to preserve the independence of our people.  Under no circumstances will it seek to economise or improve budgetary appearances by shirking its duty to provide for the nation's defence...  A substantial part must be accepted as an immediate obligation, since the defensive equipment, is required primarily to place us, who live and breathe at this moment, in a position to defend ourselves and our liberties. It is true that, defending those liberties and preserving them, we shall pass them on to succeeding generations, but it is we, and not the unborn, who are directly concerned that in this our day these precious things should not be taken from us.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This year we can jettison these precious things, and, this year, we have lost our thoughts about the unborn; this year, we propose to save £1,400,000 in respect of defensive equipment.  We propose to reduce the sum set in the Estimates by £800,000, and we will borrow £600,000. It is we and not the unborn who shall be made preserve and hand over these precious things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, the Minister is to get £1,000,000 from C.I.E.  That has been spoken of to such an extent that it is scarcely worth while going into it again.  But the position with regard to C.I.E. will bear a little examination. C.I.E. was started by the present Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Various companies were amalgamated.  There was a cutting down of stocks, including the debenture holdings in the previous railway concerns, and the Dublin United Tramways Company <Col N="929" /> was brought in in an effort to make solvent what was apparently an utterly insolvent concern.  Having amalgamated all these concerns, lumped in the good with the bad, cut down the likely dividends and the very problematical dividends to the people who had subscribed capital to the railways and cutting out altogether the rights of the debenture holders, the Minister stood here and told us we had now got a magnificent transport service; he said we would get efficiency from it and good transport at lower prices.  As far as the State is concerned, the Minister painted a picture of C.I.E. puffing or steaming, or otherwise propelling itself, definitely into prosperity.  That lasted for a few years, and we got behind the scenes in 1948.</P>
    <P>One has heard of people who will not pay their debts or who cannot pay their debts through force of circumstances. One has heard of people who send out cheques that bounce.  But this concern was unique in its method of dealing with its obligations.  We found that there was a safe and in that safe there was an accumulation of cheques drawn to pay the creditors of C.I.E. and then stuffed into the safe because there was no money with which to meet the cheques had they been presented.  Cheques to the tune of £500,000 in respect of which C.I.E. felt in conscience bound or at least constrained to make a gesture by drawing the cheques and entering the payees' names upon them were then locked up in the safe.  I understand that there was the shameful business of people streaming into Kingsbridge, not for the purpose of catching trains but to catch members of the C.I.E. staff in an effort to find out if they could extract some of these cheques which they had been told in letters had been drawn in their favour but which had been in some way delayed in their progress to the people to whom they were owed.</P>
    <P>That was the prosperity of C.I.E. in 1947.  We met some of the people belonging to the railway system at that time.  We met the man who was then the virtual dictator of railway policy. He had three proposals to meet the difficulties of the railways: they were <Col N="930" /> going to sack 3,500 men; they were going to close down branch lines, any number of them; and they were going to go slack in their payments for maintenance, renewals and repairs annually in their accounts.  The railway people agreed at the time that the last part of their programme was a policy of despair because it meant that a vast arrear would have to be taken up at some later date.  They hoped, however, that if they were allowed to sack men and close branch lines they might improve conditions on the railways so that the ultimate bill for maintenance and repair would not be too heavy.  That was the position of C.I.E. in 1947.</P>
    <P>Possibly the biggest headache we had was the position of C.I.E. when we took office.  We had a report made upon it.  That report was published and that report was derided.  Sir James Milne's name was never mentioned except in terms of derision and it was only in this year's Budget that the Minister mentioned Sir James Milne's name in terms something approaching compliment.</P>
    <P>Now, we are told that C.I.E., which over the years has caused the State so much in the way of subventions and aids, will provide £1,000,000 to the Minister and we are told that, instead of showing an operating loss, it is likely to show an operating return.</P>

      <P>It is better to have the 6/- maybe instead of increasing them and locking them up in a safe like the cheques.</P>
      <P>In February of last year the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke about C.I.E. and its losses.  That is just a little more than a year ago. At columns 1220 and 1221 of Volume 136 of the Official Report he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;During the course of the year I had on more than one occasion to make it clear to the board both in private discussions with the chairman and in various public statements that in my view neither the Dáil nor the public is prepared to continue to find substantial sums <Col N="931" /> every year from taxation to meet the losses which are running roughly at the rate of £2,000,000 per year.  I also informed the board that I was personally not prepared to contemplate losses running at a higher level&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A year ago it was £2,000,000 of a loss roughly annually and apparently it was feared the losses would go higher because the Minister told the House that he had told the board that he would not contemplate losses at a higher level:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and that if they should appear likely to emerge because of higher costs or declining traffic they would have to be offset&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, here is the plan back again in 1947:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;they would have to be offset by increases in rates and fares.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last night that was said to be a scare, an attempted scare, something to frighten people&mdash;that bus travellers would have to pay the cost of the remission of the ½d. off the 2-lb. loaf. The Minister said the losses</P>
    <P>&ldquo;would have to be offset by increases in rates and fares and, if such increases in rates and fares should lead in return to a reduction in traffic, then there would be no alternative but to reduce services and effect appropriate reductions in staffs.  The position is, therefore, that so far as the present C.I.E. undertaking is concerned, we have endeavoured to put a ceiling to their losses.  We made it clear to them and to everybody else concerned that any further addition to their costs must be immediately offset by increased fares or charges, or, alternatively, by a reduction of services probably involving reductions in staff.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in February.  Let us come a bit nearer to the present date.  In October of last year, the Taoiseach was again on the subject of C.I.E. and pointed out that the Estimate for transport showed a decrease of £850,000 compared with last year.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" />&ldquo;The House is aware, however, that the financial position of C.I.E. continues to be a cause of concern. A Supplementary Estimate for £1,100,000 had to be taken in February last, making the total provision for the 1952-53 financial year £2,400,000.  The provision for the present year is £1,500,000, and there is now fair reason to think that C.I.E. may be able to work within that figure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was made in the Dáil by the Tánaiste on the 28th October, 1953.  The Minister for Finance, in his Budget statement, said that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;C.I.E. is liable under Section 30 of the Transport Act, 1950, for the repayment to the Exchequer of moneys advanced from the Central Fund to meet interest payments on transport stock.  The aggregate amount advanced for this purpose to the 31st March, 1954, was £1,924,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the picture we got in February and October of last year of C.I.E., that C.I.E. was still running at a loss and was a cause of great concern annually.  The only alternative was to increase rates and fares in the knowledge that an increase in rates and fares might drive traffic off the railways and the buses.  If an increase in rates and fares led in turn to a reduction in traffic, then there was no alternative except to reduce services and effect appropriate reductions in staffs.  This is the concern from which the Minister for Finance hopes to get £1,000,000. The age of miracles has not passed if that can happen.</P>
    <P>Think of the promises made in October, 1944 and 1945, that we were going to have an efficient and cheap transport, that the concern would be prosperous and not a weight on the taxpaying community.  In 1947, its prosperity advanced to the point that £500,000 worth of cheques had to be locked up in a safe.  They could not be presented to the payees because there was no money to meet them.</P>
    <P>When a policy was asked for from the dictator of transport in those days his only solution was to sack 3,500 men and close branch lines <Col N="933" /> which, incidentally, would have meant more unemployment, and to let renewals and repairs get into some sort of arrear.  It is two years since the Tánaiste told us about the dead weight that C.I.E. was on our shoulders and talked of the losses, how they were being met and how much the burden was.  Now because the necessities of the Minister for Finance are greater than those of C.I.E., he builds a Budget in which £1,000,000 has to depend partly on a repayment by C.I.E., and partly on the non-payment by the State to C.I.E. of what it had already provided for it.</P>
    <P>It was stated last night by Deputy Costello or Deputy Dillon that 14 officials of C.I.E. visited Kanturk last month with a proposal to close a little branch line in that neighbourhood.  It was pointed out that the line represented to them a cost of £8,000 a year and that C.I.E. could not continue to suffer a loss of £8,000.  Therefore, they wanted the branch line closed in order to cut that loss.  Last month, C.I.E. could not bear to think of that as a continuing loss they were so hard up for money.  In this recent debate, the Minister for Finance tells us that C.I.E. is now showing not only no losses but an ability to pay.  Therefore, he is in the happy position of being able to get £1,000,000 from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <P>If these C.I.E. figures do not work out right then the whole scheme of the Budget is in smithereens.  If C.I.E. has to make sacrifices and tolerate not being paid the £500,000 they are supposed to get they will have to seek some way out of their difficulties.  Over the years, they have shown no other resort, except one, and that was to increase rates.  These have shown no result except the inevitable one of <Col N="934" /> driving away traffic.  They then come to the point of asking people to be dismissed or of curtailing services in some way.  Therefore, the travelling passenger public will suffer more hardship than even they do at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Minister, at page 33 of the typescript, spoke of economies.  Last year he budgeted to get £3,500,000 in economies.  He says that he got £3.6 million.  Some day, I hope, we will discover what the items are which make up the £3,600,000.  I would like to know if the £3,600,000 saved last year was a mere casual saving, or if it makes its appearance again in various sub-heads of expenditure this year.  The Minister says he expects the savings this year to be £4,000,000.  I would like to know if that is made up of the sum of £3,600,000 from last year with an additional £400,000.  So far as I can see, the Minister failed to get his £3,600,000 in economies last year.  He now budgets to get £4,000,000 in savings this year.  If the £4,000,000 in savings and the £1,000,000 are not obtained, the remissions given have been entirely undeserved this year.  The Minister, in his statement went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Vigorous efforts were made to achieve positive and continuing reductions in the cost of public administration and if these have not given in full measure the permanent saving which was aimed at, it is only because the problem of retrenchment in public expenditure is of its nature difficult and intractable.  But the Government are determined to master it and every Department will again be required to review its personnel and services to this end.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what that means?  The Departments are going to be asked to review their personnel.  If the Minister gets a saving of £4,000,000 this year, and if that is additional to the £3,600,000 of last year, then there is a saving of £7,600,000.  I wonder what does the Minister mean by asking the Departments to review their personnel. Does that contemplate the dismissal of civil servants, that there is going to be something in the nature of a Geddes' axe swung against the personnel in the <Col N="935" /> Departments?  Are we going to see the unestablished civil servants who are open to unemployment at any moment adding their numbers to the huge number of unemployed that we already have in the community?</P>
    <P>This morning the Taoiseach rather blew up this idea of his own Minister for Finance in respect of these economies. The Taoiseach said with regard to the Opposition that they were riding two horses, and I think he said, facing in different directions without any reins in their hands.  Putting that in less metaphorical language, he said that the Opposition were trying to accomplish two things at the same time which were incompatible.  The aim of the Opposition, he said, was to reduce the cost of Government and at the same time increase capital development and possibly increase development of social services and these he expressed as being in his mind incompatible. I see no incompatibility between a pledge to reduce the expense of Government and a pledge to increase capital development.  Capital development only adds to the annual Budget by the extent of the interest rate or whatever be the annuity relating to the period over which the money will be repaid.  There is no incompatibility and there is no saving for this country unless the huge Government expenditure is reduced.  It has grown apace year after year, and there has been no serious effort to curtail it.</P>
    <P>With regard to his statement that it is incompatible to reduce the cost of Government and retain development of social services there may be more argument than that.  We had always understood it was agreed policy between members in this House no matter what Party they represented that you could not have any increase in social services or other things of that kind unless there was an increase in the productivity of the country because everybody agreed that taxation has reached the limit and there did not seem to be any value in giving with one hand still more social services to the community and with the other hand extracting not only the cost of the social services but something extra to pay for administrative <Col N="936" /> waste.  We know now that the 1952 Budget actually amounted to that.</P>
    <P>The policy of it as now explained by the Minister for Finance in the last couple of days was that the cuts in the food subsidies, the taxation on beer and tobacco were required in order to give the betterment of the social services and the betterment of the health services.  It does not seem exactly right to say that one should go to an expectant mother and promise her some better service in the way of maternity attention and then say: &ldquo;The way we are going to get the money for that is by making such things as milk and tea and bread and butter dearer for you when you are approaching this period when you require particular maternity attention.&rdquo;  That, apparently, was the policy of Fianna Fáil. They thought the public health of this country required better attention and they proceeded to make food dearer, possibly hoping to improve the health of the people who must have been regarded then as suffering, not so much from scarcity as suffering from a surfeit of too much.</P>
    <P>We have always opposed the view expressed by the Tánaiste on the 6th March, 1951.  He was then setting his face towards the difficulties of 1951-52. His attitude was clearly expressed in this phrase often quoted in the House, and he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have got to persuade the people that instead of giving 5/4 out of every £ they should give 6/- or 6/6 or 7/-; persuade them that it is better for themselves that they should spend less at their own discretion and let the Government do the spending for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a policy that I have always argued against, expostulated about, and tried my best to prevent ever becoming effective in this country.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Christus Rex Congress in Athlone at this moment a speaker on voluntary organisations speaking generally to the effect that it was a better idea to let the people mould their own lives and work out their own human and eternal destiny through the vicissitudes of life than have a welfare Government taking on <Col N="937" /> that work at every step, one of the reverend speakers at that congress said: &ldquo;If human personality was to be safeguarded and human liberty defended, there was needed a multitude of voluntary institutions, strong and active, to resist the megalomaniac tendencies which seemed to lie buried in the heart of every modern State.&rdquo; Another speaker, looking back over the years that have passed, said: &ldquo;It would be no easy task to unwind the nationalisation and statism to which they were already committed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently he does not know that it is Government policy to wind us up still more in statism and nationalisation. What is the meaning of the Tánaiste's phrases other than what I put on them?  &ldquo;We have got to persuade the people that instead of giving 5/4 out of every £ they should give 6/- or 6/6 or 7/-; persuade them that it is better for themselves that they should spend less at their own discretion and let the Government do the spending for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the policy, as I say, that we on our side of the House have set ourselves dead against.  It is a policy that the Minister also appears to have turned against.  Redemption is a difficult thing that can only be achieved over a number of years.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if people would take the Book of Estimates for the year 1929 and take the present Estimates, and see these enormous swollen Departments of State would they not agree that we see there before us the megalomaniac tendencies that certainly have been about this State since Fianna Fáil took control?  If any Minister tells me it is not possible inside a year or two to get the cost to the community reduced by saving £3,500,000 or £4,000,000&mdash;whichever figure the Minister likes to settle for&mdash; he has no idea of the waste there is about these gigantic Departments first of all, and secondly, of the interference there is with the lives of the people through their activities.  If anybody sat back quietly and worked out the interposition of Government Departments in people's lives in 1929 and see what is occurring now, and if they started to draw a comparison <Col N="938" /> would it not be entirely in favour of 1929 when the people had the liberty in their homes and about their spending that they had in 1929?  When I say that I do not want this case to be made against me&mdash;as no doubt it will in a whispering campaign&mdash;that I am following the Minister's line and speaking of the personnel of the Civil Service, that it might have to be cut down.</P>
    <P>I have spoken over and over again and warned that there is a wastage of 1,200 or 1,500 people each year in the Civil Service and that wastage could be used&mdash;it could not be used entirely because there are people preparing their children for the Civil Service&mdash; but it could be used to the extent of about 1,000 per year.  That, accepted as a fact and that developed as a policy over quite a brief period of years, would give us some easement in all these swollen, expensive and, in the main, Departments that are inefficient for the ordinary purposes of life. I am not passing any comment on the efficiency of the Civil Service as a body.  I know the work that is done, particularly by the senior people in the ranks of the Civil Service, but I know that many of them object to the idea of the interfering in human life which they have got to do, and many of them would be very glad to see departmental activity restricted to the point where it was in the year 1929.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered what we want with one Department, the Department of Local Government, when one thinks of 26 main local authorities and a whole host of subsidiary local authorities for urban and other communities, that this is a community of 2,900,000 people and that an area around Birmingham very like that is bossed by one authority.  We have 26 local authorities of the county council type and a multitude of a minor type and then on top we set a central Department for an island which holds in this part of it about 2,900,000 people.  We clap on top a central Government Department which, undoubtedly, as the years go on has developed, and must develop, megalomaniac tendencies about the work it has to do.  We have a property valuation which shows that. <Col N="939" /> in so far as that Department is a channel for passing down rents from the central Government it could be done with less personnel, with greater efficiency and less expenditure than at present.  It would be well to have an examination made as to that one Department.  What are the activities we have for which we are loading this community with the expense of carrying all these officials?</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste stated on the 14th March this year:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This year's Budget will not be dressed up for election purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, for a Fianna Fáil Budget, is stretching the credulity of the people to the extremity.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every Fianna Fáil Budget was, and always would be, honest and Fianna Fáil would rather leave office honourably than get returned by such dubious methods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One could say that the dubious methods are being tried but that there will be no return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the very few minutes which are left I should like to say a few words about Deputy McGilligan's speech.  Deputy McGilligan spent most of his time criticising Fianna Fáil because the great programme of development which we initiated at various periods from 1932 onwards was not entirely in operation in the year 1932. Deputy McGilligan evidently has a very short memory.  He seems to forget that in the period before the war, apart from the economic conflict which we had, which is not a subject of the present debate, the Fine Gael Party of that time was so ultra-conservative in its attitude that for us under those circumstances to take step after step to commence development in this country, to build industries, to extend afforestation, to commence arterial drainage, to do all the things we did, was an immense tribute to the Fianna Fáil organisation, because it had in face of it a main Opposition Party which condemned almost every single new development of any kind which we had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, we had Deputy Dillon screaming from the rooftops that the adverse balance of trade showed a slight increase, saying that the country was heading for disruption and bankruptcy, jeering at members of the Government because of our causing some slight upward trend in the adverse trade balance, most of which could have been regarded as the result of importing machinery for capital development and saying that the country was going bankrupt.  I do not believe that at the coming election people will pay much heed to that kind of talk.  Then, just towards the end of his speech, Deputy McGilligan did what all Deputies of Fine Gael are doing at the present time.  They all have split minds.  Half of them are of the ultra-conservative type, well typified by the <i>Irish Independent</i> which <Col N="942" /> supports them and which publishes leading articles against the Government for overspending in capital development and for overspending in everything else.  Deputy McGilligan revealed his split mind when, in a mood rather of sentimental reminiscence, he thought it would be a good thing if we got back to the days of 1929.  How are the people of this country to decide what is the policy of Fine Gael if the ex-Minister for Finance can make a speech the first half of which jeers at us because we did not engage sufficiently quickly in 95 per cent. of all the development schemes now taking place which are the result of the fertile imagination of Fianna Fáil alone, and then at the end of his speech he goes back and with, as I have said, a sort of tender reminiscence in his eyes, wonders whether we would not be much better as we were in the days of 1929?</P>
    <P>Of course Deputy McGilligan all through his speech made statements which were themselves contradictory. He spoke about the increase of the Civil Service.  Did Deputy McGilligan do anything while he was in office to alter fundamentally the organisation of the Civil Service?  Did he cause any rapid diminution in the recruitment to the Civil Service?  He spoke, again, as though he thought that the increase in social service expenditure was unwise, something to be deplored; but as I understand it one of the bargains made between him and the Labour Party was that sooner or later there would be a social welfare scheme and that it would be introduced regardless of the country's prosperity, as part of the normal life of the country.  Deputy McGilligan did not have to decide for the Labour Party whether improvements in the social welfare measures were necessary because of the particular economic state of the country, but they were part of the ordinary machinery of government, they were essential for the community, essential to provide material aid to the less well off.  But we now had emerging in the course of Deputy McGilligan's speech some sort of over-conservative tendency, as though he rather regretted the increase of widows' and orphans' pensions, the establishment of children's <Col N="943" /> allowances, the increases in the scope of the National Health Insurance scheme, to provide increased benefits for those with families and children. We learn, indeed, from Deputy McGilligan in his last few remarks something of the inner conflict that must have gone on within the inter-Party Government before it broke up in regard to this matter.  Deputy McGilligan made perfectly clear in his last phrases, going back to 1929, the reason for the non-implementation of the Social Welfare Act originally introduced by that Government, and altered and put on the Statute Book by ourselves.</P>
    <P>There were many other things to which I could refer.  He referred, for example, to a suggestion of inconsistency on our part for having reduced the expenditure on the Defence Forces, and he referred to the speech made previously in which we have made it clear that something must be done for the Army of the country.  I do not think it is necessary for me to repeat again in great detail that modern equipment has been introduced into the Army and the Army's strength has been increased.  It was only after we had done those things that we found it was possible in the present state of Europe to make some reduction in what might otherwise have been a larger expenditure upon Army equipment, but there was nothing inconsistent in what we did.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to the increase of interest rates for national loans from the time of 1951 to 1954.  I suppose that Deputy McGilligan expects the whole country to believe that interest rates went up solely because of the present Government, whereas, in fact, they increased in every country of Europe, both neutral countries, undevastated countries, and countries that were not neutral during the war.  They increased in every country but two whose currencies were either as strong as or stronger than the dollar; and how Deputy McGilligan expected us to escape the general increase in rates that occurred all over the world I do not know.  But I know this&mdash;that he spoke of borrowing money at 5 per <Col N="944" /> cent. for a national loan.  When Deputy McGilligan left office the bank rate was 6 per cent, but because the Fine Gael Government at that time were doing absolutely no development work of any sort or description they did not have to worry about the rate at which they could borrow money for national loans.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also referred to the suggestion that it might be possible to make very large savings in State expenditure.  During the inter-Party Government, as I have said, they had every opportunity of investigating these matters.  They had an opportunity to punish and belabour the banks if they wished.  They had opportunities to make all those improvements which they now say are possible, but we heard nothing about it at that time.  We heard no such changes proposed.  There was no change proposed in the fundamental relationship of the banks to the State. There was not even a suggestion that a banking commission should be promoted, or even an inter-departmental committee created.  There was not even so far as we know a committee of Ministers to investigate all those fundamental problems about which we are now supposed to be so conservative and so lacking in initiative.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan had the barefaced insolence to refer to the emigration of some 500,000 people during our first term of office, but he did not tell the members of the House that during the term of the inter-Party Government's office, when they promised the sun, the moon and the stars in the way of measures to end emigration, at least 100,000 persons left this country.  I say that general experience of government since 1922 would make it very desirable for members of Parties to make no promises of a spurious kind in regard to solving this very fundamental problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also failed to account for the fact that during our first period of office although, as I said, as a result of the great war many of our development schemes were postponed inevitably, he seemed to compare the amount of capital raised by ourselves and by his Government <Col N="945" /> as something which had some real basis of comparison; but I should think that we should mention in this context the fact that about £21,000,000 was raised for new industries alone during the first part of the Fianna Fáil administration, and raised in the face of the fiercest opposition by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>We would still like to know what the Fine Gael Party policy is in regard to the promotion of industry&mdash;whether it is the policy of Deputy Dillon, who claims that the country has been halfruined by the tariffs and quotas of industry, whether it is the policy of a newspaper, the <i>Independent,</i> which refers to the &ldquo;silly&rdquo; industries, or whether it is the policy of the fraction of Fine Gael who might be described as spurious imitators of Fianna Fáil and whose policy, if it has anything new in it, is a policy that has been taught to them from the long experience of our success in developing this country and most of which had been originally devised by ourselves.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I found it interesting to listen to Deputy McGilligan because this is the end of the present Dáil.</P>

      <P>I was interested in noticing, as I have said, this curious split personality so clearly to be observed in everything he said.  To my mind it makes the position very clear to the electorate of the coming election&mdash;the difference between voting in support of an administration where on the one hand you have the possibility of some unknown alliance with the Labour Party, whose policy is a sort of super-super-super Fianna Fáil policy costing about £30,000,000 more, and the policy of a Party which consists, as I have said, of two groups &mdash;those who sometimes hunger for the <i>laissez faire</i> days of 1929 and those who have tried to align themselves in order to be able to secure the support of the Labour Party.  One can see this tendency in many directions&mdash;in discussions on rates of interest, on the amount of borrowings, in all their demands to have that reduction in taxation without being able to state <Col N="946" /> where they are to find the money, in all their demands, and half hints, that subsidies might be increased without saying that they would be increased, the half hinting that in some way or other social service benefits might be increased without saying where the money is to be found.  One finds no real evidence that their policy has been foreseen, has been properly considered.  One only sees, as I have said, what might be described as the labour alliance wing of Fine Gael in some sort of uneasy comradeship with the Fine Gael line up at any price element in that Party.  Deputy McGilligan, as I have said, gave himself away perfectly in regard to that matter because much of his speech, as I have already indicated, went back to the days when Fine Gael was doing nothing for the people, and much of his speech took the line that they should be more brilliant and more goahead and show more initiative in their attitude than any other Party.</P>

      <P>I gave notice this morning that, on the Adjournment of the Dáil, I would raise the matter of a boy who received injuries in Artane Industrial School on the 14th of this month.  I want to state briefly to the Dáil the facts as they were reported to me.  The boy concerned is aged 14½ years.  He has been in Artane Industrial School for one and a half years, and, during his period there, his conduct has been satisfactory.  On the 14th of this month he was punished for some boyish altercation with another boy.  Apparently, as I am informed, before the punishment was inflicted, the doors were locked, the windows closed and the punishment, which was the normal punishment, was inflicted in the presence of all of his classmates. The punishment, I am informed, consisted <Col N="947" /> of a number of slaps on the hand from the punishment leather that is generally used for that purpose, but on the completion of that punishment the boy was ordered to submit to further punishment with the edge of the strap and he refused to accept that punishment.  The Brother in charge sent for another Brother to come in.  Apparently the boy who was being punished felt that the Brother was being brought in for the purpose of compelling him to receive this additional punishment to which he objected.  Whatever his boyish mind was, he ran from the place in which he was being punished, lifted a sweeping brush, which was apparently standing in a corner, and held it up as a protection.  At this stage, the second Brother arrived and seeing the bush in the boy's hands, snatched it from him, struck him on the head injuring him, struck him on the back injuring him, struck him on the arm and broke his arm.  That happened on the 14th and the boy was taken to hospital on the 16th instant when his arm was set in plaster and is still in plaster.</P>
      <P>The mother of the boy, although she lives not too distant from the school, was not informed of the injury the boy had received, but she heard about it during the week-end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She sought to see the Superior but was refused permission to do so.  In regard to that, I should perhaps make it plain that, so far as I am informed, there was on that particular point apparently some misunderstanding but she sought the Superior during that week-end and did not see him.  She saw him on the first occasion on Tuesday of this week when the Superior admitted to her that the boy had received the injuries I have mentioned and that he had been taken to hospital. She did not see the boy. Whether he was then in hospital or not, I am not in a position to say but she did not see the boy.  She came to me about half past eight yesterday morning.  I communicated by telephone with the Superior and she was then allowed to see her boy.  She was shocked at the state in which she <Col N="948" /> found him.  Yesterday was the 22nd; the incident occurred on the 14th and eight days afterwards, on the 22nd, she saw the boy.  I, immediately, having heard her story as to what had happened, sent a telegram to the Minister asking him to investigate the matter and I stated in that telegram that I would raise the matter on the Adjournment of the Dáil, and you, Sir, have kindly given me permission to raise it now.</P>
    <P>These boys, who are sent to these schools by the courts, are all the responsibility of the Minister for Education, and the Minister for Education, as I understand it, must answer to this House and to the country for the conditions under which the boys sent there by the courts are kept, the conditions under which they live, the conditions of punishment and matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>I think the House and the country will want to have from the Minister an assurance that an incident such as has occurred in this case will not be permitted to occur again.  I am informed that the Brother who injured the boy was barely past 21 years of age, not much older than the little boy who was injured in the fashion I have described.  I think the House will want an assurance from the Minister, and the country will want an assurance from him, that punishment, if it is to be inflicted on those sent to industrial schools, will be inflicted by some person of experience and responsibility.  If punishment were to be imposed in a fit of hot temper, it would be exceptionally bad and, in fact, as in this case, it would be dangerous.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that I have had to mention or raise this matter in this House.  I have lived for many years convenient to Artane Schools.  For many years, whenever I was asked, I have been a subscriber to the funds of the schools.  I have seen their boys week after week passing my house, looking exceptionally fit, well clothed and happy.  All of us have seen their magnificent band playing on big occasions in Croke Park and it would be regrettable that an incident, such as I have mentioned in this case, should be permitted under any circumstances to occur in a school of that kind.  I myself <Col N="949" /> personally am satisfied that it is an isolated instance.  I am satisfied that the superiors will take appropriate action against the Brother concerned. The very fact that the incident did occur shows how necessary it is that this House, through the machinery of the Department of Education and through the Minister charged with that responsibility, should have the closest supervision of schools such as this, where children, many of them without parents at all, are sent to be brought up.</P>
    <P>This incident, when I heard it yesterday morning and heard the details subsequently, profoundly shocked me. I am perfectly certain that the fact that it has been raised in this House, that the Minister has investigated it, will ensure that no similar incident will occur in the future.  It will be a guarantee to the parents and relatives of children who are in these industrial schools that this House and the Minister and the staff of the Department will jealously guard and protect those children while they are under the care of the State in these institutions.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Cowan has been quite reasonable in admitting that this is an isolated incident and that in general his appreciation of the work of the Artane School and of the condition of the children there has not lessened. The boy was hit and his arm was broken.  I would be as much concerned as the Deputy is if I thought it was anything other than a very isolated incident and in one sense what might be called an accident.  I would not tolerate cruelty to any boy or misuse of any boy in any institution.  I visited Artane and found the boys were healthy and well cared for.  I visited the schools there and it struck me that there was great evidence of very earnest endeavour, even of notable achievement, in the schools.  It would be very difficult to improve the conditions under which the schools operate, certainly without a very substantial subvention from this House for the upkeep of the schools and for the development of what may be essential and necessary there.  I would like to remind the House that the community provided the lands in Artane, the building and <Col N="950" /> the equipment from their own resources; and they did this in a Christian endeavour to ameliorate certain conditions the development of which had not been provided for in any way by anyone.  I cannot conceive any deliberate ill-treatment of boys by a community motivated by the ideals of its founder.  I cannot conceive any sadism emanating from men who were trained to a life of sacrifice and of austerity.  They are also trained to have great devotion to a very high purpose.</P>
      <P>The point is that accidents will happen in the best regulated families and in this family there are about 800 boys. Many of them were sent to Artane because of the difficulties of their character and because of a good deal of unruliness of conduct.  These boys are difficult to control at times.  Maybe it is essential now and again that children should be punished.  I am not all at one with the people who claim that children should never be punished, but I think the punishment should be administered, as Deputy Cowan says, by a responsible person in conditions of calm judgment.</P>
      <P>I do not know how the edge of the strap is used, but I will make an inquiry into that.  I think it would be an evil thing for the school, for the character of the children, for the future of the children, that any misuse should arise in any school like Artane. Because of the unfortunate background of many of these boys, possibly due to evil social conditions, Deputies must realise how careful the handling of them as a group must be and how far from easy it is to ensure the working of such an institution.</P>
      <P>I deeply regret that there should be such a happening and I appreciate the anxiety of the boy's mother.  Apart from my high regard for the Brothers concerned, the community concerned, there is also a very constant system of inspection for all such institutions.  I personally have visited practically all of them and I make personal and constant inquiry as to what is happening in them.  I know in that particular school how deep is the anxiety for the children's spiritual and physical welfare. This is an isolated incident; it can only happen again as an accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> I hope it will never happen again.  I have not neglected full inquiry into the working of these schools at any time.  There are conditions that should be created in all these schools, they are deficient in many things; but that will cost a good deal more money from the State than the relatively small amount that is paid now.  These things are essential from the point of view of the children.  Unfortunately, this year I have not been able to make provision for the things I need in those schools; but Deputies will remember that in future a wider provision must be made <Col N="952" /> if these schools are to serve the purpose they ought to serve in the nation.</P>
    <P>This is an isolated incident.  I wish to express my sympathy to the parents of the child and I can assure them that nothing of the like will happen again.  While giving this as a guarantee to parents and knowing the difficult conditions under which the school is run, I would point out to parents that any guarantee I give them of full protection for their children is no licence to any of the children to do what they like.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
