      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (a) the number of non-nationals who have acquired agricultural land since the higher rate of stamp duty became operative, and (b) the total area so acquired in (i) each county, and (ii) the whole country.</P>

      <P>Presumably the Deputy is referring to cases in which the 25 per cent. rate of stamp duty imposed by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947 was paid.  I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing, for each county, the number of cases in respect of which this duty was paid in the period from 1st January, 1950 to 30th June, 1954, in respect of sales of agricultural land and the aggregate area of land involved in these transactions.  The corresponding particulars were not collected prior to 1950.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>NUMBERS of cases in respect of which the 25 per cent. rate of stamp duty imposed by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947 was paid, in the period from 1st January, 1950, to 30th June, 1954, in respect of sales of agricultural land and aggregate area of land involved in these transactions.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the value of agricultural and horticultural produce imported in the nine months January-September, 1954, distinguishing the principal countries of origin.  For the purpose of the reply the produce included is defined as raw or simply prepared agricultural and horticultural products, whether these are of a type produced in this country or not.  For details of the value and quantity of the various categories imported I have to refer the Deputy to the published Trade Statistics for September, 1954.  It must be pointed out that the figures given include a total of £11,183,000 in respect of maize and sorghums, tobacco, tea, <Col N="1629" /> cocoa beans, raw cotton, jute and rubber, all of which are agricultural products.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state (1) what proposals the Land Commission have under consideration for turbary development on Gowlane bog, County Sligo, and (2) the programme of work on this bog for the coming season.</P>

      <P>In the townlands of <Col N="1645" /> Carns, Tawnalaghta, Cloonkeelaun, Crewagh, Rathgoonaun and Oweny-keevan (which embrace practically the whole of what is known locally as Gowlane bog) the Land Commission have developed and allotted approximately 1,800 acres of turbary and they have on hands a further area of 4,225 acres, portion of which is let on a temporary basis.</P>
      <P>They are also considering the resumption of additional areas totalling 1,350 acres which, with the area on hands, would enable them to meet all local domestic requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the question of further resumptions has been finally settled it will not be possible to forecast the works programme for a particular season but it is anticipated that a sum approaching £40,000 will be expended <Col N="1646" /> on the future development of all the lands likely to be involved.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to emphasise that in the acquisition of bog the paramount consideration with the Land Commission is the provision of turf for local landholders for consumption as fuel in their own houses and not for sale.</P>

      <P>In view of the present very extensive flooding (which exceeds any in living memory) it has been considered necessary to resurvey the entire area, which includes Clonown and several other townlands.  This survey is still proceeding and cannot be concluded until the flood waters recede as many of the holdings are either inundated or inaccessible.  It is hoped, however, that the out-turn of events so far as the Land Commission are concerned will be the early migration of some landholders on the fringe of the flooded area whose vacated lands will provide dry building sites and dry stands for stock in time of flood.

      <P>Experience of the working of the land project showed that the demand for fencing was very heavy and that the work was proving so expensive as to be prejudicial to the more important work of field and out-fall drainage and the clearance of rock and scrub.  It was, therefore, decided drastically to restrict fencing work, and the position is that fencing is now provided for only in rare instances where it is established that the improved land cannot be worked without some fencing.</P>

      <P>The main proposal put forward by local interests for the improvement of the landing place at Portaleen (Glengad) was the construction of a dock basin.  In connection with this proposal, engineers of the Office of Public Works carried out a close survey of the site in 1953 and, as a result, that office came to the conclusion that the cost of the dock scheme which would need the construction of one main breakwater would be of the order of £250,000 and would have serious limitations in operation.  To provide harbour of refuge facilities for the number of boats based on Portaleen at the time, the Office of Public Works considered that two main breakwaters would be necessary together with an inner basin, quayage and shore facilities, and estimated that the cost would be of the order of £400,000.  The Donegal county engineer considered that adequate shelter could be provided at a much smaller cost and undertook in February last to furnish details of the plan he had in mind to the Office of Public Works.  Such details are, I understand, still awaited.</P>

As a matter of urgency would he go into the question now with a view to having something done because, if he does not, the danger is that fishing will cease to be carried on in this area since no insurance company will insure these boats?  The loss of five boats last week is a total loss so far as these fishermen are concerned because they cannot get insurance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the serious loss and hardship imposed on the people, who live on lands adjacent to the Shannon, north and south of Athlone, because of the frequent flooding of their homes and holdings, he will take immediate steps to implement the recommendation of the Drainage Commission to deepen and widen the river between Athlone and Meelick.</P>

      <P>The Government is aware of the serious flooding caused by the River Shannon referred to by the Deputy in his question.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Drainage Commission pointed out that the works recommended by them were intended to reduce the incidence of floods in the summer and harvest months and that in seasons of excessive rainfall flooding must be expected. The commission also stated that any attempt to confine the River Shannon to its summer bed by deepening and widening the channel between Athlone and Meelick may be ruled out as quite impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Agriculture indicated in reply to a question on 17th November last, the Commissioners of Public Works have been instructed to examine the possibility of removing obstructions from the bed of the River Shannon between Athlone and Meelick.  While their examination of the flooding problem has not been completed, there is sufficient information <Col N="1667" /> available to make it clear that the execution of works of this nature would have no material effect on the levels of a flood of the present magnitude.</P>
    <P>The Government is keeping the problem under continuous review.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £890,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in the course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for payment of certain Remuneration in respect of the year 1952-53.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be within the recollection of the House that the previous Government, when faced with an arbitration <Col N="1681" /> finding for the Civil Service and the analogous bodies&mdash;effective from 1st November, 1952&mdash;decided against paying the increases in full and made them payable only from 1st April, 1953.  Leading members of the present Government, when in opposition, protested strongly against this decision for reasons of justice and for reasons based upon the public interest and they gave solemn undertakings that, if and when they took office, that decision would be reversed.  Members of the House will be aware that the decision was based on the fact that the members who now constitute the present Government were clear that in an ordered society there must be arrangements made peacefully to solve differences of opinion.  One of the ways in which the ingenuity of man has arrived at a method for such peaceful solution is that of arbitration. It is, of course, analogous to the way in which there has grown up over the years of civilisation similar methods in regard to other disputes between man and man in the same nation and in the same state.</P>
    <P>The whole field of industrial disputes has had in the same way the same influence brought to attention upon it. The Labour Court, which was set up by the Fianna Fáil Government with the concurrence of all the members of this House, is a type of arbitration and it has, as every Deputy will readily admit, done extremely good work in the settlement and avoidance of disputes.  It is part of the same principle of arbitration to ensure that there will be a peaceful settlement and that there will not be, in so far as is possible, any dislocation that would arise from disputes.  It is from that point of view in regard to the Civil Service that arrangements for arbitration machinery were made without, of course, overriding in any way the constitutional duty that devolves on any Government in dealing with the public interests.</P>
    <P>The House will also remember that when I spoke here on the 16th June last I referred to the undertakings that had been given by the members of the present Government when they were in opposition.  This Estimate is now being <Col N="1682" /> presented in fulfilment of that undertaking. The members of the House will also be aware that the arbitration machinery which was set up was availed of on the 22nd July, 1952, when a claim for a general revision of pay on cost of living grounds was submitted to my then predecessor.  After discussions in the ordinary way, in accordance with the terms of that machinery, the statement of case for arbitration was submitted by the staff side on the one hand and by my predecessor, in due course, on the other hand, and after special sittings of the arbitration board on the 3rd and 4th November, 1952, the report of the board was, on the 18th November, 1952, signed by the chairman and transmitted to the Government.</P>
    <P>The board, as I say, recommended certain increases to be paid with effect as from the 1st November, 1952.  The Supplementary Estimate now before the House is for the purpose of covering the payments that require to be made for the period from the date when the board so recommended&mdash;on the 1st November, 1952&mdash;up to the 1st April following the date upon which the previous Government determined that the award would come into effect.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the total is the sum of £890,000.  That sum covers various classes, not merely civil servants, but the various classes that are set out in the Supplementary Estimate which has been circulated.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress that the amount which is involved will be spent to a very large extent in the country as apart from the City of Dublin.  It is not necessary for me to enumerate all the various classes in the country who will receive the arrears of this award.  They vary from postmen on the one hand to more senior people working down the country on the other hand, but I might mention in passing that the Post Office classes outside the capital involved a sum of £100,000.  The total sum that will be paid to personnel outside Dublin out of the total award is approximately £550,000.  I mention that because sometimes people are inclined to think in a matter of this kind <Col N="1683" /> that it is purely one referable to Dublin and only to Dublin.</P>
    <P>But the House and the Deputies in it will, I think, readily accept the view that public servants should be on the same basis in regard to increases in the cost of living as are persons in other walks of life.  It is common knowledge to us all that the cost of living rose substantially during 1952, that in fact the figure&mdash;the cost-of-living index figure&mdash;rose from a figure of 115 points in May of that year to 123 points in the following November.  During the latter half of 1952 and in the early part of 1953, employees in many walks of life in private undertakings, by negotiation or, in cases, with the assistance of the Labour Court, as I have already stated, all secured increases in their wages and in their remunerations. I think Deputies will accept that it is only right that public servants, when the same reasons operated to affect them, should be treated in the same way as other people in private employment, and it is for those reasons that I recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Lemass, on a previous occasion, the exact extent of the savings which will be effected cannot fully be ascertained until the close of the financial year, and I have no doubt that, when the close of the financial year comes, the Deputy will submit me to a most rigorous examination on the returns I put before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to come to that.  If local authorities do decide that they wish to follow the same lines then, by reason of statutory enactments, of which the Deputy is aware, further contributions will have to be made from the Central Fund to those local authorities by way of reimbursement. The item set out here under No. 5 is not by way of a direct payment by the State to employees of local authorities but is provision for reimbursement to local authorities in the statutory manner if local authorities, or any local authority, wish to follow the same line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not know exactly what effect it will have on rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to know from the Minister's opening statement and from his reply to my questions that he is not quite so sure about all this fat that was knocking around in the last Budget.  According to statements made all round the country the Budget was dripping with fat and all anybody had to do if he wanted more fat was to hold out his hand, give his vote to Fine Gael, and he would be filled with all the fat in the surplus that was going to be in the Fianna Fáil Budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister has no idea, or, if he has, will not tell the House, even though the financial year is drawing towards a close, whether this sum will be met out of savings, whether he is going to tax for it this year, whether it will be met out of taxes next year or whether it will be met out of taxes which will go to pay interest and sinking fund on moneys borrowed for the payment of this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last general election Deputy McGilligan, who most people thought would be Minister for Finance if the Fine Gael Coalition came back, said, on the eve of the poll, in a <Col N="1685" /> letter which was published in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>&mdash;but only in the city editions; it was not for country consumption&mdash;that there was &ldquo;abundant money to meet these arrears&rdquo; which Fine Gael would pay.  Now the abundance of money seems to have disappeared and the Minister is not certain about it or is very coy in admitting that he will have to borrow for it instead of meeting it out of the abundance of money that was knocking around when Deputy McGilligan was speaking.</P>
    <P>Here last week there was a question asked by Deputy MacBride in relation to this matter.  In the question he made an allegation; he asked when the Minister was going to introduce this Estimate &ldquo;for the payment of arrears due to State employees on foot of the Civil Service arbitration award which was repudiated by the previous Government&rdquo;.  No award by the Arbitration Board was repudiated by the previous Government. The Government made an agreement with the Civil Service for an Arbitration Board and the terms upon which that board would act were quite clearly set out in the circular which the Minister for Finance issued on the 15th July, 1952, enclosing a copy of the proposed arbitration procedure. For the purpose of the record I want to read certain articles of that communication dealing with arbitration.  The whole circular dealt with the scheme of conciliation and arbitration machinery for the Civil Service.  The following articles Nos. 19 and 20 are taken from part IV dealing with arbitration:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;19.  Within three months of the receipt of a report from the chairman of the board the Government will present it to Dáil Eireann or, if at the expiration of three months the Dáil is not sitting, then on the first day of the next sitting.  No such report will be published before submission to Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House will recollect that that article was completely carried out and that the Minister for Finance reported to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" />&ldquo;20.  (1) Subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) following, the Government as soon as may be after such presentation will either signify its acceptance of the finding contained in the board's report or will introduce a motion in Dáil Éireann recommending either the rejection of the finding or such modification therein as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(2)  When they receive a report from the Arbitration Board on a claim for a general revision of Civil Service pay, the Government will, when presenting the report to Dáil Éireann, in accordance with paragraph 19 preceding, adopt one of the following courses:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Signify that they propose to give immediate effect to the findings of the board in full;</P>
    <P>(b)  Introduce a motion in Dáil Éireann proposing the rejection or modification of the findings;</P>
    <P>(c)  Signify (i) that they consider that it would not be possible without imposing additional taxation, to give full effect to the findings within the current financial year, (ii) that they propose to defer a final decision on the report until the Budget for the next following financial year is being framed and (iii) to what extent, if any, they propose in the interval, without prejudice to the final decision, to give effect to the findings, the extent of the payment to be determined by the amount which can be met without imposing additional taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every single clause of that article was strictly followed out.  There was no repudiation of an award.  The civil servants were told openly and candidly exactly what the Government proposed to do under the scheme of arbitration.  The Civil Service agreed to the arbitrator, the nominee who was proposed or suggested by the Government and that arbitrator sat and made his award.  But there was nothing in the scheme of conciliation and arbitration to say that the Government would forthwith have to proceed to carry out every bit of the award.  The Government cannot constitutionally <Col N="1687" /> divest itself of its responsibility to the taxpayers.  It is ridiculous for the Government and civil servants to be equated in their relationship to that of a private employer and his workers.  The Government is not in the position of an employer paying out his own money, in the course of his own business to his own workers.  If an ordinary individual in the course of business goes to arbitration over a wage dispute with his employees and if the arbitrator gives what he thinks is an excessive award, he can go out of business.</P>
    <P>But the Government cannot go out of business and the Government is not paying out of its own pocket.  It is going to pay out of the pockets of the general public, so that it is absolute nonsense to equate the Government's position to the position of the normal employer.  The Government does not find the money out of its own pocket; it finds it out of the pockets of the taxpayer.  In fact, in the last analysis, the Government and the Dáil became the arbitrator between the servants and the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I want to say, first of all, that the scheme of arbitration to which the previous Government agreed was followed to the letter by that Government. No civil servant had any right to expect that the Government would automatically implement the award of the board.  It was pointed out in this scheme that the Government would take into consideration the state of the finances of the country and whether the people could afford to pay in that particular year, and whether there was sufficient money in the Exchequer, and it was the custom of the Fianna Fáil Government to pay as it went as far as possible and not to give the people sprees at the expense of future taxpayers.</P>
    <P>We all know, of course, that it is the aim of every individual, whether he is a civil servant or not, to improve his lot and to live as well as he can and get as much money as he can get, but the civil servants and others who are paid by the State must have some regard to the standard of living of the <Col N="1688" /> taxpayers who are supplying the money.  This particular promise is the only one that it is carrying out of the many promises which the present Government made during the election.</P>

They are quite prepared to slide out of their commitments this year notwithstanding the pretence that the Minister for <Col N="1689" /> Finance does not know whether the Budget is going to be balanced or whether there is any blood of fat around out of which he could scoop this sum for the civil servants.  There are a number of people who would be paying this who were made promises &mdash;just as the civil servants were made promises&mdash;that have not been kept. This particular promise was made by Deputy McGilligan as I pointed out on the eve of the election and only in the city editions of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>&mdash;not in the country editions.  We all know why Deputy McGilligan made this particular promise to the civil servants in his constituency.  We know that in the 1948 General Election he came in on the ninth count at the bottom of the poll: in the 1951 election he came in on the fifth count and at the bottom of the poll, and he hoped to get in the 1954 election a somewhat higher place.

It said:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very well for Deputy Davin to be prepared to give a sum of money to the civil servants which the Government is neither legally nor morally compelled to give to them and at the same time make a 15 per cent. cut in farmers' prices. But the farmers of the country who are going to suffer a 15 per cent. cut on their wheat, if they can afford to grow it at the price, will have to pay additional taxation next year; if they do not pay it in one year, they will have to pay additional taxation in some form for the next 40 years to recoup this sum.  It was calculated that the £2,400,000 per year, which is the cost of this award continuosly for the future, granted by the Government to civil servants on foot of this arbitration, would cost 2d. on the pint. 1d. on cigarettes and 1d. on sugar.  If one does not like that group of commodities, one can take another group and increase the taxes by 1d. on the pint, 1d. on cigarettes and 4½d. on income-tax. Numbers of people will have to pay these taxes, or some other taxes, in order to meet this particular Estimate introduced by the Minister.  The Minister has given us no indication as to how he proposes to find the money and, before the debate concludes, I would like him to give us some indication in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister raised the broad issue as to the approach of the Dáil on this question of arbitration and in general he seemed to take the view that Government should automatically come forward to the Dáil with an Estimate to cover any award given by <Col N="1692" /> the Arbitration Board on foot of the present arbitration scheme.  Now that is a very different attitude from the attitude taken up by some of the Fine Gael Party not so very long ago. Indeed, it is quite different from the attitude taken up when a Fine Gael Minister for Finance was negotiating with the Civil Servants when the Coalition first came into office.  The attitude taken up at that time was somewhat equivalent to the attitude expressed in articles 19 and 20 of the agreement for arbitration made by the previous Fianna Fáil Government. As far back as 1946, one very prominent member of the present Coalition, who now seems to be carrying all the other members of the Government at his heels when he wants to smash wheat or anything like that, made a speech on this particular matter.  That speech will be found at column 232 of Volume 103 of the Official Report.  Deputy Dillon, as he then was, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not agree with Deputy Norton that a democratic Government can delegate to any arbitration tribunal the duty of determining the salaries, wages and conditions of employment of State servants whose salaries and wages are charged upon the Exchequer.  I do not believe that any democratic Government can divest itself of the responsibility for making the final recommendation in regard to that matter.  They cannot bind themselves in advance to burden the Exchequer with what three persons, who have to direct responsibility to the electors, choose to say should be put upon them.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>23rd October, 1946.  I have given the volume and the column. Deputy Dillon says so much that sometimes he says something that is of some value and I think that his attitude in that particular part of his speech was a sensible one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Davin is talking to civil servants he takes up <Col N="1693" /> the attitude that he would like them to fix their own salaries.  When he was in opposition, and talking to farmers, he took up the attitude that he would like the farmers to fix their own prices for everything they had to sell.  At the present time he is quite prepared to grind down the farmers; he is quite prepared to collect any taxes necessary to pay the civil servants something that is not legally due to them.  It is very important from the point of view of the future that we should get it straight that Government is not in the position of the ordinary employer.  The Government in this matter is merely the agent of the Dáil and of the taxpayers negotiating with the civil servants.  It cannot constitutionally hand over its powers and authority to an arbitrator and say: &ldquo;Go, and carry out the work of the Government and carry out the work of the Dáil.&rdquo;  If that is to be the way of it, it will have a very inflationary effect on the Budget. When people come along looking for money, be they civil servants or anything else, no one likes to refuse them. Certainly the people who have the right to refuse awards which they think the community cannot bear are those who are supposed to protect the general interests of the community as a whole.  In one part of his speech to-day the Minister said that public servants should be treated on the same basis as other members of the community in relation to the cost of living. Apply that principle to farm prices. Farmers have to buy things as well as civil servants but farmers will suffer a cut of 15 or 16 per cent. in one commodity alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point to be remembered is that civil servants are not in the same position as ordinary employees.  It is right that civil servants should have security, should have good pensions and should in general be treated as well as the community can afford for the sake of good government; the community, through the Dáil, goes out of its way to give civil servants that security and to give them salaries which are high in relation to the income of those who pay them.  Indeed, salaries in some groups within the Civil Service are higher than those paid in Britain notwithstanding the difference in income-tax, <Col N="1694" /> the price of beer, cigarettes and other things.  In return for that, civil servants should be reasonable.  I think that the vast majority take a reasonable approach to this question of salary and conditions.  There are, of course, organisations in the Civil Service whose <i>raison d'être</i> is to agitate for higher pay, better conditions and bigger pensions.  It is healthy that these organisations should exist, that they should be vocal and that they should be free to put their case to the people and to the Dáil but it would be very bad, indeed, if there were to grow up in this country a system whereby civil servants would put political pressure and would vote in certain key constituencies, like Deputy McGilligan's constituency, to affect an issue in the Dáil.  It is important that there should be a Civil Service which will, as the Civil Service here has always done, work with equal loyalty for all Governments that are sent along by the people.  It is important, too, that civil servants should not try to dominate in politics, because if that were attempted on any widespread scale, it would soon mean that politics would dominate them, as it does in other countries where civil servants are free to take part in politics and to pursue political aims.  The other side of that picture is that you have a clean sweep when there is a change of Government.</P>

I want to conclude <Col N="1695" /> by saying that it is important both for the Civil Service and the country to recognise that the previous Government did not break their word in regard to the scheme of Civil Service arbitration, that the Government, when they set up the scheme and got the civil servants' agreement to the chairman of the board, undertook to pay within the year only if they thought it was the right thing to do by the general taxpayers of the country and by the state of the Exchequer and that there was a provision in the scheme to postpone or to amend any award made by the Arbitration Board.  It was done in relation to the period which this Estimate covers simply because the Minister for Finance at that time could not see his way to bring in a second Budget to find the sum which would be necessary to meet the award for that financial year.  He had a little more sense of responsibility to the country than to pay the award out of borrowed moneys, leaving it to future taxpayers to meet the sums he spent.</P>

      <P>When I listened to the first few sentences of Deputy Aiken opening his speech, I realised the type of speech it was going to be.  Deputy Aiken has a long way to go to catch up on the record of his Party in regard to the farmers and, therefore, for the last month or so, the members of his Party cannot talk of anything else except the farmer.  We had it even on the Local Government Bill.  On every issue that comes before this House, they speak of the condition of the country districts.  In what condition were the country districts when the country was handed over to the inter-Party Government in the beginning of 1948? Were the farmers better able to pay the Civil Service then that they are now?  Everybody knows what the answer is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is sufficient about that particular subject but we can watch the Party opposite for the next 12 months.  They have a long <Col N="1696" /> way to go to catch up on their record. I have been around the country for the last six months and I realise the kind of support the inter-Party Government has amongst the farming community.  The Opposition, by this constant ologoning in regard to the conditions that are supposed to exist for the farming community, are endeavouring to get the Dáil to refuse to meet this legitimate debt.  If Deputy Aiken thinks that that is going to get the Party opposite anywhere, he had better start over again.</P>
      <P>I understand by the word &ldquo;arbitration&rdquo; quite a simple concept.  Two people have a dispute about something and the matter is submitted to a third person who will arbitrate and give his judgement.  In this particular case the selected arbitrator did give a certain decision.  Civil servants might well have taken the line that it was a very harsh judgment from their point of view.  It was not by any means generous but on the whole it was fair and reasonable.  I, personally, would not have objected to it but civil servants might well have taken objection to it.  The Government some months earlier had put into the so-called scheme of arbitration the phrase that should the Government consider that it would not be possible without imposing taxation to give full effect to the findings within the current financial year, they might refuse to give effect to it.  We know the manner in which the finances of the State are run.  A Budget is introduced each year by the Minister in charge of the Department of Finance of the particular country. He makes his arrangements and any additional charges which arise are me out of the proceeds of taxation from the Exchequer, out of the Central Fund and &ldquo;the growing produce thereof&rdquo; as the phrase has it.  That is the case in every country.  At the very time that the Party opposite repudiated the terms of the award&mdash; Deputy Aiken said they did not repudiate them but I think I am correct in saying that they repudiated them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The cost of living had been put up that year by the Budget to the tune of about 15 points and ordinary people working with firms and semi-State companies had got additional remuneration.  Were the people who were to benefit from this particular award of a different kind or were they wealthier people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Aiken continually referred to civil servants, but as Deputy Davin pointed out, substantially the larger party of this award is for people who are not civil servants though they are employees of the State.  Certain figures were produced at the time.  If we take civil servants, that is taking Deputy Aiken on his own ground, we find that out of 32,000 civil servants at the time, 24,000 had under £8 per week and much more than half had under £6 per week. These are the people to whom the Government of the day refused to give an award of 12½ per cent. on the first £200 of their salary, to meet an increase in the cost of living, due to the policy of the Party opposite, which was at least 15 per cent.  The Party opposite at that very time having compelled other people in the country including farmers to pay additional wages and salaries to their employees, proceeded to repudiate something to which they had agreed previously.  Now I would like to get away from that.  I feel personally that this Estimate indicates the mentality of the Party opposite.  They will put a burden on people who have <Col N="1698" /> no option but to bear it.  They will put it both ways.  They will put it on the ordinary people who have to live by private enterprise and they will not put it on themselves.  Why? Because they might have to finance it, because it might show them up.</P>

      <P>The Deputy might be well advised to keep quite on that subject.  When this arbitration was arranged, Deputy MacEntee, the then Minister for Finance, had increased taxation substantially in that particular year's Budget and he would not pay this sum of £890,000 to the civil servants. Was it for a political reason that he did not pay it?  Was it that he wanted to make a political answer to the case which Mr. Costello, then Leader of the Opposition, had made, that there was £10,000,000 of surplus taxation in the Budget?</P>

      <P>We are still dealing with Budgets arranged by Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Finance of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The expenditure up to the 13th December, 1952 above the line was £66 millions, just £66 millions.  The expenditure to the 12th December, 1953 was £69½ millions.  The expenditure up to the 11th December this year is £74½ millions.  Is it not obvious, therefore, that there was surplus taxation because, in addition to the expenditure going up since, there were Supplementary Estimates that particular year to the tune of almost £10 millions?  The Government at that time looked around everywhere it could to scoop in debts to pay bills of all sorts in an attempt at that time to make provision that their Budget for the year 1953-54 would be a terrific success. It did not come off.</P>

      <P>Ah! I would say this, that the inter-Party Government left the Exchequer in a far better position when they left office on the 13th June, 1951, than the Government that went into opposition this year.  There is no question about it, from a financial <Col N="1700" /> point of view.  Are the Deputies opposite going to suggest to me that from the point of view of the Exchequer it would not have been better that this award had been met when it became due?  Of course it would have been better if it had been met.  You proceeded and you left a debt which you knew would be honoured by the Opposition of the day when they came into office.  They said so repeatedly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of remarks of various sorts were made by Deputy Aiken, that the abundance of money seems to have disappeared, that civil servants should be reasonable, meaning, of course, that civil servants are unreasonable people and that the only person who is reasonable in this regard is Deputy Aiken.  He suggested on other thing, for example, that it would be ridiculous to equate the Government to the normal employer.  I quote his words as nearly as I can: &ldquo;It quote his words to equate the Government to the normal employer.&rdquo;  The normal employer has only one method.  If he is an ordinary man engaged in private enterprise, he has to depend on that private enterprise to get the wherewithal to enable him to pay his employees. It is well known that the manner in which Budgets are created, in which the State is financed, is that first of all you add up your commitments and then you see where you will get the wherewithal to meet them.  If you are prudent you will keep your commitments as low as possible.  Is there any indication from the figures I have read out that the Party opposite when they were the Government in 1951 to 1954 were prudent in their commitments?  Of course, they were not prudent in their commitments. The expenditure figures I have read out prove that up to the hilt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also suggested and, really, there was no point in it&mdash;it is hardly worth answering&mdash;that Deputy McGilligan made this promise on the eve of the election.  Deputy McGilligan had made it specifically in this House. <Col N="1701" /> Note alone that but, with all respect to Deputy Aiken, I do not think Deputy McGilligan was in any danger of being defeated in the election which happened last May.  I do not think he was in any danger whatever.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested by Deputy Aiken that the Government of the day, the Government here to-day, is not entitled to pay this award.  Of course we are entitled to pay it.  If we put it to the ultimate test in a democracy, our promise to pay it was vindicated at the polls on the 18th May this year. If we put it to that ultimate test, we are entitled to pay it.</P>
    <P>I do not mind about references to other promises made by the Parties on this side of the House, references to sense of responsibility and that kind of thing.  That is all in the nature of the kind of speech that Deputy Aiken set out to make.</P>
    <P>I would like to finish on this particular note, the same note as that on which I commenced: If we take the whole period back to the year 1920, the 30 years of self-government, the farmers of this country who have to bear their portion of the cost of this award will know from their own experience, they do know it from their own experience, particularly the young farmers, which side of this House is more favourably disposed to them.</P>
    <P>We do not mind what people say in this House.  They can judge by the way they are treated by the different Governments that have been here. They can judge by the condition of their own affairs when one Government goes out of office and another takes its place.  It is the only test. You had two Governments in office in this country, one from 1948 to 1951, another from 1951 to 1954.  The Party opposite, of course, suggests that the Government from 1948 to 1951 borrowed this country into a depression, all that kind of thing.  I do not believe that anybody takes them seriously when they say that but, as I have said, they are changing their tune.  As has been pointed out, Deputy Lemass quite recently said the future depended on agriculture.  Deputy Lemass had plenty of time when he <Col N="1702" /> was in charge for the development of agriculture.  It is a bit late in the day now for the Party, especially on an issue like this, where an obligation is in question and which does not involve directly either civil servants alone or the City of Dublin.  The greater part of the money is being spent outside the City of Dublin and outside the Civil Service.  I may have a very juvenile idea of the obligation of Government, but I believe Governments should keep their word.  I think that must have been the belief when a scheme of arbitration was set up&mdash; that the Government should be very slow to repudiate any part of an arbitration award.  The excuse which was made in this particular case by the Minister that he had not made sufficient provision in taxation in the year in which he had to meet enormous taxation increases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have practically completed what I have to say on this subject but I should like to add that I think Deputy Aiken restricted himself to the issue here as to whether a Government should regard itself as being above all questions of fairness and equity to its employees.  But to come along and say &ldquo;Oh, the poor farmer will have to pay this!&rdquo; Deputy Aiken knows as well as I do that that is just a lot of code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get myself entangled with financial wizards, but I should like to ask a few simple questions on this matter. I would ask the Minister to elucidate further on the proposals for payment under the heading dealing with &ldquo;Local Authorities.&rdquo;  Does that mean in fact that a similar sum will have to be made available by the local authorities throughout the Twenty-Six Counties and, if so, does this mean that there will be a further imposition on the rates?  I am concerned particularly about the position in Limerick City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a report of the corporation meeting there last night where it was stated that as a result of the Government's decision to implement the Civil Service award the effect on the rates will be to increase them by a further 2½d. in the £ to meet payments to employees of the corporation. The city manager explained that some of the money necessary to meet the corporation's commitments under the award would come out of the health grant, and that the remainder would come out of the rates.  I, in my innocence, understood that there would not be any imposition on the rates&mdash;that the entire sum to meet this Estimate would come out of the Central Fund, and I should be very glad if the Minister would elucidate further as to what will be the position of the individual local authorities, and if the rates will have to bear <Col N="1704" /> 50 per cent. or 100 per cent. of the payments necessary.  I did not understand very clearly the Minister's reply to Deputy Aiken.  The Parliamentary Secretary, who has now gone out, made reference to the moral obligations of accepting an award.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture will bear this in mind when he is considering the findings of the Milk Costings Commission. No doubt there is a slight difference between arbitration and Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Slight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of the £10,000,000 surplus which the then Leader of the Opposition, the present Taoiseach, foretold we would have, and he proceeded to contradict himself very vehemently by justifying their action because, he said, they would come to the Dáil with further Supplementary Estimates because we had cut things so tightly.  I am delighted for the civil servants' sake, but I am afraid there is going to be a bit of juggling with this £20,000,000 loan which the Minister recently got.</P>
      <P>I notice the Labour Benches are very empty at the moment.  One would imagine that when arrangements were being made to have this £890,000 paid to the civil servants the Labour Party members would have said that the widows and orphans and the unemployed should have got preference if not precedence under this matter.  The civil servants have been treated very fairly by the Fianna Fáil Party down the years.  They are getting something now but all they are getting is the back pay&mdash;something I would think, like £30 per vote.  However, that is a horse of a different colour and I would again ask the Minister to elucidate the position in regard to the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. E. de Valera Mr. E. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a very serious matter which should be approached and dealt with on its merits.  There is nothing so pleasant as to give.  That is true in the case of a private individual and it is far truer in the case of a Government.  It is very pleasant to be popular and to be held as a good fellow.  We would have liked to have been a good fellow to with the servants of the State.  We had nothing <Col N="1705" /> but good to say of them.  We were in a very peculiar position when we came into office.  We took over machinery of State which had been built up during the time in which there was bitter conflict here in this country.  The individuals who came into the public service, the Civil Service, the Army, the Gardaí, were recruited by our opponents.  It was built up by the Government that preceded us at a time in which there was bitter hostility to us.  But we came into office and I can say that we got loyal service from every section of the State services.</P>
      <P>I should therefore have been more than pleased to give to the servants of the State any moneys that we felt it was just to give them or that we felt the community could afford.  The only barrier to our liberality and to our desire to be liberal was the public interest and how the public interest was best to be served.  We were said to have repudiated the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We acted fully within our rights according to the agreement and as an arbitrator, as has already been suggested, between the section of the people who have to pay the taxes and the people to whom their money is to be paid in compensation for their services.  When the agreement was being made it was made with very definite provision in it to try to safeguard the interest of the community and to enable the Government to act as the final arbiter in regard to those interests.  It was definitely provided in black and white what was to happen when an award was given by the arbitrator. Precisely because it was not thought to be in the public interest that there should be moneys paid beyond the amount that was coming in during the year, provision was made by which a Government was able to exercise its discretion; if it was unable within the revenues provided in the year to meet any back portion of the award it has not to be paid.  Even though increased taxation to an enormous amount had had to be put on in order to bridge the gap in 1952 to meet current expenditure by current revenue we faced the position.  We knew perfectly well-and it required courage on the part of the Government <Col N="1706" /> to take the action&mdash;what the political reactions and the reactions of people who did not wish to pay increased taxes were going to be, and the effect upon the political fortunes of our Party.  We did what we considered to be our duty in the public interest and that was to try to make revenue equal expenditure and it was for that reason that we had to meet that gap of £15,000,000 by imposing taxation.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach talked arrant nonsense from this side, and he knows he talked arrant nonsense, when he said we were taxing for £10,000,000 more than was necessary.  Everybody knows that no Government in its senses would attempt to do it.  Of course when the accounts for the year came in not merely had we not £10,000,000 too much taxation but we had, I think, £2,000,000 of a deficit which had to be met by borrowing.</P>
    <P>When we were considering the award we were anxious to meet it, but when we looked at the situation we saw that at the time there was danger of a deficit, as it proved to be ultimately, and we felt that we would not be justified, unless we brought in a Supplementary Budget to deal with it, in borrowing for what was obviously current expenditure. The Minister was asked did he think it should be paid this year out of current expenditure?  He will not answer.  It will only be an extra item in the deficit if it is a deficit.  As I said already, nothing is so pleasant as to give; nothing is so pleasant as to be hailed a good fellow.  We had to deny ourselves that pleasure.  The present Government is not going to do it.  I will not say they are not entitled to do it.  They are entitled to do anything that they think is right in the public interest, and they can undoubtedly back up their doing it on this occasion by saying it was one of the issues of the election.  Very well, I, for one, will not vote against it on that account&mdash;if they put it to the electorate, as they say they did.  They are able to point out that when this matter was first raised here in the Dáil they said they were going to reverse our decision.  It went to the electorate and they can certainly justify themselves now in paying it.  If the people who have to provide the money in taxation <Col N="1707" /> have any complaint they can make it against themselves very largely because if they do not want things like that to be done then they should exercise their rights at the poll and by their vote see that those who are going to do it will not get the opportunity.</P>
    <P>I agree, therefore, that the Government can say they are entitled to do this on the basis that they presented it as part of their programme, and I have nothing further to say on that. All I do say is that a Minister for Finance who is doing his duty by the country and a Government that is doing its duty should see that this item is regarded as an item of current expenditure and should come out of taxation instead of being borrowed.  If we are not able to pay it this year they should see that it is provided by revenue from the next year.  That is the proper way of doing it.  I have made it clear that if the Government want to pay this they are entitled to do it, but any suggestion that we as a Government broke an agreement is not true.  We kept strictly to the agreement and these powers were put into it deliberately and accepted by the Civil Service.  They were put in to safeguard the needs of a Government in cases such as that to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Now with regard to this question of arbitration in general, during most of my public life I have tried to suggest that conflicts of various kinds should be resolved by peaceful methods. Whether they are international or other conflicts that are involved, one of the methods is arbitration.  I was in favour of that system.  I believe that peaceful arrangement of disputes, whether they be industrial or other, by means of third party arbitration is in general a desirable procedure.  Why did we not earlier apply it to the Civil Service?  The reason has already been referred to here, that in one sense the Government is itself an arbitrator.  It is not private moneys that it is dealing with.  It is money it had to get by way of taxation.  The only check there is on Government expenditure, on being the good fellow to everybody, giving higher benefits in every direction, is that they <Col N="1708" /> have to go and get that money out of other people's pockets.  When that procedure of taking the money out of their pockets comes to take effect, those out of whose pockets the money is being taken will object and those who put their hands too freely into those pockets will not be allowed to continue in office.  There is no other check.</P>
    <P>If there is a period of five years' administration the temptation is that the Government in the earlier period of their office are likely to be much more extravagant than they are later because the hour of judgment is a little bit further off.  However, if the Government does want to do its duty and be honest and fair between the different sections of the community it has to consider whether the means are sufficient to enable them to do the good things which they desire to do. If they allow some third person to come in and decide that matter for them, the third person has no idea very often of the difficulties there are in getting the money that is necessary to meet commitments of various kinds, and the effect of increased taxation upon the welfare of the community.</P>
    <P>When I was in the opposite benches I have said that one of the most important things for the future benefit of the country was to try to put a stop to increases in taxation and to try to diminish the level of taxation if it could possibly be done.  A third person who has not got the material at his disposal or if it is not his day-to-day business as it is the business of Ministers of Government, may not be alive to all these implications and it is very easy for him to take a one-sided view of the matter, to think only of the fact that a certain section such as the servants of the State should be paid more.  He does not take into account at all the reactions that will occur from providing these increased amounts.  I think £2,400,000 additional taxation every year was involved in that award apart altogether from the retrospective payments involved here. We accepted that and said: &ldquo;All right.  We have got to meet that claim for the civil servants and we will have to put on every year in the future a sum of £2,400,000 extra which will have <Col N="1709" /> to come from the people by way of taxation following that award.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The arbitrator may or may not&mdash; I am talking about Mr. X who is brought in to arbitrate on these matters&mdash;be fully alive to all the consequences of this and even if he is aware of them he may lean in one direction and there is nobody to call him to account.  He is never going to be called to account.  But the Government is going to be called to account. It is the Government that has to bear the responsibility of taking the judgment. Therefore it was a very serious matter for a Government to agree at all to the idea of arbitration.  It was agreed to, however, as possibly being the lesser of two evils.  Discontent in the Civil Service would be an evil that would be very serious from the public interest point of view.  But there were clauses there to meet objections and one of these was that the award would be one which would relate to the future, which the Government could act on.  The other was regarding the amount to be paid in a particular financial year and what we did was, that we looked at our accounts and said we feel we cannot pay this particular portion of it relating to this current year but we will take measures in the new Budget to provide the money that will be necessary for the coming year.  That is the truth of the position.</P>
    <P>As far as arbitration is concerned, I do not think if the present Government were going to enter into an arbitration agreement that they would leave out these claúses on which we operated.  I do not think they would and if they did, I would say from this side of the House&mdash;as we said from the other&mdash;that they would be wrong, that they would not be doing their duty.  The present Minister for Agriculture adverted to this situation apparently, according to Volume 103, an extract from which was read out here to-day of a speech of his, that they would be abrogating their functions, giving up their position as the body that was going to determine what was going to be the taxation&mdash;at least as far as the controlling majority would <Col N="1710" /> determine it.  Well, then, arbitration has been accepted.  I do not know what the present position is, whether the present Government is going to alter these terms.  We acted within the terms, and we believe we acted in the best interests of the country.  We would like to be as generous as we could, and, as far as the present Vote is concerned, I think the present Government is entitled to do what they propose to do because they can claim, whether rightly or wrongly, that it was part of their published policy and that they got a majority in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech we have just listened to was marked by two things.  The first was a return on the part of the Deputy to the old arrogance which he displayed in dealing with the civil servants during the war years but which one would have thought would have since gone.  The second was a complete misconception of the financial aspects of the whole matter.  The Deputy's main argument was an attempt to explain away his own failure to meet the award while indicating that he was not going to object to it now being met by us.  He said that we accepted it and were within our rights in doing so.  The Deputy could say that with regard to the shockingly immoral treatment of the civil servants during the war years. The Deputy knows that during the war years when the standstill Orders were being put on they were put in the later stages on the working classes in the main, but were put on earlier on the civil servants and kept on later and any little bit of slackness that there was to be paid out was paid out most grudgingly to the civil servants.  Of course the Deputy acted within his rights in doing that.  What was his right?  His right was that with regard to the State personnel, everybody held his post or employment at the will and pleasure of the Government.  If they did not like what the Government gave them they could leave.  That is the right that he has boasted of until this year.  Under that right the Government conducted themselves in a way that was characterised by many people responsible for the ethical education <Col N="1711" /> of this community as being grossly immoral. There was no case on the merits to have civil servants &ldquo;stood still&rdquo; earlier, and kept at a standstill longer than other people only this one&mdash;that the civil servants, members of the Army, the teachers and the civil servants as a whole were under the thumb of the Government and could be treated whatever way the Government liked.  This is the claim that the Deputy takes pride in elevating.</P>
      <P>The Deputy says this is within the Government's rights and that it was within their rights not to make this back payment.  It was within the rights of what they forced on the civil servants.  The civil servants were told: &ldquo;Accept this agreement.&rdquo;  They accepted because they could not get one better.  There was no such reservation in the agreement I made with the civil servants with regard to arbitration. Let the Deputy remember its history.  He was against any type of arbitration for State personnel up to 1948 when one of his Ministers for Finance offered the civil servants terms which were rejected by them because while they pretended to be arbitration they were not really arbitration at all.  The Deputy was against arbitration and when we gave arbitration to the Civil Service, it was one of the proudest achievements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will argue about that at another time.  The scheme was made for a year for a trial period and when that trial period ended, I myself minuted the file, to the effect that I could not see any reason why&mdash;some changes were required because certain flaws had been discovered&mdash;it would take more than a few weeks to amend. Of course, I was not allowed to amend it and the Deputies who succeeded me as Ministers took time to amend it and then said to the civil servants: &ldquo;You have that, or you will have no arbitration.&rdquo; Does the ex-Minister for Finance, the present Deputy Aiken, think that civil servants believed that that was only for one year?  Let him go and ask the Civil Service associations. They never knew where they <Col N="1712" /> stood with the people who are facing me here to-night.</P>
      <P>May I resume?  The Deputies opposite were against arbitration.  Arbitration was a bone of contention during most of the years in which they were in Government.  They refused it right along the line.  Then we brought it in. Then limitations and reservations were brought in, and one of the reservations is the matter under which Deputy de Valera now claims he is acting within his rights: that was that if the arbitration award was brought in in the course of a financial year, there were certain limitations; the Government might accept it; the Government might reject it; the Government might accept it with modifications.  Do not forget there was a special clause in it, and I am sure it is one in which Deputy de Valera would claim he acted within his rights.  That reservation was that the Government guaranteed they would honour the award and pay the moneys unless there were exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What were the exceptional circumstances in the year in which this award was made, this award in relation to which we are now making this back payment?  The exceptional circumstances were these.  In the old days there was a certain sum of money carried forward from year to year because it was felt that at the start of any financial year revenue might not be running strongly and expenditure might be running very heavily and there was, therefore, the necessity to cover in the beginning of any financial year certain expenditure and there had to be for that purpose a certain carry-over. During my first period as a member of the Government in one year only, I think, that carry-over went to £300,000.  It generally was roughly about £200,000.  It was at £200,000 in the year 1932.  In 1938-39 it never went above £200,000.  When I went back into office I found that the carry-over was in the region of £2,000,000 and in the year in which the last Government refused to make this back payment the carry-over had swollen by about £200,000 and was somewhere in the region of £2,250,000, and the exceptional circumstances were not that <Col N="1713" /> the Government had not any money but that they had more money in the carry-over than they ever had in their whole previous existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I call the financial mistake into which the Deputy is falling.  Surely the Deputy will agree with me that, as a canon of finance, the Minister does not in any ordinary years count in his annual revenue anything that is clearly in the nature of a windfall.  Is it not equally the situation that he will not count against himself in his ordinary expenditure something that is of the windfall nature in relation to expenditure? Why does the Deputy want to mix up ordinary revenue with a back payment that has to be made once and for all and for which there was plenty of money at the time when the Deputies now in opposition refused to make this payment to the civil servants?  I may say again that the reservation was that the Government was to pay and guaranteed they would pay unless there were exceptional circumstances to prevent such payment.  I could imagine such an exceptional circumstance being that they had not got the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case we are dealing with.  The Deputy has said that his Minister was courageous, so courageous as to put £10,000,000 or £12,000,000 on to the people and found himself also having to find £2.4 millions for State personnel.  Now we are not dealing with civil servants only in this.  I am very glad we are dealing with all civil servants, including the higher grade civil servants.  But we are also dealing with the Army, the Gardaí, the teachers and all those who staked their claim before an arbitration, the chairman of which was proposed by the Government and accepted by the Civil Service associations.  The result of that award was a certain payment, this being the arrears of pay over certain months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy talked about the courage of his Minister in putting on taxes and then says that in the end they had to pay, and the community had to pay, £2.4 millions over and above the previous year's sum; and they will have to pay that in perpetuity in respect of State personnel.  So they will.  That is one of the best criticisms <Col N="1716" /> that could be made of that courageous Budget.  That Budget increased taxes; the taxes increased the cost of living; the cost of living index figure accordingly rose.  The civil servants went before an arbitration board and there made their case on that increase in the cost of living, and that increase in the cost of living was brought about in the main by the increased taxes for which the Deputies opposite were responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having given compensatory benefits to old age pensioners and so forth, the Deputy opposite had to pay nearly £2,500,000 to State personnel because of the fatuity of that Budget; and because of the terrific taxation in that Budget and because of the terrific increase in the cost of living civil servants appeared before this tribunal and got this award.  If the Deputy is going back to the old days and claiming that he is within his rights, he can, of course, on that claim abolish arbitration.  He made his claim against arbitration here to-night as far as State personnel is concerned.  What was it?  The Government is in a different position from anybody else. That is the exceptional matter in relation to State personnel and the Government.  If State personnel get a right to arbitration and go before a tribunal, the Deputy is not questioning the <i>bona fides</i> of that arbitration. Civil servants may get an award but then the Deputy says that the exceptional thing is that the Government must put its hands into other people's pockets to get the money to pay that award.  Suppose there is arbitration in relation to some group who are not State servants.  Suppose employees outside ask for increased wages and suppose they go before the Labour Court or some arbitration board and get an award, is the Deputy so simple as to believe that the employers pay that award out of their own pockets? Is it not their customers who will pay in the end?</P>

      <P>What is the difference between the State and others <Col N="1717" /> in that respect?  What is the difference between an ordinary body of traders and the State in that respect?  The State, of course, has to find the money and that is one of the matters that an arbitration body takes into consideration. Another matter that such a body takes into consideration is the wages and salaries paid to civil servants of different types and State personnel of different types and people in comparable occupations outside. Having taken all that into consideration, they make their award and when people put their hand to an award or any system of arbitration and agree that they will have an arbitration board set up, they certainly are bound in the eyes of the public to meet that award.  They did not think that it reserved to themselves the right not to pay if they could elevate for the public clarification and for the public education certain exceptional circumstances which might prevent payment.  They could perhaps make a good case under that heading if such circumstances arose, but how could they try to make a case under that heading when the only exceptional circumstance was that they had more money in the carry-over than a Government ever had in the history of this State?</P>
      <P>This money is due.  It is the carrying out of an arbitration and I am very glad to be able, as I promised and as I backed my faith in that promise, to assist in seeing that this arbitration award is met in full.  We want this House to honour that statement of ours.  We want the House to back the honourable pledge we gave and not to take the dishonourable course of refusing to give effect to the award in full.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the speech of Deputy de Valera, Leader of the Opposition, who agreed that the Government were entitled to make this payment, I do not think it is necessary for me to go into as much detail as I had intended.  I want to make it perfectly clear that our view in respect to the non-payment of this arbitration award was that it was wrong not to pay in the circumstances rather than that we were charging the previous Government with any breach of the letter of the agreement.  That was not the case and if anything I said on that point was misinterpreted by the Deputy, I desire to repeat that that was not my intention.  My view was that the circumstances were such that it should have been paid at the time. We made it clear then that that was our view.  For the purposes of the record, and in view of the challenge made by the Leader of the Opposition of the figures mentioned by Deputy McGilligan, I should like to say that for the year in question the revenue balance at the 31st March was £2.926 million and at the beginning it had been £221,000.</P>

      <P>I know that we could argue what should be above and below the line but it is a long argument. <Col N="1720" /> That reminds me of the statement made by Deputy Aiken.  I shall be only five or six minutes over the time if the Deputy would allow me to go beyond six o'clock.  Deputy Aiken came back with the allegation that was made by members of the Fianna Fáil Party very frequently at the time on the subject of spending sprees by the inter-Party Government.  I want Deputy Aiken to assimilate these facts, that between the 1st April, 1948 and the 31st March, 1951, there was a period of three years, the only three completed years in which the inter-Party Government was in office.  The period between the 1st April, 1951 and the 31st March, 1954 was the nearest comparable three years of the last administration.  I admit that the Fianna Fáil Party were not in power during the brief period from the 1st April, to the 13th May or thereabouts. In the first period of three years, when the inter-Party Government were in office, the gross capital liability of the State increased by £76.3 million.  In the last three years, in which the Fianna Fáil Party were in office, the gross capital liability increased by £81.6 millions.</P>

If we take the assets, in the period 1948-1951 the increase in assets that were built up on every side was £68,000,000.  If we take the second period, the period of the Fianna Fáil Government, the increase in assets was only £57.3 million-a decrease of £10.7 million in the assets built up in the equivalent period of three years.  £5.3 millions increase in the gross liability built up during those three years.</P>

      <P>The city editions alone.  Well now, if Deputy Aiken is correct in that, bearing in mind the fact, as I disclosed to this House somewhat earlier, that of this total sum £550,000 will be distributed to officers outside Dublin City, I am afraid that it appears then that it was a bad thing, it would be a bad argument, to select only city newspapers and it does not altogether bear the implication that Deputy Aiken was trying to make that this was purely a city issue.</P>
      <P>The fact, as I said already, is that of this sum, £550,000 will be paid to employees outside the City of Dublin&mdash; postmen, postal officials of all sorts, privates in the Army, ordinary members of the Guards, people who are all down the country, and it is entirely fallacious for Deputy Aiken to try to make the case, as he was trying to do, that the money was to be disbursed in Dublin and, so to speak, that it was only a Dublin problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked me for further elucidation in respect of the last item, sub-head No. 5, in the Vote.  That subhead is in respect of remuneration which may be payable by certain local authorities who employ vocational teachers and health authorities.  It is not a payment to the employees as such. It is a payment that will be made to <Col N="1722" /> the local authorities concerned.  I think the Deputy, when he was speaking, had the impression that the effect of this Vote meant a general increase or general payment to all local authority employees&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And that the payment that was brought in here was intended as a general payment.  That is not so.  It was purely in respect of certain employees of health authorities and the vocational teachers, in respect of which there are certain statutory obligations under which the Exchequer reimburses the local authority concerned if those arrears are paid by them.</P>
      <P>As I said a minute ago, Deputy Aiken tried to make this out to be a Dublin question.  He went on and suggested that it was entirely a civil servant problem alone.  It is not.  I made that perfectly clear, that they are commitments to be met over a wide part of the country, more in the country than in fact in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that in the circumstances that there were at that time, circumstances which had arisen because of the deliberate policy of the then Government, the cost of living had increased in such a way and that the other surrounding circumstances were such that it would have been right and proper, not necessarily to decide immediately the arbitrator's report was received, but that it would have been right and proper in those circumstances that existed and that were seen to exist at a later date, that the award should have been then as from 1st November, 1952.  It is because we felt that that was so that we made it perfectly clear in 1953 in the Budget debate and in the Civil Service arbitration award debate at that time. The Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and other Parties who were on this side of the House made it perfectly clear that if we were co-operating again in any Government they would ask the people for a mandate to make these payments and, as Deputy de Valera has very fairly said, we did ask the people for a mandate to pay it, <Col N="1723" /> we received it and we are accordingly doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is the customary Bill to give effect to the imposition of certain Orders which are made from time to time and which must be confirmed by subsequent legislation. The purpose of the Bill, as set out in the explanatory memorandum which I have circulated to Deputies, is to confirm eight Orders made by the Government under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932.  One of these Orders, entitled&mdash;Emergency Imposition of Duties (Finance Act, 1954) (Consequential Provisions) Order, 1954&mdash;provided for amendments in certain customs duties consequent on the termination of other customs duties in the Finance Act, 1954.  These amendments did not impose any new duty provisions.  They were necessary so as to prevent anomalies arising in duties which were related to the duties terminated in the Finance Act.  The commodities covered by the remaining seven Orders are as follows:&mdash;drive screws and drive screw nails; metal coffin mountings; disinfectants, antiseptics, insecticides, verminicides, vermicides, fungicides and weed-killers; fireside companion sets; felt hats and caps for men or boys; electric smoothing irons; knitted woolen cardigans, pullovers, jerseys, blouses and similar articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The customs duties imposed on drive screws and drive screw nails and on fireside companion sets are new protective duties.  The firm engaged in the production of nails and screws extended its production to cover drive screws and applied for and was granted protection for this development.  In the case of fireside companion sets the production of these articles was undertaken for the first time and a very wide range of sets at reasonable prices <Col N="1724" /> was put on the market by the firm concerned.</P>
    <P>In the case of metal coffin mountings the Order extended the scope of the duty already in existence so as to include partly manufactured mountings and component parts of mountings. The object of this Order was to stop the practice which was developing of importing partly manufactured articles to the detriment of an existing firm which was carrying out the complete range of manufacturing operations.</P>
    <P>The Order dealing with disinfectants, etc., provided for a customs duty on disinfectants, antiseptics, insecticides, verminicides, vermicides, fungicides and weed-killers.  These goods, other than antiseptics and weed-killers, had previously been subject to customs duty, but the duty was suspended in 1942 for supply reasons. Owing to difficulties of definition a number of items not being manufactured here became subject to duty under this Order and, following consultation with the Irish manufacturers and with the Department of Agriculture, arrangements were made for the issue of duty-free licences for articles which the Irish manufacturers are unable to supply or for which suitable substitutes are not available from home sources.</P>
    <P>The Order dealing with felt hats and caps for men and boys provided for an increase in the minimum rates of duty already chargeable on these articles, as the existing rate of duty had proved ineffective in protecting the Irish factories against imports of cheap hats.</P>
    <P>In the case of electric smoothing irons, the customs duty already in existence covered irons up to 7 lb. in weight.  The present Order increased the dutiable weight limit from 7 lb. to 8 lb.  The reason for this was that certain importers were evading the duty by bringing in irons weighing slightly over 7 lb.</P>
    <P>The Order dealing with knitted woollen cardigans, pullovers, jerseys, blouses and similar articles provided for an increase in the customs duty already chargeable on those articles. The Order was made following a review of the operation of the customs duty and of the quantitative restrictions <Col N="1725" /> on the importation of the articles, carried out by the Industrial Development Authority under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only Order under the Bill with which I should like to deal at this stage is that concerning knitted woollen cardigans and similar garments.  This Order, which imposes a customs duty, coincides with another Order in reference to the quantitative restrictions previously imposed on the imports of these goods.  There is a considerable amount of opposition from the manufacturers of these goods and many expressions of apprehension as to the effect upon the knitted garments industry in this country.  The manufacturers concerned of course should have known that the quota restrictions on the imports of knitted garments were only of a temporary nature having regard to the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement and that its replacement by a tariff was inevitable at some stage.  The rate of duty proposed in the Order should be adequate to protect the Irish manufacturer in normal circumstances. Indeed it would be regarded by everybody here as a serious matter if the manufacturers of these garments were yet to avail of the full 40 per cent. protection that they now enjoy.  We have here in this country the problem of a small market adjacent to a great industrial area suffering from the possibility of surplus stock being sold off here at less than the protective costs.  What might be a very small surplus in the hands of British manufacturers would be a very large amount here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a very large proportion of our total requirements, and the production of manufacturers here could be upset for a very long period by the importation of substantial quantities of cut price goods sold under normal trade conditions in Britain and representing a very small part of the production of the manufacturers there. There is a feeling among the manufacturers here that 40 per cent. might not be a sufficient protection against dumping of that kind and that their production from time to time might be upset by reason of those exports. <Col N="1726" /> The Minister should be able to see that if there were abnormal imports of these goods, if there was a claim that the rate of duty was not sufficient to allow manufacturers here to compete against these abnormal imports, he would avail of the clause which would enable him to re-apply quantitative restrictions. There may be some possible ambiguity about the application of the clause in different circumstances, but there has been a withdrawal of quantitative restrictions and any rate of duty must be regarded as being less effective equivalent than a quantitative restriction Order.  There is also a cause for apprehension among these manufacturers about the possibility of goods being delivered here at very low prices from Far Eastern countries. Some of them have said to me that they were most apprehensive of the possible effects of the withdrawal of the quota restrictions in regard to Far Eastern countries; that they were more apprehensive about it than they were about its effect on imports from Great Britain.  I think it would allay a great deal of apprehension if the Minister would say that in the event of trade statistics revealing the importation of abnormal supplies of these goods he would impose quantitative restrictions.</P>
    <P>Many of the apprehensions expressed by the manufacturers concerned seem to me to be exaggerated.  But these two matters to which I have pointed should be carefully considered.  There is the danger of abnormal imports from Great Britain of surplus production at small cost which could upset manufacturing conditions here for quite a long time.  As far as the trade agreement is concerned, I cannot see why quantitative restrictions cannot be imposed if only for a short time. There is then the second danger from imports of these goods from countries other than Great Britain.  There is nothing at all to prevent the operation of quantitative restrictions as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>In East Donegal, where knitting is carried on extensively, and where during a good number of years valuable employment has been given, there is serious danger <Col N="1727" /> from imported materials.  I want to bring to the Minister's attention the very serious situation that has developed as a result of the change-over from quantitative restrictions to a higher rate of duty.  The higher rate of duty has not had the same debarring effect as the quantitative restrictions had, with the result that unemployment is cropping up among the people engaged in the industry throughout the county.  Deputy Lemass has pointed out what might be one of the reasons for that&mdash;that outside goods can be imported from places where there may be overproduction.  These people can afford to dump that overproduction into this State and may be able to suffer the effects of a higher rate of duty.  If the quantitative restrictions had been in operation they would not be able to do that.  We have in Donegal for the first time in a good number of years a slump in the trade.  Many of the knitting firms who give out knitting to individuals in their homes have stocks on hand which they cannot clear. There may be another factor entering into this situation other than this one but it is certainly one of the factors which is causing a glut in the knitting industry in Donegal.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister had representations made from the Federation of Irish Manufacturers or some other body interested in this matter and if he had those representations made to him and if he has considered them would he say what is his opinion? Anyhow my own opinion is that it would be very wise for a further period to re-introduce quantitative restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to be very careful in this matter. I have never worn anything but Irish made clothing since I was a boy, but if I felt that people could not work inside a 40 per cent. tariff wall, it would be a matter for uneasiness.  The tariff is very high at 40 per cent. and restoring the quota system would mean that there would not even be that 40 per cent. compulsion on Irish manufacturers to meet the foreign article plus 40 per cent. and prices <Col N="1728" /> would become too high for many of our people who have too little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a background on this question of duty on these particular commodities.  The position briefly is that in 1952 the manufacturers of these commodities represented to the Minister, or, I think to the acting Minister at the time, that they were in danger of being submerged by abnormal imports and they represented at the time that the position of the industry threatened to become really precarious.  As a result of the representations then made to the Minister steps were taken to impose quantitative restrictions.  These quantitative restrictions were imposed in 1952 but, as Deputy Lemass has rightly said, it was known to the trade that that was only a temporary measure and that once those quantitative restrictions were imposed in what might be said to be a rather unusual way at the time, it was only a matter of time until the British authorities would ask for a review of the quantitative restrictions, and in fact as was then believed would happen, the British authorities did ask for the review of the quantitative restrictions.  In January, 1953, they were informed that so far as the Minister was concerned he was prepared to remove the restrictions if the British authorities would agree to an increase in the rates of duty.  The British said: &ldquo;Well, whatever review in that respect is to take place should take place as is provided for under the agreement&rdquo;&mdash;the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreements of 1938 and 1948&mdash;and the review took place.  The review was carried out by the Industrial Development Authority.  That was the body which heard the case from the point of view of Irish manufacturers and heard the opposition to that case from the British interests concerned.  It was as a result of that review and as a result of a recommendation made by the Industrial Development Authority that the present scale of duties was imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again as Deputy Lemass has rightly said, the Irish manufacturer is getting a protection of 40 per cent. in this field. None of them has attempted to show <Col N="1729" /> that 40 per cent. is not adequate in normal circumstances.  I think anybody who has examined the situation realises it is adequate; in fact they are not using the 40 per cent. tariff and I would be disturbed, and I am sure the Opposition Benches would be likewise disturbed, if after having established these industries so long ago they could only be kept alive to-day by utilising to the full a 40 per cent. tariff.  In fact they are not utilising that 40 per cent. tariff. That is in their favour and is of advantage to the people.  It is only by cutting back on the necessity to use tariffs that we can ever get the industry geared up to a level of efficiency.</P>
    <P>I do not think, therefore, anybody need worry at all about the industry from the point of view of its ability to operate under the present scale of duty.  What is a matter of concern is a possibility that if there was a slump in Britain, or if there was any pressure on a large number of manufacturers in Britain for financial or other reasons to get rid of their stock, they might decide to unload that stock here because it is a convenient market.  A menace might arise from that source from the standpoint of the Irish manufacturers, and I think we must frankly meet that if it does not arise.  We cannot allow articles dumped by British manufacturers in this market to imperil the existence of Irish industry or to put Irish workers out of employment.  I have caused the Department to tell the manufacturers concerned who were recently in the Department that so far as I was concerned I would deal with that situation if it ever arose.  I do not think we are helpless if we were faced with the problem of dumping from British sources here, and anybody who tries to dump goods into this market at prices substantially below those at which they are sold in the British market must I think be told clearly without equivocation that if they do so, and the effect is to threaten the existence of an Irish industry or threaten to put workers out of employment, we will take immediate and effective steps to protect Irish industry against that type of unfair competition. I think that assurance to the manufacturers should put the matter beyond any doubt.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1730" /> On the question of imports to this country from the Far East a complaint was recently made about imported gloves from Hong Kong.  In fact the gloves may never have been made in Hong Kong at all.  They may have been made somewhere in the Far East and just stamped with the Hong Kong stamp which has the advantage of getting those goods a special method of entry to the British market and to other markets to which certain preferences are given for goods made in certain countries.  The moment that was brought to our attention we decided to take effective action in the matter and the position of safeguarding Irish industries from that cheap type of Eastern manufacture is being actively discussed at the moment with the organisation which represents those who produce a similar type of goods in this country.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Lemass that whatever impediments there may be to the imposition of quota restrictions under the 1948 agreement in respect of British goods I do not think there are any which prevent us operating restrictive quotas in respect of goods produced elsewhere, except perhaps the tendency of the recommendations made by O.E.E.C. which urges that there should not be particular discrimination against the products of particular countries, and that there should be a uniform code of legislation which treats all except those getting the most favoured nation treatment on the same basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but some European countries have Eastern associations and you might discover the same gloves bearing a stamp and that had been manufactured nearer home than Hong Kong.  However, I think that point is really only academic because we have the power to deal effectively with any of those menacing imports from the Far East, and I think the assurance I have given in respect of dumped goods from Great Britain <Col N="1731" /> ought to satisfy the manufacturers concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the points made by the manufacturers is that they are at present paying higher prices for knitted garments than manufacturers in Great Britain.  I think that is so.  So far as I recollect the arrangements made with the yarn manufacturers that can only be due to the high cost of woollen tops.  I think the Minister should give that some attention.  I do not think it should cost more to produce wool tions in this country than in Britain. It is a considerable disadvantage to the Irish manufacturers if they have to pay more than the British manufacturers have to pay for wool tops.  If the Minister goes into that, he would perhaps find the causes and these could be remedied.  That would enable the articles to be made available here at prices comparable with the British prices.</P>

      <P>I move that Dáil Eireann approves the Agreement between Ireland and the United States of America governing disposition of the balance in the Counterpart Special Account signed at Dublin on the 17th June, 1954, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on 4th December, 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Economic Co-operation Agreement which was signed in 1948 between <Col N="1732" /> this country and the United States of America was the basic agreement under which Ireland availed of aid under what came to be known as the Marshall Plan or the European Recovery Programme.  That agreement provided amongst other things that where we received aid on a grant, as distinct from a loan basis, the Government should deposit into a special account opened in its own name in the Central Bank an amount in Irish pounds equivalent to the dollar cost to the United States Government of commodities, services and technical information made available to Ireland by that Government during the currency of the Marshall Plan.</P>
    <P>Most of the aid which Ireland received was by way of loans, and as Deputies will be aware, we undertook to repay these loans with the interest thereon over a specified number of years.  An initial grant, however, of $3,000,000 was made to Ireland in respect of the year ending 30th June, 1950, and a special account was accordingly opened in the Central Bank for the reception of the counterpart of this grant aid.  Subsequent allocations raised the total amount of grant aid received by us to $18,000,000, and a corresponding amount of counterpart was lodged in the special account in the Central Bank.  Five per cent. of each deposit made to the special, account was reserved for the use of the United States Government for its expenditures in Ireland in accordance with the provisions of the 1948 Agreement. The total amount now available in the counterpart special account is approximately £6,142,000.</P>
    <P>The 1948 Agreement provided that the Irish Government could draw from the balance in the special account for such purposes as might be agreed on from time to time with the United States Government.  In May, 1950 agreement was reached for the use of £50,000 from the special account to meet local currency expenditure by the Irish Government on technical assistance projects.  During the years 1950 and 1951 other proposals for the utilisation of the Counterpart Funds were put before the American authorities, but no agreement had been reached <Col N="1733" /> regarding these proposals before the suspension of American economic assistance to Ireland early in 1952, and the final termination of such assistance later in that year.</P>
    <P>The 1948 Agreement provided that where an unexpended balance remained in the special account at the time of termination of economic assistance, it would be necessary before that balance could be used to obtain the approval either by act or joint resolution of the Congress of the United States of America.  Between June, 1952 and March, 1953, a total of twelve projects, together with a reserve fund were put before the American authorities designed to utilise in full the unexpended balance of £6,142,000.</P>
    <P>It was decided accordingly to conclude a bilateral agreement between the two Governments regarding the disposition of the balance in the special account, and to present that agreement for approval to the U.S. Congress.  A draft agreement for this purpose was accordingly negotiated and initialled in Dublin in August, 1953.  Subsequently, however, certain modifications of the proposals were agreed upon in Order to meet the views expressed on the American side, particularly in the American Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Five projects were dropped from the original list, and one new one (that for an educational exchange programme) was added.  In consequence of the foregoing changes in the list of projects, it became necessary to revise the draft agreement of August, 1953, and a new agreement based on the proposals as they now stand, was signed in Dublin on the 17th June, 1954. Ratification of this agreement on the American side was effected by the inclusion of a special provision in the Mutual Security Act of 1954, which was passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by President Eisenhower in August last.  In accordance with Article V, this agreement becomes effective on the date of the exchange of ratifications by the two Governments. Before effecting this exchange, the approval of Dáil Eireann is being sought for the agreement.</P>
    <P>The agreement expresses the mutual desire of the two Governments that <Col N="1734" /> the counterpart money should be used for the benefit of the Irish economy, and Article I thereof indicates in a general way the measures upon which the money may be spent.  They are:&mdash;</P>

    <P>(b)  Other programmes and projects (including the establishment of an agricultural institute) to improve and develop the agricultural production and marketing potential of Ireland and to increase the production and efficiency of Irish industry, and</P>
    <P>(c)  development programmes and projects in aid of the foregoing objectives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All of these projects and programmes are to be drawn up with a view to their making a continuing contribution to our economy.</P>
    <P>The purposes for which counterpart Funds may be used are, of course, couched in general terms only in the agreement, and Deputies will observe that Article III provides that specific sub-agreements must be negotiated between the two Governments in relation to each project which will set forth among other things a detailed specification of the nature of the projects, including a detailed budget and a plan of expenditure.  These sub-agreements are at present in course of negotiation.  There are in all eight projects, and they are expected to absorb about £5.8 million of the Counterpart Funds.  The balance of approximately £340,000 will be held in a reserve fund in accordance with Section 4 of Article III of the agreement to meet either unforeseen increases in the costs of agreed projects, or for other programmes or projects which may be agreed upon.  We have agreed to make annual reports to the United States Government on the status of the projects and programmes covered by this agreement.</P>
    <P>I have already informed the Dáil in reply to a question by Deputy Collins on the 23rd June last, the nature of the eight projects which have been agreed upon.  The scheme most likely to come into operation first is that providing <Col N="1735" /> for the subsidisation of the delivery cost of ground limestone.  As Deputies will be aware, since March, 1951, the Government have operated a scheme of this nature, and up to 31st March last, the expenditure thereon was approximately £1,150,000.  A sum of £600,000 was provided for in the Budget for the current year for this scheme, and this money provided by the Exchequer will continue to be used for the subsidy up to the date on which the sub-agreement comes into operation. Deputies will appreciate that it is essential for higher productivity to increase the application of ground limestone, so that annual losses are made good, and to replenish to some extent the lime reserve of our soil.  It is the aim of the Government to integrate liming into the farming system as a practice essential to good farming, and to the building up of soil fertility.  To this end it is proposed to spend over the next three years a sum of £1,750,000 of Counterpart Funds on the subsidisation of the delivery cost of limestone, so as to encourage its extensive use among our farmers.</P>
    <P>Another scheme which it is hoped will come into operation without undue delay is that for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Already since the 1st September last the Government have introduced a scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in County Sligo and in an area surrounding the parish of Bansha.  The moneys for these two schemes have been provided and will continue to be provided from funds made available by the Exchequer. Counterpart Funds will be used on intensive eradication work in County Clare, and in the rest of the country except County Sligo and Bansha.  The total sum of money which has been earmarked for use under this project is £700,000.</P>
    <P>The third project is intimately linked with the previous one, and is for the provision of grants towards the purchase by creameries and cream separating stations of equipment for the pasteurisation of separated milk, and the sterilisation of milk containers. A sum of £500,000 will be utilised for these purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> A fourth programme is intended to provide for the making of grants to assist Muintir na Tire, Macra na Feirme and the Irish Countrywoman's Association.  A sum of £30,000 of counterpart money will be made available to this end.  A sum of £1,840,000 is being provided for the purpose of setting up an agricultural institute, and a sum of £500,000 for the establishment of an education exchange programme with the United States of America.  £350,000 will be provided for defraying in whole or in part the cost of technical assistance projects, and finally, a sum of £130,000 will be provided to make available additional laboratories and equipment for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  The details of these schemes are at present being worked out in collaboration with the American authorities, and it is hoped that we shall be in a position to complete the details during the course of the next few months.</P>
    <P>The importance of these projects for the development of our economy during the next few years will be evident to Deputies, and there is no need for me to elaborate upon that aspect of the matter at this stage.  Before concluding, however, I would like to thank especially the American Ambassador, Mr. Taft, for the unfailing interest which he has shown in these projects, and for the assistance which he has so readily given at all stages in the rather prolonged work of preparation and negotiation which has taken place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like on behalf of the Opposition to associate myself with the appreciative remarks of the Minister in relation to the American Ambassador here who has been so exceptionally helpful and understanding in regard to the details of the negotiations which have had to take place in connection with the use of this grant money.  I think I should also say that we, and I am sure the Government equally, appreciate the generosity of the American people through their Congress in making this grant available.  I understand that, although they are expressed now in general terms, that the specific <Col N="1737" /> projects such as the ground limestone scheme, the agricultural institute, the eradication of tuberculosis, the grant for the pasteurisation of skimmed milk and the sterilisation of utensils, the grant for technical assistance and so on are all to be substantially the same as were presented by the former Government, our Government, when in office and initialled; in the earlier agreement perhaps they are not precisely the ones that were initialled, but as changed to meet the American view.  They are to be substantially, although covered in general terms, the ones that we had put forward.  These are the projects the Government intends to pursue.  At any rate that is what I gather.  I was doubtful about what was intended until I heard the Minister's speech.  I take it I am correct in assuming as a result of the Minister's statement that the special agreement which has yet to be negotiated in regard to these particular projects are substantially the same as those we put forward.  May I take it I am right in that?</P>

      <P>As far as we are concerned, we agree to these projects and we hope that the necessary specific agreements will be concluded without delay.  One of the problems in connection with this grant money is the delay. <Col N="1738" /> These moneys are there for certain projects but these projects might be undertaken by the State on its own account if that grant were not available and therefore in a sense the existence of the grant might possibly hold up certain projects.  From that point of view it is desirable in the public interest generally that these specific agreements with regard to the individual projects should be completed without delay.  I take it that each of these projects has got to be sanctioned either by Act of the American Congress or by Joint Resolution of the House of Representatives and the Senate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  The sanction which was given this year covers these agreements.  The details can be worked out with the Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I am not able to read the document but I think the Minister will find in the last section of it that these specific agreements when worked out in detail have also&mdash;and it is a pity&mdash;to be agreed by either an Act of Congress or by a Joint Resolution of the two Houses.  I am afraid that will mean delay because there is always pressure of work in Congress and it is not easy to get these specific proposals agreed to.  I think I am right in that.</P>

      <P>Article V of this agreement says: &ldquo;The agreement shall be subject to approval by both Governments and shall become effective on the date of exchange of ratification.&rdquo; As far as the Government of the United States is concerned the agreement is subject to approval by Act or by joint resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister is correct in that interpretation because it will help to shorten the negotiations and bring things to a head much more rapidly.  I hope that is <Col N="1739" /> so.  I was inclined to think that even these specific agreements&mdash;the subsidiary agreements&mdash;needed an Act or a joint resolution.  If that is not so, then my criticism is beside the mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that it is only necessary to ratify the general agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's assurance.  I am glad it is so, but I interpreted it differently.  Naturally in these circumstances we should give our approval and vote for the ratification of this agreement.  The Minister has spoken about some of the individual projects and I should like to refer for a moment to the lime project. It is essential for our agriculture that liming of the land be increased.  I should be sorry to think that this money coming in now would be used simply to relieve the Exchequer of the yearly grant being made.  I think it should be utilised by way of addition to the grant because as the Minister knows at the present time the needs in regard to liming are that there is the deficit of some 12,000,000 to 15,000,000 tons of ground limestone. The deficiency in our soil requires that amount at once to bring the condition of the soil up to what would be regarded as a proper condition.  In addition to that it is estimated that about 2,000,000 tons of ground limestone are required every year.  Last year the amount provided was only about 600,000 tons.  I think, therefore, that the Minister will agree that the urgency is very great, that the inducement given to farmers to lime their soil should be continued from the Exchequer and that the money provided under this agreement should be by way of addition and not by way of substitution for the grant next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the pasteurisation of milk.  It is quite obvious that steps to eliminate tuberculosis from cattle is one of the first measures that should be taken and that pasteurisation of skimmed milk is a necessary accompaniment. I believe some creameries are engaged in that work.  It is essential, therefore, to get this pasteurisation scheme through with all <Col N="1740" /> possible speed.  As regards the elimination of tuberculosis, we thought it was one of the schemes with which the United States would like to be associated.  It is a big national scheme and one that is very urgent.  It was thought that Clare County, mentioned in the agreement, was the best county to begin with but as it was mentioned in the agreement we could not go ahead with that if any of the grant money were to be applied for that purpose.  Hence speed is essential there also.  Our Government had intended to begin the scheme in County Limerick independent of the grant but I think the present Government has shifted to County Sligo.  Again the matter is urgent because things are happening in Britain which may make it essential to have this campaign carried out in a relatively short time. There is no time to be lost so far as that matter is concerned.</P>
    <P>Another of the purposes for which the grant was to be used was to assist three organisations, every one of them worthy of support&mdash;Muintir na Tíre, the Countrywomen's Association and Macra na Feirme.  There should be no trouble about getting an agreement through immediately to make grants available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>We come then to the agricultural institute project.  We have taken certain steps towards negotiations that seemed to be necessary here as a preliminary. I do not know whether the present Government will follow on the lines that we have been planning or not. The details of our plans are available on the files in the Government offices and it is a question whether the Government wish to proceed on the lines we had intended or not.  Here, too, speed is important.  I think the Minister should urge strongly upon the American Ambassador the desirability of making the subsidiary agreements without delay.  They have been considered already in the United States in general, and in particular, indeed, by representatives of the United States here.  They were also examined and, I think, accepted by what is called the F.O.A.&mdash;the Foreign Operations Administration&mdash;in the United States.  In other words, the details are worked <Col N="1741" /> out in full.  The total estimates of the cost have been made out and submitted. Therefore, now that general agreement of Congress has been received and that the specific projects have been examined, the final negotiations should proceed and be brought to a head very rapidly.  I am glad to know that I was wrong in my view that each of these specific subsidiary agreements would come into effect only when they were accepted by an Act of Congress or by a joint resolution.  I do not wish to go into the merits of any of the separate proposals as it would scarcely be relevant at this stage&mdash;for instance, what the constitution of the agricultural institute should be.  I think, however, that that would be outside the terms of the motion.  I have great pleasure in agreeing to the motion for ratification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies may like to have some particulars of the various schemes.  Deputy de Valera mentioned the lime subsidy.  That scheme was originally started in March, 1951.  At that time the number of grinding plants in operation was about 12 and the output amounted to 75,000 tons. The number of plants in operation in July of this year had increased to 40 and the output capacity to 1,500,000 tons.  In the first year of operation of the scheme the total consumption rose to 280,000 tons and in 1953-54 the figures were 648,000 tons.  The total expenditure up to the 31st March last on lime was £1,150,000.  I should say that the first of the sub-agreements which has been submitted to the United States authorities is one dealing with lime and discussions are at present proceeding on the basis of the proposals submitted.  The next one which it is hoped to submit in the near future is that dealing with bovine tuberculosis.  Deputy de Valera mentioned the fact that it had been intended to start in County Limerick originally.  While that intention is being maintained the position is that, when the agreement had not been concluded in time, the Government decided independently to go ahead and the scheme commenced in Clare, Sligo and Bansha on the 1st September last.  The Bansha scheme includes an area extending <Col N="1742" /> into County Limerick, an area in County Tipperary and, I understand, an adjoining portion of County Cork. The two schemes in County Sligo and Bansha are being financed from the National Development Fund and the cost of the intensive measures in County Clare and some other general measures throughout the country is being met temporarily from the Vote for the Department of Agriculture pending the release of grant counterpart.</P>
      <P>The proposal for pasteurisation of milk is also complementary to the one for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and it is hoped to expedite the consideration of the various projects.</P>
      <P>In connection with the establishment of the Agricultural Institute I think, as the Deputies in the House will appreciate, it is a somewhat slower matter to decide on the actual arrangements and it will probably take longer to conclude the details.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything else in which Deputies are interested at this stage except that I would like once again to express our appreciation of the magnificent assistance which has been afforded by the United States authorities and to express our gratitude to the Ambassador, Mr. Taft, for his help and co-operation and to the officials associated with him.</P>

Deputies who took part in the Committee Stage debate will recollect that objection was raised by Deputy de Valera, Deputy Sheldon and Deputy McGilligan to the retention by the Minister of any powers in relation to the council itself.  A code of control is set out in the Act of 1927 and, as I stated on Second Reading and Committee Stage, it was my view that the council should be completely removed from any form of ministerial control except in relation to the fees for registration which they might impose and also in relation to the length of time they might prescribe for different courses.  It is in order to meet that objection that these different amendments are tabled and, in effect, they remove certain controls set out in Section 19 of the Act which provided that the form of the register, for instance, should be subject to approval by the Minister and a variety of matters of that kind.  They are now being removed by these amendments.</P>

      <P>To approve.  In other words the council cannot fix a registration fee except with the consent of the Minister.  I think the Minister will accept that that is still a control.  The other control is that under the 1951 Act introduced by the Minister's predecessor, this country was brought into alignment with conditions that exist in Britain whereby on the conclusion of the ordinary curriculum it is necessary for a practitioner, before he is accepted for registration, to serve an internship in a recognised hospital for a period of 12 months or a period to be agreed upon by the examining bodies or the Registration Council itself.  The position as it stands now is that the Minister has still the controlling influence in that.  I would like to try to bring home to the Minister this point of view: In the first instance, with regard to the control of the medical registration fee it seems to me that it is unnecessary to have ministerial control there.</P>
      <P>It might be that these controls would be necessary in other associations such as those of the Veterinary Surgeons and Dentists but there does not seem sufficient reason for them in matters of health.  The position as at present obtaining is that the Medical Registration Council is financially independent of the State.  They are receiving no finances at all from the State as they were when these rules and regulations were laid down in the Act.  If we come to study the set-up of the present council we will see that it consists of a representative of all the examining bodies&mdash;those who are qualified to give a degree to anyone practising&mdash;Dublin University and the University Colleges in Dublin, Cork and Galway, the Royal College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Physicians.  Added to that you have two members of the medical profession and two members appointed by the Government.  It seems to me that the two members appointed by the Government should be an adequate safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that altogether it seems to me that it would be in the interests of this body to charge a reasonable fee, because if they do not do so they will be cutting off their nose to spite their <Col N="1747" /> face, since they themselves are the examining body and since it is in their interests to have as many people as possible competing for medical registration. If there were higher fees there would be fewer people competing.  As long as you have controls you must have the Civil Service personnel to deal with them.</P>
    <P>I think we will all agree that in this country as in the world as a whole the greatest difficulty is that when any establishment is set up there is immediately the necessity for an increase in the Civil Service personnel.  I feel sure you will want to avoid that as far as possible.  There must be a considerable file dealing with these matters in the Department of Health.  I think that the time has come when the Minister can say: &ldquo;Carry on; I do not want any more to do with you.&rdquo;  He has two representatives on the council.  This council have all the facilities necessary at their disposal; they have all the knowledge appertaining to medical education and so forth, so that does not seem necessary for the Minister to come along now with this.  One would think that he would say: &ldquo;You are free from all control.  Carry on.&rdquo;  This Bill was originally introduced for the purpose of freeing the Medical Registration Council from State control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to the amendment and to the matters referred to by Deputy Dr. Esmonde are as follows.  Under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1951, the council is given power to make regulations dealing with specific matters. First of all they could make regulations regarding internship before final registration.  That provision was contained in Section 3 of the 1951 Act, which also makes provision for the distinction between medical service and midwifery.  Section 3, sub-section (6), deals with a person claiming registration by virtue of a diploma granted on passing a qualifying examination held by two or more bodies jointly; Section 7 makes provision for provisional registration; Section 8, sub-section (10), states that the form and mode of application for provisional registration and the evidence to be given by an <Col N="1748" /> applicant of his title to be so registered shall be such as may be prescribed; so that all the regulations made by the council under the 1951 Act require the consent of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The amendment that I am now proposing removes the necessity for ministerial consent in every case except in the two cases with regard to the prescribing of a period under sub-section (1) of Section 3 or the prescribing of a fee under sub-section (2) of Section 7. With regard to both of those matters, Deputies will appreciate that there is a matter of public interest involved and that in order that the public interest may be served it is necessary that the person who is charged on behalf of the public with dealing with these matters should have these very minimum powers.  For instance, it might be quite wrong to have the situation here where, according to our laws, somebody could hold himself out as a medical practitioner who is not registered as such.  There is to that extent a very proper monopoly given in the practice of medicine.  Registration cannot be effected unless the fee for registration is paid by the person applying, nor can it be effected unless the person seeking registration does the period of internship prescribed by the council.  In those circumstances, since registration is necessary to practise, it does appear to me to be reasonable that the Minister's approval should be sought to the scale of fees and to the period of internship. It is not very much power to retain and I feel sure Deputy Dr. Esmonde will be very glad to know that when this Bill is passed the file in my Department will be closed.</P>

      <P>It would be helpful at this stage if the Minister could give us some more concrete information as to what the purpose of this section is. This is the section by which one local authority can be asked to perform the duties of another.  It is important in this connection to know exactly what the Minister visualises, what he wants to effect by this, what are the problems that made such a section as this necessary.  The opening sub-section states the conditions under which the section would apply, that is, where:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  a local authority are of opinion it will be more convenient that any power, function or duty which may be exercised or performed by them should be exercised or performed, whether generally or in a particular case, by another local authority, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the other local authority are able and willing so to exercise or perform the power, function or duty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is only in those two cases, on the face of that section, that any transfer of duties or powers can take place, and I take it that is what the Minister is concerned with?</P>

      <P>In other words, it is a matter of freedom for them to contract in this matter.  Thereafter it is a question of the position of the employee.  In regard to employees this relates us back to Section 7 in this Bill with which we have already dealt. This provision in Section 7 made it mandatory on the part of the officers of the local authority to perform the duties of another local authority, and the Minister at this stage pointed out that if he had not some such provision as Section 7 that Section 58 could be completely defeated.  I think the Minister undertook at that time, at our request, to introduce an amendment which would amend Section 7 to restrict the imposition of duties on an officer to duties appropriate to him. But there is a little bit more than this in it.  In the case of this section if a local authority undertakes powers and duties or some duties on behalf of another local authority and these substantially affect the burden of the work which the officers of that authority have to do, I think there is a problem there that it is only right we should look at now.  It is not in <Col N="1751" /> the section but it arises on this section.</P>
      <P>The provisions of Section 7 are quite all right in regard to the local authority from the point of view which the Minister took but we are back here under Section 58 to this question: where is the point which determines the reasonableness of asking, say, a county engineer or some other officer to undertake work in addition to the work which he would normally have to do?  How far can this section mean a variation of the terms of the employment of people who are already employed by local authorities under contract, and variation in the sense of deterioration in the conditions of employment from their point of view?  A lot of that argument could be merely academic and if pressed could be unreasonable as the Minister pointed out when we were arguing on Section 7. On the other hand, there is a residue there of possibility where these people could suffer grave injustice and it could particularly arise where there would be a load put on over and above what would be the normal work of the engineer or the other officer in the particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the wording of the section it does not seem to be a matter for amendment within this section itself but it does appear that, say, in Section 7 or some other section some safeguard for these officers should be provided. There is a further point in this and perhaps I would speak somewhat differently to the members of local authorities in this matter: this Section 58 as it is drafted is a section which is conferring powers on the local authority and in so far as the powers are conferred there rather than on the central authority it is a good thing. But this transfer of work is to be a reserve function in effect.  The agreement to do so depends on the free contract of the two local authorities and it is one of those matters where a contract is to be made by the local authority rather than by the manager as a reserve function.  In that case there is always a certain amount of danger that the question of overloading an engineer by attaching more labour and duties to a particular office <Col N="1752" /> than were envisaged at the time of the contract could arise.  That is a matter which should be noticed on the passing of this section.  It seems perfectly reasonable that the section itself should be given.  In view of what I have said an amendment, in further consideration of Section 7 on the Report Stage, is indicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the section we are now discussing is one which because of the fact that it is under what is called a reserve function will go further than just, say, roads. Take, for instance, the case of the City of Dublin.  Recognising that quite a number of Dublin citizens go for holidays for periods to seaside resorts adjacent to Dublin City but not actually in the city area, the Dublin Corporation has agreed with the county council when the two bodies met over the extended area that in order to facilitate the provision of amenities for Dublin City citizens at seaside resorts outside their own jurisdiction, they would provide, for instance, water from the Corporation reservoirs and they would arrange for a certain amount of water even for citizens of the county.  That work&mdash; by arrangement, by discussion or agreement&mdash;would be done by the officers, say, of the Dublin City organisation.</P>
      <P>I do not read into Section 7 anything that is likely to be dangerous in connection with this particular section because obviously if the city authority agrees to do certain road work or water work in the adjacent territory by agreement or by arrangement, it is obviously our own officials who will have to do that work.  There is, however, sometimes a discussion that, as distinct from the officials and servants, the neighbouring body might suggest that for unskilled work, and so forth, persons living actually in the area where the work is being done or what is described as the weekly wage earners should be employed from that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But that is all a matter of agreement between the two bodies and it is not similar&mdash;I think what Deputy de Valera had in mind is what I have also in mind&mdash;to the objection we had in <Col N="1753" /> discussing under another section the power&mdash;if you like&mdash;of the Minister to direct an official of one local authority to operate, not necessarily in a neighbouring local authority area but maybe far beyond that.  And even if it was in a neighbouring area it might not be work or duties of the nature that Deputy de Valera has referred to. So far as I can understand the section, once the reserve functions are preserved, once it is a matter between the whole body and agreement is reached, I do not think there is any great objection to this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments advanced by Deputies de Valera and Briscoe are arguments which could be advanced and were advanced by them on Section 7 of the Bill, a section which has been passed.  Their main concern appears to be that an officer of a local authority may be asked to do work for another local authority from which he receives no remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is the main point that Deputy de Valera had. That is the point on which I referred the Deputy to Section 7 which has been accepted by the House.  The Deputy should also bear in mind that under Section 10 of the 1941 Act an official has the right of appeal to the Minister if he is displeased with the duties assigned to him by the mutual agreement of any two local authorities, his own employer and another local authority.  He has the right of appeal. He is also protected by Section 19 (2) of the present Bill which enables different rates of remuneration to be fixed for different offices of the same grade.  That gives him certain protection, but, as Deputy Briscoe says he does not see a lot of objection to the section as it stands, I do not propose to delay the House further by discussing it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  by the substitution in sub-section (1) of &ldquo;the manager for the local authority may, with the consent of the Minister, appear <Col N="1755" /> separately at the inquiry and such appearance may be personal or by counsel or solicitor&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Minister may, if he so thinks proper, order that the manager for the local authority may appear separately at the inquiry&rdquo;, and</P>
    <P>(b)  by the substitution for sub-section (2) of the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2)  Where the manager for a local authority appears separately at a local inquiry pursuant to sub-section (1) of this section, the employment and instruction of the counsel or solicitor appearing at the inquiry on behalf of the local authority shall be a reserved function.</P>
    <P>Section 90 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1946, provides that where a local inquiry to be held under Section 83 of the Act of 1941, is concerned with the whole or part of the functions of a local authority, the Minister may, if he so thinks fit, order that the manager for the local authority to appear separately at the inquiry.</P>
    <P>In his judgment in the Supreme Court case of McCarthy versus Cavan County Council and Minister for Local Government, Justice Lavery implied that this sub-section made it mandatory on the manager to appear at the inquiry if the Minister made an Order. The proposed amendment to Section 90 will make the manager's appearance optional.</P>
    <P>The amendment as proposed at paragraph (b) is in effect a re-enactment of Section 90 (2) (c) of the 1946 Act. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the elected members will be the party instructing counsel if the manager appears separately at a local inquiry.  This amendment arises out of the judgment of Mr. Justice Lavery in the case of McCarthy versus Cavan County Council and the Minister for Local Government, and it is merely to clarify the position.</P>

    <P>Section 91 of the Local Government Act, 1946, provides that where a local inquiry has been held under Section 83 of the Act of 1941 and the Minister considers it reasonable that a contribution shall be made towards the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by any person (other than a local authority or other body) in relation to the inquiry, the Minister may certify that the contribution shall be made and the certificate shall specify the amount of the contribution and direct its payment to such person, by the local authorities concerned.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Minister will have power under Section 91 to direct, after a local inquiry has been held, that a contribution towards the cost and expenses incurred by a manager appearing separately at a local inquiry will be made by the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>I would refer the House to the judgment given in the Supreme Court case of McCarthy versus Cavan County Council and the Minister for Local Government where Mr. Justice Lavery held that unless the limitation of the costs was made prior to the appearance of the manager at the inquiry the Minister could not limit them at a later date.  This amendment enables the Minister to fix or direct the amounts to be paid after the hearing of the inquiry.  It stands to reason that it is very difficult to limit the costs to be incurred prior to the holding of the inquiry because one cannot anticipate the length of the inquiry and when the inquiry is over I respectfully suggest to the House is the appropriate time to assess the costs. It is for that purpose that this amendment has been put in.</P>

    <P>The passing of a resolution under the second or third paragraph of this sub-section shall be a reserved function.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment which was approved some time ago and the main purpose of which is to provide for the amendment of Section 67 of the Local Government Act, 1946, to provide that where a county council or joint mental hospital board so decides by resolution for the payment to any member residing within five miles of the place of meeting, when attendance at the meeting necessitates absence from his home for not less than three hours, of an inclusive allowance not exceeding a prescribed amount to cover travelling expenses and subsistence in lieu of, and not in addition to, any subsistence <Col N="1759" /> allowance to which the member might otherwise be entitled.</P>

This amendment merely provides for their subsistence.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling. On the section, would the Minister agree to introduce on the Report Stage an amendment to reduce the distance of five miles to one mile?  I might tell the Minister, and I am sure Deputy Larkin will agree with me, that there are almost daily meetings held.  Sometimes members have to attend meetings two or three times on the one day. For instance, last Monday we had a civics building meeting at 3 o'clock; we had a bridges meeting at 4 o'clock, and we had a public session at a quarter to seven.  Practically all the members had to come and go twice. Some went home, but some had to go to a neighbouring inn in order to find the stamina for the next meeting.  I <Col N="1760" /> know the Minister is anxious to get this Committee Stage finished to-night.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that this is on a par with what he calls the subsistence in the country town. The City of Dublin is now a very comprehensive unit and even for a member who lives only two miles away, attending one of these meetings can almost approximate to going out of town for the day.  The Minister must agree that we give the staff in the Custom House plenty to do as a result of our meetings.  Will the Minister agree on the Report Stage to incorporate an amendment in similar terms to that tabled by Deputy Larkin and myself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Deputy Briscoe.  Dublin Corporation has a very large membership and the majority of the members attend anything from one to half a dozen meetings each week.  Many of them attend a meeting in the morning, go home to lunch and come back again in the afternoon.  That is a frequent occurrence.  The Minister may possibly say that if they do not want to incur this expense they should not go forward. Of course, these representatives go forward in order to look after the interests of the people who elect them. Some members lose time in having to get off from work to attend meetings. Some are not paid for the time they lose.  People who are interested in local affairs should not be penalised because they are anxious to serve the interests of those who elected them. One particular area, near mine, covers a distance of at least four miles and a member living on the outside of that area may have difficulty.  We would appeal to the Minister to consider this problem between this and the Report Stage and do something to assist these people.  I have only a short experience as a Deputy but I am sure the Minister will agree that those who represent the people on the local authority give even more time to the affairs of their constituents than do Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a lot of sympathy with the argument put forward by Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Larkin, but members of local authorities here <Col N="1761" /> are in an entirely different position from those on local authorities in the rural areas.  We have no provision for members of urban council or town commissioners for the simple reason that most of those bodies meet at night after the day's work is done.  The Dublin Corporation always meets at night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister misunderstands the situation.  The monthly meeting is usually held at night.  We are talking of committee meetings, of which there are many.  They meet from 11 o'clock until lunch, and from 3 until 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening.</P>

      <P>In the last five years members of the housing committee have had to attend a meeting practically every Friday morning.  The same is true of the public health committees. There are, too, many subcommittees. The only meeting that takes place at night is the monthly meeting of the council, and we are not raising the position of the council here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two answers to that.  The first answer is the obvious one.  Deputies are now endeavouring to discuss on the section an amendment which covers only travelling expenses.  So far as I know one can travel from one part of the City of Dublin to another for the sum of 4d.  Am I right?  Add 6d. to it if you wish.  Make it 6d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of us have cars, and our experience is that if we go on public business to the City Hall and leave our cars twice or three times outside the City Hall, we have to pay 1/-each time to the attendant at the public car park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I know people from rural Ireland who come to the city and who park their cars at the boundary of the city.  They have to pay 1/- each to the car park attendant and perhaps another 1/- to get a bus in and out of the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I hope the Deputy will not think that I am being personal.  I appreciate that both he and Deputy Larkin are not speaking for themselves but for the members of the corporation generally.  If I address the Deputy, I do not wish to address him in a personal way.  I address him as the person who spoke on the section.  However, when you think that a member of a local authority in rural Ireland has often to travel 50 or 60 miles to a meeting and has sometimes to stay overnight, you will have to agree that he is in an entirely different position from a member of the corporation travelling from Donnybrook or from the North side to the City Hall.  However, I do believe that the corporation committees are numerically too large.  I think that if committees were cut down&mdash;and I refer not only to Dublin Corporation but to committees all over the country &mdash;there would be less travelling expenses and less out of pocket expenses incurred by the various local authorities and we would have less taxes to pay to provide these travelling expenses. There are two suggestions which I would make to the Deputies who have spoken on this section.  One <Col N="1763" /> is to cut down the number of committees and the second is to use buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I appreciate the Minister's statement that he is not making any personal reference to either Deputy Briscoe or myself?  There are, however, members of the Dublin Corporation who from time to time have no employment or who are employed temporarily or who are employed and paid only a labourer's rate of wages.  Yet these are valuable members of some of our committees.  They give their time in the evenings and at the week-ends to these meetings.  On many occasions, when they may get off from their employment to attend meetings, their employers have been known to stop wages for the time they were absent. I put this reasonable proposition to the Minister.  Whatever sins of commission or omission the Dublin Corporation may have been guilty of, they have not in the past been guilty of inflicting burdens on the ratepayers either for travelling or subsistence allowance because we never had any. We put the reasonable suggestion to the Minister to look at the problem and to try to do something so that if a labourer, a shop assistant or a clerk on a low rate of wages, wishes to become elected on the local council and succeeds in doing so, he will not be obliged to spend 5/- or 10/- a week travelling to these meetings and receive no refund for that outlay.  The Minister says we can reduce the number of committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister is not aware that many of the committees consist of four or five or half a dozen people and that on many occasions it has been necessary to reduce the number of members because the people who have been appointed to these committees cannot attend them. We are not suggesting for one moment that people travelling ten, 20 or 40 miles are not entitled to an allowance for travelling expenses but we are suggesting that those who have no means or who have very little means should not be handicapped if they are <Col N="1764" /> chosen by the people to represent them on the local authorities.  Deputy Briscoe and I are not interested in this personally but we say to the Minister that the only section on the Dublin Corporation which receives any travelling or subsistence allowance is the Mental Hospital Committee. Members of a public body who travel to Grangegorman get travelling and subsistence allowances but they can travel three times a day to the City Hall or to any other section where the corporation conducts its business and they are not reimbursed one penny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has asked for some information and he is in need of it because the advice he has got about the procedure and membership of some of these committees is quite wrong.  I have a booklet here which gives a list of various committees. We have a bridges committee consisting of ten members; a civic museum committee consisting of ten members; a civic offices committee consisting of ten members; a civil defence committee consisting of ten members; an Easter Week memorial committee consisting of nine members; a finance and general purposes committee which is composed of all members of the council; a housing committee, also composed of all members of the council; a housing allocation sub-committee consisting of about 12 members; a housing, planning and construction sub-committee consisting of ten members; a building sites sub-committee consisting of nine members; a libraries advisory committee consisting of ten members; a markets committee consisting of about ten members; a national monuments committee consisting of five members; an old age pensions committee consisting of about ten members; a public health committee consisting of all members of the council; a scholarship committee consisting of about ten members; a selection committee consisting of ten members; a swimming and baths committee consisting of five members; a town planning and streets committee consisting of all members; a traffic sub-committee consisting of ten members; a school meals committee consisting of 12 members with some outside representatives; <Col N="1765" /> a County Borough of Dublin Vocational Education Committee consisting of about ten members. Then we have the corporation representatives on joint boards and committees. On the City of Dublin Child Welfare Committee there are six or seven representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what we would like to know and that is exactly why we want more understanding <Col N="1766" /> from the Custom House.  I am a member of a number of committees and Deputy Larkin is a member of a number of committees.  I happen to be chairman of at least seven committees. The chairman, at least, has to turn up at every meeting of his committee.  We have representatives on the Adelaide Hospital, Berwick Home, Dalkey, The Charitable Infirmary, Jervis Street. The Cheeverstown Convalescent Home for Little Children, The Convalescent Home, Stillorgan, City of Dublin skin and Cancer Hospital, Hume Street. Coombe Hospital, Dr. Steevens' Hospital, The Drumcondra Hospital. Incorporated Orthopaedic Hospital of Ireland, The Incorporated Dental Hospital, Mercers' Hospital, National Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street, The National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, Rotunda Hospital.

      <P>We have a special works committee which is operating in recent times and it has 12 members.  Does the Minister not realise the difficulty, no matter how we divide up the 45, even if we put two, three, four, five and, on main committees, ten?  There are only three committees where there is full membership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only four where there is full membership because these were the most important of the committees.  Does the Minister think that we are not taking our position seriously?  As Deputy Larkin said &mdash;I did not want to put it in that way but it is perfectly true&mdash;there are working men representing certain areas who, if they are interested in their work, as they are, when they take an afternoon off lose an afternoon's pay and we are imposing on them their car-fare as well.  If they stay for two or three meetings in one day they probably have to find the means of getting a bite to eat somewhere. We have a number of these men from time to time and, as Councillor <Col N="1767" /> Larkin said, we have on occasions men who become unemployed but who carry on their work in the corporation.</P>

We cater for one-fifth of the population of Ireland in the City of Dublin under our administration, and we will be catering for a lot more as things appear at the moment and 45 members are not without the burden of office.  It is not an easy job.  They get no salary.  They get nothing.  We say that the least they should get is car fare to and from their meetings if they live over a mile distance from the place where the meeting is held.  That is not asking much.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not got any picture at all, whether it has been deliberately withheld from him or whether it has been made into some kind of cartoon for him.  Every one of these committees has a job to do and every one of these jobs is important and unless you can facilitate people to go to and from these meetings you will not have the necessary number there.  A quorum is fixed.  The quorum is always less than the membership.  Sometimes it is impossible for certain members to turn up.  What we are asking for here is not worth all this discussion.  I thought the Minister would say &ldquo;Certainly&rdquo; and let us get on with the remaining sections, but apparently he is holding out against this.  Why, I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene only because of a statement made by the Minister, in connection with the type of committee mentioned by Deputy Briscoe.  It is only fair to say that many of these people would be connected with voluntary hospitals. Although these people are members of local authorities in the country, there is no provision, one way or the other, for giving them subsistence allowances. The Minister said that the answer to the problem was to reduce the numbers on these various sub-committees.  That is where I do not agree with him. From my own experience down the country if a sub-committee is being set up and it is confined to a few members, it is the over-popular members of the various Parties who get on the committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the position be that where you have 45 members on a local authority only a small number, say six or seven, are put on a committee?  In such cases we would find that on a very important committee, carrying out important work, only a few of the over-popular members would find themselves elected. These members might be hopeless in trying to put up a case and the result is that when their meetings were reported back to the council the council would find that through the low standard of their deliberations a full day was wasted.  That is why I cannot agree with the Minister that it would solve the problem if the committee were reduced.  Every member on a council should be entitled to act on a these committees such as those referred to by Deputy Briscoe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add a few words to those of Deputy Briscoe.  It <Col N="1772" /> appears that the Minister is not prepared in this case to legislate for what has been suggested in this amendment. Everyone must realise that there are difficulties imposed on members of local authorities attending meetings of public boards.  I have in mind such boards as the Cork Street Hospital on which three members of Dublin County Council are nominated.  One of those members travels every week before 9 a.m. in order to be in time for the meeting.  He travels 25 miles because it is approximately 12 miles to and from his place of residence.  While both the Cork Street Hospital Board and the local authority concerned are prepared to recommend the payment of travelling expenses to persons nominated to act on the board, there is no legal power for the payment of expenses.  The power can only come from the Department of Local Government. These members are elected to serve the public and in serving the public on various committees of a certain type they are not permitted to get travelling expenses.  They are required to work just as hard as they are when acting on their parent body. The Meath Hospital Board would be another public body on which Dublin County Council members have to serve without expenses.  I think all these questions have been overlooked and I think that we do not generally appreciate the heavy expenses which are incurred by members of local authorities acting on a number of these public boards for which they are elected to act in the normal way in the normal local elections.  I feel that in order to rectify this position consideration should be given to the submitting of an amendment dealing with the matter at a later stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>For whomsoever it applies to.  A couple of things arise out of the discussion.  Deputy Briscoe simply made the case, as I understand his case, and I heard other Deputies support him, that this provision should, in some way, be extended to embrace the Dublin Corporation.  In regard to travelling expenses, he made a suggestion which was ruled out, not by the Minister but by virtue of a Standing Order of the House.  It would be competent, of course for, the Minister to introduce such an amendment here and I think that that is a reasonable request to make.  The case Deputy Briscoe is making here is that the section is incomplete and that if we are amending Section 80 of the Act of 1941 and Section 67 of the Act of 1946, we could profitably amend the Act in all particulars in respect of these matters here.</P>
      <P>First of all, I conceive there is not any great necessity for amending the section to bring in Dublin Corporation because I take it that I am correct in saying that under Section 80 (1) (c) an Order under sub-section (2) could be made to include any local authority whatsover, so there is no legislative amendment needed to cover that point, at least that would appear to be the position from a cursory glance at the section.  If that is so, then it is a purely administrative act for the Miniter to go so far; thereafter it is a question as to whether or not the suggestions that have been made by other Deputies, Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Larkin, should not be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am merely saying those few words in an endeavour to clarify whatever the position is here.  It seems to me that these Deputies were very much <i>ad rem</i> in respect of the section but whether their case is one which should be accepted is another point.  In regard to the many committees that are involved in travelling expenses I doubt whether a provision such as has been suggested would materially help. However, they would be more experienced and know what the position was there.  Would the Minister be able to <Col N="1774" /> say at this stage whether he would be prepared to extend the provisions to a body such as the Dublin Corporation on the assumption that Section 80 of the 1941 Act and Section 67 of the 1946 Act are the only two sections governing the matter?  It would appear that at the present moment there is no provision for dealing with Dublin Corporation at all.  Is anything being done in that regard?  Is there anyone drawing expenses in that regard in Dublin Corporation?  If there are not then notice should be taken of the remarks that have been made by Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Larkin.  It seems to me that a simple administrative Order would meet the position and that no actual legislation is necessary.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister was going around to ascertain from local authorities some of their <Col N="1775" /> grievances, and he paid us amongst others the compliment and honour of his presence in a visit to the Dublin Corporation.  We have not asked for very much yet because we are expecting great things under the County Management Amending Bill which was introduced to-day.  Surely what we are asking for here is of practically no consequence. If there was a matter of high principle involved I would like the Minister to tell us about it.  We are not asking for subsistence.  As Deputy Larkin pointed out we are asking that where a person lives within the border of five miles from the City Hall he should be enabled to recoup the transport charge by some maximum agreed figure so that he can go to and from his work in the City Hall even if it happens to be twice a day on certain days, where he might be a member of two committees, one meeting in the morning at 11 o'clock and the other at 3.o'clock in the afternoon. Last Monday we had four meetings. I attended three of them; I was not as the 11 o'clock one.  The Minister says he is debarred because no Order has been made up to the present bringing Dublin local authority within the ambit of Section 80 of the 1941 Act.  It is very simple for him to make that Order and then reduce the mileage as we have suggested.  I do not believe that any member of the corporation has recouped himself in regard to travelling charges no matter how far he lives from the corporation.  His official residence is the residence within the area where he is elected but surely the Minister can see what we are asking is not unreasonable.  I do not see why there is so much fuss.  I thought we would have that settled in three minutes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin had a perfect right to ask the Minister to give increased grants to old age pensioners, to give increased wages or to give increased allowances.  It is perfectly in <Col N="1777" /> order but we cannot introduce an amendment on which to have the issue challenged by a division.  It is out of order.  I do not want to appear to be obstreperous but I do not think the Minister has given a single reason that would justify his dismissing this matter as if it were absolutely of no consequence and that the members of the authority concerned had no fundamental right to request it.</P>
      <P>I was not going to ask him to give a promise to bring this in on the Fourth stage of this Bill, but I would ask for a promise that possibly he might include it in the City Management (Amendment) Bill.  The city corporation has been restored, I think, since 1928 and the membership of the present councillors will probably expire next June, and it will not concern them for longer than that period.  But there will be an election in June and a new council, and even if the Minister said that this would take effect in relation to the new council&mdash;if the Minister thinks there is something in the point I am making&mdash;and says: &ldquo;I am not prepared to do it on this Bill, but I am prepared to consider it for the City Management (Amendment) Bill,&rdquo; I think we would be satisfied with that.</P>

      <P>There is a rather peculiar contrast here.  On the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Board there are 19 representatives of the corporation.  They need not all be members of the corporation and some of them are nominated by the corporation.  Yet, under the various Health Acts each and every member of that board can travel to Grangegorman, if they are over three miles away from their residence, attend a meeting, and get a travelling allowance. At least 12 or 14 of these members on that board are also members of the corporation.  They can travel twice that distance and much more frequently to attend to the business of the corporation and they do not get any travelling allowance.</P>

There was not one solitary plea made by Deputy Briscoe for payment of travelling expenses for members of the corporation. But Deputy Allen did make a plea and the plea he made was this: that subsistence or travelling allowances should be given to members of county councils who resided in the towns in which the council meets.  He made that plea to the Minister and,&mdash;may I quote Deputy Allen:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister must get his mind off the 2d. tram in the city, and the men who can get home to their lunch by means of the 2d. tram.  I would ask the Minister to amend that now if he has power to do so.  I think it would be a pity to spoil a good day's work. ...</P>
      <P>Mr. MacEntee: It would be preposterous for a member of the Wexford County Councils, living in the town of Wexford, to be able to get a meal at the expense of the ratepayers. There was implied originally in membership of these local authorities the idea of personal sacrifice in order to render public service.</P>
      <P>Mr. Allen: That may have been so 40 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. MacEntee: That is so, but people are very glad to be privileged to represent their neighbours on local authorities.  While I should like to do this as it does not appear to <Col N="1779" /> be very great, I certainly would not agree that it would be proper that people who can quite easily and conveniently secure refreshments after the proceedings of a meeting should be entitled to do that at the expense of the ratepayers.  That was a fundamental principle underlying our local government law and I do not want to depart from that principle in any very significant way, in such a way as would perhaps overthrow altogether what is an essential element in it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What Deputy Allen appealed for then is now given to the county councils under this Bill, under the preceding section.  I have now given to Deputy Allen what he wanted and what he pleaded to Deputy MacEntee, for and which Deputy MacEntee, the then Minister, did not give him.  So soon as I do that, we have Deputy Briscoe coming along and asking me to go further, to do something he did not even ask his own Minister to do when he was sitting behind him.  I think I have gone a long way to meet the members of local authorities.  I have gone a long way towards meeting them and if my successor would go the same distance on some future occasion&mdash;maybe that can be done.</P>

      <P>The Minister is making his argument now on the fact that in <Col N="1780" /> 1946 I sat silent behind the then Minister for Local Government, when, as he says when he quotes Deputy Allen, we had the trams and the 2d. fares. May I remind the Minister that we have no trams now and that the 2d. fare is gone?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister brings into that argument that it would not be fair to have Deputy Larkin and myself having refreshments at the expense of the ratepayers.  We are not asking for any allowances for refreshment.  Allowances do not come in.  We are saying that circumstances have changed, that the City of Dublin is twice as big as it was and that some members have to travel just under five miles backwards and forwards to meetings and we say that they are just as entitled to get their travel money recouped for their duties of public service on local authorities as are members of this House who are given travel allowances for going backwards and forwards to the Dáil. I want to remind the Minister that there is no question of subsistence in this and refreshment is knocked on the head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not interested in liquid refreshment at the moment. We are interested in transport and in seeing if there is any sense or reason in the Minister's argument.  If I did not raise my voice in 1946 on behalf of the Dublin City Councillors, the circumstances were quite different then from what they are now even in accordance with the Minister's own arguments.  The 2d. fare is gone and so is the tram and it costs now possibly 2d/- a day in fares for a member to travel from certain areas of the city backwards and forwards.  As I said <Col N="1781" /> before, when I read out a list of the committees that are functioning, these committees are justified in their existence and if he wants to see the book he will see the number of committees and how many committees a particular member serves on.  I am very disappointed that the Minister is making arguments against this request, arguments which have no basis at all in relation to the subject as we see it.  I am again asking the Minister if he does not want to do it now to give us an undertaking that he will consider it in drafting the amending legislation for the City and County Management Acts.  We will be content with that. I believe that if he does consider it the reactions of his own judgment will be in its favour and I am sure even Deputy Davin would guide him in the direction we are endeavouring to go because there is nothing unreasonable in what we are asking.  If he gives us that undertaking, or even if Deputy Davin says he will examine it in relation to the county management (amendment) legislation, I will be satisfied.</P>

      <P>Is there anything that city Deputies see country representatives getting that they do not want to get it for themselves?  That is all I want to know.  Deputy Briscoe referred to travelling allowances and so forth. I would like to remind the Deputy that there is no comparison between the members of city local authorities, who have to pay a tuppenny fare, and the members of rural local authorities who have to travel 30 or 40 miles and who receive no travelling allowances.  I appeal to the Minister to stand absolutely firm on this.  Members of the local authorities in Cork City and Dublin City have not so far to travel. Their meetings are held at a time to suit themselves.  Members of rural local authorities must leave their homes in the morning and spend the day travelling to the meeting and attending the meeting and they spend much more than a travelling allowance.  I do not know what these corporation representatives are after, but I would like this matter to be considered on a higher plane, namely, that of Deputies' allowances. We will have a lot to say then.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat amazed to find Deputy Corry and the Minister seeing eye to eye.  There appears to me to be some conspiracy between the rural areas as against the unfortunate people in the Dublin Corporation.  I am not now referring to Deputy Briscoe and myself.  I am talking about the people who are not Deputies, who never were Deputies and who never will be Deputies.  It is their ambition to serve the citizens. It might be very easy for many of the people about whom I am talking to say: &ldquo;All right; we will hold our meetings at night time and compel the local authority employees to come back at right.&rdquo;  Many of the meetings of the Dublin Corporation cannot be <Col N="1784" /> held at night because they cover such a wide field.  It would be very easy for the members to decide not to go forward.  The Minister must appreciate that the members of Dublin Corporation and other local authorities are of value to the community and give good service, just as much as their opposite numbers on the county councils, perhaps more so than some of them on the county councils.  I do not see why members of county boroughs and town commissioners should be discriminated against any longer.  Possibly members of county councils and urban councils had a little more influence in the earlier years since the Minister was kind enough to inform us that a member from a rural area raised the question of their particular problem. I am very happy to have Deputy Briscoe agreeing with me on this matter.  We often disagree.  We disagreed very bitterly the other night and will again, I hope, to-morrow. We are appealing to the Minister to exercise ordinary common justice towards people who give their services entirely free and at some sacrifice to themselves.</P>

The next point is that it is not a question of giving any one part of the country a concession at the expense of another.

      <P>Does he not see the merit of the amendment?  If the Minister accepts the amendment on its merits, there will be no need for me to make a case for it, but if he will not indicate that he is doing so I will make the case in detail.  The following statement occurs in the Minister's own Explanatory Memorandum:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Dublin, Balrothery and Rathdown Public Assistance districts are co-terminous with the areas occupied by the former Dublin, Balrothery and Rathdown Unions.  The Public Assistance Act, 1939, which makes this provision does not provide for an alteration of the boundaries. Such an alteration would be necessary if existing local government boundaries in the areas affected were to be adjusted.  It is proposed in Section 66 to take the necessary power to alter the boundaries by Ministerial Order.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of our amendment is that it shall be done, as the Minister can do it by Ministerial Order, after consultation with the Dublin City Council and the Dublin County Council because obviously if the Minister proceeded to alter the boundaries without any consultation with the local areas friction would be bound to arise afterwards. All that is asked is that if the Minister decides to make certain alterations in the boundaries, he will consult with the local authorities affected.  Will the Minister accept the amendment on that reasoning, or does he wish me to go further?</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Amendment of Aliens Act, 1935&mdash; Motion.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> That, in order to relieve the acute congestion which exists in rural areas in the State, particularly in the West of Ireland, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should forthwith introduce proposals for legislation to amend the Aliens Act, 1935, so as to ensure that aliens shall not acquire land suitable for agricultural purposes or the relief of congestion unless they have at least ten years permanent residence in the State; Dáil Éireann further considers that such legislation should be retrospective to the 1st day of January, 1945.&mdash;Deputies McQuillan and Finucane.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment in my name and in the names of Deputies Gearóid Mac Pharthaláin and Blaney:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words from and including &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;, in line 3, down to the end of the motion, and substitute &ldquo;make further and better provision for the solution of this problem&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was pointing out to the House during the debate on this motion that I felt the movers of the motion were agitated by the failure of the Land Commission and the law of the State, in so far as it went, to relieve the land slum problem. The amendment is to delete certain words after the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; in the motion and the motion would then read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, in order to relieve the acute congestion which exists in rural areas in the State, particularly in the West of Ireland, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should forthwith make further and better provision for the solution of this problem.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled the amendment, Sir, because I thought I would be able to convince Deputy McQuillan that his motion as it stands on the Order Paper, whatever good intentions may be behind it, is asking for something that is already there.  The motion asks for the introduction of proposals for legislation to amend the Aliens Act, 1935, so as to ensure that aliens shall not acquire land suitable for agricultural purposes or <Col N="1790" /> the relief of congestion, and so forth. There is power under the very Act that Deputy McQuillan seeks to amend to deal with the matter that is agitating his mind.  I refer the Deputy in particular to Section 5 of the Aliens Act, 1935, which provides, under subsection (1):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, if and whenever he thinks proper, do by Order (in this Act referred to as an Aliens Order) all or any of the following things in respect either of all aliens of a particular nationality or otherwise of a particular class, or of particular aliens, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) prohibit the aliens to whom the Order relates from landing in or entering Saorsatát Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 5 goes further and in subsection (1) (f) provides that the Minister may:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;require such aliens to reside or remain in particular districts or places in Saorstát Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We pause there for a moment.  If an alien acquires land or goes to acquire land in the County of Roscommon or County Mayo the Minister for Justice can say to him &ldquo;I will not allow you to live in County Mayo&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will not allow you to live in County Roscommon&rdquo;. Under Section 5, paragraph (g), the Minister may:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Prohibit such aliens from residing or remaining in particular districts or places in Saorstát Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that the Minister for Justice, under the law of the land, can say to an alien in any county in Ireland &ldquo;get out&rdquo; and he has no answer.  If, for instance, an alien purchases land in any particular area the Minister for Justice can give him his walking papers there and then if he so desires.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (h) of the same section provides that the Minister may:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;require such aliens to comply, while in Saorstát Éireann, with particular provisions as to registration, change of abode, travelling, employment, occupation, and other like matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that the Minister for Justice, under <Col N="1791" /> that particular paragraph, can say to any alien in this State, &ldquo;I will not allow you to engage in agriculture.  I will not allow you to farm land&rdquo;.  In addition to all these powers under the Aliens Act, 1935, that I have already cited, I would further refer the House to Section 11 of the same Act which provides that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by Order make regulations in relation to any matter or thing referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed, but no such regulation shall be made in relation to the amount of a fee without the consent of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And there is the usual provision that every regulation under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  So that, under Section 11 the Minister is empowered under this very Act, if the present powers are not sufficient, and I think they are, to make regulations even to the extent of repealing Section 3, because it has been decided that a statutory regulation now can repeal sections or other statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the motion as tabled by the movers, asks for proposals for legislation that already exists.  I can quite understand the movers of the motion, particularly Deputy McQuillan. I think he stated that he was not familiar with the law and the technicalities of the matter, but I am quite sure that Deputy MacBride, to whom I listened when the motion was being discussed on the last occasion, was well aware of the provisions that I am dealing with now.  Deputy MacBride knew quite well that if he has any case in point all he has got to do, if he is worried about any alien, is to persuade the Minister for Justice or the present Government to deal with him.  There are ample powers for the Government so to do and for the Minister so to do. If we are sincere, we have no business coming into this House, talking with our tongues in our cheeks about powers that we know are there.  If in a particular instance there is a problem that Deputy MacBride knows of and is interested in, all he has to do is to go <Col N="1792" /> to the Minister for Justice under this section and ask him to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>I realise that the main matter agitating the minds of the people who have moved the motion is the land slum problem.  I am convinced that the measures so far taken to deal with the land slum problem and congestion have been ineffective.  For that reason I also ask that further measures should be taken to deal with the land slum problem.</P>
    <P>In particular, I would refer the House to the utter failure of the Land Commission to deal with the land slum problem under Section 27 of the 1950 Act.  When that Act was going through this House the Minister for Lands and many other people gave the impression that this section, which allowed the Land Commission to come into the open market to purchase land for the relief of congestion would make a tremendous difference in solving this problem and visions and pictures were painted here, once that section was passed, of the Land Commission buying in the open market the available holdings for the purpose of dealing with this problem.  What do we find? Since 1950 to date the total number of holdings purchased by the Land Commission in the open market is 22.  There are at least 22,000 congests in County Mayo.  There are at least 22,000 smallholders there under £10 valuation.  I think it will be apparent to anybody that if the total efforts of the Land Commission under all the legislation and particularly under the 1950 Land Act has resulted in the acquisition of 22 holdings or one holding per 1,000 of the congests in County Mayo, we will not make much headway with this problem.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it is necessary for me to examine the reasons for the failure of the Land Commission in dealing with the land slum problem. Suffice it to say that every one of us who comes from a congested area realises that only the fringe of the problem has been touched and, if we take the history of the State since its foundation, there have been approximately only 1,000,000 acres of land taken and set, counting the land that <Col N="1793" /> was rearranged.  The total amount of money spent on it was approximately £9,500,000.  How much of that would go in salaries, Land Commission salaries and expenses, I do not know.</P>
    <P>We still have in counties like Mayo 22,000 uneconomic holders and we can all realise we are getting nowhere, and that if things are left as they are we will get nowhere.  I think it is a feeling in the minds of Deputies on all sides of the House that the policy of the Land Commission has been largely a failure, and I think I am giving them credit for any rearrangements they have made.  If you take their figures since the foundation of the State you will realise that their average rate of rearranging and of acquiring is a 100 farms per year.  That is obviously going to get us nowhere.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the aliens question, I must say that I largely agree, as far as my part of the West is concerned, with what was stated here by, I think, Deputy Brennan, on the last occasion. The type of alien we have got in the West are people who are buying old ramshackle places nobody else would purchase.  They are people who come back to the West of Ireland looking for atmosphere, looking for a place where the local fly-boy can play Liszt's rhapsody on his tin whistle.  They come out and find that they have acquired a place which nobody else would buy, and then you will see advertisements in the London newspapers about a cosy nook with wonderful fishing and free shooting looking out on the broad Atlantic.  They are looking for somebody who will take off their hands the property they had acquired earlier.  We like these people down there and these are not the people who create the problem that Deputy McQuillan has in mind.</P>
    <P>But getting on to what we must do if we are going to make headway, and obviously somebody is going to ask what we are going to do, I have one suggestion which is to let the local congest solve his own problem.  I would empower some board such as the old Congested Districts Board, to schedule every land slum and to schedule every <Col N="1794" /> individual farm in a land slum.  I would take one or two or three in that particular area with a valuation of £5, or say, a market value of £500, and I would give him credit for £1,000 and let him go out in the open market with the money and purchase any farm on the market.  In that way we would be providing that the thrifty congest would do for himself the work which the Land Commission failed to do.  I would allow the small farmer whose holding has a market value of £400 or £500 credit for £1,000 to enable him to go out into the open market to purchase any holding that was available. I would, of course, ask him to surrender the holding he was leaving to the Land Commission.  In every paper in rural Ireland every week you will see advertisements for holdings which are being sold.  There are hundreds of them for sale every week.  Of these hundreds of holdings the Land Commission, in their efforts to solve the congestion problem, have succeeded in buying 22 since 1950.</P>
    <P>Generally the people who go in for competition in land acquisition in rural Ireland do not derive their livelihood solely or mainly from agriculture. Usually they are shopkeepers or some such people.  I do not know if it is proposed to stop these people.  I would not propose to do so but I would help the congest by giving him this credit to enter the open market and compete with the shopkeeper and with the other people who are acquiring the land as it comes up for sale.  In that way we would be making some effort to solve the congestion problem.  I have no doubt that if those people in the land slum areas got the chance and got the necessary help to which they are entitled the congestion situation would ease itself in due course.  If there was a scheme of the sort which I am now suggesting they would not have to wait on the Land Commission. Goodness knows they have been waiting long enough for the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>In every congested area you go into &mdash;and most Deputies know this&mdash;the people have been waiting 30, or 40 or maybe 50 years for the Land Commission to get to them.  It has a stultifying <Col N="1795" /> effect on them.  They have been waiting years in the muck for the Land Commission to take them out of their misery and the Land Commission has failed.  If we do not do something about this problem emigration will solve it for us.  There are unfortunately hundreds of villages in rural Ireland where the keys are being turned in the locks and where the parents as well as the children are going.</P>
    <P>We must look upon this problem as being very urgent.  I would suggest to the Deputies who may not come from the congested areas to look on this problem as a national one.  I do not believe there is a county in Ireland in which there is not some land slum. In any county where there is a land slum scheduled it would enable the people to come out in the open market and solve the problem if they were given credit such as I suggested. Under the scheme I am advocating I would suggest to the Government to cut out the old antipathy by the Deputies from the Midlands.  I believe many of the people in the congested areas could solve their own congestion problem if given help of this kind and I am equally satisfied after all the years and all the Land Acts that unless the initiative of the small man is allowed and encouraged the congestion problem will still be talked about by us and by those who come after us in 50 years time.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why in a national problem of this kind some proposal along the lines of my suggestion could not be brought to bear on the problem. Over the years millions and millions of pounds have been devoted by this Dáil for the relief of slum problems in Dublin, Cork and other towns and cities, and further millions and millions of pounds have been voted for the provision of amenities such as water and sewerage in the urban and city areas. This is an urgent problem and a problem which will not wait.  Although I have no figures on the aliens question, I do not think that is going to get at the kernel of this.  We must think in a very advanced way about the solution of the congestion problem.  It is not <Col N="1796" /> really a question of aliens.  It is a question of tackling the problem as a national one, giving the people in the congested areas the help they require. I would urge on the Government and the Minister for Lands to consider the suggestion put forward in this motion, and if he is satisfied, as I am satisfied, that the progress has been hopeless from a national point of view in dealing with this problem, then he should face this with an open mind.  If the provisions of the old Land Acts have not achieved their object, then it is time we looked around for some new solution.  I would ask the House to accept this motion as amended and ask the Minister for Lands to accept the suggestions made by me to-night towards doing something in the immediate future to relieve this problem which is one that affects practically the whole western seaboard as well as different parts of practically every county in the State.</P>

      <P>The time is short but the amendment tabled by Deputy Moran and Deputy Bartley has compelled me to rise to my feet.  I would like first to say a few words on the original motion put down by Deputy McQuillan.  I want to be quite candid and say I have a certain sympathy with the spirit of the motion.  I think <Col N="1797" /> I know what is in Deputy McQuillan's mind when he tables such a motion as this but I am compelled for once to find myself in the strange position of being in agreement with Deputy Moran when he refers to the Aliens Act of 1935.  What he says is exactly true.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy McQuillan did not present the picture in a more correct form than he did.  He drew a comparison between the acreage that was purchased by aliens and that purchased by the Land Commission in a given ten years.  I do not know where he got the figures for the purchase of land by aliens because the official figures do not seem to tally with the figures that Deputy McQuillan has given.  I might remind Deputy McQuillan and the House in general that during the ten years that he has named, with the exception of two years, the Land Commission was closed down by Government Order.</P>
      <P>There was one Government Order on the 19th February, 1939, preventing them from acquiring or resuming any land for the relief of congestion and a further Order on the 25th February, 1941.  I have copies of the two Orders if anybody wishes to have particulars of them.  This not alone prevented the Land Commission from acquiring or resuming land in the usual way for the relief of congestion but it also limited their work within the Department, that is, the office side of it because of the loaning of staff to other Government Departments during the emergency period.  Perhaps any Government might have done the same as that and I have no quarrel with these Government decisions except that they were supposed to last only for the duration of the emergency.  The war ended about April, 1945, but three years later, in 1948, when we took office, those Orders had not been revoked.  I do not want Deputy McQuillan to blame the Land Commission for not acquiring land during that period.  They were prohibited by Government Orders of the dates I have given.  I have copies of the Orders here if Deputy McQuillan is not satisfied with that explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan said the figures <Col N="1798" /> for the acquisition of land by aliens from 1947 to 1954 is 13,200 acres and approximately 6,000 acres of that was mountain and bog of the type described by Deputy Moran.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That was given in reply to a parliamentary question to-day by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach; I think it was £1,000,000 that was given as having been paid for land by aliens.  There is another aspect to this motion.  Listening to Deputy McQuillan when he was moving this motion on the last night he was here I felt I was one of the greatest traitors to this country and that every one of the 147 Deputies were traitors too, that we were all, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta, prepared to sell the country.  I suppose I should have felt proud to think that we had at least one true patriot who would expose the whole lot of us and bring us to a sense of our duty.  I do not think that is a fair way to present the case and I would ask Deputy McQuillan to tell us in his reply (1) how many aliens have purchased land in his county and (2) how many aliens who may have purchased land in his county have sold out since?</P>
      <P>I think it is true to say that during the war years for reasons best known to themselves a certain number of people came in here and purchased land, but I am informed by auctioneers and others in the business that the tide is now turning and for the last number of years many of those who bought land during the war years have sold out.  I know that to be the truth and as a matter of fact right beside Deputy McQuillan's own home in Roscommon, of two very large farms one has been sold at a loss and another is advertised for sale at the present time.  In regard also to the figures he quoted I am afraid Deputy McQuillan mixed up the town and city purchases with the land purchases because he based his figures on the 25 per cent. purchase tax, that is, the amount you have to pay whether it is a shop, a farm or some place overlooking Clew Bay in County Mayo.</P>

The actual figure is £600,000.  Regarding the amendment which has been put down to this motion, it is a pity that Deputy Moran did not use his influence on his own Government during the long years he has been a member of this House and get these things done of which he has spoken so proudly and loudly to-night.  I remember that when bringing a Bill through this House to help the Land Commission and to make the way easy for them, Deputy Moran and two or three of his colleagues held up that Bill from the 7th December, 1949, until the middle of June, 1950, by prolonging debate to such an extent that closure had to be used.

      <P>Deputy Moran now mentions his plan for relieving congestion for the 22,000 congests which, he says, are in County Mayo.  I thought I knew Mayo, and I do know that it is one of the worst pockets of congestion in the Twenty-Six Counties, but I was surprised to learn that there are 22,000 congests.  Even a half or one-fifth or one-sixth of that number would be a terrific problem in any one country.  But that figure of 22,000 is a gross exaggeration, as I am sorry to say we have not a great deal more than 22,000 farmers.</P>

      <P>Yes, I am not mistaking that at all.  Deputy Moran said his proposal would be to make a sum of money available to each of these congests to go out and relieve their own congestion.  That is grand, but I ask Deputy Moran to visualise what would happen if every one of these 22,000 suddenly knew that they had this money to call on and if the whole 22,000 turned up at every auction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Minister were listening he would know that I said I would give the board power to schedule individual farmers and schedule every land slum and the board would select one or two or three farmers say with a £5 valuation and give each of them a credit for £1,000 and let him solve his own congestion problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>How could any board decide that?  Six years ago, I thought I had the same brainwave and, on examination, I found it was just foolishness. If any simple method like that could be found in relation to congestion, I would be only too happy to adopt it.  I examined that suggestion <Col N="1801" /> then and found it useless.  Apart from that it would never rearrange the horrible rundale system and the horrible intermixing of plots which we have particularly in Connemara, Mayo and other places in the West.  The thing that would emerge, if it were workable is that we would create a desperate flight from these lands and there would be a clamour by everybody with up to £40 or £50 valuation to get this relief.  If farmers of that class knew that they could get money in this way, this House would be surrounded with a mass of farmers deserting their work and looking for money that could not be procured.  The Deputy must know this could not be done; it would not work.  You would have to pick out one man to buy the farm and you could not lead him by the hand to every auction and say: &ldquo;You can go so much on that farm and then stop.&rdquo;  I considered every inch of that idea when I became Minister for Lands six years ago and it was not workable.  The least bit of reflection on the part of anybody, especially on the part of Deputy Moran with his knowledge of law and of land should convince him that it would not work.  It is a silly suggestion, and I do not mean that in any derogatory way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran also said that only 1,000,000 acres of land had been divided by the Land Commission.  Actually 2,125,000 acres have been purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Well 1,075,000 acres have been purchased during that time and 43,000 enlargements were given out of that.  Deputy Moran made an attack on the Land Commission or at least it seemed an attack on his own colleague Deputy Derrig who was Minister for Lands during a long period on three different occasions I think when Fianna Fáil was in power.</P>

Apart from the silly suggestion put forward what plan can the Deputy suggest to help to relieve congestion? There is need for a Minister for Lands who understands the problem of congestion and with all humility I submit to the House that I, at least, know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>A practical knowledge of congestion is the first thing that is essential for a Minister for Lands because every Department needs the Minister's guidance, and he is required to make decisions from day to day.  If he does not know and understand the problems with which he has to deal, he will not be able to guide his Department and will not be able to make decisions.  I remember very well the assistance I got from the people across the House who are now shedding crocodile tears when I introduced my Bill. Every possible obstruction was put in my way.  Deputy Moran says the Land Commission did not operate Section 27 of the 1950 Act, but Deputy Moran and his colleagues did his best to scare people and must to some extent take the responsibility for what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember Deputy Moran in this House working himself up over the people from the Land Commission appearing at auctions.  That was the assistance I got when I wanted to free the Land Commission from the legislative shackles on their wrists.  I got very little assistance and only obstruction particularly from Deputy Moran and Deputy de Valera.  Now Deputy Moran comes in here to-night with a grand scheme for giving everyone a lump of money but that scheme would not settle anything or end any of the problems in the West of Ireland.  The general opinion of the House&mdash;or of some Deputies, but not of all&mdash;seems to be that the Land Commission has some magic pool of land from which they can draw in the same way as a banker can pull out money from a bank. The Land Commission can only get <Col N="1803" /> land by acquiring it from somebody. It should be remembered that justice must be done to those from whom the land is acquired as well as those to whom it is to be given.  That is one of the first principles of the job&mdash; justice must be done to both sides.  We should remember that the day is gone when we were acquiring land from landlords.  I think any right-minded Deputy in this House does not stand for landlords and landlordism or anything like that.  At least, I do not.  It does not matter whether the landlord is an Irishman, an Englishman or a black man.  I have only one purpose in view and that is to place every possible weapon in the hands of the Land Commission to help them to acquire land to relieve congestion which exists.  As I have said before on many occasions, it is not now in the year 1954 that we should be relieving congestion.  I have helped the Land Commission out and I have gone further than any other Minister for Lands has gone to do it.  Deputy McQuillan definitely tries to injure the Land Commission.  I do not want to fight the Land Commission's battles for this reason: that legislation passed by this House has taken several matters such as resumption of land, fixing of prices, allotments and so on, out of the hands of the Minister.  For that reason, the Land Commission does not need to be defended&mdash;it is part of this House.  This House has taken by statute certain powers out of the hands of the Minister and handed them to the Land Commission.  These are powers which could be in the Minister's hands, but which it would be very foolish to leave in a Minister's hands.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that the pressure that is put on a Minister for Lands is ample proof of the danger of giving these powers into the hands of a Minister or a member of this House.  I want again to ask Deputy Moran and Deputy Bartley and the other supporters of this motion what proposals they have to put forward?  What powers has the Land Commission or the Minister for Finance not got now that should be given?  It is not good enough to put down a motion and move it in the way that Deputy Moran <Col N="1804" /> moved it, as if it were something that came into his head one night just before he went to sleep.  I do not think the House should be treated in that way.  If there are definite proposals to be put forward, then I want to hear them.  I believe that at the present time the Land Commission has all the powers it wants and I will be the first to come in here and ask for further powers if such are necessary for the relief of congestion.  I refuse to endorse the shedding of crocodile tears over congestion and, at the same time, doing nothing to relieve that congestion when one has the power to do so.</P>
    <P>How many questions did Deputy Moran table to his Minister for Lands during the three years from 1951 to May, 1954, or during the previous Fianna Fáil Government?  How many proposals did he put before his Minister for the relief of congestion?  Did he take up with his Minister immediately after the war in 1945 the advisability of revoking the close down Order imposed in 1939 and again in 1941?  The answers to those questions will be the real proof of his sincerity. These unfortunate congests do not want lip sympathy here.  Some of them may be poor and poverty stricken but I am certain they do not want their poverty paraded here, hung out on a bush like a piece of dirty linen to dry.</P>

If one quarter of the action I took had been taken by my successor there would be a different face on things to-day.  We have all the powers we want.  All we need is the driving force to ensure that the work is done in the proper way.  I want to assure Deputy Moran that there will be no flirting with land and no buying for political purposes while I am in the Land Commission.  Every perch available will be used for the relief of congestion. No matter how long I am in office, whether it is five years or ten years, I will never have to bring in a Bill to undo work that I did, as Deputy Moran's colleagues had to do.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Moran tries to blame me for what his Minister for Lands did not do, I think it is time I told the truth.  During the first two years I was in office in the first inter-Party Government I was working with empty hands.  The machine had been brought to a full stop.  The outdoor staff had been lent and I had to recruit a vast number of new inspectors to get the machine working again.</P>
      <P>It is essential that justice should be meted out to both sides.  We should not forget that to-day, with the exception of a few aliens, we are taking land from our own flesh and blood.  It would be most unfair to take land from them without due process of law or to take it unjustly or unfairly, without giving them a chance to defend themselves or receive a fair price for it.  Perhaps I am stodgy and old fashioned because I believe in that.  I believe in justice for all and not just for one.  If others do not subscribe to that view I cannot help it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government cannot accept this motion because we do not believe it was put down in all sincerity.  It implies a lack of action on my part, which lack should really be laid at the feet of Deputy Derrig and the Fianna Fáil Party.  They did not do the work and it is too late now to cry about it.  I do not intend to cry about it.  I intend to get on with the work of relieving congestion. May I say there are not 22,000 congests in Mayo.  I am glad there are not.  Many hard things have been said about our county, but there are not 22,000 congests in it.  I do not believe there are that number in the whole country.  The amendment to this motion had not been tabled when Deputy <Col N="1807" /> Moran spoke on the last occasion.  It is an afterthought.  It is a condemnation of his own Minister though it seeks to imply that, since I am now Minister, I should be saddled with the blame for what his own Party failed to do.  I ask the House to reject the amendment.  I do not believe it was put down in sincerity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to bring in any question of international reciprocity in ownership of property to satisfy Deputy McQuillan that we are not against the sentiment in his motion.  I support what Deputy Moran has said, namely, that the sentiment which is apparent in Deputy McQuillan's motion is quite acceptable to us but we feel that, having decided what the objective is, one should adopt the most suitable means of achieving it.  If Deputy McQuillan's motion were accepted and the Minister for External Affairs were to try to implement it by amending the Aliens Act, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, in order to carry out the express wishes of the House, it is possible that a very small leak might be stopped, but I suggest that the main leak in the matter of land evading the Land Commission for the relief of congestion would not have been, in fact, tackled at all.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Moran expressed that in much simpler language when he said that for the one alien who goes to the West of Ireland and buys property for its scenic rather than for its agricultural value, you have possibly ten, 20 or 30 local people with more money than they require and who certainly do not need land or agriculture to give them a livelihood, competing with the Land Commission and with these congests for whatever land may yet be available in the nine scheduled counties of the congested districts.  I think it is a bit of a joke, of course, to compare East Galway and Roscommon with the seaboard strip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one argument I would commend to Deputy McQuillan against his suggestion for an amendment of the Aliens Act. I do not know whether in his constituency there are American <Col N="1808" /> citizens who did not register themselves in our Irish offices in the United States and who come back here to the holdings occupied by their ancestors and who, in fact, according to the law are aliens.  If we were to allow the law to take a new form such as is suggested, these people could under the law be dispossessed.  I know that is not the intention of Deputy McQuillan.  He did say here on the last occasion that he was not an expert on matters of this sort and that if the sentiment and the principle, which he wanted to have accepted, were accepted he would leave the adaptation in the hands of people better qualified than he to see that the adaptation was properly carried out. Seeing that that is Deputy McQuillan's attitude on the proposed amendment of the law, I suggest to him that he should see this suggestion of his in its complete ineptitude.  It would not have the slightest effect on the solution of the problem which he and the whole of us wish to see solved.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Minister for Lands has not been by any means helpful. He started off in boastful fashion about his own virtues as Minister for Lands and about the deficiencies of any other Minister from this Party who occupied the same office.  He seems to adopt two Orders made by the Fianna Fáil Government in the emergency to defend the Land Commission against the charge made by Deputy McQuillan about the smallness of the number of acres acquired.  On the other hand on every occasion he uses the same Orders to lambast Fianna Fáil for having done nothing.  He cannot stand on both legs on that question.  He knows very well that during the emergency the main need was to utilise land for the immediate purpose of getting food out of it.  If we were to waste our time sending around inspectors and going through the long procedure of acquiring and distributing land, he knows that the people of the country would have gone hungry.  The sensible and the practical thing was done.  Every man who was capable of adding to the production of the country, whether from turf, minerals or food, the Government <Col N="1809" /> saw to it that his efforts were directed to that work.  Signs on it, we were able to battle it out with our chins above water during the seven years of the war.</P>

      <P>I can produce official letters in support of what I say. Therefore, Deputy Moran had something to offer when he suggested that some sort of credit should be given to certain people.  He did not say what the Minister put into his mouth.  He did not say that credit should be given to 22,000 congests or to the total number of congests whatever the number may be, to go into the public market to supply themselves with land with the help of these credits. What he did say was&mdash;and the Minister ignored it&mdash;that the worst of these congested spots should be scheduled or that in fact he should go down further and schedule a number of the tenants for benefit under this scheme. I am not standing up to support a credit scheme, but it is likely a variant of what the Minister had in Section 27 of the 1950 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a variant of it. What he did was to suggest that this very limited number might be scheduled and that they might get this credit, that they might go into the open market and do what the Land Commission have been apparently unable to do under Section 27, that is, to supply themselves with holdings and with sanitary houses.  Information has been given by Deputy Moran which was supplied to him by the Minister to-day on this Section 27.  Twenty-two holdings as Deputy Moran has pointed out were bought under Section 27, either by private treaty or by auction since that law was enacted.  The total amount involved is £20,000 purchase money and the total rateable valuation of the holdings is £23,000.  The Minister himself is not going to start boasting about that.  I concede him the right to boast about things about which we cannot put him on the spot here, but that is something about which, on his own figures, he cannot boast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>If Section 22 could not produce what the Minister wanted it <Col N="1811" /> to produce and what we on this side wanted it to produce, surely I can see some case for Deputy Moran's variant of it.  I am not suggesting that Deputy Moran's variant is the best that might be adopted.  I would suggest the scheme of Section 27 myself as against Deputy Moran's, but I know that Deputy Moran's suggestion would suit a certain type of man who is a little better off than the average landholder in the really congested districts. If the man who really wants help from the community is to get that help, in my opinion, he can only get it under Section 27.  I cannot understand why better results were not achieved under this section for the people who have not so far succeeded in being cared for by the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the charge against us that we held up his Bill on this section or he indicated that this was one of the sections on which prolonged debate took place.  There was debate on it and the results shown in this answer to me justify, <i>post factum,</i> the delay which then took place in trying to hammer out a better section than this.  The point at issue between us was the insistence by the Minister on market value.  We felt that if the Land Commission were to be compelled to give market value for all the lands&mdash;personally I had in mind lands within the congested districts&mdash;a scheme of that sort was open to a great deal of string pulling, that there could be puffing and that the Land Commission might be compelled to buy land at an inflated price.  The Minister himself was as well aware of that danger as anybody else.</P>

      <P>The Minister here a short time ago gave us an assurance that while he was Minister he would see that there would be no political interference of any sort in the distribution of land or in the conferring of any of the Land Commission benefits.  That is a very idle assurance indeed because the Minister has no power to affect either the distribution of land or the decision of the Land Commission in any particular case of acquisition.  He knows that and he knows that that is enshrined in all the Land Acts.  His predecessor did not attempt any such behaviour.  If the Minister did in fact attempt it he found out what the Land Acts contained, that he was quite powerless and that the Land Commission told him that it was their job to decide what land will be acquired and how it will be divided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that this was all eyewash, this thing of <Col N="1813" /> further and better provision, as a substitute for Deputy McQuillan's amendment to the Aliens Act.  Surely the Minister will not suggest that in any sphere of Government activity improvement cannot be found?  Is not the very experience of the Land Commission in the administration of the Land Acts a guarantee that something better can always be done than has been done in the past?  Does not every year bring new knowledge and new experience and show up the virtue of certain activities and the shortcomings of others?  That state of affairs will enable the Land Commission to do better than it has done in the past and is the justification for the amendment in the names of Deputies Moran and Blaney and myself to the effect that further and better provision should be made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran has pinpointed the worst of this problem.  He asks the Minister to direct the Land Commission. The Minister as director of policy can indicate to the Land Commission the type of problem to which they ought to give special attention in any particular year.  Deputy Moran has suggested, and I support the suggestion, that the Minister should go into these black spots and schedule the worst of them, that he should schedule the tenants who wish to leave and see to it that the communities of insanitary houses will disappear and that those who are to remain will be provided with good inhabitable houses and that those who wish to go will be provided with good houses elsewhere.</P>

      <P>That is one facet of the problem which requires urgent and immediate attention.  I know that the Land Commission has done a great deal in respect of this matter but we want to get that particular aspect of the matter wiped out and we think that that can be done in the course of two or three years at the most.

      <P>Talking about dispossession, the Minister talked here about delays on land legislation in the House and tried to insinuate that Deputy Moran particularly was responsible for delays in getting ahead with the land legislation in the House.</P>
      <P>There was very good reason for Deputy Moran's close scrutiny of the proposals in the Land Bill, as there is very good reason for close scrutiny of almost every Land Bill.  Does not the Minister himself know very well that there are still flaws and that decisions of the Land Commission have been upset more than once in the Supreme Court?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>And that the close examination which the Bill got in the House was fully justified and could not be called obstruction by any stretch of <Col N="1815" /> the imagination.  How could the Minister charge Deputy Moran with obstruction in a problem like this&mdash;a problem which has given him considerable concern in the West of Ireland in the same way as I myself have been concerned with it?</P>

      <P>Is it not quite obvious to the Minister that Deputy Moran would be very anxious to see that all efforts in this House which would give relief to congestion would not be obstructed?  Would he not be as anxious as any man to give the Land Commission an implement that would not break in their hands when dealing with a problem such as this?  We are dissatisfied with the Minister's failure to accept this amendment.  On the other hand we could not subscribe to the motion as submitted by Deputy McQuillan.  As the Minister himself indicated, and as has been indicated by Deputy Moran we would be inclined to support Deputy McQuillan's objective but we cannot subscribe to the method by which Deputy McQuillan wished to give practical effect to what he had in mind.  I am afraid his method is very wide of the margin.  But it is very disappointing to hear the Minister for Lands standing up here and saying that an amendment which would avoid the pitfalls inherent in the main motion is nothing more than eyewash.  Have I not stressed one very important and pressing facet of this problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say only a few words on this.  I do not think that this motion either in its original form or with the amendment will really do anything to help alleviate the problem in which the Deputies have interested themselves.  There was a suggestion that those who have acquired land should be dispossessed by making the provision retrospective to the 1st January, 1945.  As I understand the practice and the law, as far as the Land Commission is concerned they have absolutely the same power of acquisition of any property whether owned by Irish people or by non-nationals, and they can take land, as I shall show in a few moments, from any landowner in the country.</P>
      <P>In the last four years the Land Commission has acquired 23 estates comprising 6,877 acres from persons who appeared to be non-nationals and at the same time they have in contemplation of acquisition a further 49 estates totalling 11,640 acres from persons who do not appear to be citizens.  People may wonder why these people are singled out for this treatment.  Actually they are not singled out&mdash;the lands which they own have come under the notice of the Land Commission in the ordinary way, in the same way in which land owned by Irish people has come under the commission's notice.  Deputy McQuillan mentioned the fact that you had areas of land bought up by non-nationals and he and Deputy MacBride asked for particulars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particulars are not available for the years prior to 1949 except from the point of view of the value of the land acquired.  The total value of all property subject to the 25 per cent. stamp duty of the Finance Act (No. 2) <Col N="1818" /> 1927, from the 1st December, 1947 to the 31st December, 1948, was £312,556. The total area of land acquired in the four years from 1st January, 1950, to the 30th June, 1954, was 13,250 acres &mdash;a total of 210 cases.  Individual applicants acquired 13,000 acres, and of that area 6,491 acres were described as woodland or expansive mountain. Since 1950 there has been a drop in the area acquired each year with the exception of 1952 when the value of the land acquired was down but the area was substantially higher and included the 6,491 acres which were described as woodland and expansive mountain&mdash;obviously a single estate. As far as the suggestion is concerned that the fact that some land owned here by aliens is preventing the alleviation of distress, I wish to point out that the Land Commission is proceeding in the ordinary way to acquire any of that land that comes under their notice.  If we proceeded to legislate against these people we would be completely out of line with reciprocal arrangements which exist between all other countries.</P>
    <P>In a few very isolated cases, I think in South America, certain legislation has been imposed against non-nationals. But in almost every other country, in Europe, the United States of America, Canada, New Zealand, conditions exist almost identical with those in this country&mdash;the same treatment is afforded to non-nationals as is afforded to non-nationals here.  So as far as I can see there would be no reason why we should legislate in a penal fashion, particularly in view of the fact that absolute powers of acquisition, whether concerning nationals or non-nationals, lie in the hands of the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would it be possible for the Minister to give us the continents in which similar laws exist?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got them readily to hand.  There are no European countries in which legislative provision exists against the acquisition of land by non-nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier Deputy MacBride mentioned something about France.  The position in France is that in Article 2 of the French Civil Code non-nationals are entitled to acquire land.  Article 2 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Foreigners shall enjoy in France the same civil rights as those which are and will be accorded to French citizens.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are slightly different arrangements in the different countries and Deputy McQuillan asked me about Great Britain, France and the Netherlands, and in respect of all these places, the right of aliens to acquire property is freely acknowledged.  I do not want to delay Deputy McQuillan's right of reply, but I should like again to point out that the Government could not accept this motion in its original form, and the Minister for Finance has given reasons why we could not accept the amendment.  I do not see that the amendment offers any practical solution.</P>

      <P>As I said already, I do not want to take up time.  I do not think the Minister for Lands has any sympathy whatever with the amendment. I could agree with the motion to a certain degree, but because of one or two matters we cannot agree with it in its entirety.  If we were to stop the purchase of land by these aliens I do not think that would get over the problem the motion seeks to remedy. I think the movers of the motion are looking in a restricted fashion to the West of Ireland and forget that similar conditions exist elsewhere. They exist in the South.  And even when land is not purchased by aliens at the present moment the people who are most entitled to it, the agricultural workers and the smallholders, do not get it.  I cannot see that it would be any solution of the problem to have, say, migrants from Donegal or from the West, sent to farms in South Cork.  This motion seems to cater entirely for the West and <Col N="1820" /> seems to forget that there is considerable congestion in other parts of the country as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Lands sought, in the time at their disposal. to show that this motion was not a serious one and that the figures which I had given were not correct. But they produced no alternative set of figures which would challenge or contradict my figures except perhaps with reference to the moneys spent by the Land Commission during the three year period.  The Minister for External Affairs says that between 1950 and 1954 only 1,000 acres were acquired by aliens, but in the next breath he gave figures of almost 18,000 acres which he says the Land Commission are now about to acquire from aliens.  The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, last week here gave us a list of 105 individuals who have between them 40,000 acres of the finest land in the Midlands.  Many of these are, of course, aliens.</P>
      <P>Some of that land is run by aliens. Is that land not available for the people of this country?  I say again that between 1951 and 1954 a sum of almost £6,000,000 was spent by aliens on the purchase of land in this country and that they purchased between 130,000 and 150,000 acres of the most fertile land in Ireland in that period. Most of these purchases took place between 1940 and 1947, particularly between 1945 and 1947 when the Labour Government came into power in Britain and when many of these people left Britain to come here.  It was a great benefit to Britain itself; we got them and they bought the finest land in Ireland in that ten-year period between 1941 and 1951.  The Land Commission spent a certain sum on the purchase of land for the relief of congestion.  In one year alone, 1947, aliens spent more on the purchase of land than the Land Commission spent in the ten-year period mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not care whether there was a standstill Order on the Land Commission or not.  The fact is that they did not buy the land in an effort to solve congestion in that period.  Because I <Col N="1821" /> suggested the last night that I was speaking here with no legal knowledge, it might be fair game for someone to say: &ldquo;Withdraw your motion; the powers are there under Section 5 and Section 11 of the Aliens Act.&rdquo;  If the powers are there under those sections how is it that this land has not been acquired?  If the Minister for Justice has these powers, as I know he has, to prohibit aliens from living in any particular part of the country, from holding land in Roscommon, Galway, Mayo or anywhere else, and if he considers these aliens undesirable, why have no <Col N="1822" /> steps been taken by any Minister for Justice to prohibit the like of Mr. Satchwell and company from purchasing land in the West of Ireland and other areas?  I may not be a legal expert but I know there are legal experts advising these aliens as to the proper manner in which to drive a coach and four through the laws as they are made, and I am afraid my efforts to see that the pool of land for the relief of congestion is enlarged are not going to meet with any success in this particular motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question put by me to the Minister this afternoon for the purpose of eliciting information with regard to the future programme in relation to main and county roads was prompted by a statement made recently by the Minister in which he indicated that something more would in future be done for county roads. Indeed, he did not merely indicate that something more would be done; he insinuated that a system would be prepared. We are all in agreement with the sentiments expressed by the Minister in relation to county roads and, if I have to refer to the existing state of affairs in relation to Donegal, that does not mean that I wish to bring the matter down to the level of a parochial discussion; it is merely because I know the facts in relation to that county better than I do in relation to any other county.</P>
      <P>As I said, the Minister on that occasion did more than merely indicate that he had the intention of diverting money to county roads.  In the minds of the public there was only one inference that could be drawn and that was that the members of our county councils were up till now deliberately using the ratepayers' money to make&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a moment.  He said that they were deliberately using the ratepayers' money for the purpose of building boulevards for the automobiles of plutocrats.  I am quoting from the <i>Derry People</i> of November 27th, 1954, and I shall read the relevant paragraph which relates to county roads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister said he had requested local authorities to pay more attention to the county roads and less to the main or arterial roads. &lsquo;I think the county roads in the country are in a disgraceful condition. We are paying far too much attention to the main roads.  We do not want boulevards for the automobiles of the plutocrats; we want decent roads over which ordinary people can lorry their turf and produce&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That statement created in the minds of the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Deputy said that I said the taxpayers' money was being frittered away by the local authorities.  He has mentioned a quotation.  Would he now state where and when I said that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement did give rise to the belief that that was being done, particularly when it was followed up by a statement later in the Minister's speech in which he indicted the members of the local authorities.  That later statement read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He thought a considerable amount of economy could be effected but they could never hope for that until they elected to office people who had an interest in keeping down the rates and were large ratepayers themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, to my mind, coupled with the previous statement regarding the roads, is not merely a serious indictment of those who are members of local authorities, particularly in Donegal where we have a council with a 50-50 strength in relation to Coalition and Fianna Fáil, but it has also created in the minds of the people two impressions and a certain confusion of <Col N="1826" /> thought which I hope to have dissipated by the Minister's statement this evening.  Two innuendoes which the statement contained have conveyed to the minds of the people that members of local authorities are not using public funds in a proper manner with regard to construction of roads&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out that that statement engendered two particular lines of thought in the minds of the people.  I have already stated what one of these lines was. The other was that a tremendous amount of money will be made available next year for county roads.  We all hope that that is so and I feel that we are entitled to get from the Minister who has a knowledge of forthcoming legislation, which we do not want to anticipate, his reason for saying that there will be a diversion of money in that respect.  The net result of this has been that we have been inundated with deputations from this, that and the other district, pointing out to us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy should be more general in his statement.  He has been referring to a particular county, but this is of general application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I tried to point out.  My knowledge is guided by facts as I know them in a particular county and my intention was to refer to them for the purpose of making a general reference. I take it the same thing goes on in other counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I allowed the Deputy to demonstrate the conditions to which he has called attention by referring to Donegal, but I think his remarks should be more general in character than they have been up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to demonstrate what the position is generally, I may have referred to the figures in regard to Donegal.  It is not that I want to make any special reference to that county, beyond briefly indicating from the only facts that are available to me what is taking place.  The actual position at the moment is that the cost of maintenance of county roads is entirely borne by the ratepayers. We get no grant whatever from the Road Fund for the maintenance of these roads whereas the maintenance of main roads is subsidised from the Road Fund to the extent of 40 per cent. Then grants for the repairs of main roads are 100 per cent. free from the Road Fund.  These are facts which are not generally known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point in which I am interested and which I am sure the Minister will explain in due course is that every time in the past when a grant was given to a local authority from the Central Fund or the Road Fund, a directive was given as to where that grant was to be spent and how it was to be spent.  In actual fact there is a standard to which main roads must conform in order that that money can be expended.  In each instance the type of work that is to be done is pointed out.  Take, for instance, a grant for a main road.  An indication is given as to the stretch of road on which that grant is to be expended. Invariably it is laid down that a particular bend must be widened so that the road will conform to the standard of 20 feet laid down for main roads. I do not agree that that should be so and I should like to have some <Col N="1828" /> information from the Minister on this point.  Will the Minister next year reverse that position?  Will he see that the maintenance of main roads will be left to be carried out from money provided directly from the rates and that the maintenance of county roads will be given a substantial grant from the Road Fund such as is given only for main roads at present?  That will enable those of us who are members of local authorities to concentrate much more money on county roads than is being applied to them at present.</P>
    <P>I should like also the Minister to amend the regulations with regard to the standards that are laid down by his Department in connection with both county and main roads.  That would give us an opportunity to surface a much greater mileage of these roads and put them in a passable condition instead of having, as we are bound to do at the moment by the Department of Local Government, to make county roads to a width of 16 feet.  Money is often expended on widening a road with the result that we are not in a position to pay sufficient attention to surfacing.  While a considerable amount of money is expended on widening, we still have a road which is not up to standard for traffic.  If we are allowed to carry out surfacing jobs on a road which has already a good heart and is a solid road, without having to spend such a lot of money on widening or doing other jobs which prevent us from carrying out sufficient surfacing, I suggest that it would give greater satisfaction to the public.  These are some of the things that would really contribute towards making a greater mileage of county roads than we are able to make at the present time. Reading the Minister's statement, or alleged statement, as reported, one would think that the bias at the moment is in favour of the main roads.  That is not in fact the case.  Again I must refer to the only figures that I have before me, those relating to County Donegal.  They show that in County Donegal the amount of the 100 per cent. free grant from the Road <Col N="1829" /> Fund for main roads last year was in the vicinity of £86,000, whereas the free grant from the Road Fund in respect of county roads was £137,000. These figures demonstrate the very marked discrepancy between the amount provided for main roads and the amount provided for county roads.</P>
    <P>The Road Fund is derived solely from the motor tax which those who are unfortunate to have motor cars must pay. Some time ago, when we were on the other side of the House, we were reluctantly compelled to introduce legislation to increase the amount of road tax payable by vehicle owners.  The Minister and his colleagues who were then on this side of the House opposed that legislation, legislation which has resulted in there being a very substantial Road Fund now but which is by no means sufficient to keep the roads up to the standard desired.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would tell us now whether he still believes that the present condition of the roads is due to the fact that the elected representatives are not of a suitable type and are not carrying out proper economies or whether it is due to the fact that sufficient money was not diverted from the main roads to the county roads, he would allay the feelings of a great many people who are confused as to what the position is likely to be next year.  I can assure the Minister that any change he may make in connection with the allocation of money for roads which will give extra grants for county roads will have the full support of all elected members of local authorities. I can safely say that the same can be said of those who may not be members of local authorities at the moment but who will be members after June next. If the Minister would indicate, without giving actual figures, the amount of money that will be available or the changes that will be made in the regulations or otherwise with regard to the differential between main roads and county roads next year it would give members of local authorities a chance to inform the public who are anxious for improvements in the roads in their own townlands of what they may expect next year.  It is not expected that every road for which money for repair <Col N="1830" /> work is being sought at the moment will be repaired, or anything like it.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister did not intend, when he made the statement that he is alleged to have made, to imply that the present system by which roads were being constructed by local authorities was a result of the elected representatives not properly attending to their business but that was the innuendo and I would like the Minister to explain it fully now.  I have tried to point out that the Department of Local Government in every instance gives a direction as to how the money is to be expended when they give us a 100 per cent. grant out of the Road Fund and that the elected representatives have been in no way responsible for directing the money to any particular place.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister intends to do with regard to future legislation.  I do not want to anticipate him but perhaps he is anticipating that legislation when he made certain references to roads.  He may intend to give powers to the local representatives to say to the engineer: &ldquo;Put £1,000 on that road and £3,000 on that road, and so on.&rdquo;  If that is to be the case in future, we will be in a position to outline our proposals and decide as to the roads which will be repaired next year.  If that is not to be the case, the Minister might indicate now what drastic change he proposes to make in regard to the all-important question of county roads.  If he does that, we will be able to give the electorate a good account of our stewardship and point out to the people who think that we may have mishandled the public purse that we have been doing exactly what any council could do in the circumstances, irrespective of whether they were ratepayers or not.  I say in defence of my colleagues on local bodies that 99 per cent. of them are large taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I am really disappointed in my colleague, Deputy Brennan.  The main objection Deputy Brennan takes to the statement which I made is that I said that we want decent roads for the farmers of this country and not <Col N="1831" /> autobahns for plutocrats.  I repeat that.</P>

      <P>He used the county council of Donegal as an example.  I had very little to do with the allocation of funds to the county council of Donegal this year.  Prior to my taking office a share of £3,100,000 was allocated by my predecessor to the Donegal County Council for expenditure. I do not know what instructions my predecessor gave.  Evidently, Deputy Brennan does.  Evidently, Deputy Brennan knows that my predecessor said that money should be spent on main roads and not on county roads but I indicated the policy of the present Government when I said that I requested that more attention should be paid to county roads than to main roads and I allocated this year out of the supplementary grant out of the National Development Fund £41,000 to Donegal County Council and I told <Col N="1832" /> them, bearing in mind the advice I had already given, that they should pay more attention to the county roads than to the main roads.  Bearing that in mind, I said: &ldquo;There is £41,000 for you.  Allocate it as you wish.  Spend it as you wish.&rdquo;  I am glad to say they took my advice and, out of that £41,000, they spent £17,000 only on main roads and £26,300 on county roads.</P>
