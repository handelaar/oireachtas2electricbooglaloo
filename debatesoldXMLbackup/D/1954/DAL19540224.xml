    <P>*The content of the figures in 1953 and 1954 differs from that of 1951 and 1952 due to legislative changes effected by the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  It is not possible to give a precise measure of the effect of the legislative changes in increasing the live register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the number of sheep pelts imported by the various tanneries in the Republic for the years 1951, 1952 and 1953, indicating the number imported by each of the firms concerned.</P>

      <P>The number of sheep and lamb skins (undressed) imported in 1952 was 5,491, and the number imported in 1953 was 39,396. The corresponding figure for 1951 is not available since there was not in that year an individual import list heading for such items, and the imports, if any, were brought to account under a general heading.  Particulars relating to the business of individual firms cannot be divulged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the persons distributing the pelts to the fellmongers are the directors of the tanneries?  I have a complaint from a tannery in my constituency of unfair treatment, and I am prepared to send in to the Minister the full facts in connection with <Col N="841" /> it.  I agree that there should be someone in control, but I suggest it is an independent authority that should be in control and not the directors of the tanneries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of the general dissatisfaction with the high level of motor-car insurance rates in force at present; whether he is further aware that in the case of cars whose horse-power rating has been reduced as a result of recent legislation no reduction in insurance rates has been allowed although if the horse-power rating had been increased the insurance rates would have been automatically raised; and whether, in the circumstances, he will cause a general investigation of rates to be undertaken by his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of premium rates charged by insurance companies in respect of motor vehicles was the subject of an inquiry by the Prices Advisory Body in 1952, arising out of an increase of 25 per cent.  On premium rates from December 1st, 1951.  As a result of this inquiry, I accepted a recommendation of the Prices Advisory Body that an overall reduction of 12½ per cent.  Should take effect as from December 1st, 1952, and this reduction was made by the companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to horse-power rating, I am informed that insurance companies generally did not alter the premium rates for motor cars consequent on the revision of ratings for the purposes of road tax.  Where the revised rating has resulted in a lower horse-power, the insurance premium rate has not <Col N="842" /> been reduced, and, where it has entailed a higher horse power, the premium rate has not been increased. As I indicated in the Dáil on 23rd April last, I do not consider that the matter calls for my intervention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the position that an investigation took place in 1952, I am aware that a change in the rating of horse-power for taxation purposes has been made since that investigation was carried out.  In view of the fact that a considerable reduction in the rating has taken place in the case of several makes of car, would the Minister not agree that the Irish insurance companies, at least, should set good example by lowering the premiums for insurance purposes?  We are all well aware that the British insurance companies want to keep certain cars out of this country.  Would the Minister not agree that the Irish insurance companies should not follow the example set by the British insurance companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that I have responsibility in regard to the overall level of motor-car insurance premium rates, I do not think that I have responsibility for the practice of companies in regard to individual makes of cars, and I feel that to accept responsibility of that kind would be to extend the thing very widely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister does he agree that insurance rates for cars here compare any way favourably with the insurance rates at present in operation in Great Britain, and in view of that would he not consider that the matter should be referred at least to the Irish insurance companies with a view to making a reduction if at all possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates here have to be determined by the circumstances here&mdash;the volume of business and the accident experience.  The matter will be reviewed from time to time as the statistics of each year's operations are available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct to state that the number of cars where the horse-power was increased under the <Col N="843" /> new rate is negligible as compared with the number of cars where the horse-power went down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <P>One Order has been made under Section 3 of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952.  It applies to the townlands of Clarehill, Lissan East, Lissan West, Islandmcgrath, Islandavanna Upper and Islandavanna Lower, in the Barony of Islands, County Clare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the high rate of unemployment in Kinsale, County Cork, he will make an Order under Section 3 of the Unveloped Areas Act, 1952, applying to this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration cannot be given to the question of making an Order under Section 3 of the Undeveloped Areas Act to bring Kinsale within the scope of that Act, in advance of the submission of proposals for industrial development in the area, which in other respects would warrant the grant of assistance by An Foras Tionscal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I had to make that clear before, that this is a question which I am not prepared to consider in relation to any area until it is clear that there <Col N="844" /> is an industrial proposal which in other respects would qualify for help from An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Should that request be put up and the conditions be considered favourable towards that industry will the Minister then consider giving the same concessions to this undeveloped area as to part of County Clare?</P>

      <Col N="852" /> The counts showed that for 1936-37, 45,000 out of a total of 73,000 individual taxpayers derived their main income from sources assessable under Schedule E.  The corresponding figures for 1950-51 were 138,000 and 175,000, respectively. There is no material available from which reliable estimates could be made for other years.</P>

      <P>The improvement of the Dromore River under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, can be considered only as part of a comprehensive scheme for the River Erne catchment.  The Monaghan County Council have been so informed. In view of the present commitments of the Commissioners of Public Works as outlined by me to the House on 22nd October, 1953, it is not possible to say when such a scheme can be under taken.</P>

      <P>The replies to the Deputy's questions seriatim are as follows:&mdash; (1) June, 1948.  (2) June, 1948 and December, 1951, respectively. (3) March, 1951 and March, 1953, respectively. (4) July-August, 1953. (5) 96 observations on the scheme were received following exhibition.  They were mainly concerned with proposed interferences with water power, water supplies, sewerage, bridges, fisheries, lands and amenities.  (6) £320 up to 31st January, 1954, and £5,000 (estimated) up to 31st March, 1954.  (7) £2,120,000.  (8) Pending confirmation of the scheme, it is not possible to say precisely when actual work on the river will commence, but it will, it is hoped, be in a month or so.  Preliminary work on the preparation of plant for movement to the district, setting up of local stores and office, etc. is in progress.  (9) A site has been secured in Galway City for offices and stores. As the work expands, additional accommodation will be obtained elsewhere, as required.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the number of dredgers the Office of Public Works has at its disposal whether they are in continuous commission excavating and cleaning harbours; and, if not, whether, in view of the necessity for the improvement of and the combating of siltage in many of the harbours utilised by our fishermen, he will make these dredgers freely available to the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Agriculture for improving these harbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have at their disposal three sea-going dredgers, a bucket dredger, a suction dredger and a grab. When not required for works at the three State harbours, Dún Laoghaire, Howth and Dunmore East, the vessels are available on hire terms for work at other harbours.  In recent years there has been a considerable demand on their services for work at commercial as well as at fishery harbours.  Their suitability for work at any particular harbour depends on the nature of the <Col N="854" /> material to be dredged and on the flotation available.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the maintenance and improvement of fishery harbours rests with the several harbour authorities concerned and it is not proposed to alter the existing arrangements whereby any State assistance afforded for these purposes is given by way of grant.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state (1) when the Land Commission acquired the O'Farrell estate, Dalystown, Loughrea, and (2) when sub-division is to take place.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission acquired the O'Farrell estate in December, 1949 and the estate of the Dalystown Company (formerly part of the O'Farrell estate) in November, 1953.  The two areas totalling 773 acres will be dealt with together but it is not possible, at this stage, to say when allotment will take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCawley" hpid="Mr. Cawley Mr. Cawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cawley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not think it ridiculous that in relation to a <Col N="857" /> farm acquired in 1949, and this is 1954, we cannot now have a statement from the Minister as to when that land will be sub-divided?  In ordinary circumstances when a farm comes before a court for sub-division, it usually takes about 12 months.  I think there should be some statement from the Minister in relation to this matter. There should be no difference between a ministerial Department and an ordinary individual where matters such as this are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It frequently happens that when there are two or more schemes of acquisition in question in an area and when the land on both schemes is required for rearrangement or for the implementation of the particular scheme the Land Commission has in mind the estate earlier acquired, as in this case, has to wait for the acquisition of the second estate before the scheme can be put into operation.  I can assure the Deputy that is the cause of the delay.  The inspector is working on the scheme at the present time.  I can also assure the Deputy that there will be no avoidable delay.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question of 20th November, 1952, in this matter and point out that no undertaking was given in that reply that the lands mentioned would be allotted in spring, 1953.  This particular case is one of a number in South Mayo awaiting rearrangement, and such work is always of a difficult nature demanding very <Col N="858" /> experienced staff who have been for some time past and are at present engaged on other important work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that complaints of poor reception have been made from time to time by people in the West Cork area.</P>
      <P>I should explain that a number of coastal districts are outside the first-class service area of the Athlone Station and to get the best practicable reception in these districts a good aerial and earth are essential, as well as a receiver of good quality.  Because of the insufficiency of wavelengths for the number of stations working in Europe at present and because of the general political situation in Europe, there is considerable interference between stations, especially after dark. Due to their proximity to the Continent, places on the south and southeast coasts of Ireland are affected more than other parts of Ireland by interference from foreign stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the circumstances I have referred to, it is very difficult to secure first-class reception in all areas, but we are taking every step possible in the matter.  I should mention that a new five-kilowatt transmitter was installed in Cork a week ago and is being tested at present.  Although this transmitter is not powerful enough for long-distance transmission, I believe that many West Cork listeners will be able to get better reception from it than from Athlone.  A new 100-kilowatt transmitter will be installed in Athlone during the year and we are <Col N="866" /> hoping that it will improve reception generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the greatly increased demand for soil testing by the agricultural community, he will again recognise and take advantage of the facilities for soil analysis available at the four sugar factories where it is possible to carry out 6,000 tests per week and where tare houses, chemists and research soil experts can be availed of for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to by the Deputy.  The fact is that the equipment required for the provision of a full soil-testing service had been ordered by my Department as far back as September, 1946.  The supply position at that time of post-war shortages was difficult and delivery was greatly delayed.  In the circumstances a certain amount of improvisation was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann informed my Department in July, 1948, that they had built up an organisation for handling the sampling and analysis of soils and offered to test soil samples on a fee basis.  This offer, which was repeated in 1949, was declined, since it was felt that a central soil-testing organisation administered by my <Col N="868" /> Department would be a more satisfactory arrangement.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply to a question by Deputy Palmer on 11th February, the facilities of my Department's soil laboratory are being extended to keep pace with the growing demand for soil testing.</P>
    <P>If the soil-testing facilities at the four sugar factories are such as the Deputy suggests, I think it would be a good idea if they were utilised to a greater extent and if the soil samples, or some of them, at present being sent by the agricultural advisers of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann to my Department's soil laboratory were sent instead to the laboratories at these factories.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,577,800 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1954, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund (No. 14 of 1950 and No. 11 of 1952).</P>
      <P>When the Estimates for the Department of Social Welfare were being discussed in Dáil Éireann in December last, I stated that it would be necessary to bring in a substantial Supplementary Estimate for Social Insurance before the end of the present financial year.  That Supplementary Estimate is now before you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It provides for an additional payment by the Exchequer of £1,568,000 to the Social Insurance Fund in 1953-54 under Section 39 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  That section provided that the Exchequer would pay into the Social Insurance Fund the amount by which its expenditure exceeded its income in any year.  For the year 1953-54 expenditure on the various benefits provided out of the fund and on administration was originally <Col N="876" /> estimated at £7,250,000, of which just under £2,000,000 had to be provided by the State, the balance coming from the contributions of employers and employed persons and from income from investments.</P>
    <P>It is now estimated that expenditure of the Social Insurance Fund in the current financial year will amount to £8,500,000, or £1,250,000 more than the original Estimate.  In the original Estimate income from contributions was put at £4,750,000.  This amount is now estimated at £4,500,000.  There is, therefore, a deficit of £1,500,000 to be made good and this amount is provided by the Supplementary Estimate before you.</P>
    <P>The amount may seem large but I should point out that the year 1953-54 is the first full year in which the provisions of the new Act were in operation.  Owing to the radical changes in the financial structure of social insurance effected by that Act it was extremely difficult to estimate the amounts of the expenditure and the income of the fund when the Act would be in full operation.</P>
    <P>In the provision made for expenditure on unemployment benefit in the original Estimate allowance was made for the probable increase in expenditure due to the more favourable conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit under the new Act; for example, the longer duration of benefit arising from the modification of the contribution conditions, the fact that agricultural workers, who were not previously insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, would be eligible for unemployment benefit, and the further fact that persons who had exhausted some or all of their title to benefit under the old legislation would be able to qualify for benefit afresh.</P>
    <P>It was assumed that the altered conditions referred to would result in approximately 10 per cent. of the persons who were in receipt of unemployment assistance immediately before the appointed day becoming entitled to unemployment benefit.  In the event, however, it was found that the actual transfer from assistance to benefit was in the neighbourhood of 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> Allowance was also made for an increase in the average rate of benefit as a result of the increased rates provided for claimants and their dependents. The extent of the allowance made has, however, proved inadequate, the rate of unemployment benefit being substantially higher than the figure on which the Estimate was based.</P>
    <P>These factors, taken in conjunction with the overall increase in the live register in the early part of the financial year &mdash; an increase largely attributable to the legislative changes made by the Social Welfare Act, 1952 &mdash; have resulted in a very substantial increase in the amount expended on unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>The more attractive rates of disability benefit have resulted in a greater increase in the number of claims than the increase which had been allowed for this factor in the original Estimate.  In addition, the inclusion of payments for adult and child dependents of claimants was a new feature of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  At the time of preparation of the original Estimate the short experience of this new feature indicated that about one-third of the claimants would have dependents, whereas present indications are that in the case of men a figure of 50 per cent. is more correct.</P>
    <P>In the course of the December debate on the main Estimate I referred to an increase in disability benefit claims which could not be explained as arising from deterioration in the health of the population.  Within recent years there has been a steady growth in the number of medical cerficates received and the figures for 1953 are over 50 per cent. greater than those for 1948, though in the intervening five years the number of persons insured has increased by only 2 per cent.  I have since taken the matter up with the medical profession and asked them to ensure as far as possible that only those genuinely ill will receive medical certificates.  Doctors may contend that there is always an element of doubt as to whether a person is ill or not.  There is, however, a well-established procedure for dealing with such <Col N="878" /> cases in the medical referee scheme. This scheme was instituted for the purpose of making available the impartial advice of independent medical referees on questions of doubt as to incapacity and should be utilised fully by the medical profession for the purpose.  Again, where a medical certifier is satisfied that an applicant is not ill he should not hesitate to refuse a certificate.  In addition he should, in accordance with the procedure laid down for dealing with such cases, notify my Department of the fact.  This is most important, as steps can then be taken to ensure that the applicant cannot obtain benefit by means of a certificate from some other source.</P>
    <P>I feel certain that, having called attention to these matters, I will have the full co-operation of medical certifiers in ensuring that the social Insurance Fund is not imposed upon. I am also having an examination made by officers of my Department of other steps which may be taken towards the same end, but I should emphasise that the full co-operation of certifiers is the most vital factor in the situation.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, men's insurance contribution cards are now surrendered in January and women's cards in July.  The men's cards which were surrendered in January of this year covered a period of 15 months, while the women's cards which were surrendered in July of last year covered a period of only nine months.  As the sale of stamps is always heaviest at the termination of the period of currency of the cards, these changes in the date of surrender and the period covered by the cards which have been surrendered in the present financial year rendered estimation of the amount which would be received in respect of contributions difficult and resulted in the overestimation which I have already mentioned. I have now dealt with the principal factors which have resulted in the need to provide a further sum of £1,568,000 for the Social Insurance Fund in the present financial year. There are small variations in other items of income and expenditure which have been taken into account but <Col N="879" /> which I do not think it is necessary to enumerate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a statement to the House which I think ought to cause grave concern not merely to the members of the House but to the country outside.  The extraordinary difference between the Estimate and what has actually happened cannot be disposed of just as lightly as the Minister would appear to think in the rather brief statement he made and without going in any way fully into an explanation as to how it occurred.</P>
      <P>I do not think any of us here want to say&mdash;in relation to the operation of this particular Act or any other Bills which the Minister has brought before this House&mdash;that &ldquo;we told you so,&rdquo; but there is here I think full evidence of haste&mdash;unnecessary haste&mdash;and going ahead with proposals and giving proposals legislative effect without having properly considered the impact of the proposals which were being put before the House and the country.  The effect of that is, of course, that for a start&mdash; this, be it marked, occurs long before this particular piece of legislation gets into its full sweep&mdash;the taxpayer is now being called on for an additional £1,250,000.  How much greater that sum will be in the future remains to be seen, but there are only two ways&mdash; which can be taken separately or both together&mdash;of meeting it, either by calling further on the taxpayer or by increasing the rate of contributions, or by both.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that in respect of one aspect the estimate was 10 per cent.; in actual practice it has turned out to be 30 per cent.  Surely that requires more than a passing mention from the Minister.  There is full evidence of legislation being rushed before this House and being rushed through the House without full discussion and full consideration, merely for political purposes.  The problem is not dealt with on the merits and is not fully analysed and understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that the estimated income from contributions was £4,750,000.  Again, he did not get within <Col N="880" /> £250,000 of the estimate.  Why? The Minister tried to indicate that that was due to everything but the real cause, namely, increased unemployment. He never once mentioned it. He attributed it to people chopping and changing and coming under different headings and different schedules &mdash;anything but the real cause&mdash;increased unemployment in the country and, therefore, fewer contributions.</P>
    <P>It is staggering to be told by the Minister that in five years the number of sickness claims has increased by 50 per cent.  Every member of the House, irrespective of which side of the House he may be, and the people outside will be shocked at that figure. This, at a time and during a period when we are told that medical science is grasping more thoroughly, more efficiently and more successfully with illness generally and in particular with some of the types of illnesses that were mainly responsible for laying people off work.  The Minister tries blandly, by implication, to attribute the entire of that 50 per cent. to loose certification by the medical profession.  That was the only explanation, in so far as it could be called an explanation, that he gave.  He said he had made representations to the medical certifiers that they should be more careful in future.</P>
    <P>As one who was fairly closely connected for a long number of years with the old National Health Insurance committees before there was unification, and even subsequent to that, may I say that that statement has been made and those representations that the Minister says he has made, have been made to medical certifiers for the last 35 years?</P>
    <P>Of course, what the Minister is saying in effect is that there has been an increase of 50 per cent. in malingering by the workers.  That is really what he means.  He does not put it into those words but anyone who knows anything about it will agree that that is the only conclusion that can be drawn.  If there is an increase of 50 per cent. in malingering, why are the workers malingering?  Is it because they prefer to eke out an existence on the health benefit rather than on a full week's wages?  Is it because they have been <Col N="881" /> unemployed or fear unemployment?  Is it because they were under-employed or part-time employed?</P>
    <P>I do not want to make this appear any worse than it is.  I do not want to draw any conclusions from this extraordinary picture which the Minister has put before the House other than are warranted but I do seriously suggest that it is a matter that should be of the very gravest concern to the Minister, his Department, the House and everybody immediately interested. It will be a matter of very grave concern to the already overburdened taxpayers when they find that for this particular service alone, before the Act goes into full operation, they have to stump up an additional £1,250,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a duty to the House to give a much fuller and much more satisfactory explanation of that extraordinary increase of 50 per cent. in claims for sickness benefit.  He certainly owes the House an explanation as to the difference between the estimate of 10 per cent. and the actual 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>One can understand now the Minister's reluctance in relation to another piece of social legislation to tie himself to any estimate as to the cost of operating and implementing it.  One can only hope that whatever estimates were made in connection with that piece of legislation were much nearer the bone than the estimates in connection with this service.  If the costs of the other legislation are to be increased in proportion to the increase in the cost of this service, I am afraid a blister has been laid on the community that is far greater even than some of us feared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with a good deal of perplexity to the statement made by the Minister in justification of this Supplementary Estimate.  I do not think the Minister can pretend to be satisfied with the baby that has been handed to him by the Department of Social Welfare in the matter of estimates. I do not think the Department is entitled to any credit for the mess which has been made of estimating with regard to the Social Welfare Act. It is understandable that in connection <Col N="882" /> with a new Act of this kind one cannot hit the mark with precision and, inevitably, estimates tend to drift from original concepts.  I do not think we have got a full explanation as to why the Estimate has fallen short to the extent of £1,500,000.  The Minister's statement did not convey any adequate explanation of his hopeless mis-hit in the matter of estimating the cost of this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office publish what are recognised nationally and internationally as very valuable statistics. That office has a high reputation for the breakdown of statistics relating to population and to all kinds of transactions. In view of the fact that the Department had access to that source of information, it is rather extraordinary that, as Deputy Morrissey said, the estimated dependency in connection with disability benefits was 10 per cent. whereas it turned out to be 30 per cent.  The fact that the Department are out by 20 per cent. in estimating dependency, although excellent figures are available from the Central Statistics Office, requires something more than a rather cursory: &ldquo;Ah, well, we made a mistake.&rdquo;  It is clear that somebody cannot read figures or cannot estimate with anything approaching reasonable accuracy, if the figure is given as 10 per cent. and it turns out to be 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Minister has hardly treated the House fairly by the rather casual explanation which he gave of this hopeless Estimate as disclosed in his own statement.  I think that the Minister might have given us a breakdown estimate of what exactly has caused this underestimation.  We are told that the estimate of contributions was £4,750,000 but in fact the actual sum received was £4,500,000.  What caused that underestimation?  It was easy to ascertain what was the employed population of the country at the time the Act came into operation and by additions and subtractions to make certain calculations.  Why the drop of £250,000 in the contribution income in one year?  We have got no adequate explanation of that.  I think we are entitled to ask the Minister what exactly is the cause of the short-fall in revenue attributable to.  Is it <Col N="883" /> attributable to the fact that the Department miscalculated the number of insured contributors or to the fact that the Department miscalculated the extent of unemployment, or is it due to the fact that there was a miscalculation of the number of insured contributors allied with a miscalculation as to the extent of unemployment that would exist over a period?  It should be possible to get that information from the Department.</P>
    <P>On the question of what caused the remainder of the short-fall we are told that dependency was miscalculated.  In one instance it turned out to be 30 per cent. instead of 10 per cent.  How much of the Supplementary Estimate is due to that fact and how much of it is due to the various other claims made on the fund which were not adequately estimated at the time that the general Estimate was prepared?  I think we ought to get that information from the Minister.  We are discussing this in Committee and I desire to reserve my right to speak on this again when I get the information that I require.  It is not possible to discuss the Estimate unless you get an answer to certain questions so that you may be able to base your deductions on them.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister say that since 1948 the number of persons drawing sickness benefit had increased by 50 per cent., and that over a period of five years.  That is a very serious figure and there must be some explanation for it.  In the way in which the Minister referred to the matter one would think that either of two things had happened, (1) that insured persons are malingering.  Does the Minister stop short at saying that they are malingering? Let us bear this in mind in connection with what the Minister has suggested, that all those persons with a claim for benefit have got a certificate from a doctor to the effect that they are ill, and that these certificates have been submitted from the insured persons.  In view of the fact that they have been, or ought to have been, examined by a doctor before benefit was paid, and as the certificates have been received by them from a doctor, it passes my comprehension how it <Col N="884" /> can be suggested that there is malingering on the part of these persons.</P>
    <P>The Department itself and the Minister are indulging, I think, in what apparently is intended by the Department to be a warning to the doctors. I suggest that it should be possible for the Minister, if there is malingering, to deal with it, but it is hardly fair to refer to this matter in certain global language and give the impression that all the traditional illness which is now existent is due to malingering on the part of insured persons or to a conspiracy between the doctors and the insured persons.  This is a matter which should not be left where the Minister has left it in his speech.  He has left it in a most unsatisfactory position.  Nobody knows whether the doctor has been guilty of ill-attention in the issue of certificates or whether the doctor has been fooled by the insured persons.  Until there is some evidence that an insured person has been malingering, I am prepared to believe that the person is genuinely ill especially when the illness is covered by a certificate from a medical officer.</P>
    <P>Is the Department itself helpless in this matter?  As the Minister well knows, the Department has four medical officers in its service.  I do not know whether the number has been increased or decreased within the last couple of years, but these doctors are there as watch-dogs for the Department. If they think that an insured person is receiving benefit improperly, the Department can refer the case to the district medical referee.  The district medical referee is not there for the health of the insured person or as a kind of a welfare officer for the insured person.  He is there, in fact, as a kind of watch-dog for the Department, so that if there is malingering the Department itself has a method of dealing with it and, in fact, does.  If I have any complaint on this matter it is that the Department sends persons to the district medical referee who ought to have their benefit continued.  Very frequently persons are sent to the district medical referee and the payment of benefit is stopped.  It is only reinstated when the district medical <Col N="885" /> referee reports that there was no justification for stopping the benefit in the first instance.  There is no use in the Department saying that it is the doctor who certifies who is responsible.  The Department has its own remedy if there is malingering for dealing with it, besides making blind swipes at people who are genuinely ill and who can suffer considerably by the stoppage of the payment of benefit.</P>
    <P>I have had quite a considerable number of complaints, and so, too, have had my colleagues, about the difficulty in getting sickness benefit paid on the expectation that a person is ill and of the tangles which subsequently arise, even after the benefit has been put in train in the first instance. I do not know what state this section of the Department is in or what conditions there are, but if what I complain of is due to inadequate staff in the section, then I think the Minister should examine the matter and make sure that the section which deals with the claims of insured persons for sickness benefit is adequately staffed.  He should ensure that there will be no delay in paying benefit through insufficiency of staff.  Many of those claiming benefit will be out of work and will have children depending on them.  Therefore, there should be no delay in paying benefit to them. The Minister should examine the matter and apply the remedy to whatever set of circumstances may exist in that section at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that there are people in need of the money which the Minister is asking the House to vote.  But in asking for that sum, like my colleagues Deputy Norton and Deputy Morrissey, I feel that the Minister has failed to face up to the facts of the situation.  He tells us that there is a reduction in the revenue, the estimated income, and, of course, it is clear that that reduction in income is due solely to increased unemployment, and not only that but that the policy of the Government and the Central Bank is having its effect and is being reflected on this Vote.  The Minister should have adverted to that. I know it is not reasonable from the <Col N="886" /> political angle to expect him to admit that; but, mind you, truth can sometimes be better than concealment, and I think he should face up to that by admitting it.</P>
      <P>Secondly, when the Minister tells us that there is an increase since 1948 of the benefit or illness claims and that he thinks that the doctors should be warned on that matter, I would like to know from the Minister what the figures were for each year, 1948-49, 1949-50, 1950-51, 1951-52, 1952-53 and 1953-54, and I think he should have broken down those figures for us.  I suggest that in replying he should give the increase of illness in each of the years; but I am prepared to assert that the increase in this year, 1953-54, is greater than in other years for this reason, that when you increase the cost of living to the worker and increase the cost of the loaf and so on, you automatically lower the vitality of the people and have more illness as a result, and there is a delay in their recovery&mdash;that if they had been properly sustained, and everything like that, they would be able to come back to their employment more quickly or at an earlier stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the reason why this money is required and the reason for the increase in the illness and the increased benefits that have to be paid for a continuation of illness is due to a great extent, as I am asserting, to the policy that the Central Bank laid down that people were eating and drinking too much and were too well clothed, and that the Central Bank and the Government are to be congratulated on the success of their programme, but the taxpayer is going to pay for it in this particular way and the productivity of the country is being reduced by that number of people being unemployed.</P>
      <P>I have no brief for the medical profession, but the Minister actually convicts them for careless certification, saying that they have not taken proper care in the issue of certificates.  That is a serious matter, because whatever may happen in the cities I do not know, but I do know that in the country if a person is in receipt of disablement benefit under the National Health Act and if he is well everybody knows it and he cannot malinger, and if he has been in employment there is a demand for him to return to his work.  Therefore, I hold that that excuse or probable cause, as the Minister said, of the increase by 50 per cent. is not a proper excuse, and I trust that he will advert to it at some greater length when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no comfort to anybody in this House to know that the vitality of our people is being lowered steadily, and it is certainly a surprise to me to learn as the Minister says that since 1948 it has taken place.  That surprises me. Why from 1948 I do not know; there is a point, I presume, in the Minister selecting that as the date.  However, he will tell us about that, I presume, on this Estimate, which, fortunately, is in Committee, and some other Deputies of this House will have an opportunity <Col N="888" /> of referring to the matter again if the Minister does not give satisfaction.</P>

      <P>It seems amazing that there should be such underestimation in the provision of moneys for social welfare in this country.  But if that has been the position I suppose we have got to accept it.  As has been pointed out, the Minister has made some amazing statements, and I think that one of the most amazing was that the claims for National Health Insurance in the past five years had increased by 50 per cent.  I do not want to refer to things that have been mentioned by the previous three speakers, but I want to raise this particular point on social insurance, and I raise it because in view of the discussion that has taken place it seems to me that the Department, in an effort to cut their losses, have given directions to some of their officers over the past six months to effect economies.  I think that they have been very, very successful in that; and the particular branch of the Department that seems to me to have been picked out is that section that deals with the payment, or should I say the non-payment, of unemployment benefit.  I do not know whether Deputies have experience of hearings given all over the country by the appeals officers to those who appeal against decisions to disallow unemployment benefit, but I have, and I have had in the last six months especially the experience of seeing practically every single appellant turned down by the appeals officer&mdash;people against whom it was alleged that they were not genuinely seeking work.  It seems in some cases to be a bit of a joke to accuse a man or woman in this country of not genuinely seeking work when the unemployment figures are at the figure they are now and have been for a considerable time.  I might quote one particular instance, a question which was answered by the Parliamentary Secretary last week in respect of one particular town, where there were 13 appeals before the appeals officer for unemployment benefit, and of those 13, 12 were disallowed and one case was deferred. Those 12 were accused of not genuinely seeking work.</P>

      <P>This has <Col N="889" /> reference only to the sickness side of social welfare, I think.  I do not think that the section refers to unemployment. I want to be guided on that.  I think that Section 39, sub-section (9), deals only with national health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seriously suggesting that there must have been some direction given to those appeals officers around the country to cut down, and cut down to the bone, on these appeals.  In that respect&mdash;I forget now whether it is a provision in the Act or whether it is merely done by regulation&mdash;the sooner the Minister and his Department revert to the old system of a Court of Referees the better it will be because it seems that at the moment one has not the slightest chance, if it is being charged against an appellant that he is not genuinely seeking work, of having an appeal upheld by the appeals officer. In the past six months especially when the Department became aware that they would have to ask the Dáil for this £1,500,000 they made a determined effort under this particular section to try to save money thereby throwing a certain added incidence of expenditure on to the local authorities because the people who were turned down must have recourse to the home assistance officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems also, as Deputy Norton pointed out, that if the Minister and his officials thought there was malingering or wrong certification by doctors in relation to National Health Insurance claims, the Department itself had a remedy.  Spot checks could have been made around the country.  It is extraordinary that it is only after five years we have a public announcement about this.  The increases must have been <Col N="890" /> gradual.  Perhaps the Minister when he next speaks will tell us what the percentage increase has been over the years since 1948 in relation to the claims for National Health Insurance. I suggest that he and his officials have neglected their duty if that position was allowed to go on, a position in which, as the Minister alleges&mdash;he does it by inference and innuendo&mdash;there must have been malingering or illegal certification by medical officers.</P>

      <P>I am not rising to wind up the debate.  I merely want to give some information for which I was asked.  Deputy Norton asked me to give more detail in relation to this increased expenditure.  The amount in regard to disability has increased by £226,000: that is the estimated amount now asked for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether this £226,000 is needed because of inaccurate estimating as to dependency or because of greater certification?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is due to both: first of all, inaccurate estimating with regard to dependency and, secondly, an increased incidence of sickness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we get a breakdown of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be too difficult. Possibly I could get it if I had the time. It was estimated that of all those applying, 30 per cent. would have dependents; actually, 50 per cent. have dependents.  Some figures were quoted and, perhaps, they were not properly interpreted by the Deputies.  That, however, was a mistake in estimating in relation to that particular figure.  The Act was only a short time in operation when the estimate was made and it looked as if the experience would be that 30 per cent. would have dependents. The figure worked out at 50 per cent.  I admit that only a very short-time sample was taken, but I do not think anybody can be blamed for that, <Col N="891" /> because it could be assumed the pattern would be the same for the entire year.  The estimate was also checked against unemployment and the unemployment figure appeared to bear out that figure of 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>Added to that there was an increase in sickness.  A printed circular was issued to the doctors in 1947.  I do not think there was any political reason for that.  I take it the Government was taking the five-year period 1947-1952. I will give the increases each year from that time on.  The number of certificates issued in 1947 was 1,200,000; in the next year there was an increase of 126,000 on that; in 1949 there was an increase of 112,000; in 1950 there was an increase of 172,000; in 1951 there was an increase of 145,000; in 1952 there was an increase of 150,000. Each of those represents an increase on the year immediately preceding. I have only an estimated figure for 1953 and it appears to be almost an increase of 200,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every one of them.  I do not think that I have any worse opinion of people than Deputy Morrissey or Deputy Norton.  Possibly if I were in opposition I would adopt the same line as they are adopting.  I am trying to find out to what this is due.  I find it very hard to explain it. I do not care what Deputy Morrissey and Deputy MacEoin say from the Fine Gael viewpoint, there is no more sickness now than there was in 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There ought not to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There should not be and there is not.  Now we want to get the explanation.  Before the increases were given a man might be quite genuinely sick and not claim benefit because he would only get 15/- per week.  He <Col N="892" /> might not consider it worth his while. Now he is getting 50/- and he considers it worth his while to make a claim.  He is not a malingerer.  He is claiming because he thinks it worth his while. That is part of the explanation.  The benefits are more worth while and therefore more are claiming.  But that does not explain the increase from 1947 to 1953 because there is a fairly uniform increase the whole way through and I find it very difficult to explain it.</P>
      <P>That increase has been going on for years.  Probably Deputy Norton has seen some of these figures.  He will remember that medical referees are sent out from the Department&mdash;Deputies generally may not be aware of the procedure&mdash;to different centres in the country where people in receipt of benefit are asked to report for examination.  I do not think people are asked to come when they are only away from work for a week or two. The experience always has been that a good percentage of those invited to come along to the Referee go back to work and do not face the Referee.  I think the estimated figure is 30 per cent.  What is the reason for that? Of the two-thirds that remain and present themselves to the Referee a fair number are sent back by the Referee as fit for work.  We can only conclude from that that the doctors are not as strict as they might conscientiously be in issuing certificates.</P>
      <P>I think it is a great pity we cannot get this scheme administered strictly but fairly because Deputies must agree that if there was a strict observance of the regulations in relation to benefits generally, and if we had the same amount of money at our disposal we could do something more for the really genuine cases.  That is the point of view from which I look at it.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, I have no worse opinion of the people than Deputy Morrissey, Deputy MacEoin or Deputy Norton but I am trying to solve this problem.  Deputies opposite have made no suggestion as to why there should be 2,000,000 certificates now as compared with 1,200,000 in 1947.  I am looking for the explanation. That is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> In relation to unemployment, the original Estimate was £1,830,000 and we are now adding £935,000.  I do not think these figures have been properly understood.  I mentioned the 10 per cent. which the Department estimated as representing those on unemployment assistance who would also be eligible for unemployment insurance. In fact, 30 per cent. of those in receipt of unemployment assistance were eligible for unemployment insurance.  On consideration of that, I saw that it would have been a tedious matter. Every claimant's card would have to be examined in order to give a good estimate on that matter and of course we had not time to do that.  Anyway, that was the mistake as far as that was concerned.  There were two mistakes made, first of all, with regard to those who were changing from unemployment assistance to unemployment insurance and, secondly, the number of dependents that the person claiming would have.  Then, of course, there was the other matter that was foreseen at the time, that 19,000 agricultural labourers coming in for unemployment insurance would make a difference.  That was taken into account.</P>
    <P>There is another item I did not mention in my opening statement because I have not been able to get any good estimate on the matter but I hope to be able to get an estimate later on, and that is the clause in the Act which enables a man who is qualified at 65 to draw unemployment insurance.  If he is qualified at the age of 65 then, provided he is seeking work and cannot get it, he can continue to draw it for five years.  As Deputies are aware, before the Act was brought in he could only draw it for three months and then had to requalify.  I do not know what that is costing.  I have no idea and I am not going to say that it is costing a lot, but it is an item in the calculation of this increased expenditure.</P>
    <P>The next item is maternity allowances. Proportionately, I suppose, we underestimated.  We estimated for £16,000 and we are now looking for something like £2,500.  Then there are widows' and orphans' pensions.  We are <Col N="894" /> only dealing with contributory pensions. The original Estimate was £1,258,000 and we are looking for a Supplementary Estimate of £95,000. Therefore there was an underestimate with regard to widows' and orphans' pensions.  The next item is the marriage grant.  The Estimate was £59,000 and the Supplementary Estimate required is £9,700.  Then there is the maternity grant.  The maternity grant Estimate was £65,000.  We got too much there and we can surrender £2,100 out of that.  Administration expenses were estimated at £882,000 and the Supplementary Estimate is for £17,000.  On the income side, the contributions were estimated at £4,821,000, and, as I told you, we were too optimistic with regard to that to the extent of £260,000.  Investments were estimated at £483,000 and we are getting £28,000 less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the return on the investments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The investment return was another item which was estimated at £32,000 and we are actually getting £42,000 or £10,000 more.  In case I might be asked about the investment business, I should say that there are two items in it which were affected.  The first was that the interest rate was very slightly lower than anticipated.  Secondly, there was an amount of money from the fund tied up in building Áras Mhic Dhiarmada and at the same time there was no rent from C.I.E.  However, when C.I.E. begin to pay rent the interest on our money comes back again.  The period of building meant that money was being spent and there was no return for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but that is Government finance.  There is one thing very difficult about the income from contributions. It was very difficult, not so much to work out how many stamps would be sold in the year, because I think they were about correct in that as they estimated that the employment position would be about the same. I am not talking about unemployment, but they estimated that the employment <Col N="896" /> position would be about the same as it was in the previous year. Actually, I think it was 1 per cent. higher.  The fact that the years were changed made a great difference.  The women's cards that were handed in last June had only nine months' contributions on them.  If they had been handed in at the end of September there would be 12 months' contributions and that would make a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>The men's cards were handed in on the 1st January and they had 15 months' contributions.  Some people are a bit slow about handing in cards and employers are a bit slow about stamping them.  Then, by the time the money passes through the Post Office and comes to our Department it is almost certain that a part of it will not reach the Department by the end of March.  We do not know what that will amount to and in this estimate we are allowing for a certain delay in that money coming in.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is perfectly right.  I do not think the Minister should dream of making any further estimate.  He is very wise but the Minister is not quite so wise when he chooses an occasion like this to be sort of impertinent about the Fine Gael Party and about the inter-Party Government.  The Minister has not improved the position one bit by his explanation.  I do not think that, in our experience, as bad a picture has ever been put before this House.  I think it is a damning indictment of the Minister and his Department.  In view of the figures which the Minister gave for all the years, I was amazed to hear the Minister say that he and his Department were satisfied that a considerable part of the increase in the claims for sickness benefit could be <Col N="897" /> attributed, or was attributable, to the increase in the benefits payable. They were perfectly satisfied with that.  Was the Department or the Minister himself aware of the figures which he had given for the years prior to the increase in the amount of benefit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister emphasised it, but it does not hold water for one moment.  There is an explanation: there must be an explanation for this. If there is&mdash;and, as I say, there is&mdash;the Minister has not found it; and, if he has found it, he has not given it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it will be agreed there would have to be an absolute conspiracy amongst the medical profession, as Deputy Norton said, for the claims to have increased 50 per cent. in five years.  Those five years, or the greater part of those five years, were a period in which the workers' standard of living had increased to the highest level known in this country. During that period, particularly during the period 1948-51, the income of all workers, by way of remuneration and <Col N="898" /> wages, had increased to a far greater extent than at any similar period in our history.  How can you assert or allege that at a time like that, when employment, certainly over the three years 1948-51, was more readily available to workers in this country than at any similar period since the State was founded, and when the wages and lower salaries were increased more than once &mdash;in a period before there was any increase in sickness benefit&mdash;that workers deliberately elected, without being ill, to pretend illness so that they would get roughly for being ill one-fourth&mdash;I am taking a very rough figure&mdash;of the amount they would get for working?</P>
      <P>Is there any reason known to the Department, to the Minister or to anybody else which can explain that at a period when, as I say, the workers' standard of living had been raised to a higher level than ever before and when work was more freely available, certainly up to 1951, at the highest rate of wages that ever ruled in this country, we should have an intensification of malingering and of faked illness?  As I say, there must be some explanation but the House has not got it and we are entitled to get it.  If the Department and the Minister do not know it they should know it.</P>

    <P>It is not good enough to come in here lightheartedly, in the vein in which the Minister has come, looking for an additional £1,250,000 to be taken out of the pockets of the people in a year in which they are called upon to bear a load of taxation which they are unable to carry.  It is not good enough merely to state that the Estimate for unemployment was £1,830,000 and that, due to the fact that they were unable to judge the situation and, if we take the Minister's own words, due to the fact that they did not understand the legislation which they themselves were putting through the House and the effect it was going to have, the Minister now wants no less than £930,000 more in respect of that service alone. Nothing like this has ever been presented to the House before.  I think the Minister should be in sackcloth and ashes.  If ever an Estimate deserved to be rejected, if it were not for the fact that its rejection would <Col N="899" /> involve hardship, not on the Minister or his Department but on the sick and the unemployed, this Supplementary Estimate would certainly deserve to be rejected.</P>
    <P>The Minister's second speech certainly did not clarify the position. It certainly did not give any reason whatever for these extraordinary series of miscalculations.  Let us think for a moment of the numbers of millions of pounds that are being dealt with in this Department. The Minister on occasions boasts of the fact that his Department alone is spending more than one-quarter of the entire taxation raised in this country. He boasts of that but it is not something to boast about.  Is it not an extraordinary reflection on all the boastful talk we have heard, particularly in the last couple of years, about the enormous strides we have made with the health services of this country, about the amazing success of the measures which were supposed to have been taken for the prevention of disease in this country&mdash;the success of scientific developments, the discoveries in medicine and surgery, that have shortened so considerably the period of illness&mdash;that all those claims are given the lie absolutely and emphatically by the disclosures which the Minister for Health has had to make here to-day?</P>
    <P>I do not want to take it any further. Unfortunately I cannot take it any further.  Unfortunately I cannot ask the House to refuse to give this supplementary sum because, as I say, the hardship involved in that step would not fall on those upon whom, perhaps, it should fall but rather on innocent people who are ill and unemployed. The Minister is not going to get away with it, either in this House or outside in the country, by these cheap gibes about the previous Government or about any particular political Party in this House.  It is a serious matter, an exceptionally serious matter.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious matter, indeed, if it is due to some other reason.  I cannot accept for a moment that malingering on a scale that would account for an increase of 50 per cent. in five years is the explanation.  Can anybody picture the social position, <Col N="900" /> and its impact on our economic life having regard to the comparative smallness of our insured working population, that in the last year, in the calendar year, 2,000,000 sickness certificates were issued?  I would like to see that brought into proper relation to the numbers of our insured&mdash;and I want to emphasise insured&mdash;working population of this country.  It is a staggering figure.  It is something that cannot be lightly dealt with as the Minister has sought to deal with it here.  Perhaps the Minister has no other course, but the Minister will have to find the reason and give it to the House.  Otherwise, if he does not, this is not the end of it&mdash;it is only the beginning.</P>

      <P>We are going to vote for this because it is necessary in order to ensure that the under-privileged section of the community will be able to get the benefits provided under the Social Welfare Act in order to sustain them.  But the Parliamentary Secretary can now revel in the distinction that has been thrust upon him of having been responsible for an Estimate which probably creates a record as the most inaccurate Estimate ever presented to this House.  The figures must have been calculated in the dark.  Somebody must have put out the light when these figures were being totted.  Fancy the Minister saying we estimate we need £1.8 million, when in fact they needed £935,000 on top of the original £1.8 million for unemployment.  I am not quarrelling about the total sum but about the inaccuracy on the part of this Department which has access to so <Col N="901" /> much statistical information.  Can anyone imagine what would have happened if this occurred during the inter-Party Government's time in office? Dr. Ryan and Deputy Kennedy would make the welkin ring.  But now the precision estimators blandly come along themselves and say: We made a mess of it, we are £1,250,000 short. We were nearly £1,000,000 short on unemployment alone.  This Estimate is out anything between 20 and 50 per cent.  The Parliamentary Secretary ought, when this Estimate is over, give some consideration to what method of atonement they will adopt towards the Dáil for their very obviously inept display in the presentation of Estimates.</P>
      <P>Obviously somebody should give the Minister a lesson in estimating because nobody could understand what he said here in relation to Store Street this evening.  Even the scientists engaged in splitting the atom could not get what the Minister had in mind.  Here once again are the facts.  C.I.E., bankrupt as they were and not able to pay their debts, decided they would embark on building Store Street.  Let me mention as an aside that they also decided they would demolish a fine hotel in Glengarriff and build a new one.  They had no money to build a new one but that did not bother C.I.E. and they paid fees to an architect to plan a scheme for the demolition of the old hotel and the building of a new one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then C.I.E., bankrupt and unable to pay their own bills, decided to build Store Street.  They could not at that time pay the rates on the Kingsbridge property but that never bothered them.  They decided to build Store Street.  They got a certain distance. Then it was left a gaunt ruin because they had no more money to go on. They did not know what to do, and like other people who spend extravagantly they could not pay their bills. We decided to buy it and complete the building rather than have it as a crows' rookery down on the Liffey side, an example of the fatuity of C.I.E. as then constituted.  But we liquidated moneys invested to the credit of insurance funds in British securities and with the moneys thus <Col N="902" /> liquidated we completed the C.I.E. building at Store Street and paid off C.I.E. whatever they had spent on it. A situation was then created in which foreign-invested money held to the credit of the insurance funds was utilised to complete Store Street and to pay off C.I.E. what they had spent on it in order to enable them to pay other bills which they had been unable to pay.  That created one difficulty.  It was this.  In the new Department of Social Welfare it was not the invested funds that should provide the building but the State, and to the extent to which these funds were withdrawn from investment and invested in the building they were going to lose the interest they would earn which would normally go to the benefit of the Department's funds.  But what we said to the Department was this: We liquidated the foreign assets, we built Store Street.  We will lose the interest but you pay us the interest on the funds instead of providing the building. What is the result to-day?  Instead of our £1,000,000 being invested in growing peanuts in Kenya, it is now invested in the building in Store Street and gives the Department of Social Welfare a headquarters it never dreamed it would have.  It has taken a lot of civil servants from premises around town and made these premises available for other civil servants in branches that are overcrowded.  The result is that the money has been put to good use and so far as the funds are concerned they are safeguarded by the State passing into the fund a sum of money which would be spent providing premises elsewhere.  These are the simple economics of the Store Street building.  I think they are sound from every point of view.</P>
    <P>This is almost like scolding a child a dozen times over for the same offence.  This is the most hopeless Estimate ever to come before the House&mdash;hopeless from the point of view of a sheer, inept Estimate.  While we vote for it because of the purpose to which the money is being devoted, I hope some effort will be made between now and this time next year to get a less inaccurate Estimate than was presented on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indebted to the Minister for giving us some information in regard to this rather staggering Supplementary Estimate.  It does seem somewhat extraordinary to come to the House to look for a Supplementary Estimate which is necessitated by an underestimation of nearly 90 per cent. on the original Estimate and to furnish no particulars in the documents circulated beforehand.  I should like to know from the Minister the basis on which the amount for unemployment was calculated.  Presumably, when the Estimate was prepared there must have been an estimate made of the number of people who would be unemployed in the course of the year.  That, in turn, presumably, had to be broken down into the different types of benefit that would be payable.  It would be of interest to the House to know the number of persons unemployed who were budgeted for when this Estimate was prepared.</P>
      <P>It would seem, whether the officials of the Department, the Minister or the Government were responsible for it, that there was gross underestimation of the unemployment position.  For that I would criticise, not so much the officials, as the Minister and the members of the Government as they should have foreseen that unemployment in 1953 would reach new levels by reason of the policy which they were implementing. However, we now have the fruits of that policy and we find that practically an additional £1,000,000 is required in regard to the unemployment fund.</P>
      <P>It would be useful if at some stage a somewhat fuller analysis were made of the social welfare payments and charges which are attributable to unemployment and if these were made available to the House so that the country might realise the cost of unemployment to the nation.</P>
      <P>I am not sure from the Minister's explanation whether any portion of the £1,500,000 which is now being sought is to be used for administrative purposes.  Is any of this amount required, for instance, in regard to Store Street?</P>

      <P>For administrative purposes?  Does that include, for instance, provision of new furniture in Store Street or are there lurking in this Supplementary Estimate fairly substantial sums for the provision of equipment for Store Street or other offices held by the Department?  May we take it that the £17,000, which the Minister referred to, for administrative expenses includes everything other than the actual payment of benefits?  The House is entitled to that information before being asked to pass this Estimate.</P>
      <P>We might also be told what the additional £17,000 for administrative expenses consists of.  Is it additional staffs?  Is it additional equipment? What is it for?  I know that £17,000 may sound a small sum in a Supplementary Estimate for £1,500,000 but, nevertheless, the House is entitled to know exactly what this £1,500,000 is for.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the House, first, whether all the moneys sought in the Supplementary Estimate, with the exception of £17,000, is for the payment of actual benefits, sickness or unemployment benefit, and, secondly, how this additional £17,000 for administrative expenses is made up.  Is it more newspaper advertising, or what is it for?</P>
      <P>The House is entitled to complain, first, at the gross underestimation, an underestimation that suggests either complete inefficiency on the part of the estimating machinery of the Department or, alternatively, that would seem to indicate that an attempt was made for one reason or another to keep the Estimates down to conceal the true position at the time the Estimates were introduced.  The House is also entitled to complain at the lack of information and the way in which the Supplementary Estimate is presented to the House.</P>

      <P>For the best part of 40 years in a transport concern, I fiddled with figures.  I may be getting a bit stupid, as I am a little older now, but I do not understand the mathematics by which the Minister endeavoured to explain the present financial position of Store Street in connection with the allocation and division of rental, if I may describe it as such.  The Minister talked about 4 per cent, forgetting for the time being that he gave subscribers to the National Loan 5 per cent., and he probably also overlooked the fact that 6¾ per cent. is charged to local authorities for housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to get from the Parliamentary Secretary, who may be a much abler man than the Minister, some explanation of the future financial commitments with regard to Store Street.  What is the annual charge to be borne?  What is the period for which that annual charge is to be borne in connection with the rental of Store Street?  How is it to be allocated as between the Department of Social Welfare, who occupy probably seven-eighths of the premises, compared with C.I.E.?  The Minister hinted that there was some bargaining going on with somebody.  Could it be possible that this bargaining was going on between the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance?  If so, what is it about?  Or, is the suggested bargaining going on between the Department of Social Welfare and C.I.E. direct?  Let us have some explanation of the position. The Civil Service has been in occupation of Store Street for some considerable time.  C.I.E. have gone in there and have been using it for some time as comfortable storage premises for their buses without, as far as I know, being sure that the movement from Aston's Quay to Store Street will bring them one additional penny of revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> For the past couple of years, since the present Government came back into office, we have heard a good deal in this House about what happened when the inter-Party Government were in charge of C.I.E. and of the country. Surely it is not possible that the bargaining now going on, if it is going on, between the Department of Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance or the Government, of which Dr. Ryan is a member, will end in putting a further heavy charge on C.I.E., the company that is now operating with the assistance of over £1,000,000 subsidy.</P>
    <P>I also want to know something more about the circumstances in which the contract for the movement of furniture and papers was handed to a certain concern by the Department of Social Welfare, without any public advertisement. I am not quite sure of myself on this, but it appears to me that the usual procedure was departed from by whoever took it upon himself&mdash;either the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;to give a contract to a turf-carrying company for the removal of furniture and papers from other places to Store Street, without inviting public tenders.  The usual procedure, as the Parliamentary Secretary very well knows or ought to know, was that the Board of Works carried out that kind of work for all State Departments. The excuse given here for the departure from the usual procedure was&mdash; and it was a damned disgrace to say so in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We know that this turf-carrying company got the job of carrying papers and files into Store Street.  Presumably the Department pays its debts.  Therefore, if it has done that, some of the money which was paid to this turf-carrying company is for the administrative excess which the Parliamentary Secretary is asking the House to vote.  We can delay the question as to whether it is in order or not so as to provide the Parliamentary Secretary with an opportunity of reading out a list of the items comprised in the additional £16,000.  These, I imagine, will provide plenty of nails on which to hang an argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other Deputies, feel that it is rather unreasonable to ask the House for the colossal sum of £1,500,000 when the Minister is unable to inform the House explicitly what the money is required for.  I think the fact that we have such an Estimate before us shows poor foresight on the part of the officers of the Department, especially in view of the fact that the original sum was not quite £2,000,000. I had not the opportunity of hearing either the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary explain what precisely this money is to be used for.  I think that the members of the House who did hear the Minister are at almost as much of a loss in that regard as I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> I think it is only fair, when a member of the Government asks the House for the sum of money set down in this Estimate, that we, the representatives of the people, are entitled to be told what precisely the money is for, and why provision was not made for it in the original Estimate.  I believe it was indicated some time ago that an Estimate like this might be expected.  I think that the items as set out in the sub-heads do not reflect any great credit either on the activities of the Department or on the policy of the Government generally.  For example, we see here a sum of £1,765,000 for unemployment.  I think no greater condemnation of a Government could be found than is to be found in that demand.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that, at a time when two by-elections are taking place, it would be considered rather unwise to publish the extraordinary position we have in the country in regard to unemployment.  If a sum of £1,765,000 has to be found at this time for unemployment benefit, then it would appear to me that there must be something radically wrong.  I do not think anybody could defend a situation of that kind.  Despite what we may be told about the changes which have taken place in social welfare and the increases which are to be paid as a result of admitting new applicants, I submit that there cannot be any defence whatsoever of a situation which puts on the State, and on the employed workers in it, responsibility for the provision of £1,765,000 for unemployment.</P>
    <P>I have heard many things said here about unemployment.  At times I was inclined to think that the position was being exaggerated, but here we have conclusive proof that there was no exaggeration, and that the problem of unemployment is a growing national menace in our midst.  We are told that out of the National Development Fund provision will be made for the relief of unemployment.  I think it foreshadows a very dismal future for our people if something cannot be done to ease this unemployment situation and to make the draws on that fund <Col N="910" /> considerably less.  Unless something is done, then the result inevitably will be that those fortunate enough to find themselves in employment must continue to bear a greater burden in order to provide for those for whom employment is not available.  The net result will be that the pay packets of those in employment will be so diminished that there will be little purchasing power left for their recipients.  I think we should have some explanation or some indication from the Government as to what they propose to do to remedy that situation. Surely they cannot disclaim responsibility; and while I give the Government full credit for all schemes they might introduce to relieve unemployment, and have always done so, and while I thought they were proceeding on the right road before Christmas, I must confess that I as an ordinary Deputy am alarmed at the situation that this reflects.  There may be a good explanation for it, but if an explanation is not forthcoming Deputies are entitled to draw their own conclusions and to assume that this money may be used for a purpose which the Parliamentary Secretary is not prepared to disclose or to cover up some arrangement which may be made in connection with the Store Street accommodation. It is quite open to that interpretation. I say that if the Parliamentary Secretary has a full sense of his responsibility he will remove any doubt that may come into existence in the people's mind as to what this money may be used for, and will indicate clearly to this House precisely what the moneys will be used for. Otherwise I have no doubt that capital may be made of it.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can justify this Estimate I am quite prepared to accept it, but in the absence of that I do think that Deputies may reasonably draw a certain conclusion which may not be in accordance with the facts but must be accepted if they are not explained.</P>

      <P>I regret that Deputy Finan has made the kind of speech he has just made.  Were it not for that speech I do not think I would have intervened at all.  The suggestions and <Col N="911" /> the innuendoes that were in the last few words of his speech ought not, I think, be permitted to go unchallenged. After all, we have, as Deputy Finan well knows, very complicated accounting machinery.  Every penny that is spent has to be spent in accordance with the authority of this House.  We have the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who is not an officer of the Government but is an officer appointed by this House to supervise the expenditure of money, and there is no possibility that any person with a proper state of mind can reasonably infer that moneys passed by this House for expenditure can be devoted to other purposes, to cover up, as Deputy Finan said, or to use in a way that Deputies in this House would not approve of if they knew what was the reason behind the Vote.  The Minister has come before the House and has disclosed that there was an Estimate that was not as near the mark as one would like Estimates to be.  He has explained that to the House, and I think that any person familiar with the difficulties that face a new Department such as this will know how difficult it is in the first couple of years to be reasonably precise in regard to an Estimate.  The Minister has frankly told the House that there have been increases in medical certification which cause him very serious concern and which he is trying to get to the bottom of, and the Deputies who have spoken in regard to that point, Deputy Norton and Deputy Morrissey, want to know what is the cause of the increased certification. Deputy MacEoin, of course, said that the health of the country has deteriorated so much and that that is the cause of it.  Deputy Morrissey did not accept that, neither did Deputy Norton nor, I think, any other Deputy in the House.</P>

I look on this Estimate in a completely different way to the way in which it has been looked at by Deputy Morrissey and Deputy General MacEoin, and certainly in a much different way to the way that Deputy Finan has looked at it.  I am glad that under the legislation we have passed we are in a position to make provision to the extent of the moneys that are mentioned here both in the original Estimate and in the Supplementary Estimate for people who require that assistance from the State.  I think it is a good thing that our legislation is in such a way that we are enabled to make provision for that, and while there may be criticism of the fact that the Estimate was not 100 per cent. or 90 per cent. or 80 per cent. accurate a year ago the important thing is that we have statutory provision to ensure that the payments to which the people are entitled will be paid to them.  That is from my point of view the main aspect of this Supplementary Estimate.  I am glad that the Minister has brought it in because it shows that as far as the Minister is concerned he is determined to see that the provisions that our statutes give to people who are unemployed and to people who are ill will be honoured. And we are honouring our bond to those people by passing here this evening this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the occasion should be availed of to make the innuendoes and the nasty suggestions that Deputy Finan made in regard to it.  This is not the Estimate on which one can talk about the provision of schemes for employment.  We will get many other opportunities to discuss that.  What we are discussing now is our social welfare code and the provision we make for the people who unfortunately for one reason or another, for a short time or a longer time, are unable to earn their own livelihood.  I say that in passing this Supplementary Estimate we are honouring our obligations and our bond to the people; and while it is perfectly legitimate for Deputy Norton, as a previous Minister, to criticise the bad estimation of the Minister or the bad estimation of the Department over which he presided <Col N="913" /> not so long ago, the other matters that have been mentioned are not in my view relevant or proper to the Estimate.  I am glad that we are honouring our bond in passing this Supplementary Estimate and that we are showing the people that whatever amount of money is necessary to fulfil our statutory obligations to them will be made available by the House.  I think that is the principal and most important part of this Supplementary Estimate and it certainly has my wholehearted approval.</P>

      <P>When the Minister spoke in the first instance, he made what a number of Deputies considered was an inadequate explanation of this Supplementary Estimate.  In other words, there was no satisfactory explanation as to why there was underestimation. I then said, when the Ceann Comhairle was in the Chair, that we would not regard the Minister as being entitled <Col N="914" /> to conclude until we had got an explanation from him of these items.  Now we got some explanation from the Minister.  I do not know what the Parliamentary Secretary will say.  I do not know whether he will give an explanation of some of the other points raised or reply to some of the other questions asked.  The Chair has accepted the position that this Estimate is in Committee, and if the Parliamentary Secretary now discloses some information in reply to the questions put to him, I feel I am within my rights in taking up the matters raised by the Parliamentary Secretary.  If he merely replies to points already raised in the debate, I shall not bother; but if we get more information on the instalment system which has been adopted here this evening, then I claim I am entitled to speak again.</P>

The Minister then left the House and <Col N="915" /> did not sit in for the remainder of the discussion, though, as Deputy Morissey has said, this is an Estimate for £1,500,000.  Since the Minister left the House we have put questions to the Parliamentary Secretary and the Parliamentary Secretary has maintained a magnificent silence.  I notice he is now going to break his silence.  Perhaps he will break the sound barrier.  If he gives us some further information which we have been seeking surely we are entitled then to deal with the information the Parliamentary Secretary gives us.  All this arises because the Minister had a slovenly brief and did not give any adequate explanation of the Estimate.

      <P>Whatever competence I have or have not, I claim that our appeals officers, from my knowledge of them, are humane people and do their work very conscientiously.  They give the benefit of the doubt in all cases of <Col N="916" /> appeal.  Deputy Corish singled out a particular group on a particular occasion where ten of the appeals were turned down and another was deferred.  That is not the general picture in the country; neither is it the general picture in County Wexford.</P>
      <P>It has been my observation of social legislation over the years, let it be old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions or anything else, that the sum tends to go up all the time, year by year.  Every Deputy who approaches a Minister, irrespective of what Government is in office, approaches him not to find out as to why a particular person should not get one of these benefits but to make the case that the person should get the full benefit.  I have never known of any Deputy at any time to make the case that a claimant should not get a benefit.  So it is that the sum is going up every year whether it be old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions or anything else.  Deputy Finan should bear in mind that whilst we admit that by far the greater part of this sum is made up of unemployment benefit there is at the same time a considerable sum for widows' and orphans' pensions and disability.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey stated that for the past 35 years there have been complaints of malingering and wrong certification. That is so.  There is, unfortunately, no civic spirit to end that.  I think the Minister appealed for a public spirit to put an end to that.  I firmly believe as a result of my observations and because of the opinions generally expressed that there is loose certification and the sooner we have a public spirit that will put an end to that the better it will be.  I recall the state of things here in 1932 or 1933 when unemployment assistance came in.  We had a queue outside the labour exchanges composed of people who were not entitled to these benefits and it took a couple of years to weed out the genuine claimants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wanted to ensure that for once I would use a rather valuable service which Deputies have available to them although they do not avail of it as often as they should.  In view of the contribution of the Parliamentary Secretary I do not think it matters very much whether or not he was concluding because he did not add anything whatever to the debate.  Obviously he knows even less about the matter than the Minister does.  Though one might be inclined to think that could not be possible, apparently it is.  For the few minutes he was on his feet he talked about a number of matters which had nothing whatever to do with the subject under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is now before the Dáil is a demand for nearly £1,500,000 in addition to the original demand, and that is put forward from the very seat from which we were told by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Finance that there would be no Supplementary <Col N="918" /> Estimates; that they would set their faces absolutely against them. We are told blandly from that seat that there is an increase of 50 per cent. in the number of people claiming sickness benefit, and that increase in sickness is alleged to have taken place during a period when we spent millions of pounds per year, infinitely greater sums than ever were spent since this State was established, for the prevention and cure of disease.  The only explanation, which I for one absolutely refuse to accept as the true one, we get from the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary, is that it is due to malingering and to a conspiracy between the workers and the medical certifiers which brought about an increase in a period of five years, particularly the five years we are dealing with, of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I said when speaking previously that I have never seen an Estimate like this presented in this House before and I sincerely hope that we will never see one again, although, frankly, I am very much afraid we will.  If we are to contemplate for a moment that the estimation, in so far as there is estimation in relation to the service which we passed into law last year, is going to work out the same as this, all I can say is, God help both the taxpayers and the ratepayers.  It might be, though one doubts it again, a lesson to the members of the Government and to some of those who sit behind them not to be so impatient when members of the Opposition insist on examining in greater detail measures brought before this House, not to be so prone to accuse people of obstructive methods when they are trying to analyse measures brought before this House and when they are trying, above all, to ascertain what the cost of them will be.</P>

I want to make it perfectly clear that I think the Committee should not have been satisfied with the explanations which they got from the Minister or from the Parliamentary Secretary, if I may call them that.  I think the most damning indictment of the whole Estimate was made by Deputy Cowan.  He is a very skilful <Col N="920" /> debater, and he can put a pretty good face on a bad case; there is no doubt about that.  He will not spare any effort or skill, certainly, when the Government are in the dock, but he failed completely.  The case was so bad that he could not adduce one single argument for it.  He was putting up skittles of his own to have the pleasure of knocking them down.  He was delighted because we were honouring our bond and meeting our financial commitments, as if we had any option in the matter. The Deputy was thankful to the Minister for bringing in the Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister had no option in the matter.  I am sure that if the Minister could have avoided bringing in this Estimate, particularly at the present moment, he would not have brought it in.  Of course, he had no more option in the matter than the Deputy had in supporting it to the best of his ability, and his ability in that matter is fairly considerable, but just not sufficient to make this particular case a convincing one.  However, we will have another day yet.</P>

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary does not consider it necessary for him to say anything&mdash;I realise that he covered it fairly fully in his speech on the Second Reading&mdash;I want to say a few words on this.  Frankly, when I saw it first I was half tempted <Col N="921" /> to oppose it or even to vote against it, concerned and all as I am to see the fullest possible provision made in respect of what I might call our inland fishing industry.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows quite well that the additional finance, apart from the question of how he is to obtain it, he is going to get from the implementation of this motion is not worth talking about in so far as it will help to improve the position of the various boards of conservators in the country.  In practice, it is not going to help in relation to either the protection or restocking of our rivers and lakes.  It is merely tinkering with a very important industry, an industry which, notwithstanding the way in which it has been grossly neglected over the years, apart altogether from the amount of money that is earned from it by tourists who come here as anglers, apart from the fact that they are the best type of tourists &mdash;because, generally, they spend more money than the average tourist and they certainly give more employment &mdash;contributes over £1,000,000 to the national income by way of exports of salmon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as criticising the Department of Fisheries in relation to what they are trying to do for our inland fisheries.  I should like again, in passing&mdash;because I can only say it in passing&mdash;to pay a tribute to the Department for what it is doing through the Fisheries Trust in relation to trout fishing in this country.  I think they are doing excellent work and I think they are tackling it in the right way.  I have not in my mind at the moment the exact figure, but I do not think I am far wrong when I say that the State made available to the various tourist bodies and boards that we have in this country something between £350,000 and £500,000&mdash;that is, to An Bord Fáilte and to An Fógra Fáilte, apart altogether from whatever money finds its way from the local authorities to the Tourist Association, the third body.  The principal aim and the main object of both An Bord Fáilte and An Fógra Fáilte is to build up the tourist industry in this country in the off-season. Generally speaking, at what we <Col N="922" /> call the peak, we get here nearly as many tourists as our existing accommodation will cater for and everybody is agreed that the most valuable addition to our income from tourists in this country would be that from tourists whom we can attract and entice to come here during the off-season.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest about it.  In the off-season, outside sporting facilities, we have very little attraction to offer to people from outside this country. The sporting facilities I have in mind are principally hunting, shooting and fishing.  I do not presume to know anything at all about hunting beyond what I occasionally see or read of.  I know very little or practically nothing about shooting, except what I am told by those who are deeply interested in it.  Unfortunately, game in this country has almost disappeared, due entirely to neglect or to the ravages of vermin which seem to be nobody's business.</P>
    <P>I know a little about fishing; I am not a good angler but I am a keen one. I have knocked around enough of the rivers and lakes in this country and I have talked sufficiently with old anglers, hotel keepers at angling resorts, boatmen, rivermen and others trying to get knowledge and experience from people who have a practical knowledge of it, to know that we have in our fresh water fisheries the greatest possible attraction and the greatest lure for the best type of tourist, the tourist whom we can induce to come here to spend money and give employment in the off-season.  We have here in Ireland probably some of the finest salmon fishing in the whole continent of Europe.  We have salmon fishing running here from as early as the 1st of January, on some of our rivers, up to the 12th October.  I have myself personal experience of some Americans coming over here to fish for the first time, very many of them in the West of Ireland, because some of their friends who had been here told them about the fishing possibilities.  I have actually fished on the same river with some who were staggered, completely staggered, at the idea that they could, with a little bit of luck and <Col N="923" /> a small bit of skill, take out of our rivers salmon from 15 lb. to 30 lb. in weight.  They did not think it was possible to get fish of that size fairly frequently in this country.</P>
    <P>I want to put this consideration to the Parliamentary Secretary.  It was certainly a matter I was keen on myself when this question of providing additional money for tourism was under consideration before I left the Department of Industry and Commerce. I am perfectly satisfied that the Government ought to insist on a fairly substantial amount of that £250,000 or £500,000 being utilised to build up and expand what in my opinion would be the greatest attraction we could have for the off-season. Remember it is the most valuable form of tourism because the angler who comes here, if he gets any sort of fair fishing at all&mdash;he will get no better fishing anywhere and he certainly will not get comparable fishing as cheaply elsewhere&mdash;unlike the ordinary tourist who comes here once in a lifetime, will come back the next year. The angler spends a good deal of money in the hotel, in the bar if you like.  He employs a gillie and a boatman, sometimes two boatmen, every day as well.  Certainly when he goes back, if he has caught a couple of fish, he is not going to underrate his achievement when he is talking about his experiences in the club, the &ldquo;pub,&rdquo; or wherever he talks about them.</P>
    <P>I get every week some of the principal papers that are published, particularly in Great Britain, for anglers and fishermen.  Fógra Fáilte has somewhere in the neighbourhood of £250,000 to spend on publicity.  In the principal angling newspaper published in Great Britain where there are no fewer than 3,000,000 anglers&mdash;that is 3,000,000 in anglers' clubs and associations apart altogether from those who are not members&mdash;some of them within an hour's journey from this country, I have not seen as much as half an inch of an advertisement. The Parliamentary Secretary knows, nobody knows better than he, and the Minister knows&mdash;in his own constituency there is one of the finest salmon <Col N="924" /> rivers probably in Europe&mdash;that you are only tinkering with the problem when you talk of putting 2d. per lb. extra on salmon exports and 10/- extra on the rod licence.  That is not going to get you anywhere.  We have got to be serious about this matter and we should not be pretending to be doing something about it if we do not attempt something worth while.</P>
    <P>To what extent is this going to enable a board of conservators either to maintain an employee or erect hatcheries throughout the country?  To what extent is it going to enable them to employ and pay additional river watchers?  To what extent will it enable them to pay additional money to the river watchers they have at the moment?  Does anybody think you are going to have protection against explosives, against poison and against the use of nets by men who are being paid anything from £25 to £40 or £50 a year as river watchers?  The thing is absurd.  Of course, some of those fellows&mdash;I am speaking entirely personally; I am not referring to the poor man who takes the salmon out of the river in the ordinary way as I do not think he does a lot of harm &mdash;but so far as the fellows with the explosives or the poison are concerned, if I had my way they would not have the option of a fine&mdash;they would go to prison.  Yet they are going into the District Court and most of them get away with a fine of 10/- and a bit of a lecture and that night or next day they will go out and snitch a salmon out of the river for which they will get £6 or £7.</P>
    <P>I appreciate fully that neither the Minister nor the Parliamentary Secretary has direct responsibility in this matter but I would like to know if there is not a more useful way of spending a substantial proportion of the money which we are providing for our various tourist organisations?  I know there is a valuable salmon and trout hatchery in this country that has for certain reasons been allowed to go into disuse and disrepair for a few years because the private owners just could not stand the expense of maintaining it.  They are now ready to maintain it and that hatchery for both <Col N="925" /> salmon and trout could be put working to-morrow for the expenditure of only a few hundred pounds.  It would pay for itself over and over again.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider that with an additional 2d. on export salmon, an additional 10/- on rod licences, he can improve the stocks of salmon while you have indiscriminate netting and almost indiscriminate trapping?  There are so-called salmon traps in operation on some of the best-known fisheries in this country and they are so calculated that a 1½ lb. sea-trout could not get through them. The Parliamentary Secretary knows that himself or ought to know and if he does not he should be so informed by his officials and they should know it.</P>
    <P>Do not forget this: that there is another reason to attract this type of tourist and it is because they do not come and stay in Dublin.  They go down to the most remote parts of the country and to the West of Ireland. We hope very soon as a result of what is being done by the Fisheries Department, we will be getting them in greater numbers into the midland lake areas, to County Monaghan and West-meath as well as to the West and down through Kerry and Cork and the other remote places where employment is so badly needed.</P>
    <P>We can give employment with the proper exploitation of our fisheries.  I do not want to bring in anything about coarse fishing but there are 2,000,000 coarse fishermen in Britain just across from us.  We would nearly pay them to come and take the coarse fish out of our lakes as we have so many game fish and we would not bother here about coarse fish.  These people could go into the most remote parts of the country and see some of what are certainly the most beautiful places in this country, the places you do not normally see, where very often in order to get to a particularly good river or lake you may have to plough down a mile of boreen or across a half-mile of bog but when you get there you find something by way of beauty to talk about.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prolong this debate <Col N="926" /> but I honestly feel like opposing this. I do not think that would do very much good but I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary on this question of rod licences, has he given any consideration to having a licence for which one would pay a certain fee and be free to fish wherever one liked throughout the country?  I know this is difficult because it is bound up with the local boards of conservators&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, and I know that if I take out a £2 licence to-morrow in Drogheda and then go down to fish the day after in Galway, I pay another 10/- and if I go to Connemara the day after I pay again. After that, if I go to Bangor Erris or down to Kerry I have to pay again, if I am lucky enough to be able to get around a bit.  Very often, too, a man's work takes him throughout the country or he is invited to some place and given a couple of days' free fishing but he has to take out a 10/- licence every time he moves.  I remember one year myself in the last few years, and in addition to my £2 licence I think I had in all no fewer than five 10/-licences on top of that&mdash;not that I was fishing additional days because if I were fishing where I took out the £2 licence that is all I would have to pay. That may appear to be a small point but it is one which I have been asked to raise over and over again by a number of anglers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say this before I sit down. I want the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to make an effort to get their hands legitimately on as much as possible of the money that we are providing for the tourist organisations for a legitimate and excellent purpose. I think it will be put to better use than it is at the moment.  I warn them&mdash;as my colleague Deputy Dillon would say &mdash;that whether they do it or whether they do not, I will be at their heels on every opportunity I can get because I believe we have something there that is worth developing, something that would bring a tremendous return to this country.  I believe that we have in <Col N="927" /> our salmon, brown trout and sea-trout fisheries something that is probably unequalled&mdash;certainly unequalled in Europe outside Norway&mdash;and something which could be developed and instead of earning whatever we are earning from it at home, instead of earning around £3,250,000 by way of exports we could be earning five to six times that amount.  But there is indiscriminate abuse, almost indiscriminate poisoning; netting, poisoning, trapping and explosives are being used on a widespread scale.  I know that under the existing type of organisation that the Parliamentary Secretary has to operate, and certainly under the system he has to operate in relation to the formation of the boards of conservators and the method of financing them, it is not easy for him to make progress, and it is because I fully realise that that I am urging him to attempt to make some sort of revolutionary changes.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating that there should be any additional impost on the taxpayers.  All I am saying is that the money which is being voted by the taxpayers and being handed over for the development of tourism should be channelled in such a way as to bring the maximum return and the greatest degree of profit to the community.  We can do that.  We can attract a very considerable number of people here for salmon fishing in February, March, April, May and June, which is not a peak month in this country, and if it were properly advertised and if there were proper protection, stocking, and so on, in the rivers and lakes, we could also attract them in the month of September and, indeed, in the first half of October.  Many hotels, boarding houses, guest houses and cottages in the remote parts of the country could earn good money from tourists, who would be getting good value for the money they would spend here and they would go back and speak well of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little that Deputy Morrissey has said with which I cannot agree wholeheartedly. The tone and tenor of his remarks were quite different from what I heard on the Second Stage.  I would point out to him, however, that he has <Col N="928" /> widened the scope of his remarks to extend far beyond what is contained in the Salmon Conservancy Fund Bill. It is specifically entitled a Salmon Bill.  While I agree with what he has said about developing coarse fishing and inducing coarse fishing organisations in England to come here, that is not provided for or dealt with in this Bill.  That matter is not being neglected.  Quite recently there was a conference between Tourist Board officials and Fisheries Branch officials on that very question.  I think Deputy Morrissey is also aware of the work which is being done by the Inland Fisheries Trust in relation to that, as well as the development of trout fishing.  I think he and I agree that the development work is going in the right direction.  I do not want to cavil at the Deputy's remark that it is not going on on a sufficiently large scale.</P>
      <P>This Bill is to provide more money for protection and there is nothing in it for the other very admirable development matters to which Deputy Morrissey has referred.  It is not to provide money for hatcheries or for the other matters which we all know are necessary for proper development, but I think he will agree with most people who take an interest in angling, particularly the experts in the Fisheries Branch, that if there is proper protection so as to allow for adequate natural spawning, that is a much better contribution to the stocking of rivers than artificial hatcheries. The fisheries experts would prefer that our rivers would be stocked in the natural way than by any method so far discovered by scientific investigation. That is particularly true in connection with trout in lakes.  A great many well-intentioned people, keenly interested in angling, have put an enormous amount of voluntary work into the reduction of the number of predatory fish in these lakes for the reason that, if they did not do that, the work of their hatcheries would be in vain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am following Deputy Morrissey's example.  I am not dealing with exactly what is in this Bill in my remarks about trout and lakes and coarse fishing.  It is <Col N="929" /> a salmon Bill specifically, designed to produce from the new levies on rods and exported salmon as much more as is being received at the present time from the licences payable by rodsmen and netsmen.  That sum, in round figures, at the present time is £15,000 annually, and it is anticipated that in a full normal year these two levies&mdash;the 10/- duty on rods and the 2d per lb. on exported salmon&mdash;will bring in as much more, that is, in round figures, £30,000 in all.  Twenty-six thousand pounds are being received from fishery rates.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Morrissey that it does not enshrine a very ambitious programme but it should help to increase the numbers where an increase is necessary.  More important still, it will enable the boards of conservators to give better remuneration and to make the job of protecting the rivers a worthwhile job for those who are employed on it.  That is more important than numbers.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything relevant to the Bill in Deputy Morrissey's speech that I have to refer to.  He has spoken along the lines on which my own mind is running.  If he had criticism to offer, it is that the Bill does not go far enough.  His speech is out of tune with the intentions of some of his colleagues in relation to specific provisions in the Bill, but they will be dealt with when we come to deal with the Bill section by section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the question of the levy and the Parliamentary Secretary in reply stated that the present price of salmon would bear it. Of course it would if the price of salmon remained what it is now but I do not foresee that the price of salmon will remain at the present figure.  I gave my reasons then and I mentioned that it costs about 1/- a lb. now to deliver salmon in London.  That is all to come off the fishermen, these poor men.  If the price of salmon falls to the prices that we knew, 2/6 and 3/6 a lb. and if you take the cost of the box and the freight, together with this levy, it will approximate to about 1/- a lb.  I think that making this permanent legislation, and ignoring the variations that will take place in price, will put an unbearable burden on poor men and drive <Col N="931" /> them out of fishing for salmon altogether.  I am convinced that, with the world situation as it is to-day, and looking at the prospects for the future, I am right in that.  Therefore, I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should not press this too far.  He has told us that this money is to aid the conservators, to give them money for protection purposes. I do not want to repeat what I said on that on the Second Reading of the Bill.  I wonder will this additional sum of money which the conservators are to get tend to increase the efficiency of the protection of salmon.  I do not think that any amount of additional money which is given over and above what is provided at present is going to do that.  So far as I know, the rivers are reasonably well protected.  I do not think that anything more in the line of additional water bailiffs is going to make the protection of them any more efficient than it is.</P>
      <P>I do not think this is the proper road to travel.  We know enough about our people to be able to say that while protection for the rivers is one thing repression is quite another thing. I am sure Deputies will agree with me that if there is one people on the face of the earth who will resist repression it is our people.  Therefore, I do not see the need for any additional sum of money to be given to the conservators. What we really want is respect and obedience for the fishery laws.  No amount of repression is going to solve that problem.  We should be prepared to provide reasonable facilities for the average man who wants to fish for salmon during his leisure hours.  Provided he pays a couple of pounds for a licence, he should be given that right. I am not concerned with the amount of salmon that he will take out of the river.  Probably he will catch none at all.  I suggest to the House that it would be a retrograde step to deny these reasonable facilities to our own people.  Surely, it is far better that a man should spend a few hours on the banks of a river fishing than amongst the ranks of the industrious unemployed at the street corners in our local towns or villages.</P>

I am not claiming any privileges for them, but that is a right which was denied for centuries to our people.  It is one which they should now be able to exercise.  This Bill should not aim at repression or at having an army of water bailiffs who would be a source of provocation to the sons of riparian owners and to people in our country villages and towns.  I cannot see the wisdom of this proposal.  In fact, I can see that it is capable of producing disastrous results.  In my opinion, our fisheries are being protected in so far as it is humanly possible to do it.  I think that our rivers, too, are being protected with reasonable efficiency. It is true, of course, that there are some people whom one cannot stop from doing damage.  They will do damage no matter how many water bailiffs we provide or how much money this House gives to conservators.  Our aim in this legislation should be to get the confidence of the public and not give the idea that we are passing legislation which is going to have the effect of repressing the average man in the country from exercising a simple sporting right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that Deputy McMenamin has not given me anything to reply to.  There is not any question of repression in this Bill.  As a matter of fact, the only person who has spoken, and who could be said to have alluded, even remotely, to repression was the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Morrissey, who told me that he would not give people who used the objectionable method of poaching the option of a fine but would send them to prison.  Our fisheries laws, as framed, do give the courts a choice in that matter.  They have the option of imposing a fine rather than of sending a person to prison.  Therefore, I think Deputy McMenamin has referred to something that is not contained either <Col N="933" /> in this Bill or in the Acts already in existence.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why Deputy McMenamin, having accepted Section 2 &mdash;and not having moved his amendment&mdash;which, in fact, imposes a levy, should now object in Section 3 to the Minister prescribing the rate of levy. That does not make sense.</P>

      <P>Well, the position having been explained to me, may I say that the sub-section which the Deputy is now opposing merely provides that the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, will prescribe the rate of levy?  If the Deputy has not been allowed to move his objection to Section 2, I do not think there is anything to argue between myself and the Deputy.  I am standing over the section that the levy rate be prescribed, and Deputy McMenamin opposes the prescribing of it.  I do not think that position as between the two of us requires any argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section I do appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to go easy with this.  The sum of money involved is not going to be big. I do feel that enacting this provision <Col N="934" /> will cause real revulsion among the young men of the country who do a bit of fishing.  As I said before, they do not go out to slaughter the rivers. That is not the way that rivers are hurt.  That would not do any river any harm.  There is no doubt about it.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is already aware that those young men who were in fishing clubs and angling associations are already perturbed by this line of country.  I would appeal to him to drop any increase in the licence duty.  There will be a substantial sum of money coming from the levy on salmon according to the kind of year it is for fishing.  If it is a good year the sum will be quite substantial, and I think that this addition to the rod licence is a trumpery thing.  As Deputy Morrissey said already, when you change from one conservators' district to another you have to pay an additional sum anyway.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I have no object at all in doing so except to help the object that he has in view&mdash; to help salmon and trout fishing on our rivers.  I fear that real damage will be done over a thing that is only trivial and worth nothing.  I think we will get ample money from the levy on the export of salmon to cover the Parliamentary Secretary's requirements, and I do really appeal to him not to irritate those young men, members of angling associations, who fish for amusement and for health purposes. They are entitled to their sport just as well as everybody else and visitors who come to this country, and we cannot preclude them.  We could try it but we would not succeed.  This is a petty thing and I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to drop it.  There is no substantial sum of money in it and I do not think any substantial sum is required to help the conservators with regard to giving protection. As I said already I think the protection is reasonably good, and I do not want protection to become repression, because if we do that there is an end to salmon fishing in the rivers of this country.</P>

One body that in my opinion is well qualified to give advice on the matter is the National Salmon Anglers' Federation.

      <P>I do not know how you would define a nabob, or whether you would call them Irish nabobs, but in any event they were all nationals, all Irishmen, all resident in this country, all following varying occupations, and while there may have been some among them who are by ordinary standards comfortable I think that in the main they were a body of ordinary citizens representing a much larger body of ordinary citizens and that their views were genuinely representative.  I think it was only fair, in any event, that their opinion on this matter might be asked, not that I bound myself to accept their advice&mdash;I could not do that&mdash;but I think they were entitled to be asked to offer advice and I took the opportunity of one of their annual gatherings to have the matter discussed. I think I can say that they were not opposed, and in fact I would say that their viewpoint was in favour of this small addition to the cost of a salmon-fishing licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to this matter I should say that a very large number of salmon anglers are professional anglers and make a pretty nice income out of it in the year.  It has been worked out from fishery statistics that the money value of the average catch by rod and line is something over £10, so that if we ask a man who is now paying £2 to pay an extra 10/- and he gets £10 worth of salmon in the year I think we <Col N="936" /> are not imposing a harsh fine or infliction upon him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the average.  In some districts the figure is very much higher than that.  The average number of fish per rod is something between four and six.  I would be inclined to put it at five salmon per rod.  You could average salmon between nine and ten lb. weight each.  So I think that the figure of £10 of money value per rod is not exaggerated.  It is conservative rather than the reverse.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that the anglers' association would not be able to give me accurate records in respect of its own membership, but, as the Deputy knows, everybody who catches a salmon legally has to furnish particulars of his catch and, therefore, we have accurate information of the legal catch both by rod and line and by net.  What the illegal catch is, Deputy McMenamin's guess is as good as mine. According to what Deputy Morrissey was saying, it is very considerable, indeed.  We know that it is greater since the price of salmon was decontrolled in England a few years ago.  We know that it is very much higher now than it was before that took place.  We know that what Deputy Morrissey has said is true, because there is such a high price for salmon there is a strong incentive to use any and every method to catch salmon and, in fact, to risk even a heavy fine in the process.  That is the position.  If Deputy McMenamin calls our attempts to reduce that illegal fishing to a minimum repression, then I make him a present of the expression. All genuine anglers and all genuine <Col N="937" /> fishermen who fish for salmon favour stricter and more efficient methods of protecting the stocks on which they both depend.  Deputy McMenamin will find that the number of people who look upon adequate fishery protection as repression are very few indeed.  I know that there are many fisheries in which the man who takes out an ordinary licence cannot cast a line because these fisheries are privately owned.  Deputies know that in respect of those in the estuaries the 1939 Act made provision for their compulsory acquisition.  The war prevented these fisheries coming into public ownership and the task of implementing that Act is now receiving active consideration in the Fisheries Branch, but it will have to be amended. That work is being attended to.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said there are people who would lead others to believe that it would be good for their health to cut their throats. The man of leisure can fish at any hour of the day.  He can pick the time when conditions are most favourable and when the weather is suitable and he can land in an hour five or six salmon.  The average citizen can only fish on his half-day and he must take his chance with both the weather and conditions.  He has as much chance of hooking a star as he has of hooking a salmon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not sneeze at this £2.  It is a pretty substantial sum of money to-day and it calls for a great sacrifice on the part of the ordinary individual who fishes as a hobby.  He may be a married man with a wife and family who likes to go out to cast a line on the local river.  I think this is an injustice to that man.  It is the last straw that breaks the camel's back and £2 represents a very substantial sum to the ordinary man whereas £20 would mean practically nothing to the man of leisure who can choose his time and pick his weather.  I have no sympathy with the latter.  He can pay any sum in reason because he makes money out of fishing.  The ordinary fisherman, the bank clerk and the fellow who is stuck in an office all day, must take <Col N="938" /> pot-luck.  I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary appreciates that that man makes a sacrifice in putting down £2.  He does not fish in order to make an income or for the sake of what he will get out of it.  He fishes for the sport of it, and I do not think we should be unduly severe on him.</P>

      <P>I believe that if the licensing fee were reduced a larger number of people would be induced to fish legally.  A licence fee of £2 provides a temptation to fish illegally. Deputy McMenamin is quite correct in saying that the leisured classes can select their days and no doubt receive sufficient compensation for both their efforts and their licences.  The ordinary citizen, with only a few days' holidays, who can only fish four or five times in the year, will not find it easy to pay £2.  The temptation then is to fish illegally.  Golf courses charge a day fee and something on the same system might be suitable in relation to fishing.  If one visits a particular locality on a particular day there should be provision for a reasonable fee to enable that person to fish, thereby obviating the temptation to fish illegally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of rod licences has been increasing in recent years and I think that is evidence that the £2 fee is not oppressive.  I believe that increase is due partly, if not entirely, to the fact that the majority of the anglers to whom Deputies have referred find it not only an agreeable pastime but a profitable sport.  I think that is the main reason for the increase in the number of licences.</P>
      <P>With regard to fees, there are, of course, fees which have to be paid for fishing where there is no public right. I do not know whether it is to that aspect of the matter Deputy MacEoin was referring.  There are some fisheries in the ownership of the Department of Agriculture and, where possible, these are let to local associations who do provide a day ticket for visitors who come along when these visitors have provided themselves with the right to fish.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The increase of 10/- has been made much of by Deputy McMenamin, but I should like to remind him that although he says £2 is a substantial sum, very often we are told that £2 is a very insubstantial sum nowadays.  However, I am prepared to accept Deputy McMenamin's estimation of the value of £2 and to agree with him that it is a substantial sum. I would, however, remind him that in the Fisheries Act of 1925 the licence of £1 was increased to £2.  Deputies will admit that there is some difference between the value of the £ in 1925 and the value in 1954.  The amount was actually doubled in 1925.</P>

      <P>We hope to get from the levy and the excise duty on the rods £15,000 in round figures.  There is about £15,000 in round figures at the present time from the licence duties. We could possibly get the £15,000 by doubling the licence duties, but we felt that it would be unfair to ask a netsman, who has a comparatively short season, to pay £8 before he catches a fish rather than the £4 which he has to pay now.  In any event, he will pay as he earns now, which I think is a considerable advantage.</P>

I should have pointed out that one advantage the rodsman has over the netsman is that he can catch fish during the weekly close time on Saturdays and Sundays.

      <P>In reply to Deputy McMenamin, I might say that this fund will be administered by the Minister for Agriculture.  Lest there be any misunderstanding about it, I should like to point out that it is not a fund which will be divided by the number of fishery districts and an equal part of it handed out to each of these boards each year.  The purpose of the fund is to supplement the work where it most needs to be supplemented. There are some districts which are in a satisfactory financial position.  There <Col N="941" /> are other districts where, possibly, the duties of protection are more onerous and in which they find that they have not got enough money.</P>
      <P>The experience of the Fisheries Branch in recent years has been that the demand for supplementary grants to aid their rates and licence revenue has been for greater amounts each year. We anticipate that this demand will continue to grow and, therefore, this Bill had to be introduced so that we would have money which the Minister would have under his control and which he could administer by taking into account the needs and necessities of the various districts.  There will be a fair apportionment of it on that basis.  While it may not be quite sufficient in the course of the next few years, in any event we do feel that for some years to come there will be need for this growing fund for grants.</P>

      <P>Having got this additional source of revenue, the conservators then will appoint henchmen simply to give them a week's wages irrespective of the necessity for them to protect rivers or things like that. You open the door for a flood of that sort of thing.  How will the Department keep a check on whether or not in any given case where there is an application to appoint additional bailiffs they are really necessary and will add to the efficiency of the protection of the rivers?  We have seen things like that being done.  I can see this money, taken from men who cannot well afford it, being abused in its administration.</P>

In any event, the inspectors of fisheries in the Department are in close touch with the organisation in each district and they attend meetings from time to time of the board and do go in detail into the requirements of the board in the matter of protection, the number of staff required and so on, and the amount of money necessary to finance it.  Deputy McMenamin can take it from me that the affairs of each board are fairly intimately known to the officials of the Fisheries Branch.</P>

      <P>I was replying to the debate on my amendment No. 60 and I had almost concluded when the debate was adjourned.  The Minister made the point in replying to my amendment, a point which he made on a number of sections, that the power contained in the sub-section which it is proposed to delete, would never be unreasonably exercised.  He said that so far as he himself is concerned, if he were operating that sub-section, he would not operate it harshly or in any other than a reasonable manner, that he was certain his predecessor would have done the same and similarly that any Minister who succeeded him would also do the same.

That gave me somewhat to think over the weekend and I did remember&mdash;and I should like to put it on record&mdash;one incident which I think might be relied upon in regard to this very point and in regard to the differences that exist between the Minister and myself on this fundamental point.  Under the Bill as it is at the moment, and as it will be when it becomes an Act, the Minister for Defence will have power to make dress regulations.  No one ever suggested in this Dáil or elsewhere that the Minister should not have that power.  It was never assumed that power such as that would be unreasonably exercised by the Minister in power for the time being.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to what I am sure he would agree with me was a complete and absolute misuse of the power governing dress regulations under the old Act.  For reasons that were never understood, a Minister for Defence issued an Order that every officer in the Army would wear uniform at all times, unless he was in possession of a pass or permission from a superior authority authorising him to wear mufti.</P>

      <P>I have never been able to ascertain why the power was exercised but it has been accepted as an unreasonable exercise of the power given to the Minister.  As I say, the Minister ordered that officers should wear uniform at all times and that they could not wear mufti unless in possession of a pass or permission from a superior authority.  I was instructed at the time personally to draft the regulation and I remember being rather upset at such an Order being issued but in the Army one cannot <Col N="945" /> reason why.  One must do what one is told.</P>
      <P>In drafting the regulation I took the Minister at his precise word that every officer would have to have the permission of his superior authority and the regulation&mdash;I do not know whether it was in 1929, 1930 or 1931&mdash;was made in that period, anyway.  I drafted the regulation in such a way that every battalion officer had to have permission from the battalion commander, and every battalion commander had to have permission from the brigade commander; every brigade commander from the O.C. and the O.C. from the Chief of Staff.  I put in a most amazing clause for the purpose of damning the whole thing&mdash;that the military members of the Council of Defence, the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General, the Quartermaster-General would all have to get permission from the Minister.  I thought that would make the regulation so ridiculous&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.  I thought the regulation would never be proceeded with but to my great surprise there was no objection from the military members of the Council of Defence, apparently, and the regulation was apparently accepted by the Minister and exercised for a considerable period.  Officers were subjected&mdash;there is no doubt whatsoever about it&mdash;to something bordering on torture for a long period through the exercise of that particular regulation.  I remember very well when we had a change of Government, the first thing we suggested to the new Minister who was then Mr. Aiken was to revoke or rescind that regulation and I am glad to say he did it immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that that was an exception and that the exception would not prove a general principle in regard to the regulations but I think it will be accepted that there was a misuse of power in the dress regulation and it was used to punish officers for some <Col N="946" /> reason or other of which I am not aware.</P>

      <P>My amendment is to delete entirely the phrase which gives the Minister power to make regulations, and I am making the case that if you give the Minister the wide power that is here it could possibly be misapplied and misused.  Because it can be misapplied and misused I object to it being put there.  The Minister on this particular section had said he could not visualise circumstances in which a Minister would misuse the powers granted to him.  The power is very wide.  It says &ldquo;specified political activities&rdquo;, and I argued&mdash;and I do not want to repeat the argument now &mdash;but I did argue that the word &ldquo;political&rdquo;, not being interpreted in the Act, can be used to cover a multitude of activities which, undoubtedly, are political but which, in the present Minister's conception, would not come within his power under these particular regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> I am arguing that this power to prohibit participation in specified political activities is too wide and too dangerous a power to give to any Minister because a Minister might misuse the powers, and a Minister following the present Minister at some future date would not be bound by what the Minister at the moment says is the intention in regard to that.  I gave the example in regard to the dress regulation, as bearing out that argument.  I am glad to say that there are not too many examples of conduct of the kind I have mentioned on the part of the Minister, but when one Minister in the matter of dress could abuse the power given to him to make dress regulations and when he could subject the whole Regular Army to a period of punishment, another Minister at some future date could, under this particular sub-section, submit the Reserve Defence Force to regulation and restriction and prohibition to which they would object and which would be bad for the force and for the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>I do not think that would be fair.  I would suggest to Deputy de Valera that after all at that time I was in reasonably close touch but I could not find a reason for it and if a reason did exist, it existed in the mind of one man only and no one attempted or endeavoured to explain it until years after when the thing was over and passed, and done with.  Then somebody felt that there was a necessity to try to explain away conduct of that kind.  Those are the observations I have to make in regard to this sub-section.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister, if he thought there should be some power there, did not avail of the opportunity to try to limit that power as much as possible.  In actual fact he proposes in amendment No. 61 to widen the force of the sub-section so as to include, not only officers of the Reserve Defence Force when they are on permanent service but officers of the Reserve Defence Force during a period when they are called out pursuant to the provisions of Section 88 of the Act.</P>
      <P>I cannot do any more in any of these amendments than to put forward the force of reason.  The force of reason is absolutely in favour of the line I have taken.  I regret very much that the Minister has not seen fit to meet the amendment or to meet the intention behind my amendment by restricting the powers and limiting them in such a way as to ensure that they cannot be misused on some future occasion by a Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 63:-</P>
      <P>In pages 53 and 54 to delete Section 104.</P>
      <P>This, like all the amendments I have moved, is an important amendment.  It is important because the section as it stands is a new section designed to disqualify members of the permanent force and the Reserve from being members of local authorities.  While a member of the permanent force could not possibly belong to a local authority because he cannot be nominated or elected to it, the section provides that an officer of the Reserve Defence Force shall not be permitted to belong to a local authority under certain circumstances which are outlined in the section and which I will mention.  It is necessary to understand the section. The section is divided into three subsections and the first sub-section is divided into three paragraphs.  The first paragraph defines a local authority as &ldquo;a local authority for the purposes of the Local Government Acts, 1925 to 1946, and includes a vocational education committee and a committee of agriculture.&rdquo;  In other words, a local authority as defined in the Local Government Acts of 1925 to 1946 has been extended to include a vocational education committee and a committee of agriculture.  The second paragraph of the sub-section says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;An officer of the Reserve Defence Force shall be deemed to be actively employed whenever, during a period during which a proclamation authorising the calling out of reservists on <Col N="950" /> permanent service is in force, or during a period during which reservists are called out on permanent service under Section 88, he is employed on military service or duty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The third paragraph says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A reservist shall be deemed to be actively employed whenever he is called out on permanent service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the interpretation part of the section.  Then sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  A member of the Permanent Defence Force shall be disqualified from being elected or co-opted or appointed or being a member of a local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of that sub-section says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If a person, who is for the time being a member of a local authority, becomes a member of the Permanent Defence Force, he shall thereupon cease to be a member of that local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In regard to that sub-section, there would be no difficulty about it.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3), paragraph (a) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  A member of the Reserve Defence Force shall, during any period during which he is actively employed, be disqualified from being elected or co-opted or appointed or being a member of a local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is intended by the Minister in a subsequent amendment to delete the two words &ldquo;or being,&rdquo; so that the first paragraph of sub-section (3) would read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A member of the Reserve Defence Force shall, during any period during which he is actively employed, be disqualified from being elected or co-opted or appointed a member of a local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b), which is the most objectionable one, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a member of the Reserve Defence Force, who is for the time being a member of a local authority, becomes actively employed he shall <Col N="951" /> thereupon cease to be a member of that local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes certain amendments to that.  He proposes to replace the last paragraph I have read by the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  The following provisions shall apply to a member of the Reserve Defence Force who is for the time being a member of a local authority&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  he shall not, during any period during which he is actively employed, act as a member of that local authority and if he does he shall thereupon cease to be a member of that local authority,</P>
    <P>(ii)  notwithstanding anything contained in any enactment relating to local authorities, he shall not by reason only of his absence from meetings of that local authority during such period be disqualified or vacate his office as a member of that local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is necessary to refer to the Minister's amendments so that the House will understand the section that we are dealing with.  I feel that there are parts of this section which are reasonable, such as that which relates to the Permanent Defence Force, about which no point could possibly arise. A point has not arisen for many years and it could not possibly arise now. The provision that if a person is unable, because of permanent service, to attend the meetings of the local authority, he will not be disqualified for that reason, is a concession that was made by the Minister as a result of the discussions that we had in committee in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>We are then left with two clauses. The first is that a member of the Reserve of the Defence Forces shall, during any period during which he is actively employed, be disqualified from being elected to or co-opted on or appointed a member of a local authority.  The next sub-section says that he shall not, during any period during which he is actively employed, act as a member of that local authority, and that if he does so act he shall cease to be a member of that local authority.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to reduce the <Col N="952" /> difficulties of the section, with its many amendments, to the smallest possible compass.  The grounds of objection, therefore, are limited to these.  I want to say, first of all, that I feel that any law dealing with election to a local authority should not be in the Defence Forces Act but should be in another Act.  That is the first submission I want to make, that anything dealing with elections to local authorities should be in the laws dealing with elections to local authorities and not in this Defence Forces Bill.</P>
    <P>We had a somewhat similar matter raised on a number of occasions in the House, where it was sought and, in fact, done, to include restrictions on standing for election to the Dáil or Seanad in different Acts of Parliament. The Tánaiste, on a recent occasion&mdash; I think while he was in opposition&mdash; said that he thought the time had come when the electoral laws and the laws dealing with nominations and the eligibility to stand for the Dáil and Seanad should be set out clearly in the Acts dealing with elections to those bodies.  It is on the same grounds that I would make my first submission, that these laws dealing with local authorities should not properly be in the Defence Forces Bill.  After all, we are going a very far distance, indeed, when we say in a Defence Forces Bill that a person will be disqualified from being elected to or co-opted on or appointed a member of a local authority, and we are certainly going a very far distance outside the scope of a Defence Forces Bill when we say that if a person who is a member of the Reserve of the Defence Forces attends a meeting of very non-political bodies such as a vocational education committee or a committee of agriculture he will cease to be a member of that local authority.</P>
    <P>These seem to me to be provisions which are entirely foreign to a Defence Forces Bill and should not be in it.  I say that I want to meet the Minister in reason with regard to the section. All that I want to eliminate from it are the unreasonable parts, what I consider to be the parts of it that trespass on the powers and responsibilities of another side of Government and another side of the Dáil.  When we discussed <Col N="953" /> the matter in committee, we were all agreed that the Minister should discuss the matter with the Department of Local Government and should endeavour to remove the difficulties that we saw there.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister has introduced amendments which are designed to meet views that were expressed in the committee.  I want to admit that he has gone a long way towards meeting the views of the members of the committee, but on these two points I think the Minister has not gone far enough, and that it would be unwise for us to allow that section, with these particular provisions in it and even with the proposed amendments, to be passed into law in the form in which it is here.  If the Minister were to indicate that he would reconsider the observations that are now being made in this House in regard to these particular things, and that, in the course of the Bill through the Seanad, he would be anxious to improve it further, then I think we would not have to delay very long on this section.  But the section itself follows the whole trend that is in the Bill, the trend that is in the section that we have already discussed, of taking power to deprive a person who is of sufficiently good citizenship to be a member of the Reserve of the Defence Forces, of the honour that he has achieved by virtue of his public services and of his services to the community.</P>
    <P>I think it goes without saying that any person who is elected a member of a local authority&mdash;extended as the interpretation of that local authority is by this section&mdash;any person who becomes a member of a local authority does so because of his value, of his worth and of his services to the community.  It is my experience that it is very difficult for a person to become a member of a local authority. It requires long service to the community to enable a person to become a member of a local authority.  This is the experience that I have had anyway, and whatever one may say about politics in the ordinary, narrow Party sense, it is very seldom politics of that kind intrudes itself into the work of a local authority.  The local authority is <Col N="954" /> a business concern, and it operates, generally speaking, through committees.</P>
    <P>I can talk about the Dublin Corporation with some knowledge and experience because I am a member of it myself and I am a member of all its vital committees and of a number of other committees attached to it which are not considered of such importance. In every one of those committees the work of the corporation is done in a businesslike way behind closed doors and there is no question of any publicity for the work of individuals.  There is given at the end by one of the officers of the corporation to the Press a synopsis or short statement of what has in fact occurred and what has been decided by the committee.  Therefore, I feel that in considering this matter in regard to local authorities and Reserve officers being members of local authorities perhaps the drafters of the section, being somewhat removed from the actualities of membership of a local authority, may have been inclined to get a completely wrong conception of what such membership means.  I must say that taking local authorities all over the country by and large very valuable public work is done by their members in a businesslike way and entirely apart from what might be considered to be Party politics in a very narrow sense.  One may have politics of a type such as, if one could call it politics, the views of a section that believes in giving increased wages, and you may have the views of a section of people who think that it is unwise to grant increased wages in certain circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that anything else arises on the amendment because the whole amendment is, that the section is designed to prohibit members of local authorities from participating in the work of local authorities in certain circumstances, and what I am trying to do is to ascertain in so far as I can what is, in fact, behind the prohibition of membership of a <Col N="955" /> local authority by members of the Reserve in certain circumstances, and I want to establish if I can to the Dáil that membership of a local authority could not possibly be interpreted as membership of an organisation that could be considered as detrimental to the best interests of the State.  I think that that is the approach that ought to be made in regard to the problems that are in this section and that are raised by the amendment I put down and the other amendments the Minister has put down to meet the wishes of the committee when they discussed this matter.</P>
      <P>If a vocational education committee is concerned with technical education and the provision of facilities for boys and girls and men and women to improve their education after they leave the primary schools, I want to ask the House how could membership of that possibly be prohibited to an officer of the Reserve while he is out on permanent service, which as we all know might only last a very short time.  If he attends a meeting, what proper grounds could be advanced for dismissing him from that vocational education committee during the time the Reserve is called on permanent service and while he might be on leave or absent from his unit with proper permission?</P>
      <P>I do not know very much about committees of agriculture or what exactly they do, but reading about them in the Press they seem to be concerned mainly with the development of matters relating to agriculture in their own areas, and if there is an officer of the Reserve a member of a committee of agriculture, perhaps one of the outstanding members of it, with extra knowledge in regard to the problems they discuss&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is not the obvious answer that he is a whole-time member of the Defence Forces?  He cannot be full-time on both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Why should he be dismissed if he attends it?  A member of the Reserve is, theoretically, on whole-time duty.  I want that to be understood.  But he is not on duty for 24 hours of every day.  He is entitled to his periods of off duty.  He is <Col N="956" /> entitled to go to the cinema, to go to a dance.  If he is a member of a football club he is entitled to attend a meeting of the club.  If he is a member of the governing body of one of our athletic associations he is entitled to attend a meeting of that.  If he happens to be a member of the governing body of the G.A.A. he is entitled to attend meetings of that body, and similarly if he is a member of the governing body of the soccer association or the boxing association.  Why can he be free to attend any of those activities, all of them of an educational nature, and at the same time be prohibited from attending a meeting of a vocational education committee in dealing with the higher education of adults?  That is the point that I want to make in regard to that, that the restriction imposed here does not appear to be reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have only taken two committees, the committee of agriculture and the vocational education committee, because they are particularly specified in the Act as being additional to local authorities as prescribed in the Local Government Acts of 1925 to 1946.  But there are other committees such as the committee of a mental hospital. Deputy Major Vivion de Valera put a point to me that he cannot be full time on both duties.  Obviously if an officer of the Reserve of Officers is on military duty and is not free to attend a meeting of a vocational education committee or a committee of agriculture he cannot attend their meetings; but if he is free for an afternoon or for an evening or for a day why should he be put out, because that is the word, of the local authority because he attends it?  If I could find a basis of reason behind this I might take a different view.  As I understand the basis of reasoning behind this, this is what we had in connection with the discussion on politics.  Politics has many meanings.  It is the Minister's idea to prohibit participation in politics of a particular type but not to prohibit participation in politics of another type.  The same thing arises here: once one begins to make a hole in the dyke that hole will continue to grow bigger.  That is our trouble here; once <Col N="957" /> we started to make the hole in the dyke of citizenship, we have continued to enlarge that until it tends to become a dangerous inroad on citizenship.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister, on examination of these two particular points of view, will agree that perhaps he can delete sub-section 3 (a) and (b) or, at least, amend sub-section (a) and delete sub-section 3 (b), making similar amendments in relation to his own proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>I can see no reason why an officer of the Reserve, or a man, cannot be a member of a local authority during the period when he is on permanent service. I can see no reason why, if he is free from his military duties, he cannot attend meetings of a local authority. I can see that such attendance provides no interference with his position as a citizen or an Army officer.  I think we are taking the wrong view in relation to the Reserve, in relation to membership of that body, its liabilities and responsibilities, when we get down to the limitations of the two sub-sections to which I refer.</P>
    <P>Those are the reasons why I object to these provisions.  I appeal to the Minister to say that he agrees with the views that have been expressed and that he will at the proper time introduce amendments which will have the effect of leaving the section in such a way that it cannot be subjected to the criticisms I have advanced against it. All the criticism I have made here is directed towards the interest of the Bill and towards the interests of the Defence Forces.  I do not want our Defence Forces to be a professional body entirely segregated from the rest of our people and completely separated from the ordinary functions of citizenship. In all the sections of this measure that we have discussed up to the present it seems to be the desire to establish a professional body of military personnel who, while wearing the uniform, will not be permitted to participate in any other activity. It is to that endeavour to make the Reserve similar to the Regular Army that I strongly object.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much to be said for the amendment of this <Col N="958" /> section in the way in which Deputy Cowan proposes it should be amended. I agree that we should not give ourselves power to decide in a Bill relating to the Defence Forces or the Army the question of membership of Parliament, local authorities or anything else.  That is a section for which I have no great affection.  It would be reasonable to provide that if the individual attended a meeting of the committee he would be dismissed out of the Army, but I do not think that we have power to dismiss a person out of a local authority because that would look as if the Army is seeking to exercise authority over a civil body which is not subject to military law except in the case where a Proclamation is issued and a state of emergency declared.  The suppression of even one person out of a local authority is equivalent to the suppression of the lot.  I think the Minister should delete that provision relating to the disqualification of a member of the Reserve who attends a meeting of a local authority of which he also happens to be a member.  I do not think the deletion of that provision would hurt the Bill.  As Deputy Cowan has pointed out, a member of the permanent forces cannot be a member of a local authority.  If he is a member prior to joining the Army the fact of his joining the Permanent Defence Forces is tantamount to his having surrendered his right or resigned from the other body.  It is reasonable that he should sever his connection with the local authority but, on the other hand, if he is a member of the Permanent Defence Forces, becomes a member of the Reserve and then a member of a local authority, I cannot see why, if he is called out on permanent service and attends a meeting of the local authority, the punishment should be that he is dismissed from the local authority.  I think we are going a bit too far in that.  I suggest the Minister should reconsider the matter.  To bring it further, if such an individual attends a meeting of a vocational committee or an old-age pensions committee&mdash;a very benevolent type of work&mdash;the penalty is dismissal from the committee.  I suggest the Minister should delete that sub-section altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Cowan and Deputy MacEoin.  I have had 30 years uninterrupted membership of, and association with, public bodies and I have been during all that period, except latterly, a member of various committees.  I think it would be very injudicious not to have this provision; if the other position obtained it might have a very deleterious effect upon the position of an officer.  It was different some years ago when members of public bodies belonged to no particular Party.  The standard of administration then was much more efficient than it is to-day.  Public bodies have now admitted into their various committees a definite and distinct dividing line as between Party and Party.  An atmosphere of politics has been introduced into administration.</P>
      <P>From time to time these various committees have at their disposal certain positions.  Prospective candidates may be related to members of the committee and, sometimes, while one may not have a precisely acrimonious debate one will have a very heated and animated discussion.  Consider the position of an officer in such circumstances.  Is that the kind of atmosphere in which one would like to see an officer on permanent service in the Army?  Remember, he will have to return to his ordinary duty as an officer with men under him; and the possibility is that these men may have friends or relations looking for the particular positions about which the committees have a divergence of opinion and around which bitter controversy may arise and very often encounters take place of which one could not approve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think myself that the decision to preclude officers from taking part in such committees and public bodies, in which I am sorry to say politics play a very significant part in the selection of individuals to fill various appointments, such as agricultural instructors, itinerant instructors, domestic economy teachers et cetera, is a proper one.  I feel that we should preserve that immunity, that dignity and that strange isolated philosophy which is characteristic of officers, and that if you throw them into the vortex of these local squabbles which occur from time <Col N="960" /> to time it will not exalt the position of the officers.  I would regret very much that the Minister should depart from the policy adopted, which I think is the right and proper one, rather than to throw officers into the squabbles, disputations, annoyances and often, as I said, acrimonious debates which are not always finished in the chamber where the appointments are made.  I think that the discipline which an officer is expected to maintain can be better maintained by immunity from all local squabbles.</P>

      <P>The substance of what Deputy Cowan has said with regard to this amendment has already been said on the amendment which just preceded it.  I think it is just a repetition of what has already been discussed on that other amendment.  I am sure that Deputy Cowan knows as well as I do that there is already a section in the 1923 Act which is very similar to this particular section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is Section 142.  All we are doing in this is to ensure that if a reservist is called up for permanent service he will not remain an active member of a local authority, but that he will retain his membership.  I think we are going a long way in ensuring that, so that in future a man who is a member of a local authority and who is a reservist and is called out on permanent service will not have to risk his position on that local authority.  He will retain it and can resume whenever his period of service is completed.  From that point of view, I think we are going a considerable way to ensure that such a man will not be victimised in any sense, that he can return to his county council or urban council or corporation activities when he is eventually released from service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the other aspect which I mentioned in the course of the discussion at the Special Committee and which would play a very large part in regard to this whole question.  When these men are called out on permanent service they are as much on permanent service as the men of the regular <Col N="961" /> forces.  What I want to point out is that when they are called up they may be sent to any part of the country far removed from the councils of which they happen to be members.  That is another aspect of the matter which I mention to show that we are discussing this largely on theoretical lines.</P>
    <P>I think the very best case that has been made for the retention of this was that made by Deputy Cowan himself when he admitted that I had gone a very long way to meet the views of himself and the other members of the Special Committee in regard to this matter.  If you examine my amendment No. 65 you will find that I have gone a very considerable way to meet the wishes expressed at that committee. I could not possibly accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did say and I do say that the Minister did go a long distance to meet the views of the Special Committee and, when that occurs, I am always anxious to acknowledge the fact.  I want to deal with a couple of other matters because it is important in a case like this that the records should be perfectly correct. I want to put Deputy Madden right as early as I can.  Deputy Madden has expressed points of view which undoubtedly are proper in regard to the Permanent Army, but I want Deputy Madden to realise that what we are discussing at the moment, and to which I am taking objection, is not the matter of the Permanent Army but the matter of the Reserve.  Deputy Madden has had a long period of service as a member of a local authority.  If 30 or 40 years ago when he was very young and active, we had self-government and our own defence forces I am perfectly certain that he would have been one of the local officers of the Reserve.  If, in addition to being a local officer of the Reserve, he was representing his area on the county council and if he was called away for a month, two months or three months on permanent service, I feel that he would consider he had a great grievance, and properly so, if because during that period, when he was free from duty, he attended a local authority meeting just to carry <Col N="962" /> out the ordinary business of the meeting he incurred disqualification.</P>
      <P>That is the objection there is to this section.  A person who is a member of a local authority and a member of the Reserve as an officer might be called up for training, which might be for permanent service, for a period which might be a day or which might be six years.  As the Minister says, he may be sent to any part of the country and it is very seldom he will have the opportunity of attending meetings of the local authority.  But if he did attend and engage in the ordinary activities of the council at the meeting, I think Deputy Madden would feel that it would be a very grievous thing to dismiss that man from the Reserve and from the local authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, and I think we are all agreed that a man who is in the Permanent Force has enough to do to look after his own business without engaging in local activities and should not be there.  I think Deputy Madden, therefore, is in agreement with the views I hold and with the views held by Deputy MacEoin in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin did raise a very important point in regard to this which I think is worthy of consideration by the Minister.  It means, as he says, that the Army is endeavouring to exercise authority over local authorities. A very interesting point arises there&mdash; in other words, that the Department of Defence or the Minister for Defence is to decide by Order who shall, or shall not, belong to a local authority.  I think that Deputy MacEoin raised a very important matter when he mentioned that.  Even if the Minister for Local Government attempted to interfere in an arbitrary way with a member of a local authority, there would very properly be an outcry.  Members of local authorities cannot be dismissed except for reasons that are specifically laid down by statute.  One reason I know is that on conviction of certain offences he can be dismissed and I think he ceases to belong to the local authority if he does not pay his rates. <Col N="963" /> There may be other reasons but, broadly speaking, these are the reasons.  Members of local authorities have a very wide protection just as members of the Dáil have a very wide protection.  Once you allow the Department of Defence to exercise any authority whatsoever over membership of the local authority, there is very grave danger and I think it is the duty of Parliament to provide against that danger whenever Parliament gets the opportunity.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy MacEoin said, that if the Army is to exercise disciplinary power it should be exercised against an officer, as an officer, by saying: &ldquo;Well, if you attend the local authority while on permanent service, you will be dismissed from the Reserve.&rdquo;  Then there would not be the serious constitutional objection that there is to this section, which says: &ldquo;If you attend a meeting of the local authority while you are on permanent service you will be dismissed from that local authority.&rdquo;  I doubt the constitutionality of that.  I think it is a power this House should never give to the Army, that is, power to exercise authority over the local authority.</P>
    <P>Strange to say, this matter has arisen on a number of occasions when it was a question of an officer becoming a member of the Dáil and the decision was, not to dismiss him from the Dáil because that would be absolutely unconstitutional, but power was taken to dismiss him from the Reserve. There is where the serious aspect of this section arises.  A local authority provides for representation in a democratic fashion after democratic election by the people and on general principles the Army should not be allowed to interfere in matters of that kind. That is why I am afraid that, in the wording of the section originally, a correct constitutional approach was not adopted.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that under Section 142 of the 1923 Act we had the same provision.  The heading of Section 142 of the 1923 Act was: &ldquo;Officers not to be sheriffs or mayors.&rdquo;  It says: &ldquo;An officer of the Forces on the active <Col N="964" /> list within the meaning of any order for regulating the pay and promotion of the Forces shall not be capable of being nominated or elected to be sheriff of any county, borough or other place, or to be a mayor or an alderman of, or to hold any office in any municipal corporation in any city, borough, or place in Saorstát Éireann, or of being nominated or elected as a member of a county council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that old Act of 1923 there were two kinds of Forces.  There was &ldquo;the Forces&rdquo; which means the Regular Army and there was the &ldquo;Defence Forces&rdquo; which means the Regular Army and the Reserve.  That is the interpretation under the Act.  It is very clear that you have two things&mdash; the &ldquo;Forces&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Defence Forces&rdquo; and the prohibition under Section 142 was a prohibition of an officer of the Regular Army being capable of being appointed a sheriff or being appointed a member of a county council, in the way I have read out. There was no limitation, good, bad or indifferent, in that in regard to the Reserve.  It is in regard to the Reserve that the whole discussion takes places. Now while Section 142 bears out what Deputy Madden has said as applying to the Regular Army it does not affect the Reserve officer or the reservist as this does.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is an interesting point.  An officer of the Reserve never becomes an officer of the Forces whether he is on permanent service or not.  If the Minister would look at the Act, he would see that you have an officer who is an officer of the Permanent Forces, that is, a regular officer, who always remains a regular officer, but if he is an officer of the Reserve, even though he is called out on permanent service, he is still an officer of the Reserve.  As the Minister <Col N="965" /> knows there are two separate and distinct commissions&mdash;one for the officer of the Regular Forces and one for the officer of the Reserve.  The Minister will remember a very interesting discussion we had in committee and which we shall probably have again on this Bill when we come to it.  That is on the section which provides that where an officer of the Reserve is appointed to the Regular Army, he must resign his Reserve commission and get a new commission in the Regular Army.  I admit it is a technical distinction but it is a very important distinction, and it is there all the time. While generally speaking, people will say that when he is called on permanent service, an officer of the Reserve is just the same as a regular officer, he is not.  If he were to be court-martialled he would be called &ldquo;Captain So-and-so, an officer of the Reserve on permanent service.&rdquo;  It is because he is an officer on Reserve on permanent service that he has liability to martial law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

      <P>You are not paid as much for being an officer on the Reserve on permanent service as if you were an officer all the time.  We come up against that all the time, in respect of marriage allowances and other allowances where an officer on permanent services was given the same allowances as an officer on the Regular Defence Forces.  I would like to say in regard to that that the Minister over the period of the Reserve did a considerable amount to improve the regulations relating to allowances and pay of officers of the Reserve on permanent service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very wide difference of view between the Minister and General <Col N="966" /> MacEoin and myself.  We have expressed ourselves in regard to that section, and what I have asked the Minister to do in the light of the discussion we have had here is to introduce, when the Bill comes before the Seanad, an amendment which would remove even the appearance of the Army exercising jurisdiction over local authorities.  My personal view is that if the Minister were advised by a constitutional lawyer in regard to this matter he would be advised that the part of the section objected to now would be undesirable and should be removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 65:-</P>
      <P>In page 54, to delete Section 104 (3) (b), lines 12 to 15, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  The following provisions shall apply to a member of the Reserve Defence Force who is for the time being a member of a local authority&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  he shall not, during any period during which he is actively employed, act as a member of that local authority and if he does he shall thereupon cease to be a member of that local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  notwithstanding anything contained in any enactment relating to local authorities, he shall not by reason only of his absence <Col N="968" /> from meetings of that local authority during such period be disqualified or vacate his office as a member of that local authority.</P>
    <P>In this case I had to secure the agreement of the Minister for Local Government. Deputies will remember in the course of the discussions in the Special Committee I mentioned that that course would be necessary and I am glad to be able to say that I have secured the agreement of the Minister for Local Government and the other Ministers concerned.  The effect of this is that a member of the Reserve who is also a member of a local authority and who is called out on permanent service will be able to retain his membership of the local authority for the current period of office without, however, being able to participate in its activities.  I think that meets the view expressed in the course of the discussions in the Special Committee and it is practically covered by the discussions which have just proceeded on the other amendment.</P>

This is to some extent repetition, but I think it is necessary to repeat it for the purposes of the record and for the purposes of consideration.

      <P>It does, but while the Ministers concerned have agreed to the section, I would like the Minister before the Bill goes to the Seanad to discuss with the Attorney-General the constitutional aspect of sub-paragraph (b) (1):-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;he shall not, during any period during which he is actively employed, act as a member of that local authority and if he does he shall thereupon cease to be a member of that local authority,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am raising that on the point General MacEoin made this evening about the danger of the Army controlling local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very serious doubts about its constitutionality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I would ask the Minister to consult with the Attorney-General as to the constitutionality of that particular provision. I said on the preceding section that a constitutional lawyer would take the view that the one thing that must be provided against is the Army exercising authority over the civilian population or exercising authority, as in this case, over a local elected body which is part of the machinery of government.  If the Minister consults the Attorney-General and if the Attorney-General advises him that it is perfectly constitutional, then it remains in that state until somebody questions its constitutionality. Where you have this provision to decide who will or who will not be a member of a local authority, I do not think that should be passed by the Dáil and Seanad without the specific point as to its constitutionality being raised with the law adviser to the Government.</P>
      <P>While I oppose this amendment, as I must, because it provides something to which I have taken objection in the discussion on the previous section, I know it will be passed but I am anxious to have that safeguard that it will be considered by the Attorney-General from the aspect of its constitutionality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite possibly Deputy Cowan has done a service in relation to this particular sub-section.  I do not <Col N="970" /> set myself up to contend with the opinion of the Attorney-General on the question of its constitutionality but, <i>prima facie</i>, it does not appear to me to be constitutional.  It seems to assume that a member of the Reserve of Officers, embarking on what is a perfectly lawful act, would by virtue of that suffer a penal consequence, namely, forfeiture of his right as a member of a local authority.  From a purely legal point of view I should imagine that the performance of his duties as a member of a local authority could not, by virtue of any statutory provision, disqualify him from being a member of that local body.</P>
      <P>Which Act&mdash;the Act under which the local authority becomes an effective machine of administration or the Defence Forces Act&mdash;will carry precedence in the interpretation of statutes as distinct from the constitutional issue?  Glib as the words of these few lines may be, they endeavour to circumvent what might be a very highly technical and dangerous constitutional situation.</P>
      <P>I did not intervene at an earlier stage because I am hoping that somewhere, in this steam-rolling of an Act through the Dáil, there will be recourse to reasonable common sense.  While a case can be made for certain exemptions in relation to politics, in this particular sub-section you are running into a conflict on basic ideology, apart altogether from the clash of defence force against local authority.</P>
      <P>The Defence Force regulations envisage attraction to the Defence Forces of young men of the highest possible standard and quality.  We accept that reservists will be men who have given a reasonable amount of service in the permanent Force, who, at a later age have gone into some other avocation.  In a niggardly and un-Irish way, we are trying to limit the contribution that such men can make to local administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find myself in a very serious difficulty in relation to this part of the Bill. I become rather impatient at the mentality that inserts unnecessary safeguards and unreasonable restrictions that would seem to imply some innate weakness in ourselves or some <Col N="971" /> inherent irresponsibility in our people generally.  It is that concept that becomes an <i>agitans irritans</i> where I am concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the progress of this measure but, candidly, I am becoming rather impatient of this warped mentality&mdash;I put it no further than that&mdash;that is behind some of these sections.  We have grown up as a nation.  We have discharged responsibilities as an army and safeguards such as this might best be described as puerile.</P>

This Bill in its Long Title is &ldquo;An Act to make further and better provision in relation to the defence of the State and the Defence Forces and to make provision for other matters connected with or incidental to the matters aforesaid.&rdquo; The amendment which the Minister has before the House is an amendment to deal with Local Government law.  I am asking the Chair to rule as to whether the amendment is in fact a proper amendment in relation to the title of the Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>On last Wednesday evening I had almost concluded when the debate was adjourned to this evening. The motion, as the House knows, is to set up a Select Committee to investigate the method by which the property at <Col N="974" /> Tramore held by the Tourist Board was sold.  I had taken the points in connection with that matter.  Since last Wednesday evening certain happenings have taken place in Tramore.  I am not certain whether the Minister has knowledge of them or not, but I believe he has.  Naturally I can only speak for myself.  I am very happy that these happenings are taking place because I think they will clarify the air and clear up the doubts and uncertainty that exist in a certain position there and may resolve all the difficulties. Because of those happenings and because of the fact that anything I might say here this evening might in any way impair the hope of a satisfactory conclusion, both from the point of view of the Minister and the Department and the owners of the property and the local authority in Tramore, I would wish, with the permission of this House, to ask that this debate be adjourned.  Should the Minister object to that I am prepared to take the alternative, and to continue my motion in such a way as to give as little cause for harm as it is possible for me to do.  I believe that the happenings that are taking place are such that if they come to a satisfactory conclusion they will both clarify the position from the point of view we have stated and make the interests of tourism in Tramore doubly assured as compared with the present position.</P>
      <P>An indication from the Minister as to whether he would accept on his side a suggestion of an adjournment would help me in this matter, if the Chair is prepared to accept a motion from me that we now adjourn the debate.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, when I opened my concluding statement there were three points and I was dealing with the three in rotation.  On point No. 3, which I was about to begin, I wanted to ask as to whether the best interests had been served in making the sale to the three individuals whose names were given by the Minister in reply to Dáil questions here.  The one thing that struck me as unusual and unsatisfactory in the main was that the Minister's sole point was that he acted on the recommendation of An Bord Fáilte.  I am aware that An Bord Fáilte gets its information and generally takes its direction with regard to the Tramore property from the three directors who reside and work on the property in Tramore.  It was but natural, then, that should An Bord Fáilte seek from those directors advice as to how the property was to be disposed of, they would naturally and very humanly feel that they, because of the unpaid services that they had given and the extensive knowledge that they had, would be the more responsible and better qualified people to be appointed as the people who should purchase, and that they should recommend to An Bord Fáilte, not only that it should be sold by private treaty, but that it should be sold at the price that they, in all honesty, believed was the proper price. Unfortunately, they being both sellers and buyers in these circumstances, it is but natural that a suspicion that should never arise with regard to public property would arise because An Bord Fáilte accepted their recommendation and passed it on to the Minister, who, in turn, agreed to that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say in fairness to the Minister that he did not agree wholeheartedly. In the first recommendation the price of approximately £20,000, I think, was recommended to him.  He <Col N="976" /> refused to accept it, and he sent it back with a request that a better offer should be made before he would agree. The wisdom of what he did was clearly seen when a further advance of £3,500, making a total of £23,500, was forthcoming within a short time.  I feel that in all those circumstances there was a case for a select inquiry&mdash;not, as I said at the start, to establish a wrong done by the Minister or by his Department, and certainly no suggestion of a wrong by the property buyers, but of a fact, that because of the fact of who bought it, the circumstances in which it was sold and the price paid for it, it caused an uneasiness and a suspicion that it was absolutely necessary to clear up.</P>
    <P>As I said when I was making the case for adjourning the debate, certain circumstances have since happened.  I understand&mdash;and I think that in all fairness to the present owners this should be made public&mdash;that they have now offered&mdash;my information comes from the Tramore Town Commissioners &mdash;to hand over that property provided they are recouped the money they spent on it and whatever expenses were incurred to the Tramore Town Commissioners as such if they have the authority to raise the money and to purchase the property and to use it in the interests of the ratepayers of Tramore.  Because of that offer, which appears to me to be a <i>bona fide</i> one, which appears to me to be an honest one, I feel that it is not necessary for me to press this motion to a division. I am content that I have carried out my duty as a representative of the constituency of Waterford acting on behalf of the local interests, interests elected by the free vote of the people in the town commissionership of Tramore.  I was not motivated either by political spite or by any Party advantage.  As the sole Opposition Deputy of the constituency of Waterford it behoved me to express the views of the local people when called upon to do so.  I can sympathise with my fellow Deputies who, because of Party connections, were not as free to express the feelings contrary to the sale that were circulating in Waterford. I respect the fact that had the position been altered I might have been forced <Col N="977" /> into the same position.  But I would say that the mere fact that such a motion as I have tabled and have spoken to has drawn a reply from the Minister and given an opportunity to Deputies of this House to indulge in a free and frank discussion of it is a manifestation of democracy that this House should be proud to have.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this motion has served in some small way the purpose for which I moved it and I will be very happy if that fact is finalised in a satisfactory settlement which will bring honour on all parties concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that proposals for legislation should be introduced to amend the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, so as to provide that the ordinary members of committees of agricultural wages areas and of the Agricultural Wages Board who are to be regarded as persons representative of agricultural employees shall be appointed by the Minister from a panel constituted of persons nominated thereto by trade unions representative of agricultural workers; that each county shall constitute a separate agricultural wages district; that a quorum for the Agricultural Wages Board shall consist of one-third of the members of the board and that the board may determine questions by a simple majority vote; and, finally, that every agricultural employee whose employment comes within the provisions of the Act, or any statutory Order made under the Act, shall be supplied by his employer with a printed statement of the rate of wages, and conditions of employment applicable to him, such statements to be on sale in appropriate form in all post offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In suggesting that proposals for legislation should be introduced to amend the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, we realise and appreciate the advantages which accrued from that Act in the past.  It was introduced at a time when it was vitally necessary to <Col N="978" /> provide legislation giving effect to certain improvements in the lot of the worker in rural Ireland.  Many years have passed and, no matter how well-intentioned a Minister or a Government may be, as time goes on there are bound to be certain flaws.  It is our duty when such flaws are discovered to suggest the manner in which these flaws should be remedied.</P>
    <P>Firstly, in relation to the appointment of representatives of the agricultural workers themselves, we suggest that the ordinary worker should have representation on the board.  In order to implement that, we suggest that the Minister appoint such representatives from a panel submitted by a trade union organisation responsible for looking after the interests of the workers in question.  The Minister may say that the trade union organisation as it exists is not at the moment representative of every county; the organisation may not be of such a high level that the Minister would be satisfied to accept such representation in relation to every county.  On that, we are quite prepared to agree that such appointments will not be made until the Minister is satisfied that such trade union representation is available.</P>
    <P>Looking back on the experiences of the past in relation to the selection of representatives on the main board and on the regional boards it is possible to find some criticism of the nominees placed on these boards for the purpose of representing the workers.  Our concern is to ensure that the workers will at all times be satisfied beyond all doubt that the men who purport to represent them are genuinely doing so and are not just individuals foisted on the workers.</P>
    <P>Instead of having regional boards, we are of the opinion that separate boards or units should be established in each county.  We all know that conditions vary from county to county.  It is for that reason that we think it would be more than desirable to have separate units in each county.  At the present moment a regional board meets in Limerick and that board embraces, as well as Limerick, Kerry, Cork and Clare.  I think it would imbraces <Col N="979" /> prove the Act considerably if it were amended in such a way as to provide separate units within the counties themselves.  It may be argued that that would make for more expensive administration but I hold that, in dealing with a measure which so vitally affects the welfare of the rural community, we ought not to consider the possible expense incurred but rather the ultimate benefits which will be conferred.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we hold that every employer should have available at the disposal of his employee the statutory Orders issued from time to time.  Cases arise in which employees are not familiar with the scales of wages in operation in particular areas.  They may not be familiar with the reductons that an employer is entitled to make in the case of a man living indoor or of the allowance in respect of gardens, etc. Very often disputes arise because of ignorance of the regulations.  If this information were readily available, both the employer and the employee would be aware of the regulations and conditions and there would be no ground for subsequent complaint.  Unfortunately, there are employers who will take advantage of the men working under them.  The result of that can been seen in the number of visits that the inspectors of the Agricultural Wages Board have to make.  I give credit to those inspectors for attending to their duties in a most satisfactory manner considering the large areas over which they have to operate. On the other hand, there are cases where the culprit may be the employee and not the employer.  I have known a specific instance where a certain man who was quite prepared to work for a particular farmer did not succeed in finding employment because another man&mdash;and sometimes the other man may be a neighbour&mdash;went to the farmer and suggested that he would work for less than the fixed rate. Human nature being what it is, I suppose if the employer thinks he can get away with it we cannot blame him for employing a man who is prepared to work at a lower rate.  But, of course, according to the law as it stands, the <Col N="980" /> farmer has no protection afterwards by saying that the employee was quite prepared to work at the lower rate.</P>
    <P>In this motion we are not approaching the matter in any critical manner in so far as the Act has been in operation as a whole.  But we do believe, as many people of rural Ireland believe, that there are certain flaws that could have been and should by now have been removed.  That is the main purpose of the motion.  We are putting these points before the Minister and I would be anxious for the Minister to say whether he is prepared to have this legislation passed in 1936 amended with a view to making the improvements which are necessary.  If that is done, it will be an advantage to these people in rural Ireland.  We all complain at times about the emigration from rural Ireland.  If we want to stem that emigration from those areas and make people satisfied to work on the land, we should give them proper conditions.  By doing that we will help to make these workers in rural Ireland prosperous and also bring prosperity to the farmer, which is so much needed at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must oppose this motion.  The Deputy has suggested that we should have wages boards representative of the counties.  That is impossible from every point of view.  You have counties, portions of which are in close proximity to large cities, where naturally the wages paid in the districts adjacent to the city must be and should be much higher than those in the remoter areas.  That has been happening in many counties. In portions of County Kilkenny, for instance, higher wages are paid in districts adjacent to the City of Waterford than in the remainder of the county.  Then you have other counties where the same position does not obtain.  As a matter of fact, you have four or five counties grouped in different sections where you have different wages being paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion is being made in this motion that representatives of the <Col N="981" /> workers and of the employers should be selected from organisations.  There are 27 farmers' organisations in this country.  To which of these is the Minister to go for a representative? Is he to select one particular organisation and ask them to give him nominees for the Agricultural Wages Board?  I think it would be impossible. If you had an organisation embracing the 27 which was responsible for the employers throughout the country, there might be no difficulty in doing that.  On the other hand, you have no organisation representing all the rural workers in this country.  You have the Federation of Rural Workers here in Dublin and portions of Wicklow, Meath and Kildare.  The total number in that organisation is 487 out of 100,000 rural workers.  Is it suggested that I must go to the Federation of Rural Workers to get nominees to represent the rural workers of this country?  That is what Deputy Desmond is asking for in this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  You should not make statements which are false.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from returns which have been given this year to the Department of Industry and Commerce and that is the number given.  I am taking these statistics. What other figures can I take?  In February, 1953, that is this time last year, that was the registered membership. I suppose the statistics for this year will show in or about the same number.  But the suggestion is that I should ask the Federation of Rural Workers to nominate people to go on the Agricultural Wages Board.  Even assuming that we did ask organisations responsible for the employers and for the employees, the Agricultural Wages Board does not fix a minimum wage for the country.  It fixes a wage which in many parts of the country is not recognised as the minimum wage.  In fact, farmers are paying far in excess of the wages fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has mentioned that there are a number of agricultural workers who are not getting the wages fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board.  I <Col N="982" /> doubt that.  I have no evidence of it and no knowledge of it.  If there are people who are getting a lesser wage than that fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board, they have the means at their disposal to report that.  There are inspectors appointed by the Agricultural Wages Board who pay visits periodically down the country and who are at the disposal of the workers at any time if they are written to and who will go and make inquiries. If a complaint is substantiated, the employer is taken to court, and he has to pay the arrears and is fined.</P>
    <P>Then again the Agricultural Wages Board have made provision for the man who, for some reason or another, is unable to command even the wages fixed by the board.  An exemption order is given in such a case whereby the man is permitted to work for less. We have many cases of that kind throughout the country.  There are many men who are not capable of earning the same wages as other men and provision is made for these cases under the Agricultural Wages Act of 1936.</P>
    <P>If, as I said, we had two organisations in the country, one representative of the workers and the other representative of employers, there would not be any difficulty.  I doubt if there would then be any reason whatever for the Agricultural Wages Board.  They could fix these matters between themselves as representatives of the workers and the employers.  But, as that is not the case, it is necessary to have the Agricultural Wages Board. As a matter of fact, representations were made to me during the year from agricultural organisations to have nominees recommended by them and also by the workers put on the board. These nominees were put on.  In fact, I think at the present time there are two representatives of the Federation of Rural Workers on it.  One, actually, is the secretary of the Federation of Rural Workers.  There is also a representative of the agricultural organisation in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There are at present five groups of wage districts and the groupings are:&mdash; (1) Counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan and Sligo; (2) Counties Galway, Longford, Mayo, Offaly, Roscommon <Col N="983" /> and Westmeath; (3) Dublin (including the County Borough of Dublin), Kildare, Laois, Louth, Meath and Wicklow; (4) Counties Clare, Cork (including the County Borough of Cork), Kerry, Limerick (including the County Borough of Limerick) and Tipperary (N.R.); (5) Counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary (S.R.), Waterford and Wexford.  The chairman of the wages board at present is also chairman of the area committees and the build-up of these committees is that you have from each wage district representatives coming there together, holding their meetings and making recommendations to the Wages Board. The Wages Board consists of representatives of workers and farmers, with independent, or what are known as neutral, members and they come to a decision by a majority vote.  As a matter of fact, I understand their last decision was by majority vote.  That is one of the things that Deputy Desmond has been asking for so that what he is looking for is in existence already.</P>
    <P>He mentioned, in the course of his speech, that copies of the Orders should be sent, I take it, to every farmer in the country and that he, in turn, must present it to the agricultural worker when he comes into his employment.  I cannot see any necessity for that. Every agricultural worker is capable of reading a paper and of reading the announcements made with regard to wages for particular districts at specified periods of the year.  There is no difficulty in knowing what the wages are and I never heard any criticism of that method until this motion was put down.  From that point of view I do not think that Statutory Orders obliging farmers to present these Orders to their workers is going to help in any way.  Anybody who has any connection with agriculture knows what the agricultural wages are to-day. I am opposing this motion on the ground that there is no necessity for it at the present time.  There is no justification for the argument put forward that we should have either farmers' organisations or workers' organisations representatives and I certainly am not going to be recruiting sergeants for either one or the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion deals with a very important and vital portion of our national life.  It aims at making more secure the position of the agricultural worker, at making agricultural workers more happy and contented and so preventing their eyes turning to the cities to which, we regret, they have drifted in such large numbers in recent years.  Anything that will tend to arrest the movement in that direction is in the national interest.  We have had already too great an exodus from rural districts to the cities and towns.  The establishment of the Wages Board was a step in the right direction but the operation of the system, I believe, requires some tightening up. We do know that there is a reluctance by a majority of the farmers throughout the country to co-operate in the working of any such body as the Wages Board.  They strongly resent any interference by the State to regulate the relations obtaining between the employer and the employee.  They hold that the conditions of agricultural workers are completely different from those of industrial workers and city workers and that it is entirely wrong on the part of the State to come between them to adjust questions such as holidays and conditions of employment generally.  Recent legislation in that respect has been strongly resented by the farmers.  These farmers say: &ldquo;We always dealt decently with our workers; we gave them a fair crack of the whip.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that in any industry the standard of wages and the conditions of employment generally obtaining should be made known to the workers.  In the cities, in engineering or building, contractors must know the rates of wages paid by rival contractors.  I think it is equally necessary that in country districts a wages standard should be established and be generally recognised. It is suggested that that could be done in a simplified way by having a leaflet available which would inform workers and the public generally the rates which a farmer is obliged to pay in accordance with the decisions arrived at by the Wages Board.  There is at the moment a wide diversity of opinion in regard to this matter and many people are in a fog about it.  I am sure <Col N="985" /> the Minister himself has got representations from time to time from his own area and inquiries to know what the rates applicable to that area were.  In certain areas, inspectors were appointed and their services were availed of very widely, but they were removed before they could be of very much assistance.  That has happened in my own district.  Now workers are obliged to have recourse to their Deputies to get in touch with the Agricultural Wages Board in Dublin, hoping to get some information on the point.</P>
    <P>I think that leaflets could be made available in which the conditions which should obtain in each district would be clearly set down so as to ensure that one farmer would not be getting away with a different rate of wages as against his neighbour who is also employing men.  That has been going on in some areas.  I do not mind if one farmer outbids his neighbour and pays more than the standard rate.  We cannot stop his doing that but I must say that is the exception rather than the rule.</P>
    <P>I think that workers also should have some say in regard to the appointment of the representatives on the board.  It may be said that they have to a certain extent at the moment but I think that they should have the right extended to them to select their own representatives because it could be held that they lack confidence in the men appointed by the Minister.  If the machinery is to operate to the best advantage, it should have the confidence of the people concerned.  So far as I am concerned the only interest I have in the motion is to try to establish conditions which will make our agricultural workers a more happy and contented community and that can only be brought about when they know what their rights and conditions are.  The same idea was behind the movement to give them half-holidays and a weekly holiday, seeing that they are an important, if not the most important, section of workers in the community Hitherto their rights have been recognised only in wartime but when war conditions passed the rights of the agricultural worker were allowed to go by default.  One unfortunate result of <Col N="986" /> that has been that 22,000 workers left the land in one 12 months up to June last.  That does not speak well for existing conditions and anything that can be done to tighten up the regulations and to stop that leakage from the land would be all to the good.  I believe that this motion is a move in that direction and that it would not be difficult for the Minister to have it implemented and to give a greater feeling of confidence amongst workers in the rural areas that the machinery of the Agricultural Wages Board would be operated in their interests.  I believe that it would be in the best interest of the country if the Minister were to accept the motion.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to say that this is not the first time in discussions here that the Minister for Agriculture has found it convenient for his own ends to twist a motion completely out of its context to suit the occasion.  The Minister came in here this evening&mdash; unfortunately he was late in coming in &mdash;and had the blatant audacity to try to read something into the motion that is not there at all.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in it and the Minister dare not try to suggest that it is.  I fully appreciate the fact that there are many organisations representing the farming community.  I fully appreciate also that it would not be easy or perhaps possible to arrange through the various organisations who would represent them.  It is because we know these facts that we had not any such suggestion in this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is it that the Minister comes in here, and to help himself in his arguments against this motion, tries to damn it from the outset without even considering it by trying to suggest that there is something in it which is not.  He said, and, of course, took pride in saying, that quite recently majority rule prevailed.  The Minister was cute enough to put such emphasis on the fact that majority rule prevailed, but he knows&mdash;I will give him credit for that&mdash;that in the Act of 1936, there is <Col N="987" /> a provision where majority rule may not prevail through the chairmanship. There is provision whereby the chairman appointed by the Minister can be just a mouthpiece of the Minister and that is one of the reasons we are suggesting that it should be amended if possible.</P>
    <P>We may put up suggestions here in an orderly fashion but the Minister, as he did in connection with some other proposals including the question of the half-holiday, wants to adopt an attitude of dividing the House in bitterness and rancour.  He mentioned the question of Statutory Orders.  We did not ask in this motion&mdash;I am sorry to say that I have had to conclude that the Minister did not read the motion&mdash;for such Statutory Orders to be sent to every farmer.  If the Minister had gone to the trouble of reading the motion he would see that we asked that such information be made available by putting it in every local post office.  What is wrong with that?  Who is going to suggest that we are asking to have it sent to every man or to use the Minister's words &ldquo;to every farmer and farm-worker&rdquo;?  We are asking that that information be made available, because we know that it is not available in post offices in rural Ireland.  The Minister himself states that every farm worker is conversant with these wages, but I could ask a farmer in Cork what they are and he could not answer me&mdash;much less the farm worker.  The Minister will say they are published in the papers.  They are: once or possibly twice in two years when an increase is given and that is the only time such information is published in the national Press.  It means apparently that every farm worker and employer is expected to cut out from the local newspaper this advertisement, find a piece of cardboard and paste it on, and hold it until the next wage increase comes around.  I am amazed at the Minister, coming from a rural area trying to put over something like that which he knows is completely untrue.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the question of trade unionism.  Perhaps it may be best for me to forgive him for his statement in that respect.  He was not here when <Col N="988" /> I mentioned it.  I am not saying he should have been here.  We all have our own difficulties in getting here at times, but I made my statement here when the Tánaiste of the present Government was sitting in the benches opposite.  I asked that the procedure be such that the men be represented by the representatives of the trade union when the Minister was satisfied that a trade union existed in the particular county.  What is wrong with that?  Is the Minister afraid of trade unionism for the farm workers? Is it as he stated in the course of the debate that he does not think either the farmers or the workers should have unions?</P>

      <P>The record will show clearly what was said by the Minister. In his innocence he comes and tells us that he is amazed at the suggestion that workers are underpaid in rural Ireland.  If the Minister went to the trouble&mdash;and mark you this motion is on the list for two or two and a half years&mdash;of making contact with the Agricultural Wages Board he would very easily find out the number of visits paid by the inspectors of that board to every county in this country including County Kilkenny.  If the wage rates had been paid why was it necessary to have these visits of inspection?  I made it clear here that I gave credit to these inspectors for the amount of work they have done and the amount of time they have been able to give to it, but the first fact that could be seen by the Minister in the records of the Agricultural Wages Board is that these inspectors are fully occupied in going around the various areas under their control and seeing that the appropriate rate is being paid there, and in some cases threatening prosecution.</P>

      <P>May I say there is no need to waste time on this?  It is quite obvious from the sinister fashion in which the Minister treated this motion that he is not interested in trying to <Col N="990" /> improve the lot of the agricultural workers and the farmers, because I believe that prosperity for both is interrelated.  I was quite prepared to see any legislation introduced here which would safeguard both the employer and the employee.  We moved this motion because of the Minister's attitude, which is reminiscent of a recruiting sergeant&mdash;thank God the time of recruiting sergeants is gone and we want to hear no more about it.  If the Minister wants to adopt the attitude not of a recruiting sergeant but of a destruction sergeant in keeping the employers and employees divided in rural Ireland, let him and not us take responsibility for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The first reply which the Minister gave to my question to-day and his further replies to supplementaries make me wonder as to the attitude of the Minister in this particular instance.  In reply to one supplementary by me, the supplementary being: &ldquo;If the officials of the Cork County Council have been asked to show cause by the Minister&rdquo; the Minister stated: &ldquo;The officials of the Cork County Council know the requirements in this matter, and, therefore, if they go outside the village to a considerable distance they know that they must show cause for that decision.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, I cannot understand why the Minister should give such a reply to this question.  Apparently, the Minister admitted, or wanted to admit or claim, that the officials of the Cork County Council had neglected their duty by not giving the necessary information when, in reply to another supplementary he said: &ldquo;If the Minister was so aware he might consider the present site, but apparently those whose responsibility it is to make the Minister aware of that fact have not done so.&rdquo;  Did the Minister wish to state or to insinuate that it was the officials of the Cork County Council <Col N="992" /> who had failed in their duty?  If he wanted to put that across here, then I say that he is is utterly wrong in making such suggestions.</P>
    <P>Is it correct to state that, first of all, the compulsory purchase Order was sent up from the Cork County Council about the 27th or 28th February, 1952, and that included in it was a request for sanction for this particular site? Furthermore, is it correct for me to say that, roughly about 12 months ago, the Minister had a letter sent by the Department to the Cork County Council inquiring as to why this site had been selected owing to the fact that it was considered to be a certain distance from the village?  Will the Minister deny that the inquiry was answered by the Cork County Council officials?  Will he also deny when I state here clearly that the information transferred to the Department from the Cork County Council indicated that approximately five, six or maybe seven sites were inspected by the officials and by the members of the sites' committee, including myself, and including members of the Minister's Party?</P>
    <P>When one takes into consideration the advice that was given by the architect employed by the Cork County Council, as well as the suitability and accessibility of all sites, one can say that the reply from the county council fairly indicated to the Minister that this site was considered suitable and preferable even to any other site.  Will the Minister deny that from the time the Cork County Council sent their letter, in reply to the inquiry that was made by the Department that they have never since received even an acknowledgment of it?  I want the House to realise the extraordinary situation in which even the officials of a local authority can be placed.  Sanction was sent down a few weeks ago. It simply stated that this site was deleted, and that sanction for it was not given.  No word of explanation was offered, good, bad or indifferent to the officials or members of the Cork County Council as to why sanction was not given for this site.  Apparently, the Minister wishes to take it upon himself to decide whether or not a site <Col N="993" /> is to be made available.  If he decides that it is not going to be acquired, then we are to get no information: we are to be told nothing by the hierarchy in the Custom House under the present Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>In view of the answers which were given to-day by the Minister to my supplementary questions, I am rather in a quandary as to whether all this was due to lack of understanding or to political ignorance or whether it was just the Minister's wishing to trample on the opinions of everyone who might oppose his voice here on a subject like this.  Will the Minister now state whether it is the custom and the procedure in all cases where a local authority asks for sanction for the acquisition of a site for building, that an inspector from the Department of Local Government is sent to inspect the sites?  Further, is it the procedure for the inspector, in all cases, to report back to his Minister?</P>
    <P>I presume and I believe that the inspector did his work on this occasion but the difficulty, of course, is that as far as I am aware such reports are considered as confidential from an inspector to his Minister.  We do not know when we are trying to get to the root of these problems whether a report from an inspector merely sets out that a site is not suitable or otherwise. Why is it, then, that the Minister failed to inform the Cork County Council why this site was not included? He cannot state at this stage that it is further from the church; it is nearer to the church.  He cannot state that it is much further from the local schools; as a matter of fact it happens to be much nearer to one national school, and from the other school it is nothing more than 82 yards further on than the lowest point in the village of Ringaskiddy. Does the Minister realise as his inspector does, I believe, that the village of Ringaskiddy is situated in such a way that we have no hope of getting a site adjacent to it?  Is he also aware that in this particular instance we marked this site on the advice of the local architect, and that it is situated close to the public road, with such conveniences as a public bus service to and from the village?  Is <Col N="994" /> the Minister trying to insinuate in his reply that we were not prepared as local representatives to take into consideration the importance of trying to keep the people as near as possible to the local village?  What use is it for local representatives at all, at our own loss of time, to go searching as we did in this instance and seeing five or six or seven different sites trying to get the most suitable one for housing? Then when we got it, or believed we had got it, we are simply told by a Minister of State that we are not going to get sanction for it.  May I ask the Minister this&mdash;if two years have elapsed before we got this unfortunate information why is it that it took so long to do it?</P>
    <P>I have my doubts.  I am not going to bring in any other matter into the discussion of this particular point except to say that there is a touch of irony about it when we realise that this site is nothing more than, roughly, three and a half miles away from a site which the Minister a couple of years ago also rejected and for which we had to fight here.  Eventually, I am glad to say, the officials of his Department, in their wisdom and in their proper reports, made it clear that it was a perfect site.  Must we now go through the same procedure again?  Must the people in this village be held to ransom, as it were, for another couple of years until we get the Minister to agree to giving sanction for this site? Why should it be that he refused, or even had not the courtesy, as Minister for Local Government, to inform the officials and the local authority why the site was not suitable?  He may state more indirectly than directly in his reply in connection with these supplementaries that it was far away from the village, but I want to pin him down to the main point, the point of admission by him of either ignoring the whole inquiry and asking for sanction of the site, or else of wishing not to give sanction in this particular area, for political purposes or otherwise.</P>
    <P>When he states that officials of Cork County Council did not take into consideration and did not state why this site outside the village was selected, I want to make it perfectly clear that he is totally unjust and unfair to <Col N="995" /> officials of a local authority who cannot defend themselves.  If officials in Dublin cannot be attacked, I maintain that a Minister of State has no right or privilege to attack the officials in County Cork.  A site in Ringaskiddy is going to be sanctioned, whether it is by Deputy Smith, the Minister, or somebody else, as was done in the last site a couple of years ago, when an inspector doing his duty in a honest and honourable fashion decided that it was a perfect site.  I believe that site was no better than the present one.</P>
    <P>We want to see the people in Ringaskiddy area going into those homes. The Minister by refusing sanction has decided that the building of these ten houses is going to be held up.  He must take the responsibility for it, but it is cold comfort that we are going to be held up for probably another two years.  I will conclude with one point, and all I can say is that I do not care what way the Minister takes it&mdash;I believe, myself, that the same influence is brought to bear in rejecting this site as in rejecting the other, and that influence was the square and compass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to see Deputy Desmond getting hot and bothered about this matter, if I might use the term.  I think he is the only Deputy from any side of this House who has had reason to raise a matter of this nature since I came into this office.  I think that he would be foolish to regard himself, or indeed myself, in the light that I would be in any way anxious to single him out, or the area for which he speaks here or in the local body, for any kind of exceptional treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice in Cork, as I understand it, is a practice which does not prevail in most other counties.  The local bodies there endeavour to select sites by agreement even though the selection of those sites has to be followed by the making of a compulsory purchase order.  They adopt that procedure, which often results in their being unable to get what we think, anyhow, would be a better site if they proceeded in a different way.  If the Cork local bodies, as they must, have <Col N="996" /> reason for that sort of procedure it is the responsibility of my Department to ask them to justify the selection of a particular site in a case about which we are in doubt.  My contention here is that in this case it appeared to us that a better and more convenient site was available.  If we were wrong in that belief we gave an opportunity to the officials of Cork County Council to show that no better site would, in fact, be available.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to attack anybody. I have no desire to defend my own officials if it can be shown at any time that they were blameworthy, nor have I any desire to attack local officials, because though I could do so freely, they have no means of defending themselves. The fact that that is the case means that I would be very, very reluctant to make any such attack on them.  As I say, a compulsory purchase order was made in respect of a number of sites in the area of South Cork. This particular site for the erection of ten cottages was excluded for the simple reason that in our view the officials there did not show cause, did not show reason and did not produce evidence that it was, in fact, the best site available.  After all, if we have any function in this matter of inspection of sites we have the right to say to a local body that they should try to procure the best site available.</P>
    <P>I remember in the old days away back in the time when district councils functioned it was the practice to shove labourers' cottages on any and every piece of waste land in the country. There is a new approach now.  I am sorry if that has resulted in this case in the exclusion of a site in relation to which, if a strenuous case had been made along the lines I have suggested, approval might have been given.  But without attempting, as I have assured the Deputy I will not do, to pour blame on officials of any kind, I still say that we regarded the site in question as not the most suitable and, as far as I can see, no proper effort was made to show that, even if it was not the most suitable site, it was nevertheless the most suitable site procurable.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is unfortunate in so far as he is the only Deputy who has had <Col N="997" /> to raise a question of this kind with me.  I am not in any way courting his friendship but I would like him to know that I am not just so smug, mentally or otherwise, as to behave in the fashion in regard to a matter of this kind, or indeed in any matter, that he has described.  There is no desire on my part if a local body approaches me in a reasonable way with evidence that is not perhaps available to me in the ordinary way, to refuse to listen to that evidence or the particular reasons in support of a particular matter.  My mind is not fixed or rigid.  I am advised by my officials.  I cannot see these sites.  I have naturally to listen to the advice tendered and I am influenced by what I am told.  If any Deputy can at any time&mdash;not by parliamentary question, because that is not always the most desirable way, unless for the purpose of exposing failure to make a proper approach&mdash;bring to the Minister's attention the fact that there is another side to a question, a side, perhaps, that the official is unable to see who approaches the matter in a somewhat narrower fashion, then the <Col N="998" /> Deputy can always exercise his powers of persuasion.  Without pretending to be over-saintly, I am as amenable to reason as anybody else.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that a question of this kind should have arisen in connection with Deputy Desmond.  We have at all times, as I say, the right to inspect, to see and be satisfied that the sites are reasonably good and reasonably convenient and to ensure that public money is spent on the provision of houses on proper sites and the best sites available.  Houses are costing a good deal of money, and that should be our approach.  But, at the same time, if it had been shown that this was in fact the only site, even though not entirely satisfactory, we would have been open to reason.  In my submission that case was not made; had it been made, I would have listened to reason.</P>
