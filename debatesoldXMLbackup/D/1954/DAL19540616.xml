      <P>Nuair a scaramar aréir bhíos ag cainnt ar an meastachán ar an Vóta Oideachais.  Bhíos ag leanúint de bheith ag trácht ar an meanoideachaís agus dúras go bhfuil leanúnt ar mhéadú do dhul ar líon na ndaltaí atá ag freastal ar na Meán-Scoileanna. Tá méadaíthe ar an líon sin ón 30,966 a bhí iontu sa bhlíain 1932-33 go dtí 54,040 sa bhliain 1953-54.  Tá an líon deireannach féin sin 1,951 níos airde ná líon na bliana 1952-53.</P>
      <P>As an 447 de scoileanna atá ann is trí Ghaeilge a déantar iomlán an teagaísc nó cuid de i 220 ceann díobh agus, as an líon san féin, tá 91 de scoileanna ina ndéantar an teagasc go hiomlán trí Ghaeilge.</P>
      <P>I gcomparáid le 1952-53 tá 37 de bhreis tagtha ar líon na n-oidí go bhfuil breisthuarastal á fháil acu, is é sin, 2,396 in áit 2,359.  As an iomlán san tá incrimint speisialta á fáil ag 1,333 díobh de bharr céimeanna onóracha a bheith acu agus incrimintí speisíalta á bhfáil ag 802 díobh de bharr teagasc a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.</P>
      <P>I gcás na range go n-íoctar deontaisí speisialta Eolaíochta dá mbarr, tá méadaithe ar a n-iomlán sin ón 2,093 díobh a bhí ann sa bhliain 1952-53 go dtí 2,111 sa bhlíain 1953-54.</P>

      <Col N="234" /> Aon mhilliún, sé mhíle déag, dhá chéad agus triocha punt glan is suim don bhóta chun Gairm-Oideachais agus is ardú £49,040 glan é sin.  Is é is mó a chuaigh chun an arduiteh ná an méadú ar ar íocadh de dheontaisí leis na Coístí Gairm-Oideachaís chun díol as forbairt agus leathnú ar a gcuid scéimeanna oideachais.</P>
    <P>Sa bhliain 1952-53, sé líon de scoileanna Gairm-Oideachais a bhí sa Phoblacht ná 224 b'shín 19 de bhreis ar iomlán na bliana 1951-52.  Ina theannta sin do fairsingíodh a lán de na scoileanna a bhí ann cheana féin ionas go mbeadh slí iontu dá raibh ag éileamh freastal orthu.  I rith na bliana so caite, do húdaraíodh ceithre cinn déag de scoileanna nua agus dhá fhairsingiú mhóra ar chostas iomlán £150,265.  I seisiún 1952-55 do bhí iomlán 87,516 de dhaltaí ar rollaí an uile rang le chéile fé na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais i gcomparáid leis an sár-iomlán 88,121 a sroiseadh i seisiún 1951-52.  Do breisíodh óna 19,032 go dtí 19,780 ar an méid díobh sin d'fhreastaíl na cúrsaí lánaimsire lae&mdash;an líon is airde do sroiseadh riamh sa roinn sin.

Is é is mó is cúis leis an laghdú ná a dhóichí é gur lú an líon de leanaí a bheidh fé choímeád sna scoileanna sin i rith na blíana reatha seo ná mar bhí anuraídh.  Ar an 31ú Iúil 1953, is é iomlán a bhí fé choimeád sna Scoileanna Ceartúcháin ná 175, agus sna Scoileanna Saothair bhí 5448.</P>

      <P>Maidir leis an Meastacháin i gcóir na Roinne Oideachais, sílim nach gcuireann go leor Teachtaí spéis ann.

Tá sé an-tábhachtach oideachas a chur ar fáil do na páiste agus is mór an náire dúinn é nach gcuireann níos mó Teachtaí spéis sa Mheastacháin seo agus sna rudaí a bhaineas leis an oideachas.</P>
      <P>Cuirtear suim san fheirmeoireacht agus caitear a lán airgid ar mhodhanna nua feirmeoireachta agus rudaí a bhaineas leis an fheirmeoireacht.  Is maith an rud é sin mar is tionscal tábhachtach an fheirmeoireacht sa tír seo agus tá a shliocht air ; caitear a lán airgead ar an fheirmeoíreacht ach níl muid toilteannach an t-airgead céanna a caitheamh ar oideachas. Chomh maith le sin, ní chuirimuid an tsuím chéanna i gceist an oídeachais. Is mór an trua sin mar ní féidir naisiún a bheith againn mar ba chóir muna dtugamuid gach seans do na daoine óga oideachas maith a fháil agus náisiuntacht d'fhoghlaim ar scoil.  Is mian liom cupla focal i mBéarla a rá ar an Meastachán seo fosta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noticed for the past couple of years that very little interest is taken by a number of Deputies when this Estimate comes before the House.  I think that is a pity, because the Estimate for Education should be one of the most important Estimates to come before us.  Yet it usually goes through the House in a very short time, in a matter of a few hours.  At least it did last year and the year before.  That is something which is not good, something which I personally do not like to see, because the education of our young people is of such importance that I think we should all take a very keen interest in it.  In the first place, I think many people are not inclined to take an interest in it because they do not understand Irish, and when the <Col N="237" /> Minister's statement is read in Irish they feel that it is just something for those people who understand it.  It is a pity that the Minister's statement was not read in English as well, although I do appreciate the fact that the English translation of the speech was circulated last night.</P>
    <P>On looking through this statement, I find that the money spent on the different branches of education works out at £16 per pupil in respect of primary school pupils, at £31 per pupil for secondary school pupils and £52 per pupil for pupils attending full-time day instruction courses in vocational schools.  I think certainly that that is putting the cart before the horse.  I arrived at these figures by finding the number of pupils on the rolls in the three types of schools for the last year and the total estimated expenditure for the current year.  Most children in this country receive only a primary school education.  Those who receive a secondary school education are the children of the better-off sections of our people.  The majority of those who go to secondary schools usually pay for their education.  Yet the State intends to spend this year £31 per head on these students, whereas they intend to spend only £16 per head on each pupil in the primary schools.  I think that is not right.  It shows that the emphasis is on secondary education, whereas I maintain that the emphasis in this country should be on primary education.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Council of Education which was set up to study two questions&mdash;the function of the primary school and the curriculum to be pursued up to the age of 12 years &mdash;have concluded their deliberations and that a report will be issued shortly.  In regard to primary education, we seem to be at a crossroads at the present time.  At least it is a question that is occupying the minds of very many people.  Debates are taking place as to what should be done about the programme&mdash;is the present programme the right programme to follow, has it any faults, should something new in the line of a programme be adopted, should we add to or take from the present programme, <Col N="238" /> etc.?  These are questions which are being debated by teachers, parents and others.</P>
    <P>Then again there is the question of what we should do about the teaching of Irish.  Are the present courses and the present methods followed in the schools the right courses and the right methods, or can anything better be done?  Can better results be achieved?</P>
    <P>I have one main fault to find with the present programme.  Of course it has been said so often that the statement is becoming hackeyned and therein lies the danger of repeating it once more.  Despite the fact that it has been said so often, I do repeat that the present programme in the national schools is too wide and too much is expected from it.  The teacher is expected to cover a very wide field, a field that he has not time to cover. The pupils are expected to follow the teacher over that wide field.  As to the advice that might be offered, there is a lot to be said for the old system of the three R's.  I think the aim in our primary schools should be to give to the pupils weapons whereby they can afterwards acquire knowledge. Cramming in the primary schools should not be countenanced at all. That is one of the reasons why I fought against, and will continue to fight against, the primary school's certificate.</P>
    <P>In the first place, the primary school's certificate is an unsound method of training young people from 12 to 14 years of age.  In the second place, it does lead to cramming in the primary school, a thing that should not be encouraged but rather should be discouraged, because I think myself that it is not the primary school pupil who leaves the school with a vast or fairly large amount of facts and figures who in after life becomes the best or the most educated citizen.  I think the most promising pupil is likely to be he who leaves the primary school with sufficient foundations laid to acquire knowledge in after life, the pupil who during his school life has been given chances and opportunities to study, to work out problems for himself, to work out the whys and wherefores for different <Col N="239" /> things.  I believe that instead of being told: &ldquo;This is so and so, you take it or leave it,&rdquo; the pupils should be encouraged to ask so that the teacher may tell him the reasons, the whys and wherefores.  That is the pupil who in after life stands the best chance of acquiring further knowledge and learning more.  Under the present programme, I do not think that the teachers can be blamed if that leisurely pursuit of education in the primary school does not take place.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the most serious problem in primary education is, I think, the shortage of teachers, both male and female.  It is something which has come all of a sudden.  Ten years ago, many trained teachers had to wait three and four years before they found a vacancy for a permanent teacher in a primary school.  That is not the case now : managers are finding it very difficult to get teachers, male and female.</P>
    <P>That in itself is bad, but it is leading to a lowering of the standard of education, a lowering of the attendances and a lowering of the status of the national teacher.  The Minister will find that in many schools there are unqualified teachers acting as assistants and acting as principals. That certainly lowers the status of the qualified teacher.  I know that an effort is being made to train more teachers, and that the figures for those who will qualify this month are higher than they were for some years.  I wonder, however, if the training of more teachers will solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Last year I put down a question to the Minister for Education to find out the number of teachers trained over the last five years who are not now serving as teachers; and the reply I got indicated that in respect of male teachers 12½ per cent. of those trained over the past five years are not now teaching.  There must be something radically wrong when that situation exists.  It indicates that they have left the teaching profession.  There may be some of them who qualified last year or the year before and who did not find schools, but that is most unlikely; so it indicates that many&mdash;<Col N="240" /> or a fair number&mdash;of the teachers who are trained do not follow teaching as a career.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons is that the salaries are not high enough.  They are not equal to the salaries paid in other professions where similar qualifications are required.  The salary is not anything like what is earned in business.  Another difficulty is that many people decide not to go on for teaching at all.  I do not know of any pupils who passed the preparatory college examinations and refused to go on to the preparatory colleges but I am told that recently that has happened and that they refused to take the scholarship.</P>
    <P>Since more money per head is being spent on secondary education than on primary education, I would suggest to the Minister that he should study the question of parity of pay for primary and secondary teachers.  There is a good deal to be said for it.  It would not weigh the scales in favour of primary education at all, as the balance is the other way round.  If parity were given it would not shove up the £16 per head figure to anything near £31.</P>
    <P>In regard to the shortage of teachers, there was a question tabled here yesterday about allowing married women back into the service.  I appreciate the Department's and the Minister's views on that matter but, as I suggested in a supplementary question yesterday, it would be a good thing, while the present shortage exists, if the Minister would consider taking those lady teachers into the service for a short period&mdash;say, three or five years.  It would at least remedy the very great shortage at the moment, which is causing damage, especially to rural schools, which are the worst hit.  They are two-teacher schools in the main and when one teacher is absent&mdash;and that does happen for rather long periods&mdash;and an untrained teacher is appointed, it lowers the general standard.  Sin an méid a bhfuil le rá agam ar an cheist seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I avail of the opportunity afforded by the introduction of this Estimate to draw the Minister's attention to the difficulties of parents <Col N="241" /> who are removed from the centre of the City of Dublin to the outskirts, to corporation housing schemes, in very large numbers indeed.  I would like to see a little more co-operation between the housing authorities, the parish managers and the Department, with a view to having schools ready or nearly ready when the children&mdash;in thousands, not in hundreds&mdash;are removed from slum quarters in Dublin and from other quarters where houses are going into decay.  Very large numbers are transferred, in many cases, four and five miles away from the centre of the city, from the old type of school, a magnificent school, built of granite and long established.  Those schools are losing their pupils at a very fast rate.  The corporation, when it is ready, transfers children in thousands&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;thousands&rdquo; I mean thousands and not hundreds.  Children are transferred, sometimes 5,000 and 6,000 at a time, to various areas where there are not schools ready for them.  The parents are then faced with the difficulty that, owing to their having to pay high rents, they cannot find the money for bus fares to send their children to school in the city.  The result, as the school attendance authorities will tell you, is that a very large number of such children are left for a considerable period without adequate attention to their education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider the appointment of an officer with full powers to discuss both with the housing authority and the parish managers the possibility of providing accommodation for these children who are transferred to the outskirts of the city so as to ensure that, at least, temporary accommodation will be available from the very first day that those children go to live in their new homes.  I think that about 20 or 30 buses, at the very least, bring children from corporation housing schemes to and from schools which are some distance from where they live. Of course, if suitable educational facilities are not available for them in their own districts, then that is a step in the right direction and both Governments deserve thanks for seeing to it that these buses are made available for that purpose.  I understand that the fare is only 1d. and that, in some cases, it is <Col N="242" /> even less.  Might I, however, put this point to the Minister and to the House?  Take, for example, a parent who is trying to cater for his family out of very small wages and inadequate allowances and who has to find a penny bus fare for four or five of his children per day.  It will readily be admitted that the extra 2/- or so can be a heavy burden in such circumstances. I feel that it is only necessary for somebody to mention that matter here: I know I am pushing an open door.</P>
    <P>The fact remains, however, that in certain areas in Dublin City there is a delay in the provision of schools for the children and the parents are complaining. I should like to put this suggestion to the Minister as a means of surmounting the temporary difficulty which is experienced while parents are waiting for the extension of the splendid schools that have been built by both our Governments.  I think it can be said, in passing, that our schools in Dublin are equal to the best we can see in any part of Europe. They are magnificent schools that are a credit to our native Governments and that would be a credit to the Government of any country.  The complaint of parents is that there is delay in the provision of such schools and that there is, therefore, an interruption in the education of their children. I am talking now about children who are, maybe, only five or six years old. However, if a child of five or six years who has been attending school for some time must, when the parents move to a new area, wait maybe six months or a year until the new school in the area is ready for occupation, it must be admitted that that is a very serious break in the child's education.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it quite clear that, in speaking as I do, I am not complaining of the work of our Ministers for Education in the past or of either of our Governments.  I just want to ask the Minister to look into the points which I have made and which are uppermost in the minds of many parents of young children who are living on the outskirts of Dublin City. I think the Minister should impress upon his officials that the time has arrived for friendly consultations between <Col N="243" /> parish managers, representatives of his own Department and representatives of the corporation housing section with a view to looking after the matter of the provision of sites for the erection of schools on them.  I may say that representatives of all religious denominations have praised Dublin Corporation for providing sites for the schools.</P>
    <P>Here is another point that may arise some day.  Somebody may say: &ldquo;We think that the sites should be part of a housing scheme.  We think that if a church and schools, library and technical schools have to be provided, the parish managers should not be burdened with the obligation of having to purchase a site for the schools.  We feel that a parish manager should not have the obligation of obtaining from his parishioners the funds to purchase a site for the schools.&rdquo;  I think that that is a matter for the Government. The parish manager accepts a very serious and heavy responsibility in undertaking the management and care of a school and in paying a fair contribution&mdash;and a fair contribution is asked from the people, through the parish manager.  In my view, it is not fair that they should be asked to purchase for cash costly sites that have been provided by the municipal authority under the Housing of the Working Classes Regulations.  The unfortunate parish manager has to try and get a proper site and fit it in with the roadways and, of course, he has to try and get it at a fair price.  So far as the raising of funds for the purchase of a site is concerned, I think that is a matter for the Government and the local authorities and that it is a burden that should be taken off the shoulders of the parish managers.</P>
    <P>One will notice, too, in Dublin City that when pupils are being enrolled for vocational schools there are always long queues of boys and girls who are very anxious to avail of the training provided in these schools.  I am aware that in many parts of Dublin City quite a substantial number of boys and girls are disappointed annually in not being able to be enrolled as pupils of these vocational schools because they <Col N="244" /> are already full.  Again, I should like to make it clear that I am not making these remarks in a complaining way because there is progress in the provision of such schools.  I wish that any words of mine would encourage greater activity and speed in that matter.  A very large number of boys and girls are waiting to go into vocational schools and to get the benefit of the training given there by splendid teachers.  For those reasons, I earnestly hope that the Minister will try and speed up the provision of further vocational schools.</P>
    <P>While we are waiting for the erection of substantial school buildings, might I suggest to the Minister that movable schools might be made use of?  I feel there ought to be some system whereby temporary buildings would be available for removal from site to site, as required.  When the corporation or the local authority find that their work on any particular site is nearing completion they can move the temporary building to the next site on which they propose to start work immediately.  In that way, these temporary buildings could be made use of for two months or six months or for as long as required until the permanent work on the new site has been completed.  In my view, much use could be made of such temporary buildings&mdash;buildings not in any way to be accepted by the people as permanent buildings but buildings which could be erected on a site for a short period until such time as the new schools are ready for occupation.</P>

      <P>There is one point on this Estimate which I should like to put very briefly to the Minister for his consideration and it concerns the appalling conditions in many of our rural national schools, as was mentioned by Deputy Cunningham.  He emphasised the importance of primary education and I might refer now to the matter of the lack of suitable sanitary facilities in many of our rural national schools.  I realise only too well the grave difficulties which we have had to contend with in the past but the provision of adequate sanitary facilities in such schools in rural areas <Col N="245" /> is a matter which has been awaiting attention for years and years.  The local authorities are not able to provide the funds for these facilities&mdash; facilities which, I am convinced, are vitally important for the people and the children, who must be considered first and foremost.  Therefore, it is essential that some provision, by way of grant or otherwise, be made for this purpose.  I do not say for one moment that 100 per cent. grants should be provided but I do say that it is an urgent matter.  My view in regard to education is that its most important aspect is that the parents themselves, as well as the manager, should realise that they must take their share of responsibility and play their part, themselves, in their own localities.</P>

    <P>In dealing with the Estimates for the current year it is rather difficult for a Deputy on this side of the House to be very critical in view of the fact that these Estimates are the work of the out-going Minister for Education. There are, however, a few points to which I would wish to call the attention of the present Minister for <Col N="247" /> Education in the hope that there would be a continuity of the sympathy shown and the interest taken in this problem by Deputy Moylan when in office.  The present Minister for Education, while being the best of the present team of Ministers for the post, has had a fairly high standard set him by his predecessor, a standard which I believe he will have some difficulty in maintaining.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan's principal aim was to effect and to maintain&mdash;and I think he succeeded in achieving it&mdash;the most amicable relations with the teachers. He treated them with the utmost courtesy and consideration.  He brought into his Department a sympathetic understanding of the problems of education, while his efforts towards the improvement of existing schools and the building of new schools have won him the warmest tributes from both parents and managers.  Despite the efforts of Deputy Moylan, there is much yet to be done in regard to the improvement of existing schools and the building of new schools and it is up to the present Minister to ensure that the good work of his predecessor will be continued.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of the progress of the past three years would undoubtedly see the achievement of the former Minister's aim of good, clean, bright and well-equipped schools in every parish in the country within five years. The special effort he made towards speeding up the construction of new schools is reflected in the fact that the number of new schools, including extensions in progress at the end of 1953, was well over the 100 mark.  It is the duty of the present Minister to ensure that that effort will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Now, while we are waiting for the completion of the problem of the construction of new schools, a determined effort must be made to improve the condition of existing schools.  More congenial conditions must be provided by an effort to remove the drabness and, in some cases, the squalor of these schools by the provision of better heating, cleaning and sanitation.  These <Col N="248" /> things are essential for the health and happiness of the children.  Certainly, these essentials cannot be provided under the present niggardly heating and cleaning grant.  A considerable increase in that grant deserves the serious consideration of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Cunningham to the teacher shortage. The recent announcement of the Department to the effect that teachers due to retire may be retained for a further period of 12 months and the progressive increase in the number of untrained teachers in our schools bring home in no uncertain fashion the grave and serious nature of this shortage of trained teachers.  There is no doubt that the salary paid to teachers is a direct cause of this shortage.  To meet this increasing problem, there are, to my mind, three apparent solutions: (1)  to increase salaries; (2) to remove the marriage ban; (3) to permit university graduates to teach in our primary schools.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to understand why there should be any reluctance on the part of any Minister or on the part of the Department to accede to the request of the primary teachers for an equation of their salaries with vocational and secondary teachers.  The vast majority of our students never go beyond the national schools for education. To deny these students the best we can give them in the matter of teachers is, to my mind, a palpable injustice. No one believes that the work of a primary teacher is less important than that of the teachers in vocational and secondary schools.  There is no justification, then, for the discrimination, if you call it discrimination, which reduces the status and the dignity and the salary of the primary teacher as compared with that of his professional colleagues in vocational and secondary schools.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that this discrimination militates against and will continue to militate against brilliant boys and girls undertaking the long and arduous training for teaching in primary schools.  The 80 per cent. of our pupils who only get primary teaching are entiled to the best teaching we can give them.  They cannot get the <Col N="249" /> best while this discrimination prevails. In view of the importance of primary education for the vast majority of our children, and with a view to removing one of the greatest bones of contention and one of the greatest causes of discontent amongst teachers, I ask the Minister to examine that question with a view to removing this discrimination at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>A contributory cause of this teacher shortage is no doubt what I call the short-sighted policy of the introduction of the marriage ban.  The withdrawal of this ban would make immediately available some hundreds of badlyneeded trained and highly experienced teachers, teachers who by reason of their marriage and their motherhood are peculiarly fitted to undertake the training and the upbringing of the very young and the adolescent.  These trained, skilled and very competent teachers are in most cases replaced by inexperienced and untrained junior assistant mistresses. The loss of these teachers to the education of our youth and the loss caused by the constant changes and replacement of the efficient by the inexperienced must be very serious and is to my mind an injustice which the Department can hardly stand over.  The Minister should examine this with a view to its withdrawal or, as suggested by Deputy Cunningham yesterday at Question Time, he might make use of these teachers until such time as there are sufficient trained teachers to replace them.  The admission to our primary schools of a number of university graduates each year would help to solve the teacher shortage.  Many of these graduates are unable to secure employment in our vocational and secondary schools and have to emigrate as a result.  Their loss to the teaching service could be avoided by permitting them, after a short training course, to teach as trained teachers in our national schools.  That is a point well worth considering.</P>
    <P>There is another appeal I have to make to the Minister.  It is an appeal on behalf of those pre-1950 pensioned teachers, who, in the evening of their lives, after a lifetime of hard work in their profession and devotion to the <Col N="250" /> language revival cause, have to take off their coats and fight for equity, fair play and a recognition of their just demand for equal treatment with later retiring teachers on the question of their retiring gratuity.  There can be no justification, nor has there been any attempt at justification, of a regulation whereby a teacher retiring on 31st December, 1949, gets a lesser gratuity than a man retiring on 1st January, 1950, a day later.  To me it seems absurd. If it is, as I suspect it to be, a departmental bookkeeping matter, I think it is a petty attitued.  It is but a matter of simple justice to yield to the demand of these pensioned teachers.  The cost to the State, I understand, would be very little and public opinion would undoubtedly be on the side of these aggrieved people.  There should be no avoidable delay in yielding to their just demand.</P>
    <P>Let me finish, as I began, by appealing to the Minister to ensure that there will be no slackening off in the language revival efforts and to ensure that the enemies of the language will not feel that they can now relax their efforts against the revival movement.  I have no doubt of the sincerity of the Minister in this matter, but I feel none too happy about the attitude of some of his Cabinet colleagues towards the language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I want first to congratulate the Minister on taking over this Department.  There are not many men in this House endowed with the necessary character and ability to take on the responsibilities of Minister for Education in this country.  I want to congratulate, also, the former Minister who, I believe, was a realist and who faced up to his responsibilities, and who left the stamp of his character on the country.  These men are men whom the nation needed to take over and to set the course for education in this country I know that the present Minister, who has spent his lifetime in the service of the country, has his heart and should in the uplifting of the masses of our people and in the formation of a character in our people which will give us a distinctive Irish nation, and, now that he has taken over this responsibility again, I know he is going to set <Col N="251" /> himself to the task of leaving behind him a nation of which we can be proud, an Irish culture and an Irish tradition, and that every effort will be made to realise the ideal of an Irish-speaking nation.</P>
      <P>This is a Department which needs serious consideration, because I believe that we are at the crossroads. We have now had 30 years of native government and we must ask ourselves if we have made much progress and if we are going on the right lines. We should also know why there is so much apathy and doubt as to the course on which we are going or should go and what is our ultimate aim.  Is it a Gaelic nation, with our own distinctive characteristics and culture and speaking our own language? If so, why is the nation not harnessed to its task?  Materialism, as we know, is sweeping aside our whole national outlook.  Materialism is the order of the day and, to my mind, it is getting a complete grip of the nation. If it gets that grip, there is very little we can do to stop its progress.  Cynical indifference is gaining the upper hand and must be curbed.  I believe that a major decision must be taken.  We have to marshal all our national forces to set our course and I hope that a united Parliament will make an effort to set that course before many years have passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many handicaps under which education suffers, the first of which is a discontented teaching community. Teachers had many grievances which required to be remedied.  Although some of them have been remedied, others have not yet been remedied, and I hope the Minister will set about doing so, because we do not want to make our teachers trade unionists or anything of that sort. They are people with a vocation and they come next to the ecclesiastical authorities.  They have the moulding of the youth in their hands and I do not believe in forcing them into trade unions or other organisations.  There should be some way of easing their difficulties and they should be removed from the need to cry out for a few <Col N="252" /> more pounds to meet the cost of living. The national teacher in the country areas is the pivot of all activity in the area, and, if he is a contented teacher, I am satisfied that we will get over many of our difficulties.  I hope we will hear very little more about dissatisfied teachers who are not getting the remuneration to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>In this matter, we have to start at the bottom.  The young teacher is not paid enough.  The young teacher gets a mere pittance or weekly wage which is little better than the man working on the road gets, with the result that he is unable to do anything for himself. He cannot settle down to build a house or to get married and we all know that the man with his own house who is married and content makes the best teacher.  All our young teachers at present are on the move.  Many of them are moving out of the teaching profession and going across to England to earn money.  That is a serious position because these fine young men, with training and culture, should be held for the Irish nation.  I hope the teachers at the bottom will get a better initial salary, a salary sufficient to raise them above the level of people with a mere existence.</P>
    <P>There are other grievances that should be looked into.  Many of our country schools near the big towns are being depleted of their pupils and something should be done about it. The big centres are like a magnet&mdash; focal points which draw all the young people because it is there the big money is spent and there are more facilities there than are to be found in the country schools.  I hold that the country school is the natural pivot of all activity in the country, and I know areas in which ten, 15 and 20 children pass by their local national school on their way into the big centres.  I also see religious communities sending out vans to bring in these pupils from distant areas, passing the national schools on the way.  This depletion of the national school population leaves the teachers in a serious position, and many of them become disheartened and dissatisfied and resign.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> I hold that no community, religious or otherwise, and no big school should be allowed to take the national school children from these areas.  I quite agree with their sending out vans to bring in the pupils going to the secondary schools, but they should not be allowed to bring the children away from the national schools.  The national teachers, on whom so much money is spent in their training, are entitled to some consideration, and I should like to see some order going out to the different schools setting out that they are not entitled to take pupils away from the country schools, because, if this practice continues, we will have nothing but a few big centres and a depleted countryside and our people will make no effort to stay on the land.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister did many good things and made many good statements, but he did one thing which I regard as a major blunder.  He insulted the national teachers.  He told them openly that they were only of secondary importance and that the secondary teachers were of primary importance.  That was a colossal blunder which I do not believe he intended.  There is no man as important in the country as the national school teacher who has in his charge the formation of the character of our Irish youth.  The teacher in charge of the youth from six to 14 years of age who has the responsibility of the formation of the character of those children has in reality the formation of their whole life.  Therefore, we should not allow them to be insulted; any grievances they may have should be taken away so that they can perform their duties to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>In connection with vocational education I would like the Minister to look into certain grievances which exist in my county.  Vocational education is very important and is the follow-up of the work done in the primary schools. I am glad to say that it is on the upgrade but we have far too much centralisation in the bigger towns.  It is wrong to spend such a vast amount of money on big schools.  Other people <Col N="254" /> who have to pay for the education of the few who attend these schools should get consideration also.  There are large areas in my own country which have no facilities whatsoever because they are too far away from the bigger centres.  We would be far better occupied in building smaller schools out in the country areas and giving all our children the same facilities as are given in the larger towns.</P>
    <P>As regards the building of a new vocational school in Oldcastle town, the people of that town and the people of Meath have a definite grievance.  I am not against the erection of this school if it is found to be necessary, but there is in Oldcastle the Gilsenan endowed school which caters for all the people, where Protestant and Catholic communities can combine for the purpose of education.  It is a pity that we have not got many more schools of this type in the country.  Now we are about to build a new vocational school in this area, notwithstanding the fact that the Gilsenan endowed school have stated that they are prepared to provide any facilities necessary to cater for the people of that area.  If any money is to be spent for education in this area, it should be spent on that school in order to make it the pivot of vocational education there.  Many people who are not of my religious persuasion are beginning to think that the proposal to erect this new vocational school is the thin end of the wedge to close them up.  It would be a dangerous and an unfortunate situation if that were to happen and if the matter has not gone too far, I hope the new Minister will look into it seriously and see what can be done to bring about a remedy.  I am convinced the Gilsenan endowed school is capable of providing all the facilities needed, and the tens of thousands of pounds proposed to be spent on building a new school should be spent some where else where the facilities are not available.</P>
    <P>A similar situation exists in Navan. I have no objection to the enlargement or the building of a new school in the town of Navan; possibly it is needed, but I cannot see why a committee is allowed to pay up to £1,200 an acre for three acres of land for the building of <Col N="255" /> a school.  I know that there are plenty of places around the town of Navan where you can get land either compulsorily or voluntarily for anything up to £200 or £300 an acre.  To pay such an enormous amount of money is a case of deliberately throwing away the people's money.  I would rather see that school a quarter of a mile, or a mile, outside the big town centre.  How are we going to buy land to build labourers' cottages around that centre when £1,200 an acre is paid for three acres of land?  Not a half a mile away is better land for which we refuse to give £70 an acre.</P>
    <P>I know this Estimate should be passed as soon as possible so I will not delay the House but I do hope the few remarks I have made will bear fruit and that there will be an inquiry into the question as to how our money is spent on education.  We need a vast amount of money for the education of our people and we must get down to the question of the feasibility of having an additional school room in our national schools in which vocational education could be started. All our people are entitled to equal treatment whether they live in the bigger centres or in remoter areas.  If there is no work locally for the children leaving school at 14 years of age they must go to England and they are lost to the nation.  They are the cream of the country and are entitled to fair consideration.  If adequate educational facilities are given to our youth they will not want to emigrate as they have been doing over the years.  I hope the new Minister in taking over will lay a foundation of which we can be proud.</P>

    <P>I think we are not spending enough <Col N="256" /> money on education.  It seems to be easy enough to get money from the Dáil for the work of other Departments where expenditure is widely undertaken because there are tangible results.  The difficulty about education is that the results are always intangible and we are, therefore, not so much inclined to spend the money that we should on certain aspects of education.</P>
    <P>With regard to national schools and national teachers, I think the problems there hardly need discussion any longer: they can be solved by the combined energy and wisdom of the Minister and of the Department of Education.  Having left the Department of Education, I can assure the present Minister that he will have no better or more efficient staff, no matter in what Department he might find himself, not merely in administrative matters but in all matters appertaining to education.  The staff in the Department of Education are not merely civil servants; I regard them as educationists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles had some criticism to make of vocational education and I am in agreement with him in so far as he would like a wider development of vocational education in the rural areas.  But, after all, we must remember that vocational education had its origin in the cities.  It has developed widely in the cities and that development must continue because of the demand for that particular type of education in the urban areas.  That, however, is no reason why we should not have a much wider development of vocational education in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in one aspect of vocational education in the rural areas, that is, in the provision of rural science classes.  I think there are grave difficulties facing the Minister, particularly in regard to the provision of teachers of rural science and, in that regard, it would be far better if there was more co-operation than now exists between the various Departments of State; it would be far better if some of the cut-throat competition between them could be eliminated. Without going further into that, and I could say a good deal about it, I <Col N="257" /> would suggest that for the proper development of vocational education in the rural areas we need a very close co-operation&mdash;a co-operation that does not now exist and its non-existence is not the fault of the Department of Education&mdash;between the Department of Education and the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>It has come to my notice that one very important aspect of vocational education is that of Irish and continuation classes.  For many reasons the Minister should take steps to ensure that the men who control and direct these classes have very high qualifications and ability.  In many ways that particular responsibility is in many places throughout the country the shop window of vocational education.  It is most important and I would like the Minister, therefore, to give special attention to the qualifications and ability of the teachers appointed to that particular work.</P>

      <P>In my own village in County Cork I have seen land composed of bog and mountain fetch more than £1,000 when bought as a site for a school within the past 12 months. One cannot get away from that, but that must not stop us building vocational schools.  To my mind there is an unjustifiable delay in the building of these schools.  Owing to some Department of Finance regulation, or rule, a county vocational education committee cannot proceed with the building of two schools at the same time even though they have the money.  That is wrong and I think <Col N="258" /> that rule should be abrogated by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne had something to say about the co-operation between municipal authorities and the Department. If there is any lack of co-operation, it is not the fault of the Department.  As far as I know there was a committee set up as a result of the views expressed by the Department to corelate the efforts in relation to housing and schools and I would acquit the Department of any charge of neglect in regard to the work they have done in the provision of schools in the newly built-up areas.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of the work of the Department of Education to which reference is not very often made.  I refer to the work done in our reformatories and orphanages. The work being done in orphanages is beyond praise.  In the reformatories I think it would be better from the point of view of the children if there were separate reformatories, buildings or institutions for the younger children.  At the moment they are grouped together without regard to the charges which have brought them into these places.  I think some selection between the younger and the older groups would be more effective for the purposes we wish to achieve.</P>
      <P>Again, we are not spending enough money on our reformatories and orphanages.  Let me emphasise once more that the results of education are intangible; nevertheless they are all-important and the money spent on these intangibles will ultimately give very tangible results from the point of view of the nation as a whole.  I hope that any urge for economy on the part of the Government will not stop the Minister from trying to provide the moneys absolutely necessary for these purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Magnificent work is being done in our deaf and dumb institutes.  I do not know if the capitation provided, whichever Department provides it, is sufficient for the purpose.  I know there is a great need for more up-to-date equipment in these institutions. The Minister can discover quite easily in the Department what that equipment <Col N="259" /> is.  There is need for more teachers in these schools and the Minister should take note of the deficiencies that exist.</P>
    <P>The blind schools are in the same position.  One most difficult aspect of education is the care and training of mental defectives.  That is the responsibility of another Department to some extent.  To some extent it is the responsibility of the Department of Education.  I wish that the Minister would look into the matter so as to make better provision for those who have undertaken this very arduous task.</P>
    <P>The National Library needs a very wide extension.  Books, valuable manuscripts and documents of all kinds are being stored under conditions where they cannot but deteriorate.  I find it hard to believe that, in the case of scholarly research, it is possible to discover readily all the information that is required because of the manner in which the books and documents are stored.  The manner in which the library is being conducted is beyond all praise, but the Minister ought to take courage and try to discover some means of providing the storage space that is very badly required in the National Library.</P>
    <P>In the National Gallery we have a collection of pictures equal to that of any gallery of its type in the world, but, unfortunately, at least 50 per cent. of the pictures that should be on show are stored in the cellars of the National Gallery where they cannot be thoroughly cared for, where they must deteriorate and where it is wrong to keep them when they should be on show.  There is opportunity for expending money on extending the National Gallery, and I think the Minister should take up with the architects of the Board of Works the question of how the provision to be made for an extension of the gallery can be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Again, our National Museum is suffering from the same lack of space.  The available exhibits are thrown higgledy-piggledy throughout the Museum, so that many valuable exhibits must <Col N="260" /> deteriorate under the conditions in which they are kept.  The exhibits cannot be properly catalogued.  It is hard to understand what is the material that is in the Museum at all because of lack of space.  I commend to the Minister the need for immediately tackling that particular problem.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that we could create a folk museum.  Again, I think there is an opportunity now of doing so.  The future of this country, to my mind, in great measure depends on the outlook of the people where they can create in coming generations a pride in the past, some belief in tradition and some love and pride in this country.  One of the ways in which we can do that is by telling our people what their past was, and it has been proved in other countries that no better way can be designed of doing that than by the creation of a folk museum.  Like Mitchel, I do not despair of this country yet.  I think it is a policy of despair to suggest that everything should be centred in Dublin.  Some people seem to have the view that University College, Galway, and University College, Cork, will become organs for which there would be no further use&mdash;for which the political body has no further use.  I have the hope that this country will develop, that it will go ahead, and that there is great need for further development in Galway and Cork, and not for the curbing of expenditure on activities there.</P>
    <P>Further than these few words, I will not comment on the Estimate.  There is just one other thing: that is, that in the coming year, I understand we are to have a visit from a convention of scientists.  I think that we ought to have our shop window in order, and if there is any further expenditure needed to put Dunsink Observatory in a position to face up to the visiting scientists, then that money should be spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate in succeeding years takes very much the same line.  I should like to go back to something that was said on the Estimate last year and try to see if we can develop some positive thinking in regard to our basic approach to education from the practical point of view. I will put the question this way, particularly <Col N="261" /> in regard to our secondary schools: Is the curriculum now becoming loaded in every category with a lot of matter which the student cannot possibly reach on effectively, and which, on sober analysis, by, shall I say, the ordinary man in the street as against the specialist, will be shown to be unnecessary?  If our education has developed in that way, would it not be better to go back over practically every programme and, if I may use the word, give the student a load which he can cope with and so get better results?</P>
      <P>That problem is really a practical problem.  It in no way conflicts with the broad aim that is there in education as a whole.  I know that when some people talk like this they are told that the function of education is something higher.  You hear a lot of talk about character training, about ideals and so forth.  That is all very proper and all very good, but what I am going to talk about does not really conflict with that at all.</P>
      <P>Last year, I think that some of us asked what did the parents, and, after all, these are the people primarily interested in the children, want.  They are their children, and they want, first of all, a sound basic education where there is a proper outlook given. They want a sound moral and religious basis first, a sound character basis first given to the child, a sound outlook on life and, after that, they want the child equipped for the life that he will have to face.  I wonder how far our educational system at the moment is helping towards that end.  As far as the basic outlook is concerned, the general religious training and moral outlook, the situation is satisfactory, but, as far as the practical side of things is concerned, I think it is not so.  Under the old educational system, you had a system where the child was made to understand things throughly. The field was in some respects more restricted.  The child was made to do things thoroughly and he knew what he knew.  That was not only a good thing for his character&mdash;a very good thing for his character&mdash;but it gave him a certain practical equipment as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> Frankly, I confess I just do not know where to start because there are so many angles that can be dealt with in this and I do not want to repeat all the things I said last year on this Estimate except to emphasise that I could repeat them again in detail here to-day.  But if the child is going to start out in life he wants to have some training in attention to detail and a character strong enough to get down to detail in pushing things home.  I think some of us said last year that one of the difficulties that seem to have developed in our national character is a certain inability to attend to detail and to concentrate to the final point to get success in an undertaking.  We are inclined to let up a little before we finish the job.  We are all rather addicted to generalities. I am afraid that is a rather sweeping statement but that tendency is definitely there and I wonder how much that is attributable to our educational system as we have had it over a number of years.</P>
    <P>The child who&mdash;well, in my time, perhaps it has improved since&mdash; went to the secondary school was brought over a wide range of ground in practically every subject.  There was not any hope that the child could master the whole field and feel at home in it and as a result he finished up with a certain kind of foggy general knowledge and he had not enough practice in detailed concentration on anything.  I have often thought since when one looks at the examination papers and other things how many of us afterwards from experience in life would be able to do them and how many of these questions and how many of these subjects that are dealt with have any relation to life as we found it in the reality after leaving school.</P>
    <P>Take the mathematical programme for one.  The mathematical programme in the secondary school may be very well for somebody who is going to specialise in physical science or mathematics or something like that but for the ordinary child going through whether he is going to be trained academically in some other line or particularly if he is going out <Col N="263" /> into life as most others do, what bearing has a lot of the stuff that is being done and how many of the students other than those who become engineering students or such, or something on these lines, have any real appreciation of what they were taught and found it in any way of use?</P>
    <P>That is a question I think we could ask ourselves.  If the answer to that is &ldquo;Very few found it to be of any use to them afterwards, or to have had any effect on their thinking,&rdquo; then what use was it at all for these particular people?  I know that the argument could be put up that there will be a certain percentage who will require higher mathematics later, but, as I said before in this House, I have known university professors who later have had to deal with students taking up these specialist courses and I have heard them more than once mention that they would have preferred to get students with a better grounding in the basic things without any introduction to the higher principles which they had under the type of preliminary education they had to deal with, because they have often had to go back on the ground that had not been covered and the situation was more unsatisfactory than if they had got children grounded very thoroughly in the elements of calculation whom they could then initiate and bring into the higher regions.</P>
    <P>I have merely singled out mathematics as one subject.  I think you could nearly say the same about any subject. You could say it, for instance, about Latin.  I think I said here before that an elementary teaching of Latin in our schools would be a very good thing. It would be a particularly good thing if it was organised so that the average child could take an intelligent interest in such Latin as he is likely to come across, and in particular for the Catholic child, so that the average Catholic child could take an interest in the liturgy, but when one goes to what I would nearly call &ldquo;extravagances&rdquo; of Horace, and all the rest of them that are often inflicted on children in secondary schools, it simply gives them a distaste, because they cannot master them, and an uncertainty and unsureness of themselves because they have <Col N="264" /> not been able to be clear on their studies, and perhaps a lot of tags that will not be very much use to them, but they will probably fail and not be able to deal with the simple case I have mentioned where it might have been useful to him.  It would be much better if time were given to grounding the children in the elements of the language so that they could read simple Latin such as is in the liturgy and understand it, and follow simple constructions instead of the type of thing that the children sometimes have to suffer.</P>
    <P>Again, that may be all very well for the specialist&mdash;I do not know anything about the classical specialist&mdash;but I think our common sense tells us what the position should be in regard to the average child.  Perhaps things have mended somewhat since I went through the mill but I wonder if this is so from the tenor of examination papers as I find them.</P>
    <P>One could take almost any subject, but lastly we come to another side of the picture&mdash;the English language. Whether we like it or not we all have to work and think through the English language.  It is the principal vehicle for most people in everyday life.  It is very important that the child should have an accurate command of that language in the schools, that is, in our ordinary English-speaking schools.  It is a different problem in the Gaeltacht. I could put it in this way&mdash;the important thing is that the child should get a through grounding in the language that can in reality be considered as his first and his natural language.  It is an unfortunate fact, but one that we must all face, that for the majority of people in the country that language happens to be English.  Again, on the English programme&mdash;I do not know how far it has been remedied since my time&mdash;but the thing had been so broadened and widened and there was so much talk about culture and philosophy that it became a completely foggy activity in the school at the expense of such necessary things as accurate expression, accurate description of something the child saw, an accurate report&mdash;maybe in letter-form &mdash;of something that the child wants <Col N="265" /> to report or should report, the accurate appreciation of simple words and construction of the language and the ability then to be able to express accurately what he wants to express.</P>
    <P>I am not going to get involved now in the question of how far our thinking is tied up with the language that expresses it, but I think I can go this far and say that you are not going to have effective expression of thought, and maybe not even going to have effective thinking, unless you have the technique for expressing it mastered, and that, of course, is the language.  In the case of English, how often do many of us hear complaints&mdash;and this might go even to the primary schools&mdash;that the children nowadays are not taught. Their writing is bad.  Writing may be merely only writing, but concentrating on good writing, when the child has got the basis the effect is to make him concentrate on what he is writing and not to dash it off slipshod.  I think there is something to be said for even the mechanical task of good writing.  But the complaint goes more than that.  The complaint is that they cannot express themselves.  The complaint is that they use the English language badly, that it is bad English; and I think that there are even university lecturers who look through their examination papers at various times of the year and will have that thought prompted to them, in some surprising places sometimes.  I may be wrong, but I think that that is not altogether an uncommon experience as a result of our education in the first case.</P>
    <P>Now, why does that happen nowadays? It is not the child's fault.  It is not the fact that people are any worse or that you have a lower standard of material than you had formerly.  I think it is due to the fact that we are not paying enough attention to these basic techniques&mdash;if I might call them that. If the child had more time to concentrate on accurate speech, accurate grammar, the simple but necessary rudiments of grammar, understanding that grammar and the reason for it, again in its more simple and direct cases&mdash;I would not like to make the error of which I was complaining in another direction by attempting to <Col N="266" /> make him a professional grammarian or something like that&mdash;but concentration on these techniques, particularly in regard to the English language, I think, would be an improvement, as I said here last year.  The same goes for the other subjects.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the mathematical curriculum, again it is a question mostly of the secondary schools, but we can go back to the primary schools. Older people and older teachers to whom I have spoken are almost unanimous in expressing the opinion that children of some 40 years ago, or even say, 30 years ago had more facility and assurance in, say, reckoning, elementary arithmetic, in the elementary mathematical processes, than children have to-day.  They knew their tables. they could use them, they could apply them to the old sums that were the bane of the schoolboy but still had a certain down-to-earthness about them when they were not pushed too far&mdash; the simple direct sum about how much wallpaper is going to be taken to paper a particular wall.</P>
    <P>In doing that kind of thing it is said, and it is said so frequently that I am not inclined to dismiss it merely as the views of people of another generation, that children formerly were much surer.  I know this much &mdash;that people of my generation at school were nothing like as sure in these techniques and were not able to handle simple mathematical problems, particularly the simple ones that turn up in ordinary life, whether ancient or modern, as well as the generation that went before.  I think that the generations that were educated in the twenties and thirties in that regard can certainly say that they did not have the mastery that their fathers had.  I take it that if you were to take the generations and put them into competition with one another in these techniques the older generation would have won hands down.</P>
    <P>That is something that has a bearing on life afterwards, because what does a child want when he leaves school&mdash;the average child?  He wants to be able, surely, to do the elementary calculations of arithmetic, <Col N="267" /> addition, subtraction, multiplication and those things and to do them thoroughly, quickly and accurately. He wants to be able to do the ordinary manipulations with money. He wants to know something about interest; but there I would like to say that there is a certain limit to what he wants to know.  I am still wondering where people will ever come up against some of the beautifully complex and ingenious problems that were worked out in compound interest for the harassing of the unfortunate students that I was once introduced to.  Nevertheless the simple problems, the direct problems that turn up in life, are important and the child should be equipped for these.  I cannot think beyond, say, ordinary manipulation of money, the arithmetical operations &mdash; multiplication, division, substraction, addition, the ordinary manipulation of these things whether it is in reckoning stocks, counting motor cars, numbering something or anything else&mdash;these turn up but one can master them, and anybody who has a sure mastery of them and is at home with figures has an advantage. I am not so sure that I can think of an awful lot else.  Even the giant calculating machines are based, I think, on these few simple operations, and they certainly are enough for the ordinary individual.</P>
    <P>In geometry I am all for a certain intuitive knowledge, but again we have completely upset that line of country by getting too involved.  I am afraid that the specialist has tended to bring in on the unfortunate child a lot of unnecessary and harmful complications there.  Many people will agree that the outlook in regard to teaching geometry should be this&mdash; first of all to give an intuitive idea of the simple properties of space, and again I would stick to the space we know about, Euclidean space.  It is quite time enough to specialise afterwards in the case of anybody who wants to specialise or to go far ahead with it as a hobby.  If he wants to read the popular science papers he will find plenty of materials and books.  But I <Col N="268" /> am thinking of the ordinary citizen who is neither a specialist nor turning it into a hobby.  It is good enough for him if he can have an intuitive knowledge of the essential properties of space and the geometry that is being taught is simple.</P>
    <P>There is something else that can be added to that, of course, in regard to geometry&mdash;that there is very good training in logic available there if some definite system like Euclid is followed.  But again the line should be a simple and direct one, and it would be better, to my mind, if the whole of the secondary school course did one book, say Book 1 of Euclid, which is not the easiest in a way, in a thorough appreciative manner and never heard of anything else afterwards.  The training should be thorough, and if the simple logic of geometry is brought home by careful explanation, by making sure that the child appreciates what it is, he will get a firm grasp of the fundamentals and then you could reasonably add detailed and complete exercises in the more elementary portions. Afterwards I suppose most of us will find that the sum total of the geometry we will ever require is how to calculate the third side of a rightangled triangle from the other two. That is nearly about the only geometrical application that is of really great importance to the child.</P>
    <P>I am not attempting to suggest what are the limits.  My plea would be simply this&mdash;let us get a course where, first of all, we are realistic and disciplined, if you like, in selecting what is to be the course for the child to do in those particular subjects.  Prescribe no more than the child can do thoroughly.  Make sure there is a grasp of fundamental techniques and that it is a real foundation for such further development as that particular child may require.  We should be able to do that.  In order to do that a certain discipline in selection is needed; a certain realism is needed for everybody who is prescribing a particular course to appreciate that there are other courses.  That is where the general educationist comes in to see what is to be the balance between different subjects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> There should be a certain amount of prescription to make the thing definite.  That prescription is necessary in respect of all the things certain educationists will say.  From a practical point of view, it is more or less essential that there should be a certain amount of definite prescription and that necessity is further enhanced by the fact that effective examinations, which appear to be the only practical way of testing the child, are not made easier&mdash;I was going to say they are hardly possible&mdash;that is, in a secondary course, unless there is a certain degree of prescription there.</P>
    <P>That would mean a lot for the character of our children too.  If they give us a system where there was discipline in prescription and what was to be done, a restricted field but an insistence on that field being covered and the child knowing what was prescribed &mdash;in other words, putting it in a queer way, knowing what he knew, it would have a very beneficial reaction on the character of our children growing up generally.  You would get attention to detail.  You would get the confidence that comes from knowledge.  You would get a sureness in thinking and in execution.  That would do a lot to compensate for or correct some of the faults that are alleged to-day to be found in our children.</P>
    <P>From the practical point of view of fitting the child for life, I know some people will say that you want, even at that early stage, to prepare the child for various careers.  Some people say that maybe a child is going to be a lawyer and, therefore, you want to make sure that he knows a certain amount of history.  Another person says that the child is going to be an engineer and, therefore, he will have to cover a large mathematics and science field.  Another child is going to be a chemist, and so forth and so on and therefore you have to try to do the preliminary training to fit the child on the average so that he can go anywhere.  I would not agree with that.  That is a problem in specialisation. The problem is really, when should the child specialise&mdash;at what stage?</P>
    <P>I would like to make it quite clear <Col N="270" /> that what I am talking about is the question of general education and, normally, for certain classes of children, anyway, in the secondary school, specialisation will not take place until the child has completed his secondary school course.  Sometimes specialisation may follow the intermediate.  All right, but that is a separate problem. But, even in the case of specialisation, as I have said already, a knowledge of fundamental basic techniques is perhaps more important than a roving introduction to the whole field.</P>
    <P>I know that many of my generation &mdash;I do not know how it is with people who followed afterwards&mdash;those of us who specialised in any way in anything requiring certain mathematical knowledge, always suffered from a lack of sureness and facility in the elementary techniques and that was never in any way compensated for by the fact that at school there was a wide introduction to such things as analytical geometry, even the calculus and things of that nature.  That introduction to those subjects was given at the expense of time which should have been devoted to the more elementary parts of the subject. Frankly, I for one, doubt the wisdom of including in the leaving certificate programme all the parts of the subject, say, mathematics particularly, that are apparently prescribed to-day and, actually, from the point of view of the specialist they would probably be better off if they had not that wide prescription at that stage and were able to develop from a familiarity with the so-called more elementary parts of the subject when they started off on the specialist course.</P>
    <P>To go any further with what I have said rather generally&mdash;and it is only generally&mdash;would involve simply repeating in detail what I said on this Estimate last year.  On looking back on it, I do not think I would change anything I did say there but, at the same time, particularly in the present circumstances, I do not feel warranted in repeating it for the benefit of the House to-day as the House wishes to rise to-day.</P>
    <P>I would end by asking the Minister to have this aspect of the subject <Col N="271" /> thoroughly and critically examined from the point of view of the parents who have a large interest in it, from the point of view of the parents in so far as they want to have their children equipped for life afterwards, to have it examined from every point of view, to have it examined especially from the point of view of balancing the specialists, who may have an influence in prescribing in any particular subject or any particular course, examining it from the point of view of restriction with a view to thoroughness, and from the point of view of being able to ensure that the children, when they leave school and go further in life, have got a sound practical education as well as the general education.</P>
    <P>In saying all that, I do not want to appear reactionary.  I want particularly to safeguard myself from the type of accusation that can be made when one approaches general education from the general view of the ultimate purpose of living and the ultimate purpose of education.  All that is a different matter which I was careful to safeguard when I started to make these remarks here. But there is another angle to it&mdash;that is, the practical side, the education of the child for life.  There is the question of the education and development of the child's character, particularly, in directions where, perhaps, we are a little bit weak in this country: attention to detail, sustained concentration, and so forth and so on.  I would ask the Minister, as I asked the Minister last year, to have this matter taken up and properly examined, and to have something done about it.</P>

    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his <Col N="272" /> efforts in Irish education from 1948 to 1951.  He removed many of the causes of irritation amongst our teachers when he set up the conciliation and arbitration board.  I am very glad to hear that he is about to introduce this arbitration board once again to be a buffer between the Department, the Minister and the teaching bodies throughout the country.  I must also congratulate Deputy Moylan for his handling of the Department, for the originality he showed while he was the responsible Minister and for the schemes he devised for the betterment of our educational system.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of parity spoken of by Deputy Giles and Deputy Ormonde, I feel sure that nobody in this House will argue against the principle of parity.  If we had that parity, we would have greater co-operation amongst teaching bodies in the country. We would have a combined effort towards the solution of our problems and towards the reforms that are needed in our whole eductional system. I feel, too, that if we have this parity we would have greater contentment and better results.</P>
    <P>The teaching of rural science and domestic science is a crying need in rural areas.  I agree that there may be some difficulty in finding teachers at the present moment, but the present schools could be availed of for evening classes and night classes for these different branches.  If there was not sufficient accommodation in the present rural schools, there is no reason why little extensions should not be provided by the combined bodies and thus obviate any greater expenditure.  These extensions could be provided with a little co-operation.  I would commend to the Minister the point put up by Deputy Giles as providing a solution of this problem and as a means of providing the rural education and the domestic education we so much need in this country at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to say very little, indeed, to-day, because I think the subject of education has been discussed very widely and competently already.  I do want to make an earnest <Col N="273" /> plea to the Minister to restore the monitorial system.  I think it was the best system in the country for the recruitment of teachers.  The monitor was appointed by the principal teacher and the manager, and he was usually picked because he had an aptitude for teaching. Having that aptitude for teaching, it naturally followed that when he entered the profession as a qualified teacher he was a happy and contented teacher.  I know that it was necessary to depart from the monitorial system for the reason that many of the older teachers had not sufficient Irish to prepare monitors for entrance to the training colleges.  For that reason, it was necessary to depart from the system, but that reason no longer obtains.</P>
      <P>There are now throughout the country a great number of teachers, practically all teachers in the national schools, qualified and able to teach Irish up to the standard required for entrance to training colleges.  For that reason I should welcome nothing more than a return to the old system of recruiting teachers, that is, through a system of selection by the principal teacher and the manager who knew the boy and his aptitude and who picked him because of his fitness for the office of teacher.  Under the present system, young boys are, I might almost use the word, trapped into the profession of teaching.  When it comes to the time for entering the training college they find that possibly they are entering on a career which is distasteful to them.  They find that there are other much more remunerative careers which they might have entered if they had not been caught, as it were, into the profession at the early age at which they were.  So much for the monitorial system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another step for which I would make a plea is the complete lifting of the ban on married lady teachers. Throughout this country we have an immense number of two-teacher schools.  What better staff can you have for a school than a man and wife where you have a common interest working right through the school from the infant stage up to leaving age?  I do not know that there should be anything <Col N="274" /> very wrong in having married teachers.  If so, it took a tremendously long time to find out that there was anything wrong.  The system operated for generation after generation and I never heard any objection raised to it by Church or State.  The natural wish for any woman who is not entering religious life is to enter the married state and, under the present system, I know that we have a tremendous number of quite discontented lady teachers.  That particularly applies to the rural lady teacher.  She is not happy in the country and she tries to get to the city, where she will have wider contacts and more opportunities to meet people and to get into the married state&mdash;the natural aspiration of every normal woman.  That is sufficient, I think, for that question.</P>
    <P>I should like to see teachers trained in the university rather than in the city training college.  It would make for a broadening of the mind for those who were brought in to a very narrow sphere in these preparatory colleges and who then go back to a narrow sphere of contacts.  It would give them an opportunity of broadening their outlook and would be a better idea altogether than the specific training college education.</P>
    <P>If students were trained at the universities they could get practical experience of teaching by visiting the schools in those university centres. Even in this large City of Dublin you have schools of every type, graded from an immense school down to schools of the two-teacher type.  You have the same in Cork and Galway. The Department could supply to the university a list of efficient schools where, through the inspectors' reports, it was known that the work was done thoroughly and well.  The students could visit those schools and observe the most efficient methods of teaching.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope the Minister will give some consideration especially to the first point I mentioned&mdash;the restoration of the monitorial system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I would like to say a few words.  Early in the debate it was said, and said properly, that we ought to <Col N="275" /> regard the occasion of this Estimate as one of the most important given to us for influencing the future of the country.  The subject ranges over a wide field, including the training of children to become good citizens from a moral and from a character point of view and from the point of view of intelligence, so that they may be able to take their place and do efficiently the things which come their way in life.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress what has been said regarding the need of thoroughness in elementary education.  I do not know whether the pictures that have been painted of better conditions long ago are just or not.  Going back to my own young days, I think that if you were to take the boys from the class in which I was, in all probability the majority of them would be found at that time, by those who wished to find fault with the system of education, to be as lacking in knowledge as the boys of to-day.  It would be said they did not know this, that or the other properly or thoroughly.</P>
      <P>There are very few years available for the teacher in the primary system. Boys and girls leave at 14 years of age.  They have not begun to develop reasoning powers until seven, eight or nine years of age, so there are very few years in which reason can play a proper part.  The earlier years are extremely valuable for memory work, for the things that depend on memory, and those early years should be availed of to the full.  The total period is very short and you cannot expect in those short years to turn out people who can stand questions from elders who have had a large part of life experience behind them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity that these debates are confined for the most part to those engaged in teaching or administration. It would be very much better for us to hear the parents, those who have an opportunity of seeing the proof of the pudding in the eating of it, seeing what knowledge their children have got and who could tell us what faults they find in the system of education. Unfortunately, when these debates are <Col N="276" /> confined to the experts, they are inclined to be restricted to questions that teachers discuss at their congresses&mdash;mainly questions of remuneration and classification of teachers. The broader aspects and the needs could be dealt with much better by the parents who are ordinary members of this House.  If they gave us their own experience with their own children, we would see exactly what faults have to be corrected.</P>
    <P>I had only a very short time in the Department of Education.  The first thing I tried to do there was in regard to the secondary school programme, to get a definite prescribed piece of work which would be sufficiently short to enable it to be done thoroughly in a year.  I had conferences with the inspectors.  However distasteful it may be to teachers and others, we must remember that unless there is proper inspection of the work the Department cannot know exactly what is taking place and cannot judge adequately the results of a programme.</P>
    <P>As far as the primary schools are concerned, taking the case of arithmetic for the moment, if the children are taught to add, subtract, multiply and divide, that will lay a good foundation.  When I talk of division, I mean long division.  You can have division by short methods of various kinds, by factors and so on, which are very useful on occasion, but what should be taught is not the exceptional or a particularly handy method, but the general method.  If you know long division, you can do any ordinary division question.  If you know only the factor method it will not apply in all cases.  What is needed is proper attention to the general rules, leaving the exceptions and refinements to a later period.</P>
    <P>The same would be true in the secondary schools, in the teaching of languages.  It would be true in the teaching of Irish.  It is the simple, direct rules we need.  The exceptions can be allowed to wait over.  The point, then, is that the time available in the primary school for teaching is very short and the amount that can be gathered there is comparatively very <Col N="277" /> little.  Let us see that that is done well. I am all for examination of the results. There may be a difference as to whether it should be a written examination or an oral examination.  I am very much in favour of oral examinations myself in all subjects.  I think they are far better.  The questions cannot be so easily anticipated, for example.  A teacher who is anxious for good results in a written examination will find, by going over the examination papers of a number of years previously, that the papers tend towards a repetition of certain types of questions.  If a child has done the simple rules of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division there should be a test to know if he can apply those rules: to know if the child has facility, speed and accuracy in the processes and their simple application. It is easy to talk of the doing of these things, but it is very difficult to get a whole class to do them.  You may get one or two individual children to do these things well; but take, for example, a class of maybe ten or 20 children. It requires careful teaching over a period of years.  We want to know if these children will apply these rules and do so correctly.  Moreover, if they are taught properly, you can teach very many more things than the mere doing of the process.</P>
    <P>As far as speech is concerned, you want accuracy of expression.  I should not like to regard myself as a good example.  Certainly, when I look back at some of the speeches I made in the past I feel that I would like very much if my method of expression were greatly improved.  Children should be taught to express themselves accurately, both orally and in writing. That is important and it is a very difficult task.  Then there is the question of the selection of books for them to read so as to train them to read and to write.  The choice of reading books depends upon the scheme for which they are designed.  What are the best types of reading books for a child?  If the child lives in the country, should the topics discussed in the books relate to country life?  One would naturally expect that they should.  Sometimes, however, it is the unknown that is attractive to us. I remember that we had a book in the <Col N="278" /> old days, I think it was the fifth book. In that book there was a description of the Four Courts in Dublin, together with a picture of the building.  I know that that interested me very much at that time&mdash;probably because the Four Courts was something which was away from me&mdash;farther away, at the time, than something of local interest which might be described.  However, I am not saying that, as far as possible, the topics in the books for country children should not be based mainly on country life.  If you want to teach rural science, if you want to give ideas about science in general, you can do so through properly arranged reading books.  I remember that in the sixth book we had something about banks. I knew nothing about banks then and I do not know if the teacher at the time knew very much about them either.  Perhaps he did, but I know that that particular lesson did not interest me in the slightest.  Therefore, we have to be careful in the selection of reading matter.</P>
    <P>If reading, writing and arithmetic are well taught and you find by examination that this minimum course is well done then, after that, I should leave the teacher a relatively free hand.  However, I should not allow the teacher to neglect these three subjects under any circumstances.  I should not say that any school is being properly taught in which the vast majority&mdash; you will find certain exceptions&mdash;of the students are not able to do that minimum work well and I do not see how you can satisfy yourself that that is being done unless you have inspection.  I do not think the teachers ought to resent inspection.  While I am talking about inspection and examination, I have no hesitation in saying that I regard as a retrograde step the decision not to give special rewards to those who are specially efficient. Rewards and punishments are part of the means by which human advancement is effected.  We have rewards and punishments even as regards life eternal and I see no reason why there should not be rewards for those who do their work in the schools with particular efficiency.  It is very easy to claim that those who are not of the <Col N="279" /> highly efficient class should get the same pay as those who are regarded as highly efficient.  The method by which &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo; is determined is, no doubt, very important but that is a problem by itself.  If I had the doing of it and if the money were available, certainly I should give reward in any way possible to those who had proved themselves highly efficient.  I do not know of any better way of doing it than by increasing the remuneration.  If there is a better way, if an olive leaf or a green ribbon or something like that would produce the same result&mdash;if there were some distinction for which people would work harder than the ordinary and more devotedly&mdash;I should be all for giving these rewards.  I should do the same in regard to Irish.</P>
    <P>What you want most in the teaching of the Irish language is devoted teachers&mdash;teachers who love the language and who desire to hear the language spoken in later life by the children whom they are now teaching. I should give any reward I could to teachers of that kind in the case of Irish and the same is true of the other subjects which are taught in the elementary schools.  There is no use in expecting to get university degree standards from young children.  What you want from young children, in the matter of Irish, is that they will be able to express themselves, that they will have a certain fluency in the common speech which will give them courage to go on and master the higher parts.</P>
    <P>I have always stressed, whether it was in private or in public, that the way to improve the Irish language is to have oral teaching from the very beginning.  In fact, it is essential to have it from the beginning.  The question later is how to use that knowledge in the higher classes.  That is a matter for very careful consideration.  In my view, it is a point which should be examined closely at the present time. I think the report of the Comhairle Oideachais has just been furnished to the Department.  Is that so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That will give the Minister and the Department an opportunity of examining the views of a large number of people who are interested in this whole question of primary education.  Advantage should be taken of the presentation and examination of this report to see whether we should not look into this whole question of the teaching of Irish &mdash;because a very large number of people are dissatisfied with the results. It may be that it would be impossible to get the results we require but, in any case, there should be a thorough examination.  The basis on which the past method rested was that from about five to eight or nine years roughly, that period was &ldquo;the language period.&rdquo; In those years, children naturally acquire languages very easily and it is the oral knowledge of a language that they acquire at that time.  It is much too early to expect children of that age to have a knowledge of grammar rules.  Therefore, it is an oral knowledge that must be given to them at that period.  After that period has elapsed and you have taken full advantage of the child's natural facilities for learning languages at that early stage, the question arises of how you can best, with fairness to the child's needs, and the thorough development of its mind, combine these with the national objective of the restoration of the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that we are all serious about the restoration of the language and that the only difference between those of us who differ is as to the best method and how we can get the best results.  If you go down the country <Col N="281" /> you may meet children of ten years or so who are attending a primary school. You know that the language is taught there.  You speak a few words to them in Irish, but they do not seem inclined to use in reply the Irish which they probably know.  That is unsatisfactory. There is something wrong about their unwillingness to use as much of the language as they know. Sometimes, after a great deal of trouble, you extract a few simple phrases from them, but you get the impression when you talk to them that they regard it as something artificial.  It ought not to be so.  I suppose the fact that it is not the speech they hear in an English-speaking area, the speech they hear all round them, that gives them a feeling that there is something queer in being spoken to in Irish.</P>
    <P>But have we not gone beyond that stage in which Irish is altogether unknown in an area, even in the English-speaking areas?  We ought now to have arrived at a stage in which the children will realise when they are using Irish that they are using the language of the nation, that it is another mode of expression and that it is the mode of expression which would be most characteristic of our nation had it not been for historical accidents which deprived us of having it as the general speech.</P>
    <P>In the case of the primary schools the teaching of Irish should be oral, without doubt, up to eight or nine years of age.  After that the introduction of reading matter and writing&mdash; teaching the children to read and write&mdash;and to the extent it can be used as a school medium of instruction all require very careful examination. A good teacher, almost in any circumstances, will get good results. There is hardly a doubt about it.  You can put a teacher in an old cowhouse &mdash;I do not say it is the proper atmosphere in which to put him&mdash;and if he is enthusiastic he will get good results.  The hedge schoolmasters were successful.</P>
    <P>But we have mass education and mass teachers to-day.  We have not the selected teacher, the one who is teaching as a vocation.  We have <Col N="282" /> people going into the teaching profession to-day as a career.  That is why you have this percentage of those who go to a training college where they get opportunities of getting education which they would not get otherwise. They avail of that.  They have no calling to continue as teachers, and if other opportunities are available to them they avail of them, using the education which they have got.  As far as the primary schools are concerned, what we want is simplicity and thoroughness, dealing with the broad general things and not the exceptions.</P>
    <P>We come next to the secondary schools.  They are intended to give a broader education than can possibly be given in the primary schools.  It is unfortunate that all our children cannot get that broader education.  But for those who have the opportunity it does open up fields of knowledge and of happiness too, a means of using their leisure time and developing their minds.  They get these opportunities in the training given.  On the one hand, the practical instruction in the science and on the other humanities, if I might use that word in a not very technical sense.  You have the subjects which enlarge the scope of a person's thinking and of a person's ability to get information and knowledge elsewhere.  That is done in the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Again, the programme there has to be very carefully thought out.  There is only a certain number of years in which this work has to be done.  If you want to learn modern languages, you will get an introduction to modern languages in those years.  It will not be possible to get the large course of modern languages if you want at the same time to do classics, or mathematics or science.  So that there must be a certain restriction in the distance you can hope to go.  The question is, will you expect everybody to have a certain knowledge of modern languages, a certain knowledge of classis, even though it may be limited, and a certain knowledge of fundamental science, or will you group the subjects as has been done and say: &ldquo;We will have certain groups and we will regard the aim of our secondary education as being fulfilled if we get a boy or girl <Col N="283" /> who has been introduced through the training given in one of these groups.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, in the secondary school the same thing should apply; we should have a definite prescribed course and by examination find out whether the required standard has been reached in that course.  If the majority of the pupils in a school do not reach that minimum standard, the pupils should not get the rewards given for having that minimum work done thoroughly. Once you have the minimum, then you can give the greatest freedom for the rest.</P>
    <P>My complaint was, from the experience I had of children who had gone to these schools, that looking at the work they were doing, I came to the conclusion that the broad courses that were being followed at that time were unsatisfactory.  In Latin, for example, they got a thick book&mdash;<i>Les Latins</i>&mdash; with selections from many authors.  I do not think that gave pupils as thorough a knowledge of Latin as would have been given by the careful study of one or two authors such as, say, Virgil and Caesar, to take these as examples.  A thorough doing of one or two books of these would give a better foundation.</P>
    <P>Another matter has been referred to this afternoon which I should like to stress in regard to the teaching of Latin.  We have a wonderful opportunity in this country to have Latin taught more as a living language than they have in other countries.  I found my own knowledge in this respect unsatisfactory. I had been pursuing an honours course for a good number of years both in the intermediate and in the university, and when I got the Latin missal I found, to my horror, that I was stuck very often.  It was convenient, of course, to have the English translation very near, but I felt that I certainly had not done very well in the five or six years I had been doing an honours course in Latin.  I think we ought to begin at the other end.</P>
    <P>I have tried to interest some people in preparing a textbook to see whether that would be popular.  I think that in the early teaching of Latin&mdash;we can <Col N="284" /> proceed to the higher courses afterwards&mdash;we should start with the simple Latin prayers, make them the basis of our grammar and composition&mdash;that is, get off by heart, as a beginning, the ordinary prayers that every Catholic will meet in a very short time&mdash;get that thoroughly done, and make it the foundation. Those of us who go to Mass hear the priest every Sunday reading certain parts of the Mass aloud.  If those prayers are known, we can very easily follow them.  There is a constant repetition of them.  If we base our teaching on learning such prayers, we can take the hymns afterwards if we want to do something harder.  There is very little difference between the Church Latin&mdash;there are some rules and some words which are different, but they are not very numerous&mdash;and classical Latin, so far as the rules of grammar are concerned.  Therefore, if we begin with the Church Latin, the Latin that will come the way of every child, and do it thoroughly, it will be found that the child can very easily get on to the ordinary classical course.</P>
    <P>I know that the purists, the classicists, will find fault with me in that line of approach, but I have been trying to induce some people to produce a Latin textbook based upon learning off the prayers by heart and using these prayers which have been learned off and which they will hear constantly repeated as a basis of grammar.  To my way of thinking, the old Smith's <i>Principia</i>, if thoroughly done, would give as good results as any modern textbook I have seen.  It is oldfashioned, but if I were to devise a textbook with such experience as I have gained, I would go back to a book of that sort, basing the introduction to Latin upon the prayers and upon a textbook similar in character to that old Latin textbook, and going on to the classical Latin, the Golden Age or Augustine Latin, from the Church Latin.</P>
    <P>The same is true with regard to Irish &mdash;oral, and then later going on to the reading matter.  In regard to oral teaching, however, the trouble is to get something which will be complete in itself.  Mere phrases higgledy-piggledy would be all right, if you were <Col N="285" /> in an Irish-speaking community in which these in time would amount to a full conversational knowledge, but during school hours, which are very limited, it is not possible, unless one systematises carefully, to have the sort of phrases necessary to give a child the feeling that he is able adequately to deal with whatever things he wants to deal with through Irish.</P>
    <P>I have often tried to think how that oral teaching could be systematised, and one way would be to try to follow the child's life and see what are the first words a child would use, in its very early years, get a collection of these and form them into a textbook to help the teacher in his oral teaching. You could probably make a certain amount of progress in that way, but I was in no position in which I could follow that systematically and see where it would lead.</P>
    <P>There is a method, however, which one can follow, that is, to have your teaching based on the grammatical rules without any necessary reference in class to them.  Take a book like the <i>Ceachta Cainte Gramadaí</i> of Seán Ó Catháin, or a similar book where the broad grammatical rules are covered, you could, on that basis, frame a series of conversational lessons complete in themselves.  You could make the children finish that course with all the main rules that a child requires to speak correctly.  They will have got examples of these without explicit grammar teaching and examples that can be referred to.  They may not know anything whatever about the grammar rules, but they will have got the examples which can be used and will, consequently, be in a position to form short sentences correctly.</P>
    <P>If somebody, then, would try to assist those who want to teach orally children from the ages of five to eight or ten by producing a textbook of that kind, it would be a tremendous help&mdash;a textbook giving sentences which would be related to actions of the child in the school as far as possible. If we had that, and behind it were the grammatical rules which were being illustrated, it would be helpful, and if I were asked to devise a system <Col N="286" /> at the moment, I know of no better plan than that and it would enable me to feel when I had finished the course that I had done something thoroughly as a foundation to equip the child to give expression to the various thoughts which children would want to give expression to in Irish.  It will not be altogether complete, of course.</P>
    <P>In the secondary schools, you have to decide carefully what your programme is to be and how far it should go.  In these modern times, there are some people who are so practicalminded that they want to have everything related to what they call practical life.  I was amused while listening to a discussion on the examination papers, some of the questions on which were published in the papers recently, to hear some of the criticisms of these questions.  There were some questions in history and fault was found with a question asking something about Napoleon's attitude towards the Church.  Other people criticised some arithmetical questions or some simple algebraic questions on the lines of: six years ago, A was five times as old as B and in another four years he would be two and a half times as old.  The problem was to find their present ages.  The people I was listening to said that this was a ridiculous question and asked why some more practical questions were not put to them.</P>
    <P>The point is that such questions are only examples of processes and what the teacher is teaching is not that particular example, but a process which can be applied generally.  It is only an example of the application of a process&mdash;a simple equation with one unknown&mdash;a process which can be applied to a number of other questions. The wit of the teacher is tested and the textbook also, in providing suitable applications of the process in question and it was no real fault in the examination paper that a question of that sort was set.  There could be other types of applications of a similar process and the particular one was of a type probably found in the textbook the children were using.  With regard to the question as to Napoleon's attitude to the Church and <Col N="287" /> the criticism or the setting of a question of that sort, the people who criticised forgot that the children who were asked these questions were asked them after they had studied a particular programme and period.</P>
    <P>It might be said that a programme of that particular type was too advanced for the children to comprehend it properly.  That would be a fault of the programme.  But if you set a programme thought suitable for the ages of the children, and there is a textbook covering that programme, which there will be I am sure, and if there is a part of it dealing with the attitude of Napoleon towards the Church, I would not find it wrong to set questions on those lines.  Of course, the children who would be asked those questions are no longer babies.  They are fairly grown-up boys and girls.  I forget whether that question was given for an intermediate examination or for the leaving certificate.  It would have been better for the senior class.  However, it is very easy to be hypercritical of examinations like that.</P>
    <P>Cramming is another matter about which you hear a lot of talk.  I heard it to-day in regard to the primary examination. We must all cram a certain amount.  For example, when the Minister is preparing for this particular Estimate, he concentrates on it for a certain period.  He will be ready to answer detailed questions on it for the moment which he might not be so ready to answer at a later period.  We have all to do that in life, and I would not regard as harmful the intensive application and concentration which is necessary in order to prepare for examination in a subject.  There is, of course, a type of thing which is harmful. You are supposed to read a textbook and you find that some people are able to short-cut and defeat the purpose of those who set that textbook by preparing replies to certain types of questions which they think are suitable for examination purposes, and the textbook itself is not read.</P>
    <P>I admit that competition and cramming are things which can very easily be abused, but they have their purposes. One of the troubles to-day is <Col N="288" /> that everything is too free and easy. You have not got sufficient of the intensive application such as is necessary to succeed in competition.  As I have said, I do not regard this intensive application as in general harmful, nor does it take away from the happiness of children or from the pleasure of their life.  It is a useful part of the training for life to be able to concentrate and to make up intensively and thoroughly a certain portion of the work.</P>
    <P>In the secondary schools there is the problem of the programme and textbooks which exists to a lesser extent in the case of the primary schools. These are matters that require attention to see whether adjustment ought to be made to fit pupils for the life of to-day, which is not the same as the life of 60 or 70 years ago.  The question is whether we have considered the new conditions sufficiently to satisfy ourselves that the programme does fit the child for the world in which the child is going to live its life.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised as to whether the primary teacher and the secondary teacher should be regarded as in parity and be paid equally.  The fact is that they have different functions. I suppose if, say, an Aristotle were teaching a child the elementary subjects of reading, writing and arithmetic in the primary schools he might be a more satisfactory teacher because occasions might arise when a child might have difficulties and asked questions. Asking questions is one of the best ways in which a child can learn and understand.  If a teacher is alive to what the child wants to know at a particular time he can do much more for him by his questions than by merely pursuing the general course.  The individual needs show themselves up there and a good teacher is the one who takes advantage of any opportunity which presents itself by a child asking questions.  It is the teacher's knowledge which enables him to answer properly.</P>
    <P>Although it is very hard to dispute that the better prepared a teacher is&mdash; the more he knows himself&mdash;the better he will be able to deal with the individual problems of the children, I know, however, there are many instances in <Col N="289" /> which that does not follow.  There is not one of us here who has not had experience of the master who was regarded as a genius in his own line but who was quite unsatisfactory when he tried to impart his specialised knowledge to others, and it is possible that you could have a genius who would be a most unsatisfactory teacher.  Taking all in all, I suppose I could hardly dispute that our primary teachers could not themselves know too much, but I do not know that you can get people whose range of knowledge is very limited and who can do the particular work that is required in the primary schools very efficiently.  You often have a mother or father who may not be very well educated themselves or have a wide range of knowledge, but who will in regard to the simple things be able to do them thoroughly and get excellent results.  It is true, also, that the teacher with comparatively limited knowledge can carry out his work competently.</P>
    <P>Deputy Butler spoke of the monitorial system.  I just escaped being a monitor myself.  I used in my young days be put to teach some other children in lower classes.  It was a small school and I know what this sort of thing is.  I realise the enthusiasm that such a young person can have about the particular work, but whether the choice of the manager and the teacher, as suggested by Deputy Butler, can be depended on for the selection from the school of someone who has a natural vocation for teaching or not, I do not know.  It might be tried when people are seeking to enter a training college or a preparatory college.  The manager might be asked whether a particular young person would make a good teacher, whether he would be devoted to teaching afterwards.  There are many people who would be excellent teachers but will not teach.  However, the love of teaching is another matter.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I could say that the monitorial system would do a great deal for us.  The training colleges fulfil two purposes.  They are professional schools and a type of secondary schools.  They are intended to be continuation schools, to give to the teachers extra knowledge in connection <Col N="290" /> with the subjects they have to teach afterwards or subjects related to them. They are also used as professional schools to teach them the art or science of their particular profession.  I have always felt they failed in the second part of their work.  I was absolutely opposed to the so-called practice schools.  They were attached to the training colleges to give the teachers in training an opportunity of actually teaching children.  I felt it was most unfair to the children, and I was against it on that account.</P>
    <P>I have always thought that what should be done in that case is that there should be selected schools under approved principals, who have themselves proved excellent teachers, and the students in training should be sent to those schools for a period of six months or one year, as the case may be, to learn teaching under the supervision of fully-trained, efficient and approved principals.  That would mean more expense.  It would admittedly be a slower process but, in the long run, it would get better results, if any system would get them, because the professional training would be properly done.  I do not think that can be done by this periodic system of giving what used to be called demonstration or practice lessons.  I do not think that is sufficient.</P>
    <P>Whether or not we should seek to pay equally all members of the teaching profession is a matter which has been raised here.  I fear it is one in which my opinions differ from those to which expression has been given.  If one requires a longer period of wider training in order to equip oneself to do a certain piece of work it is only natural that one should look for a higher reward for one's labour.  I do not think that we can accept otherwise unless one completely eliminates any type of hierarchy.  I doubt if we can say that because the work done by the primary teacher is of such tremendous importance, he should be paid equally as well as the secondary teacher.  I know the case that can be made on the other side, but on the whole I think the primary teachers will have to make a better case before their view will be generally accepted.</P>
    <P>With regard to the special awards <Col N="291" /> for highly efficient teachers, I think that system was a wise one.  There may at times have been faults in its administration; but that is a different matter.  It is a good thing that those who show they are particularly well fitted for teaching by getting good results should get a special reward for their efforts.  That in itself will be an incentive to others.  Some, I admit, will give of their best without any outside incentive, but in the ordinary course of human nature the most usual incentive to good work is the fact that it is specially rewarded.</P>
    <P>Vocational education is also of tremendous importance.  It has been dealt with extensively by Deputy Moylan, who devoted special attention to it.  There is no doubt whatever that it is of paramount importance to-day. If the teacher engaged in vocational education is properly equipped he can make that particular type of education a liberal education. There is no reason why a teacher engaged in the teaching of a particular craft cannot make that teaching the medium through which to impart, not alone knowledge, but a general outlook on life and a perspective proper to the circumstances in which his pupils may ultimately find themselves. A teacher engaged in teaching carpentry can give to his pupils an elementary course in geometry, for example.  All knowledge is an asset and there is no reason why we should regard vocational education as something completely remote from a liberal education.  That, again, depends upon the teaching.</P>
    <P>The most important part of the educational scheme is the actual teacher and anything that can be done should be done within the bounds of reason to make the teacher satisfied and contented.  It is a fact, unfortunately, that we are never content in life.  Indeed, there are people who speak of a &ldquo;divine discontent&rdquo;, though this discontent is sometimes anything but divine in relation to the particular individual or the community as a whole.  There is within us all a natural desire to rid ourselves of things that are irksome.  We shall <Col N="292" /> never succeed in doing that completely. If we could find a body of teachers composed of individuals imbued with the ideal: &ldquo;I am a teacher; I want to remain a teacher: I am fairly well off; I want to give of the best of myself to my pupils and to the community&rdquo; that body of teachers would be worth any price we could pay for it.  Immediately, however, one alleviates or removes one source of discontent another source presents itself and one is, perhaps, discouraged from trying to get contentment because one knows, whatever one may do, there will always be a residue of discontent.  It is, of course, both wise and sensible to reduce that residue to the smallest possible proportions, and when demands are reasonable, it is in the interests of the country and in the interests of education that these demands should be reasonably met.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who believe that we are not spending a sufficient proportion of State funds on education. The reason we are not doing so is the reason given by Deputy Moylan here this morning, namely, that in education we are dealing in intangibles. Immediately one starts spending money on education <i>qua</i> education people come along and say: &ldquo;Look at all the money that is being spent,&rdquo; and the results and their value to the individual and the community are completely forgotten or ignored.</P>
    <P>This is a fundamental matter and if the Minister can suggest to the House any practical steps for the improvement of education we will meet him more than half way.</P>
    <P>As far as the Irish language is concerned, the Minister knows we share the views expressed on both sides of this House, namely, that we should try to restore the language to the position in which it will be once more the spoken language of the country.  What is the best method by which to achieve that?  A Ministry for Irish had been suggested.  Someone suggested that if we had a Ministry or a board dealing entirely with the Gaeltacht it would be of very great value.  I have often pondered on that.  I have often wondered if that would achieve our object.  The <Col N="293" /> trouble is that whoever is responsible for education and the Gaeltacht and the Irish language has also to deal with Government activities in other directions.  One cannot isolate the Gaeltacht and say that the State functions of one Minister or another shall not operate there.  They all operate in the Gaeltacht, and the point is to discover whether one can get all the activities of all the Ministers under the aegis of a Minister appointed specially in charge of the Gaeltacht.  It is a good thing undoubtedly that there should be one eye watching the interests of the language and the Gaeltacht all the time; it is most desirable that that should be so, but the man charged with that responsibility will not be able to carry out his functions or get real results unless he has the co-operation of every other Minister.</P>
    <P>What you want then is the desire, on the part of every single Minister in the Government, to forward the national aim we have in regard to the language, and it is not easy to do that. When a Minister has a practical problem he is inclined to solve it in the way that immediately appears best to him without considering the language. You always have therefore to ask: &ldquo;How is this going to affect the language; is there a language question involved there, and if the language question comes in, how the proposed solution is going to help us towards the attainment of the national objective as regards the language?&rdquo;  The only thing that a new Minister for the Gaeltacht, in addition to the Minister for Education, can do is to keep a watchful eye in regard to the activities of other Departments to try and see that these activities are helpful and not detrimental to the promotion of the language.  It will be found that that is always a job in itself because the other Ministers will be dealing with their immediate problems and so there is always the danger unless each Minister is enthusiastic about the language, that the interests of the language in particular cases will be forgotten.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in regard to education.  I have often wondered whether it is wise that the Minister for Education should also have to look <Col N="294" /> after the administration of the National Gallery, the National Museum and the National Library.  The work of the Minister for Education is a whole-time job, in dealing with primary, secondary and vocational education.  I know that he can, by departmentalising or sectionalising, get these various things attended to and can get reports, but the Minister to do good work has to give personal attention to each of these particular branches.  I think that if he does he will find that it will be impossible for him to give to the National Library, the National Museum and the National Gallery the detailed attention which must be given to them if they are to be made use of properly to the country's advantage.</P>
    <P>Before we left office in 1948 I remember we had come to the point at which a new site for the National Library was going to be got.  It is very difficult to get a proper site for an extension of the National Library.  I think that the Minister, if he goes into the details, will be convinced that the facilities as regards space and so on that are here at present are not satisfactory for the library.  He will find the same with regard to the museum and the picture gallery which have already been referred to by Deputy Moylan.  Therefore, to attempt to get these functioning in the national interest will require the detailed attention which no Minister of Education can give to them.  There is also the question of the universities which calls for his attention.  I do not think it would be possible for the Minister to give the detailed attention that would be required to get an approach to what would be satisfactory with regard to the library and the other institutions I mentioned.  It was suggested to me that some of these might very well be allocated to the new Comhairle Ealaion and put under their control.  I had not made up my mind on that, but I know the suggestion was made.  Ministers want to have more and more under their immediate control, and Departments have similar characteristics.  The wider the control they have the more they are pleased. I think the Minister should resist that very carefully, and if he finds that he cannot give detailed attention to these institutions, then he should think of <Col N="295" /> arranging that the care of them would be provided for by some other method.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have spent so much time in dealing with this whole question. I should prefer, by far, if we had a series of separate items where one could deal thoroughly with any one of them, but one cannot do that on an occasion like this.  I do hope that, when this Estimate comes on again, we will hear from parents in this House their criticism, from the parents' point of view, of our whole educational system and its administration. I will simply end with this, that none of us is so perfect that we cannot be improved by the feeling that there is some eye watching.  I do not think that the teachers ought to have any resistance to inspectors coming along to see the work that is being done.  If these inspectors are reasonable people they will be helpful and will not hinder.  They will not be people that the teacher who does his work conscientiously ought to have any occasion to fear.  The inspectors, however, are of vital importance and their selection should be made with the greatest possible care.  I believe they are necessary, as I believe examinations are necessary.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I shall have to ask the House to bear with me further while I deal with the question of examinations. I think that, no matter what it costs, we ought to have oral examinations in the secondary schools in regard to Irish and, indeed, in regard to modern languages, so that, in the case of a modern language, one can make use of it&mdash;read it and speak it.  Now, in the past, modern languages, certainly in my time, were taught as the classics were taught. One was taught enough to be able to read a modern language.  In the school that I was in, we got a reasonably good pronunciation of the language because the people teaching it had a considerable opportunity of learning the language orally and of using it orally.  We were taught to pronounce it and got some dictation so that our ears were trained to the sound of the words.  We were not taught, most of us, to use the language <Col N="296" /> conversationally, and so those who got that training when they went to a country where the language was spoken were not able to converse with the natives in the language.  I think, as regards modern languages, that is not right and that we ought to have oral examinations in these languages.</P>
    <P>The modern language in which it is essential, in my opinion, to have oral examinations is Irish.  I know the difficulties.  There is the question of having a common standard in the examining, for example.  It has been suggested, too, that oral examining would beget a greater amount of hostility than it is said exists in regard to the language.  That is one thing that I do not believe at all.  How anyone should be hostile to learning our own language in a secondary school I do not know because, from the point of view of mental training, it can be most valuable, apart altogether from the fact that the language is the national language of our country.  As Patrick Pearse once said, it appeals directly to the child. The child can be got to love it for its own sake because it is the language of its country.  But, in any case, I cannot understand how, in the secondary schools, there should be any hostility to the national language.  I do not believe that there is in fact a fundamental hostility to it.  There may be a hostility to methods which may not be approved of, or something of that sort, but I am not going to believe that if you have oral examinations in Irish these will increase the hostility, either of teachers or pupils towards the language.  It is much easier to get a love for the language if you are speaking it and feel that you are in a position to express yourself in the language.  You get a greater degree of love for it than you do with a language that you feel you can only just read, and cannot, if you meet a person who speaks the language, converse with him in the language.  I would ask the Minister to consider anew with an open mind this question of oral examinations in the secondary schools. There will be some expense attached to it and some difficulties with regard to a common standard of examination <Col N="297" /> but these can be solved step by step. As regards having uniformity of standard there may be a question of simply having the oral examination as a qualifying examination to start with.  When you come to the prize groups you may have special problems which will require solution, but I would ask the Minister in the interests of the language and would urge him very strongly to keep an open mind and examine anew the whole problem of oral teaching and oral examination of Irish and modern languages&mdash;particularly Irish&mdash;in our schools.  I am sorry to have delayed the House.</P>

      <P>Ní raibh aon coinne agam labhairt sa díospóireacht seo ach tá cúpla rudaí ann gur mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh dóibh.  Personally, I was very interested in the nature of the discussion which took place here to-day.  There are just two points that I would like to make.  The first is a technical point: it relates to the recruitment a few years ago of certain teachers for the teaching of cultural subjects in the vocational schools, the method of recruitment and the method of training.  The annual conference of vocational education authorities passed a resolution which suggested that the Department should reconsider that matter at the time before these teachers were trained.  I would like to say just this &mdash;that I doubt if the standard of education which these teachers had was adequate to enable them in a short period of time to become suitable teachers of cultural subjects in the vocational schools.  I think that perhaps the former Minister for Education was not to blame&mdash;it is a case of one trying something and one may find by experience that it is not quite as good as one hoped it would be.  I think this might be found to apply to these particular teachers who were trained in that way.  The system had been found very satisfactory for the teachers of woodwork and for teachers, some years ago, of domestic economy.  I am just doubtful as to its merits in this particular regard.  Perhaps it is part of the major problem referred to by Deputy Cunningham some time earlier <Col N="298" /> this morning of having qualified teachers in national schools.  It may be another facet of that problem&mdash;the difficulty of recruiting suitable people.</P>
      <P>The other point to which I would like to refer is the question of the standard of expression in the English language brought about by the training of children in our primary schools at present.  There seems to me to be an appeal running through the speeches in the House this morning for a return to greater accuracy, to the development of a system which would lead to precision of knowledge.  In that regard, I was reminded of a group of people who represented this country in the British House of Commons and who were said at the time to come up from the national schools in West Cork full of self-confidence and positive knowledge. I think the age in which we live with its development of knowledge in different directions has had the effect of scattering knowledge rather than making for precision, but I mention the matter just to give my own experience in a limited way.</P>
      <P>During a period of about three years now, I have examined each year some hundreds of examination papers of students in the National University. Owing to the manner in which I had been conditioned by this criticism which I heard I had perhaps expected a rather low standard.  In actual fact I found the standard of expression with very few exceptions was exceptionally good.  I can be more precise on a definite point.  Despite that experience I met only one or two instances of people who could not spell.  That may be attributable to the manner in which the matriculation examiners had done their work.  But that is a fact, that I met only two, and as we all know there are certain people who cannot learn to spell even if they were to spend their whole time at it.  I think, therefore, we might be inclined to exaggerate the deficiency in our national schools in the manner in which syntax and English grammar are taught.  These are the two points which I wish to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Seosamh Ó Cinnéide</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá ceist amháin agam le cur ar an Aire. Baineann sé le ceard-oideachais.  I <Col N="299" /> think it is time that there was a new approach in the State to the finances of vocational education.  Vocational education in latter years has spread very rapidly.  A number of schools have been erected in various towns in the provinces and in smaller towns, and the demand is greater each year. Under our system of vocational education handed down from the British time when it was known as technical education, it was centred primarily in the cities and towns particularly in Dublin and Cork and the cost was borne by the State in the cities.  The greater portion of the cost I think, in Cork&mdash;and I make this statement subject to correction&mdash;in Cork City two-thirds if not three-fourths of the cost of education was borne by the State and a similar proportion for Dublin City, where as in the country only 50 per cent. of the cost&mdash;capital and running expenses&mdash;was borne by the State.  It is high time now that there was a new examination of the whole matter.</P>
      <P>The argument was put up at the time that people from the rural parts sent their children into places like Dublin and Cork but that no longer obtains now even in a small county like my own where we had only two centres, Athlone and Mullingar.  There is a different picture to-day and you have several vocational schools all over the county.  The point I was making is not exactly applicable there; I only give it as an illustration of the way vocational education has been made available in centres all over rural Ireland.  I do not see why the rural taxpayer should be made to bear 50 per cent. of the capital as well as the running costs of vocational education whilst in the City of Dublin most of the cost is borne by the State and in Dublin, of course, because of its central position and facilities the scope of vocational education is much greater.  I am putting this case here in the House for consideration by the Minister and by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to make is about primary education&mdash;the upkeep of the schools.  I would like to say this, that no matter what schools the Department may build, no matter <Col N="300" /> what grants for the erection of primary schools the Government may give, unless there is a civic spirit in the rural areas to protect and maintain these schools the money is going to loss.  I have seen in the area where I was born and reared a national school that was erected in the year 1848 which is in splendid condition because of the care that was given to it, whilst I saw a school in the Kerry Gaeltacht erected in the seventies and through pure neglect it looked in a terrible condition, with windows broken and a bit of cardboard stuck in them, doors not mended, and various other things That is only indicative of many schools where no care is given.  The Minister may sign sanctions for the erection of ten, 20 or 30 modern schools, but unless there is a civic spirit in every part of Ireland to maintain those schools and keep them in proper condition it is in vain that we build them.  I am not blaming anybody for that.  We are all responsible, but we should all endeavour that when a public building is put up at the expense of the State something should be done to maintain it in proper condition.</P>
    <P>Those are the two points I want to make on this Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather frightened by the suggestion that in some future discussion on the Estimate for Education the Deputies of the House would be invited to speak as parents.  I feel that if such an invitation was rather widely responded to I would have to ask Deputy Moylan to come over here for a bit with his rather particular sense of humour, his fertile imagination and his command of language; and the very thought that has been suggested to my mind by that suggestion makes me all the more forgiving to Deputy Cunningham and perhaps Deputy Ormonde, who, I thought, might have given a little more contribution from the purely pedagogic side of things.  I will completely excuse them for not going further in that particular direction because I think we must agree that when we take some of the things that have been said by Deputy Moylan on this matter he brought it back to a little bit of <Col N="301" /> reality, that what we are most concerned with here is seeing that an adequate amount of money is provided, that it is provided for application in particular ways for a service where there is certainly a division of responsibilities. The main thing, I think, we have to get out of the discussion on the Estimate for Education is a picture of what are the various functional bodies that are engaged in the work of education in the country and how they are provided for so that each of them may be invited and encouraged to discharge their own particular function.</P>
      <P>I welcome particularly Deputy Moylan's reference to the staff of the Department of Education.  I have repeatedly emphasised that you have in the Department of Education members of the staff who are as devoted to their work as any of those who, in religion, are devoting their lives to education.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moylan truly points out that not enough money is spent on the educational side of the work in Ireland, but even when we speak in terms like that a look back over the schedule of the net audited expenditure on public services given in the schedule attached to the Estimates circulated this year shows you how quickly the expenditure on educational services of the country is increasing. It shows that when we take the audited expenditure for 1945/46, which in primary education was £4,000,000 odd, the figure is now £8,262,000.  On secondary education, which was £594,000 in 1945/46, it is now £1,689,000 and on technical instruction, which was £408,000 in 1945/ 46, it is now £1,016,000.  You have the situation there in which there was an expenditure of £5,000,000 in 1945/46 and there is going to be an estimated expenditure in the current year of £11,000,000.  That shows how increasingly money is being brought to the service of our educational services, and from the discussions that have taken place here everybody will understand how much more has to be provided if the services are to be made for many of the needs that have been stressed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being so, I feel that it is terribly <Col N="302" /> important that our discussions here should help to bring out what are the functions of the Department of Education, of the teachers and of the managers, so that each of these functional groups will have their prestige established and will be encouraged to devote themselves to what their proper responsibilities and proper work are and that in so far as they are remunerated for their services their remuneration will be adequate.</P>
    <P>I indicated in my statement that I expected very shortly to receive the report of the Council of Education.  It may be recalled that when I set up the Council of Education originally I indicated to the council if not to the Dáil that prior to my original entry into the Department of Education in February, 1948, there had been an examination of the general educational services in the country, particularly at the primary level, and that a departmental committee had reported on where it thought primary education should stop and the type of bifurcation along practical educational and academic education that might take place after that. The departmental committee examination of the situation made certain recommendations and outlined the very considerable cost at which these developments would take place.</P>
    <P>When the Council of Education was set up I asked them particularly to report on (1) the functions of the primary school, and (2) waiting for some further consideration as to what particular age the primary school might end at, I asked them to report on what should be the curriculum to be pursued in the primary schools I think up to ten years of age.  I expect that the report will be in my hands within a week.  I will see that there will be no delay in getting that report immediately into the hands of the printers, so that any delay in the matter will arise solely out of the printing of the report.  It will be, I hope, printed in parallel pages in English and in Irish and nothing in relation to the translation of the report into Irish will cause any delay either.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of matters which have been discussed here can better be <Col N="303" /> discussed in the light of the recommendations and the comments that will be made in that report.  The report will, I understand, contain a rather lengthy review of the development of Irish educational institutions while dealing effectively with the matters that were put before it.  I hope that with the setting up of the Council of Education and the publication of its first report, some of these matters that have been discussed here will be brought into greater perspective with regard to one another and that we will be able to see that the finances that are provided for education will be suitably and effectively allocated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham rather suggested that more financial attention was being paid to vocational and to secondary education than is paid to primary education.  I do not know exactly how his calculations were made but at any rate such questions as these, I take it, will arise in the discussions which I hope the issue of the report of the Council of Education will initiate in the country.</P>
    <P>On the various questions that have been raised here a small comment can perhaps be made, although I hope the House will excuse me for not going into any great detail with regard to them, having only just gone back into the Department.</P>
    <P>On the question of Irish and Irish spelling, I probably would agree with Deputy Cunningham that I would stand for a lot of purity in the use of Irish words but there is inevitably a development that has to take place and the Irish language has to absorb some other elements outside in extending its range.  I think that the Department of Education has perhaps been a little too interfered with or perhaps a little too much ignored in the matter of standards of Irish spelling and standards of Irish grammar and such things.  I would be looking for the support of every Deputy and everybody interested in Irish in bringing about a situation in which the Department of Education will be regarded as the Department which least of all should be ignored in these matters and as the Department where there should <Col N="304" /> be centred the greatest authority in either advising or approving of standards of Irish spelling and standards of Irish grammar.  I think I can assure Deputies who are interested in these matters and these standards that the Department of Education will be given its rightful place in these matters.</P>
    <P>I know that there are further matters that require to be decided but I see no reason why such standardisation and such simplification as may be necessary could not be harmoniously and effectively brought about.  Very considerable progress has been made. A considerable amount of progress was made by the most effective users and the most effective propagandists of modern Irish, even before the Irish State was set up.</P>
    <P>I remember Father O'Leary, when he came to Dublin, about 1907, to receive the Freedom of the City, down at the City Hall, describing how he began simplifying Irish, when he began to write in Irish, as he did in such an effective way.  He spoke of the long spellings and the long endings and the long middles and he said, with regard to the way he started to improve the spelling: &ldquo;Do thosnuíos ar na cinn agus na h-earbaill a bhaint díobh agus ar na boilg do ghearradh asta&rdquo;&mdash;he began cutting the heads and the tails off the words and cutting the bellies out of them.  I do not think that those who have been changing Irish spellings in recent years can be charged with going as far as that but at any rate it shows that for the purpose of making Irish effective and useful for modern use a certain amount of attention had to be given to Irish spelling and a certain amount of attention had to be given to Irish Grammar.  I plead that everyone will understand that we do not want these matters dealt with without reference and without the approval of the Department of Education that has to deal so much with the use of Irish in the schools without their being consulted.</P>
    <P>The question of the curriculum and cramming and the primary certificate has been criticised here.  I do not know that there can be very much cramming for the primary certificate <Col N="305" /> and I would hesitate very much in thinking that children who attend the primary school are not entitled to receive the primary certificate indicating that they had attained a particular proficiency in the primary school.  More and more, it may be looked for by employers.</P>
    <P>The general question of the shortage of teachers both with regard to vocational and primary schools has been referred to here.  Certain steps are being taken to deal with that particular position.  It is a position that has obtained for too long a time.  If there is a shortage of teachers, particularly on the primary school side, one of the reasons, perhaps, is that the Department of Education and those who were shouldering ministerial responsibility for it in recent years were not able to get the Department of Finance to understand how necessary it was, both in the avoidance of problems in future and the carrying on of the work of the day, to have more adequate provision made for the training of primary teachers.  I would like to assure those interested in the matter that the shortage of primary teachers at the present time is not due to any lack of candidates desiring to enter the training colleges.  It is entirely due to the fact that there was not a sufficient number of places in the training colleges for their training. Beginning this year, I have indicated that there will be places for 50 or 60 additional entrants into the training college for women annually which will turn out from 50 to 60 additional teachers every year from 1956 onwards.</P>
    <P>Other steps are being examined at the moment and are under consideration with a view to dealing with the shortage of primary teachers but I do not consider in relation to that the withdrawal of the marriage ban.</P>
    <P>On the vocational education side, I appreciate what Deputy Moylan said with regard to Irish and the continuation courses as being the shop window of the vocational system.  It might appear to many that it was extraordinary that he would make that statement but I agree with him if the interpretation of the statement is that <Col N="306" /> except we have a sense of culture in the country, except we have graciousness and manners, except we have people who, after their toil in the fields or in factory can show themselves to be cultured, educated people, our educational policy is not bringing out the best in our people.</P>
    <P>The vocational system, with its contacts particularly with rural Ireland, seems to me to be exerting a vital influence in emphasising the importance of education.  In the various bodies that have arisen in the country, such as Macra na Feirme, Muintir na Tíre and the Irish Countrywomen's Association, you have organisations of a voluntary kind arising over the natural economic work of the country, organising themselves for educational purposes in relation to that work and stretching out their hands to the educational machinery set up under the vocational education scheme, bringing life and reality into the vocational scheme throughout the country.  I find the work that is being done on the periphery of our vocational system has the greatest possible influence and bearing on the perfecting of our educational processes.  It will vitally affect both the realism and the effectiveness of the work that is being done in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>On the question of the status and dignity of teachers, we shall have a better chance of achieving in the minds of the teachers a greater sense that they are being given their proper status and dignity when we have had a little more time to review our educational system in the broadest possible way.  As Deputy Moylan pointed out, there is a lot more than primary education involved in the Estimate we are discussing here and it is only when we have a review of our whole educational system that we can see the importance of primary education.</P>
    <P>The question of parity has been raised here without any clear idea of what is meant by parity as a word or parity as a policy.  I would plead for an understanding that you would stop all your educational processes if you decided that all teachers should be turned out with the same basic training <Col N="307" /> and the same basic qualifications. Deputy the Lord Mayor of Dublin would do without the present training colleges for national teachers.  I consider that the present training colleges for national teachers are the most valuable educational institutions there are in the country.  If anybody wishes to examine the results on the secondary education side, in regard to children who had the benefit of getting their primary education in primary schools as against those who got their primary education in a junior school other than an ordinary national or primary school, he would see how much more effective a foundation is apparently laid in the ordinary primary school than in other types of junior schools.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the wideness of the programme in national schools and the necessity for concentrating in such a way that the children will &ldquo;know what they know&rdquo;.  Whatever may be the defects in the primary school or in the wideness of the programme, there is ample evidence that the foundation laid in the ordinary primary school is a very effective foundation indeed upon which to graft the secondary education given in the secondary schools.  So that when we come to deal with the question of party, it would be a help to know what it means.  In so far as it means fairness and the equitable payment of the primary teachers, then I want to repeat, as I said in my opening statement, that one of the first things I did on going back into the Department was to have intimated to the Irish National Teachers' Organisation that I desired forthwith an agreement with regard to how a scheme of conciliation and arbitration could be come to and to have a scheme of that particular kind restored forthwith.</P>
    <P>I feel that with machinery of that kind available to the teachers to see that matters affecting their payment can be satisfactorily decided, then the teachers will be able to concentrate a little bit more systematically on what I consider at any rate is the function that is really theirs, that is, the question of pedagogic practice and pedagogic technique generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> I feel that it would not be necessary to invite Deputies to discuss their experience here as parents if we had a little more systematic examination of the methods of teaching along what might be called clinical lines with regard to pedagogic practice and theory.  There is a wide opening there.  I do not think that any other group of people in the country can take the place of teachers and provide from their experience, advice and guidance a decision on the manner in which the teaching of various subjects should be done in the schools and on how the impact of the teaching of these subjects on the character of the children in their general preparation for after life can best be achieved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy raised the question of the financing of vocational schools. I do not think that anybody could seriously urge to-day that with the widespread development of vocational education throughout the country, the State should be asked to bear the cost of that.  At one moment Deputy Kennedy spoke of the necessity for a local civic spirit in maintaining the schools that are there on the primary side.  I think the same type of thing is necessary in regard to vocational schools, not only in regard to their maintenance but to seeing that when local people require an extension of vocational education, that some amount of the costs should be borne by the locality.</P>
    <P>It may be claimed that if local bodies are asked to pay fifty-fifty, special favour should not be shown to Dublin.  I should like to say in regard to that that I am filled with admiration of the work of the vocational education committee in the City of Dublin and the readiness with which they and the Corporation in Dublin undertook the very big expense that has been associated with the rather remarkable development of the vocational school in the City of Dublin.  I remember a time when the only vocational school here in Dublin was that of Kevin Street.  Then Bolton Street came along about 1911.</P>
    <P>Now with the spread of the city and with some of the questions in mind <Col N="309" /> which Deputy Alfred Byrne raised to-day, the vocational education committee of the City of Dublin has equipped the city and its various outlying districts with vocational schools and continuation schools that are rendering very great service, not only to the City of Dublin but to the country as a whole.  The question which Deputy Byrne raised was that of the transfer of population from the centre of the city where formerly thickly populated areas have been cleared through housing development and the people housed on the outskirts of the city.</P>
    <P>Three or four years ago there was established a joint consultative committee representing the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, the Corporation of Dublin and the Department of Education, with a view to looking ahead and seeing that where housing development was contemplated steps would be taken at the earliest possible moment by the various educational authorities to get their sites and have the schools built so as to reduce the inconvenience to parents.  There has been a carefully organised bus system to take children from the new residential districts to their old schools or to others some distance away from the new housing schemes.  I admit it has been a matter of expense&mdash;I think 1d. per child is charged for the journeys. The committee has been working for the past four years and is continuing its work on the steps that require to be taken to build new schools in the City of Dublin.  Very considerable progress has been made in that way.  We should be grateful to the ecclesiastical authorities who have been able to go ahead with their work so quickly and who have had to provide very considerable sums of money for the building of new schools.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne asked that those authorities should not have to pay for the sites of their schools.  There is a very big question of principle involved in that for the ecclesiastical authorities, and I do not think there is any way by which the municipality or the State could undertake that charge, or that the ecclesiastical authorities would agree to be dependent on the <Col N="310" /> State or the local authority for the provision of sites.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles raised questions in regard to a proposed new vocational school in Oldcastle.  That is a matter I will have to look into and I hope it will be possible to come to an understanding with all concerned.</P>

      <P>Subject to your concurrence, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Votes 58, External Affairs, and 59, International Co-operation, together.</P>
      <P>In presenting these Estimates I should make it clear that I have not had an opportunity since I took up office of examining all the departmental activities which they cover.  I cannot, therefore, give the House all the details usually presented at this time.</P>
      <P>The main Estimate for the Department, as Deputies will see, shows a net reduction of £19,270 on that of last year.  Details of the various increases and decreases are given in the printed volume.  A reorganisation of the Department's staff has resulted in decreases in expenditure on both staff sub-heads, notwithstanding the increase in the Civil Service salary award.  Other decreases and an increase on sub-head A (3) are due to recent expenditure trends.</P>
      <P>Since the External Affairs Estimate was last before the House there has been no change in the number of missions abroad.  Consequently, our offices abroad now number 7 embassies, 8 legations, 1 consulategeneral, 3 consulates and 7 honorary consulates.  There has been no change in the number of foreign missions established in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Passport, visa, estate and other consular work was carried on as usual <Col N="313" /> by the Department at home and by the consular offices abroad.  No appreciable change occurred in the volume of this work in 1953-54 compared to the previous year.  During the past year the Department has carried on its usual information and cultural activities.</P>
    <P>In regard to international co-operation, Deputies are, no doubt, aware that the Estimate covers the expenses arising out of Ireland's membership of the Council of Europe and of the O.E.E.C.  The total amount of the Estimate is £33,200, representing a net decrease of £6,600 on the provision made last year.  Details of the various decreases under the different sub-heads are shown in the printed volume.</P>
    <P>The provision in respect of this country's contribution to the expenses of the Council of Europe is the same as last year's, while the provision in respect of travelling and incidental expenses shows a decrease of £300 on last year's figure.  So far as the council is concerned, we shall continue to co-operate with other members with a view to achieving the greatest degree of unity possible within the framework of its statute.</P>
    <P>The O.E.E.C. maintains a vigorous existence and Ireland has continued to play its full part therein.  The amount required for our contribution to this organisation is related to actual expenditure incurred in the year 1953-54 and shows a reduction on last year's provision.  There is no change in the provision for travelling and incidental expenses in connection with the organisation as no reduction is expected in the number of meetings requiring the attendance of delegates from Dublin.</P>
    <P>Provision is made this year for a contribution of £5,000, as against £10,000, towards the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund.  As the house has previously been informed, this fund is used to finance a long-term programme of child health projects in the economically less developed areas of the world, carried on in close collaboration with the World Health Organisation and <Col N="314" /> the Food and Agriculture Organisation, of both of which Ireland is a member.  A voluntary governmental contribution of this nature results in the provision of aid to children greatly in excess of the amount of the contribution, as it is equalled, in goods or in cash by the receiving country, and the United States generously donates a further one-third of the total value of the other contributions.  It will be arranged that, as before, the contribution will be spent on the purchase of goods in this country.</P>
    <P>A commitment has been entered into with the United Nations for payment of a contribution of £5,000 towards their expanded technical assistance programme.  Provision for contribution was made in the Estimate as originally drafted but was inadvertently struck out when the Estimates were being examined.  It will be necessary, therefore, to take a Supplementary Estimate on this Vote later in the year.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,511,600 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for the Defence Forces (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, and for certain administrative expenses in connection therewith; for certain expenses under the <Col N="315" /> Offences against the State Acts 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946 (No. 21 of 1939 and No. 28 of 1946); for expenses in connection with the issue of medals, etc.; for expenses of the Bureau of Military History; and for a Grant-in-Aid of the Irish Red Cross Society (No. 32 of 1938).</P>
    <P>I should like to say, in introducing this Estimate, that it was prepared by my predecessor in office.  The gross Estimate for 1954/1955 is £8,443,772, and the net Estimate, after anticipated Appropriations-in-Aid have been deducted, is £8,267,300.  This represents an increase of £382,380 on the original net Estimate for 1953/1954, but account must be taken of the sum of £323,380 provided in respect of last year from the Vote for Increases in Remuneration.  In the light of that sum, the net increase is £59,000.  As the previous Minister for Finance indicated in his Budget statement, however, it has already been decided that the net provision of £1,800,000 in sub-head P for defensive equipment should be taken to be £1,000,000 only, or a reduction in that sub-head of £800,000.</P>
    <P>I may, perhaps, deal first with the provision for the pay, allowances and maintenance of the members of the permanent force.  This provision is spread over a number of sub-heads, and it totals £4,215,255 or almost 50 per cent. of the entire gross Estimate. As has been customary, the Estimate is framed on the basis of the full peace establishment, which is 1,273 officers and 11,542 other ranks, with appropriate deductions in respect of the numbers by which the actual strength is likely to be below establishments during the year.  At present, the officer strength is 113 below establishments. Twenty-four cadets are to be commissioned this year; a further 42 are in training and 42 are to be recruited. As regards other ranks, the Estimate, after the deductions which I have mentioned, covers an average strength of 9,500 over the year.</P>
    <P>The Estimate also contains substantial <Col N="316" /> provision for the pay, allowances and maintenance of the Reserve. The provision under these headings for the First Line Reserve amounts to £77,219.  This is actually an increase of about £7,000 on last year's figure, but this is largely attributable to higher rates of pay, as the numbers provided for&mdash;3,279&mdash;are somewhat lower than last year's, which was 3,304. The provision for the Second Line Reserve, which consists of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muiri, amounts to £273,800.  The corresponding provision last year was £198,380.  Here again, the increased rates of pay are largely responsible for the increase.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-head P, which relates to defensive equipment, the net provision is, as I have already mentioned, to be regarded as £1,000,000. The actual commitments for this year, which will have to be met, amount to £685,087.  I am considering the question of the extent to which the balance of the £1,000,000 should be expended this year.</P>
    <P>The gross estimated requirement for civil defence, as shown in sub-head P (1) is £112,658.  As it is anticipated that all the equipment ordered may not be available within the year, a deduction of £50,000 has been made, leaving the net provision at £62,658.</P>
    <P>Since the setting up of the Civil Defence School, some 150 instructors have been trained for the purpose of imparting instruction to the nucleus of the local civil defence organisation. Orders have been placed for a considerable quantity of the equipment provided for in the Estimates.  It is expected that the bulk of this equipment will be issued to local authorities this year, thus enabling local training to commence.  The principal items of equipment provided for are six rescue training sets, one in each of six important centres, for the purpose of teaching rescue technique, and specially constructed rescue vehicles with the necessary equipment for training and, should the need arise, operational purposes.  Provision is also made for grants to local authorities towards the expenditure involved for civil defence officers, local training of recruits, etc. <Col N="317" /> Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>

A recommendation by the housing committee in regard to rent adjustments in the case of blind pensioners was made on 22nd December, 1952.  The manager indicated that he was putting proposal (1) into operation, but that before taking any action in regard to (2) and (3) he would like to have the views of the Department.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably unnecessary for me to refer to all the sub-heads of the Estimate, but, on the precedent of previous years, I will comment on those which show an appreciable variation from last year's provision.  The increase of £66.558 in sub-head A&mdash;Pay&mdash;is due entirely to the increased rates of pay; <Col N="326" /> actually, the net numbers provided for are lower than they were last year. The increase of £3,000 in sub-head A (1)&mdash;Military Educational Courses Abroad&mdash;is due to the fact that the opportunities for such courses are likely to be greater this year.  Sub-head B&mdash;Marriage Allowance&mdash;shows an increase, having regard to the amount made available last year for the Vote for Increases in Remuneration, the actual increase is £27,330. There are two main reasons for this increase.  The first is that a larger number of non-commissioned officers and men is expected to be eligible for marriage allowance this year.  The second is that deductions in respect of the occupation of married quarters are now lower than they have been formerly.  Up to recently, fuel was supplied to occupants of married quarters.  That practice has now been discontinued and the charges for the occupation of quarters have been reduced.</P>
      <P>I may take together sub-head C&mdash; Pay of Civilians attached to Units&mdash; and sub-head S&mdash;Barrack Maintenance and New Works, each of which shows a very substantial increase.  The increase in each case is largely attributable to an expansion in the building and construction programme of the Corps of Engineers.  Most of the military barracks are old and quite unsuitable by modern standards.  Much of the accommodation is in the poorest condition and hopelessly uneconomic to maintain.  An effort is being made to provide suitable living accommodation and amenities for personnel and to provide additional storage and other accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With such a backlag of essential work to be undertaken and having regard to the unemployment position last year, it was natural to look to the Army to undertake schemes which would serve a double purpose.  A number of major works, including the provision of more than 80 houses for soldiers at Blackhorse Avenue, Dublin, are on hands.  Three of these&mdash;an ordnance store at Cork, a gymnasium at Galway, and certain works at Naas Barracks&mdash;were to have been carried out by the Office of Public Works, but have been transferred, since the preparation <Col N="327" /> of the Estimate, to the Corps of Engineers as the Office of Public Works saw no possibility of being able to make an early commencement on them.  They are, therefore, not covered by the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E&mdash;Pay of Officers of the Medical Corps etc.&mdash;shows an increase of £3,776 over last year's Estimate, but against that must be offset an amount of £3,745 recovered last year from the Vote for Increases in Remuneration in respect of the sub-head. The increases in sub-head G&mdash;Subsistence and Other Allowances&mdash;and H &mdash;Transport of Troops&mdash;are caused principally by increased rates of subsistance and car allowances and increased rail and bus fares.  The increase of £4,528 in sub-head L&mdash;Petrol and Oils&mdash;arises mainly from additional quantities of aviation spirit required in connection with the Air Corps short service pilot training scheme and the additional use of oils, grease, etc., in connection with the increased activities of the Corps of Engineers.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £20,554 in sub-head O&mdash;General Stores.  As will be seen from the details of the sub-head, the principal increases are in signal equipment, camp equipment and workshop equipment.  The increase under the heading of signal equipment arises from the necessity to provide maintenance spares for antiaircraft radar sets delivered last year and from the generally increased cost of maintenance of the considerable quantities of signal equipment now held in the Army.  One of the principal factors in the increase under the heading of camp equipment is the replacement of 100,000 sandbags sent to England for the relief of flooding last year.  The increase in workshop equipment is due to the necessity to replace a large quantity of tools and equipment which has been unserviceable through fair wear and tear.</P>
    <P>Sub-head P (2)&mdash;Naval Service&mdash; which shows an increase of £78,320, contains provisions, under the heading of capital expenditure, for a sum of £25,000, the initial instalment on a <Col N="328" /> small store and training ship which is estimated to cost £152,000.  This will replace a vessel which was sold for scrap purposes a few years ago.  The Naval Service does not, at present, possess a vessel suitable for the conveyance of stores, ammunition, etc. There is also a provision of £92,000 in respect of two seaward defence boats, required for training personnel in harbour defence duties.  These vessels will be of the motor fishing vessel type, suitably adapted and equipped. They will also be used for the general training of naval personnel, including the Slua Muiri.  Both the stores ship and the seaward defence boats would have a limited usefulness for fishing protection duties in addition to their primary functions.</P>
    <P>The provision under the heading of maintenance includes a sum of £75,000 as an instalment of the cost of the major overhaul of one corvette.  The cost will be higher, but this will not be known until a survey has been carried out.  While well maintained by us, none of the corvettes has had a major overhaul since being built.  The work is, therefore, long overdue and, in future years, it will be necessary to deal with the other two corvettes.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the replacement of the main armament of two of the corvettes and to increase the stock of smaller weapons.  It is not expected, however, that the full cost will fall to be met this year.</P>
    <P>In sub-head Q&mdash;Engineer Stores&mdash; there is an increase of £2,127.  Under the heading of technical and instructional stores, provision is made for the expenditure of £31,100, an increase of £22,200 over the previous year's figure. The items under this heading are mainly required for the training of personnel in anti-tank mining and the laying of minefields, as well as for the general demolition training of the Corps of Engineers.  Military bomb disposal equipment is also to be purchased at an estimated cost of £4,500. A deduction of £23,000 has been made in respect of stores ordered but not expected to be delivered during the year.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for sub-head R&mdash;Fuel, Light, etc.&mdash;has increased by £4,750. <Col N="329" /> The provision made for fuel is based on actual requirements.  It is proposed to continue using some of the reserve stocks of coal at the Curragh and in the Southern and Western Commands.  There are no reserve stocks in the Eastern Command.</P>
    <P>The increase in sub-head X&mdash;Incidental Expenses &mdash; is due almost entirely to provision made for advertising in connection with recruiting. A sum of £25,300 has been included under that heading, as compared with £15,000 last year.  The provision of £4,330 in respect of books, periodicals and manuals is normal, but is for the first time included in this sub-head.  It was previously scattered over a number of sub-heads.</P>
    <P>Sub-head X (1)&mdash;Telegrams and Telephones&mdash;is increased by £6,860, principally because of increased rates of charge.  As regards sub-head X (3)&mdash; Irish Red Cross Society (Grant-in- Aid)&mdash;there is an increase of £5,900. It has been found necessary to increase the contribution towards the normal activities of the society by £5,000, bringing the amount to £10,000.  The additional £900 is intended to enable the society to pay two years' contributions to the International Committee of the Red Cross.</P>
    <P>As regards sub-head Y&mdash;Office of the Minister for Defence: Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;an increase of £17,821 is shown as compared with last year. The sum of £17,690, transferred from the Vote for Increases in Remuneration, must, however, be added to last year's figure, so that there is really no change.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, also refer to substantial decreases which have occurred in some of the sub-heads.  The first particularly large reduction is in sub-head K&mdash;Provisions and Allowances in Lieu&mdash;the amount of the reduction being £68,819.  This year's Estimate, as I mentioned earlier, provides for an actual average strength of 9,500 other ranks in the combined services over the year.  That is considerably less than the number provided for last year and is the chief factor in the decrease.</P>
    <P>While, in the case of sub-head M&mdash; Clothing and Equipment&mdash;there is a <Col N="330" /> reduction of £93,238, it will be seen, in particular, that under the heading of uniform clothing for non-commissioned officers and men, there is an increase of £151,619.  This is partly due to the fact that last year's provision was inadequate and partly to the reduction in old stocks which in previous years were used to a substantial extent but are now almost exhausted. On the ground of economy, no provision has been made this year to increase the reserve stocks of uniforms. The provision of £28,250 under this heading is entirely required to meet the balance of contracts from last year.</P>
    <P>The considerable reduction of £27,900 in sub-head T&mdash;Military Lands &mdash;is caused by the fact that expenditure on last year's scale, when a large parcel of land at Baldonnel together with smaller parcels at Gormanston and Clonmel had to be paid for, will not arise this year.</P>
    <P>The saving of £9,602 in sub-head V &mdash;Barrack Services&mdash;results from a proposed curtailment of purchases of furniture, bedding, etc., while the reduction of £5,813 in sub-head W&mdash; Insurance&mdash;is due to the fact that the numbers provided for are not so great as last year.</P>
    <P>That completes my survey of the provisions of the Estimate for Defence.  I think it right to say, in conclusion, that from what I have seen since taking office, I am very satisfied with the discipline and morale of the Defence Forces.  It is my intention to carry out an inspection of all posts, establishments and units within the next 12 months.  I intend, in particular, to take a special interest in the F.C.A. and to do everything within my power to help it to be a most useful component of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's statement, I would like to paraphrase a statement which Deputy Lemass made on a former and very similar occasion when he said that he was handing over affairs in good order and condition.  I think I can claim that the Army in general has been handed over in good order and condition and I hope it will be retained in that state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would very much like to have had <Col N="331" /> the Minister giving the House some assurance that the policy of the last Government in respect to the Army, that is, in regard to recruitment, and to the securing of defensive equipment wherever and whenever it is possible to secure it, would be followed.  I think that when the Minister is concluding he should give the House some inkling in regard to the policy which he hopes to pursue.  The statement which he has just read out is a purely technical one in regard to the various affairs of the Defence Forces.  The Minister has little, if any, responsibility for the Estimate and because of that I do not propose to speak at any great length, but I do feel that the House is entitled to an assurance that that policy pursued by the former Government will be continued by this Government.  After all, the Defence Forces should not, in any circumstances, be the plaything of polititicians. There is a world situation existing at the present time which I do not think anyone will agree is a very healthy one, and while it is possible to a very great degree to secure equipment which was denied to us in the past, I hope that the policy of going after that particular type of equipment that suits the armed forces of this country should be pursued.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that he was encouraging the F.C.A.  It is a body that deserves every possible encouragement being as it is a purely voluntary force.  It is one means by which this nation can have at its disposal a readymade Reserve which unfortunately is not available as a result of recruitment to the Regular Army and the outflow from the Regular Army into that Reserve.  It was my ambition at all times to build up the Regular Army to the 12,500 which was the peace time strength of that Army. I was not successful in doing that.  At no time did we reach a figure very much in excess of 11,000 but the effort was always there.  Whatever reason there may be for the failure of the youth of this country to join the Defence Forces it cannot be ascribed to lack of desire to secure their services.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to the House <Col N="332" /> to know that more than 50 per cent. of the people who applied to become members of the Defence Forces had, for one reason or another, to be rejected.  That is a matter which should receive serious consideration from the health authorities of this nation.  I am not suggesting that the whole 50 per cent. of rejections was due entirely to what you might call general health reasons or to bad physical condition. There were various reasons which included sight, bad feet and so on. However, it would be worthy of the attention of some section of this community to see if anything can be done to have at least a fitter type of youth in the country than we have at the present moment.  I do not intend to dwell on the Estimate in view of the fact that the Minister has very little responsibility for it but I would again appeal to him to give an assurance to the House that he intends to pursue the policy which has been carried out over the past three years.</P>

All that had been done before I took over office and I could not stop these things even if I had wanted to.  I have only one anxiety and that is to make the Defence Forces effective for the purpose for which the people and the Government will want them, namely, to defend the country from whatever danger may threaten it from any side.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £982,940 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, No. 15 of 1937, No. 2 of 1941, No. 14 of 1943, No. 3 of 1946, Nos. 19 and <Col N="333" /> 28 of 1949 and No. 23 of 1953); Military Service Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 48 of 1924, No. 26 of 1932, No. 43 of 1934, No. 33 of 1938, No. 5 of 1944, Nos. 11 and 34 of 1945, Nos. 7 and 29 of 1949 and No. 5 of 1953); Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936, No. 9 of 1948, No. 30 of 1950, No. 27 of 1952 and No. 4 of 1953); Payments in respect of Compensation for Members of the Local Defence Force (No. 19 of 1946 and No. 15 of 1949); and for Sundry Contributions and Expenses in respect thereof, etc.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, of course, be aware that the main provisions in this Estimate cover service pensions under the Military Service Pensions Acts; wound and disability pensions, special allowances and dependents' allowances and gratuities under the Army Pensions Acts and service pensions and gratuities under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes in respect of service in the permanent force.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that the amount being provided in the Estimate shows a small decrease of approximately £7,000 on the provision made for the previous financial year.  This arises, not from any decrease in the amount of the annual commitment under the various statutory measures, which commitment continues to grow, but mainly from the fact that provision was made last year for arrears in respect of the increases granted under the Military Service Pensions (Amendment) Act, 1953, the Army Pensions Act, 1953, the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme, 1953, and the Connaught Rangers Pensions Act, 1953.</P>
    <P>The decreases which I have explained occur in sub-heads E, I, J, and M.  There are two sub-heads in which substantial increases are shown&mdash; namely, sub-head F, relating to dependents' allowances and gratuities, and sub-head O, relating to special allowances to persons who served in Easter Week, 1916, to persons awarded meedals and to persons granted pensions under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Acts.</P>
    <P>The increase of £13,094 under sub-head F arises largely from the <Col N="334" /> enhanced allowances payable under Part II of the Army Pensions Act, 1953.  This Part provides allowances at the rate of £250 per annum for widows, £180 per annum for parents and, in certain circumstances, £125 per annum for brothers and sisters of certain deceased persons who had pre-truce service and who gave their lives in the struggle of the 1916 to 1923 period.</P>
    <P>The increase under sub-head O, the sub-head which relates to the special allowances, is due to the necessity to provide for the new cases which it is thought will qualify for the payment of allowances during the present year. The commitment under this sub-head continues to increase regularly and it is not possible to foresee when, or at what figure, it will stabilise itself.  The other increases are relatively small. Those under sub-heads A and C arise from salary increments and also from salary increases which last year were met from the Vote for Increases in Remuneration; those under sub-heads G and H arise from the fact that the cost of the provision and replacement of surgical and medical appliances to pensioners has increased, as has also the cost of hospital treatment while those under sub-heads K and L are caused by the increasing expense involved in the travelling of applicants and witnesses attending for examination under the various Acts and also in having applicants for benefits under the Army Pensions Acts medically examined by outside medical practitioners and specialists, etc.</P>
    <P>The foregoing brief outline of the factors causing the increases and decreases in the different sub-heads will, I trust, be helpful to Deputies, and if any more detailed explanations should be required I shall endeavour to give them.</P>
    <P>It may be no harm if I mention, in particular, the question of military service pensions.  In round figures, about 20,500 fresh applications and petitions have been received since the enactment of the Military Pensions Act, 1949.  As at the 31st May last, the Board of Assessors and the Referee had reported on 15,462 of these&mdash;1,359 being favourable reports and 14,103 unfavourable.  That leaves approximately 5,000 cases to be <Col N="335" /> reported upon, not counting any additional fresh applications which come in as a result of the recent time extension authorised by my predecessor.  I propose to ask the Board of Assessors and the Referee to expedite the disposal of these cases as much as possible. I think it desirable that the cases still to be dealt with should have the same principles applied to them as those which have already been disposed of and I propose, therefore, to allow the present phase to be completed under the existing system.  I will then have an overall picture of the situation which will be of assistance to me in considering if anything further needs to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I only wish to make a few remarks on this Estimate. We have had from time to time statements, sometimes here and sometimes elsewhere, that justice is not being done to applicants applying for military service pensions.  We had this afternoon a suggestion that there was something in the nature of huggermugger in relation to notifications in respect of pensions.  I would like to put it on record that, as far as I am concerned, the Referee and the members of the board are men of the highest integrity.  During my time as Minister for Defence I have had to examine complaints of one kind or another.  On every occasion on which that examination has taken place I was fully satisfied with the conduct of the particular cases and fully satisfied that they were dealt with on their merits, and on their merits alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a recollection that the late Dr. O'Higgins, when introducing the 1949 Bill as Minister for Defence, gave as his estimate of the number of people likely to succeed under that measure as something in the region of 2,000.  That figure has been very nearly reached at the present time. The figures quoted by the Minister show that we are within striking distance of that particular estimate.  The estimate which the late Minister gave of the number likely to apply amounted to something in the region of 20,000.  That figure has been exceeded. I think that the volume of <Col N="336" /> disapproval in relation to the decisions of the board comes mainly from the class of applicant who applied under the 1949 Act.</P>
    <P>As a means once and for all of killing these mean innuendoes I would suggest that the Minister should have an inquiry into the conduct of the board. That inquiry should be a well-conducted legal inquiry, and I am certain that the decision of that inquiry would be such as to kill, once and for all, the suggestions which have been made inrelation to the decisions arrived at by the board.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to say at this stage.  The Minister has little, if any, responsibility for this Estimate and, therefore, it is unnecessary for me to discuss it at any great length.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring to the Minister's notice one or two cases of soldiers who had given practically maximum service to the Army and died rather unexpectedly.  Their widows claim that their deaths were due to something that happened to them during their period of service in the Army.  I am informed that one man got severe wettings while on manoeuvres and died.  The Department of Defence sent a letter to these widows containing phrases that were used by the British Government in the early days of the war to the effect that the death of the deceased was not caused by any action which took place in the Army and was not aggravated by any work done in the Army.  On these grounds, they refused to give to the widows the pensions which they thought they were entitled to.  I am asking the Minister is it right to send out a statement like that to a widow saying that her husband's death was not caused or aggravated by service in the Army.  I suggest that the position should be reversed, and that the onus should be on the Army authorities to prove that death was not caused by Army service instead of asking the widow to prove that it was, especially when they can produce evidence that things did happen in the Army to hasten the death of the soldier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are about half a dozen cases of this kind which took place in the <Col N="337" /> last year.  A reply of the kind to which I have referred was sent to the widow in each case.  I would ask the Minister to review these cases.  If death was aggravated by Army service, then the matter should be investigated.  If doctors differ, I think the widows should get the benefit of the doubt.</P>

      <P>In dealing with the cases referred to by Deputy Byrne, may I say that there is no provision in the Estimate dealing with cases of death arising from disease not attributable to service other than during the emergency?  I do not know why that is so.  I certainly propose to examine the matter.  I am aware that hardships have arisen.  I propose to find out what are the valid reasons which prevent a person being paid in war time and not being paid in peace time for the same thing.  It is rather peculiar.</P>

      <P>There is nothing in the Estimate at the moment dealing with this, but I will have the matter examined.</P>
      <P>On the question of military service pensions, there are two facts which arise out of Deputy Traynor's assertion. When the previous Government terminated or ended the granting of military service certificates in 1947, they said that every person who had service, and who was entitled to a certificate, had been granted one, that there could not be any more, that everybody was finished and that they were justified in winding up the board in 1947.  When that statement was made there were many people in the House who were inclined to agree that the numbers who had been granted certificates of service were higher than most people expected.  It now emerges that 1,600 odd have been granted certificates since, so that at least, on the face of it, a number of people were denied their rights prior to 1949.</P>

      <P>I am not getting away from anything.  I am stating what the Deputy, and his predecessors in the Fianna Fáil Government, said. It has since been found that a number of persons entitled to certificates did not get them.  Whether or not they are all entitled to them I do not know. That is another matter.  My predecessor as Minister for Defence, the late Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, said that he thought the number of people who were entitled would run to about the 2,000 mark.  He estimated that a certain number would apply, that a certain number, again, would be rejected, and that a certain number would qualify.  Deputy Traynor very naïvely sets out that almost 2,000 people have got what the late Deputy Dr. O'Higgins suggested they would get. I think, again, that nearly 2,000 wronged people got them.  I do not know that the Referee or the board will be one bit thankful to the Deputy for the suggestion that I should set up an inquiry into the operation of the Act by the Referee or the board for the purpose of killing rumours.</P>

      <P>I have spoken in this House and I have asserted that, as far as I was aware, the Referee and the board carried out their duties in an impartial manner.

      <P>How are you going to get over the problem, or how is anyone going to settle it?  In any event, I propose, at an early date, to have the whole picture made clear to me as to the total number who were rejected and of those who were granted certificates of service.  When I have that picture before me then I should like to have the board and the Referee dealing with as much expedition with the 4,000 or 5,000 cases that are now pending as they did with the 10,000 cases which were rejected in 1953/54.  Is anyone going to tell me that they dealt equitably with that number when their case is that they can only deal with six cases a day on the one hand, while on the other hand they were able to deal with 10,000 cases in a crack?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy allow me to finish?  When the all-over picture is made that they can deal with these 4,000 cases as quickly as they did with the others, I will know what the situation is.  I then propose to make a submission to the Government which I hope the Government will accept, so that we can end this question for all time, and so that these men will not only get fair play but will have the appearance of getting fair play without any question of partisanship or lack of appreciation of the services rendered by them, and so that the mean innuendoes to which the Deputy has referred will be eliminated for all time.  It is not easy to do that. On reflection, it may be said that all this was due to causes over which I have no control and for which, I suppose, the Deputy had no responsibility either.  The responsibility is on the time that we all lived through, in which the meanest possible interpretation was put upon the actions or services of many people of this country.  Let us hope that when this thing is finished and that when I <Col N="340" /> handle this situation in the particular way in which I think it should be handled that we will have got rid of all the nasty things that have been said from time to time.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's statement, it is obvious that he is not aware of the fact that there is contained in the Act a clause which makes it mandatory on the Referee to reject any case in which there is not <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  Therefore, it is not correct for the Minister to say that 10,000 cases were not given the examination that they should have been given, and when he talked about six cases per day I presume he is referring to six cases in which there was <i>prima facie</i> evidence and which the Referee must of necessity examine in a more minute form.  But there is contained in the Act a clause which makes it mandatory on the Referee, without any other consideration, to turn down applications for the want of <i>prima facie</i> evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be mandatory on the Referee and he has power to notify the applicant that it is his intention to turn down the case unless additional evidence is forthcoming. If I accepted the Deputy's statement that it was mandatory on him, it simply meant that the person who could write up a good case and initiate the claim&mdash;the good writer&mdash;was going to get through and the others would not.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,740,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of <Col N="341" /> payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 and 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 and 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1953; No. 45 of 1926; No. 14 of 1940 (secs. 30 and 31); No. 14 of 1942 (sec. 23); No. 17 of 1951; etc.), and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
    <P>In view of the very short time since I assumed office Deputies will, I know, not expect me to be adequately informed of the activities of the Department or to have examined its policies in any detail.  In presenting this Estimate, therefore, all I propose to do is to indicate how it compares with the Estimate for 1953/54, to give briefly an explanation of the variation in the amounts provided under the more important sub-heads, and then to give some account of the working of the various services during the past year and to indicate some of the Department's proposed activities for the coming year.</P>
    <P>The net Estimate for 1954/55 amounts to £7,340,000, being a gross total of £7,811,348 less Appropriations-in-Aid of £471,348.  The net provision represents a decrease of £34,891 on that for 1953/54.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that the 1953/54 provision included a sum of £371,560 which was actually provided for in the Vote for Increases in Remuneration and thus nominally transferred.  This amount should be divided up and added under the appropriate sub-heads in order to give the figures for 1953/54 which are properly comparable with the sub-head provisions for 1954/ 55.  The sub-heads affected and the proportions proper to be added in each case are:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The more substantial variations&mdash; those of £10,000 or more&mdash;occur on the following sub-heads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sub-heads A (1), A (2), A (3) and A (4)&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances:&mdash;The increase of £88,899 under these four sub-heads is mainly attributable to the fact that the amount provided in 1953/54 to meet the Civil Service pay award was less than required, to normal increments, to creation of posts, offset by savings on retirements and on suppressed posts.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (1)&mdash;Conveyance of Mails by Rail:&mdash;The increase of £43,000 is due to the increased cost of conveyance of letter mails and provision for increased payment for the carriage of parcel mails, the latter mainly due to anticipated additional traffic following upon the extension from 11 to 15 lbs., as from the 12th April last, of the maximum weight limit for parcels.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (5)&mdash;Conveyance of Mails by Air:&mdash;The decrease of £13,000 is due to a reduction in rates for transatlantic air transport and the higher provision which was required in 1953/54 for clearance of United States Post Office accounts in arrear, offset by increased conveyance rates on British Commonwealth air services.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (1)&mdash;Stores (other than engineering):&mdash; The decrease of £13,400 is due to a reduction in the number of vans due for replacement, offset by increased provision for mail bags.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (3) &mdash; Manufacture of Stamps:&mdash;The increase of £15,000 is for additional supplies of watermarked paper for postage stamps and for normal requirements of such paper for postal orders, old age pension and children's allowance books, which last year were met from reserve stocks, and for increased purchases of stamped stationery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> Sub-head I (1)&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances (Engineering):&mdash; The increase of £22,720 is mainly attributable to the fact that the provision for the Civil Service pay award in 1953/54 was less than required, to normal increments, to regrading of posts, offset by savings on retirements and reduced provision for Sunday duty and overtime.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K&mdash;Engineering Materials: &mdash;The decrease of £88,800 is due in the main to reduction in prices and to a reduction in the quantity of stores to be ordered because of an improved delivery position generally.</P>
    <P>Sub-head L (3)&mdash;Contract Work:&mdash; The decrease of £118,200 is mainly due to decreased provision for telephone renewal work, the amount for which in 1953/54 was abnormally high, due to renewal of some of the larger exchanges.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M&mdash;Telephone Capital Repayments:&mdash;Increase of £88,903.  Funds for the development of the telephone system are provided under the authority of the Telephone Capital Acts (1924 to 1951) which authorise the Minister for Finance to issue sums out of the Central Fund for this purpose. Repayment of these funds is made by means of terminable annuities extending over a period not exceeding 25 years.  In consultation with the Minister for Finance provision is made each year under sub-head M for the repayment of the instalments of principal and interest on the annuities created.  The increased provision in the sub-head is an indication of the continuing expansion of the telephone system.</P>
    <P>Sub-head T &mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid:&mdash;Increase £70,663, due to anticipated increased receipts from the sale of obsolete stores, from the Social Insurance and the Savings Bank Funds for administration expenses, and under other miscellaneous heads.</P>
    <P>As regards the postal services, mail services worked satisfactorily during the past year and traffic generally remained steady.  Air mail traffic, inward and outward, showed an upward trend.  A new business reply <Col N="344" /> service was introduced on the 1st July, 1953, and is being availed of to a wide extent by the business community throughout the country.  The weight limit in the inland and foreign parcel post was increased from 11 lb. to 15 lb. on 12th April, 1954.  This extension should be of particular benefit to business firms engaged in the export trade.</P>
    <P>On the 1st March, 1954, the special cheap postage facilities in the inland service for blind persons and in the service to and from Great Britain, which hitherto had been restricted to embossed papers and books, were extended to embrace a wide range of articles specially adapted for the use of the blind.</P>
    <P>The general reorganisation of postal services in rural areas was continued during the year and a daily frequency of delivery and a better standard of service were provided in the head office districts of An Uaimh, Ceanannus Mór, Dundalk, Monaghan, Cahir, Clonmel and part of Sligo.  Daily frequency was provided on 98 posts on which delivery was previously restricted. The reorganisation of postal services in the head office districts of Tuam, Bandon, Skibbereen, Killarney, Tralee, Castlerea and the remainder of Sligo will, it is hoped, be undertaken this year.</P>
    <P>Re-equipment of sorting offices with modern fittings was continued throughout the year and it is expected that all head offices will be supplied with these fittings before the end of 1954.</P>
    <P>Six new sub-offices were opened and money order and savings bank facilities were extended to 11 sub-offices.  A special postage stamp, in the 3d. and 1/3 denominations, was issued in September, 1953, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the death of Robert Emmet.  The stamp was printed in Ireland by the recess process.  A special postage stamp in the 3d. and 5d. denominations was issued on the 24th May, 1954, to commemorate the Marian Year.  This stamp also was printed in Ireland by the recess process.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made to issue a further special stamp in 1954, in the 2d. and 1s. 3d. denominations, <Col N="345" /> to commemorate Cardinal Newman's rectorship of the Catholic University of Ireland, the centenary of which is being celebrated this year.  This stamp will be printed in the letterpress process in the Stamping Branch of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The telegraph traffic continues to decline.  The total number of telegrams handled was 3,477,500 as compared with 3,548,500 during the previous year.</P>
    <P>As my predecessor announced last year during the progress through the House of the Telegraph Bill, 1953, a committee is considering the finances and working of the telegraph service in order to make recommendations on policy, rates of charge, organisation, etc., and on any other matters affecting the telegraph service.  The report of this committee is awaited.  In the meantime, however, the policy of abolishing morse telegraphy has proceeded. In the area roughly south of a line from Dublin to Ennis transmission by morse was replaced by teleprinter in six centres and by telephone at 28 other centres since April, 1953.  In this area there now remain only 12 offices still using morse transmission. It is expected that morse will be replaced by telephone at all but two or three of these this year. The cessation of morse in the other half of the country is held up primarily through lack of circuits. This difficulty will, however, be largely overcome on the completion of the new coaxial cable from Dublin to Sligo and Athlone to which reference will be made later.  During 1953 telegraph service was extended to 29 sub-post offices.</P>
    <P>New radio telephone equipment to replace the existing radio telegraph equipment serving the larger islands off the coast has been received and is being installed.  It is already in service to Inishmaan, Inishere, Tory, Gola and Owey Islands and it is hoped that it will be working before the end of the year to the eight other islands at present served by radio telegraph. Progress on these installations has been slower than was anticipated due primarily to the novel nature of the equipment.  A considerable amount of experimentation and testing is necessary <Col N="346" /> in each case in order to determine precisely the most suitable positions for the island and mainland terminals of the radio link.</P>
    <P>Expansion and improvement of the telephone service continued during 1953.  The number of trunk calls made represented an increase of 10.7 per cent. over the 1952 figure; local traffic increased by an estimated 3,000,000-odd calls to a total of over 80,000,000.</P>
    <P>Seven thousand six hundred and one new telephone lines were installed as compared with 7,234 in 1952.  The total number of waiting applications on the 31st December last was 3,250 representing a substantial reduction on the arrears of 5,000 odd on 31st December, 1952.</P>
    <P>In some exchange areas in Dublin where plant and cable conditions are particularly favourable it is now practicable to give service to new applicants with little delay.  The exceptionally heavy demand and connection rate in recent years, has, however, reduced the capacity of main underground cables in certain other areas in the city to a relatively narrow margin.  This is likely to be the principal bottleneck in the way of providing telephones speedily in Dublin for some time and may reduce appreciably the Dublin installation figures for the current year.  Major schemes for the laying of additional ducts and cable are already in hand or in various planning stages and are being pushed ahead as rapidly as the resources of the Department's engineering staff will permit.</P>
    <P>In the provinces the clearance of waiting applications has been proceeding apace, but applications involving an abnormal amount of construction work were deferred in favour of early completion of the rural call office scheme.  As the House is aware, this scheme has been receiving a substantial measure of priority.  Two hundred and twenty-five isolated post offices were provided with telephones in 1953 and of some 900 post offices originally scheduled for attention only 25 now remain without telephones.  The work required to provide the remaining call offices is being &ldquo;staggered&rdquo; over the remainder of this year to enable the engineers to dispose of their <Col N="347" /> resources to the best advantage and in particular to do more trunk work and to commence the clearance of long deferred applications involving abnormal work.</P>
    <P>During last year 53 telephone kiosks were provided.  There are at present over 200 in service in Dublin City and suburbs and approximately 250 in the provincial areas.  In general, all provincial towns with a population of 1,000 or over have now got kiosks.  The question of providing kiosks in towns with smaller populations is kept under continuous review.</P>
    <P>Certain improvements in the Telephone Directory were effected in the 1953 edition.  It is proposed to improve the directory further in the next issue. It will be in larger and clearer print and will be divided into two sections, one for Dublin City and County and the other for the rest of the telephone system.</P>
    <P>In Dublin a new automatic exchange linked with the Dublin automatic network was opened at Clondalkin (serving the Clondalkin and Tallaght areas).  Installation of an automatic exchange at Sutton (to serve the Sutton-Howth area) is proceeding and the exchange will be opened towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Operator trunk dialling, which was introduced between Dublin and Belfast in 1952, was extended last year to the cross-Channel route; Dublin operators now dial directly numbers in the London and Liverpool areas and in the reverse direction British operators dial Dublin numbers.  Last summer the number of cross-Channel circuits was substantially increased, and there is now a no-delay service to and from Great Britain.</P>
    <P>In the provinces a new auto-manual exchange was opened at Athlone last September.  At Nenagh, Muine Bheag, Tramore, Maynooth and Dunboyne manual exchanges were replaced by wholly automatic exchanges.  New auto-manual exchange buildings are in course of erection at Limerick, Drogheda and Mullingar.</P>
    <P>Switchboard equipment was extended during 1953 at 118 exchanges, <Col N="348" /> and new modern operating equipment installed at Galway, Sligo, Mallow, Killarney, Youghal and Tullamore.</P>
    <P>The trunk service was further improved by the addition of some 8,900 miles of trunk circuits to the telephone network and no-delay services were introduced on many routes including the Sligo-Letterkenny, Dublin-Ballina, Dublin-Claremorris and Dublin-Wexford routes.</P>
    <P>The proposed underground trunk cable from Dublin to Mullingar with branches to Athlone and Sligo has now passed from the planning to the actual working stage.  Trenching work commenced in April.  It is hoped to have some long-distance circuits working in this cable by the middle of next year and some circuits between intermediate exchanges earlier still.  When this cable is completed a backbone network of underground cables from the capital to the South, West and North, capable of easy expansion to meet any foreseeable traffic demands on the major trunk routes affected, will be available.</P>
    <P>It is planned to build about 1,800 miles of overhead physical circuits to shorter routes throughout the country where extra circuits are required.  Last year over 1,350 miles of new circuit were provided in this way.</P>
    <P>Continuous service was introduced at 13 exchanges where the hours of service were previously restricted; and the hours of service were extended by two hours at 188 small exchanges.  Over 96 per cent. of subscribers are now provided with 24-hour service.</P>
    <P>The Department's building programme is continuing to make good progress.  In the Dublin district, there are at present under construction automatic telephone exchange buildings at Foxrock and Whitehall and work on a major extension of Clontarf automatic telephone exchange has commenced. Premises for a new post office at South Anne Street, Dublin, have been acquired and the necessary adaptation works are in course of execution.</P>
    <P>Pending the erection of new permanent district sorting offices to serve the Dundrum/Churchtown and Crumlin/Walkinstown areas of Dublin, a temporary office has recently been provided <Col N="349" /> at Churchtown and it is hoped to provide a similar temporary office in Walkinstown in the near future.</P>
    <P>In the provinces, new post offices and/or telephone exchange buildings are under construction at Limerick, Drogheda, Kilrush, Rathluirc, Mullingar and Greystones, and financial provision has been made for the commencement of new buildings at Galway, Sligo, Naas, Cootehill, Athenry and Letterkenny.  Structural alterations providing extended accommodation are in progress at Ballina, Tralee, Monaghan and Cahir, and schemes for Kilkenny, Dundalk, Ennis, Carrick-on-Suir, Fermoy, Loughrea, Roscommon, Bray and Ballymote are well advanced.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in the detailed study of postal and customs requirements for the new Central Sorting Office in Dublin and a tentative lay-out plan for the building has recently been received from the architecht assigned to the work by the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The position of the Post Office Savings Bank continues to be satisfactory. Deposits rose from £13,323,000 in 1952 to £14,075,000 in 1953 and withdrawals fell from £10,961,000 to £10,815,000, a net surplus of £3,260,000 as compared with £2,362,000 for the previous year.  Interest earned during the year is estimated at £1,437,000 and the total amount standing to the credit of depositors on the 31st December, 1953, is approximately £61,767,000.</P>
    <P>Deposits during the year by the Trustee Savings Banks amounted to £980,500 and withdrawals to £462,000, an increase of £60,700 on deposits and a decrease of £237,700 on withdrawals. The balance to credit of the Trustees Savings Banks at the end of the year, including £258,000 for interest, is approximately £9,290,000.</P>
    <P>An appreciable amount was withdrawn by ordinary depositors and by the Trustee Savings Banks for reinvestment in 4½ per cent.  National Loan.</P>
    <P>The estimated combined balances, Post Office and Trustee Savings Banks, on the 31st December, 1953, amounted to £71,057,000 as compared <Col N="350" /> with £65,584,000 on the same date in 1952.</P>
    <P>In regard to saving certificates, business for the year showed a small decrease as compared with the previous year.  Receipts from sales amounted to £3,037,000, repayment of principal to £1,375,000 and interest to £517,000.  Corresponding figures for 1952 were £3,370,000, £1,576,000 and £638,000.  The decrease in sales was mainly due to the natural decline in purchases as compared with 1952, during which year the 5th issue, a very attractive one, was introduced.  The decrease in repayments was principally due to smaller investments by savings certificate holders in the 4½ per cent. National Loan than in the National Loan floated in 1952.</P>
    <P>The amount of principal due to investors at the end of the year stood at £16,935,000 compared with £15,272,000 at the end of 1952.</P>
    <P>Last year when speaking on the Estimate my predecessor dealt at length with the financial position of the Department.  He indicated that on a commercial account basis the working of the Department for the year 1953/54 was estimated to result in a deficit in excess of £700,000.  To meet this anticipated loss the former Government decided to increase postal, telephone and telegraph charges so that the Department should be self supporting.  Increased postal charges were accordingly introduced in May, 1953, increased telephone charges in July and October, and as already mentioned, the position regarding telegraph charges is being examined by a special committee. These increases would have enabled the Department to meet the anticipated deficit on the over-all working of the Department for 1953/54.  As the House is aware, however, increased pay was awarded to the Civil Service as from the 1st of April, 1953, and the cost of that increase to the Department for that year was £420,000. Despite this increased cost the deficit on the over-all working of the Department for the year is now estimated at £312,000 made up as follows: Postal Service, Deficit £142,000; Telegraph Service, Deficit £347,000; Telephone Service, Profit £177,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> Before concluding, there is one important matter to which I wish to refer particularly and that is the manner in which appointments are made to sub-postmasterships. Deputies will recall that in January, 1951, under the inter-Party Government, a permanent selection board, consisting of senior officers of the Department, was established in connection with the filling of such positions, and given the following special directions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  The board shall be responsible for the investigation of the applications and qualifications of all candidates for any of the said positions;</P>
    <P>(b)  The board shall disqualify for the said positions any candidate who uses or attempts to use political influence in the furtherance of his or her candidature for any of the said positions, and</P>
    <P>(c)  The board, after an impartial examination of the applications and qualifications of all candidates, for any of the said positions, shall determine the candidate most suitable in each case having regard to the efficiency of the public service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Since my assumption of office I have found that there has been a departure from this procedure and that the selection board originally constituted has been replaced by another board, which submits to the Minister, not one recommended candidate but three candidates, in order of merit, from which the Minister may select the person he considers most suitable for the appointment. I have found, too, that in connection with these appointments it has been the practice to permit representations to be made by Deputies directly to the Minister, thus bringing these appointments back into the sphere of political pressure.  I propose to get away from this revised procedure and to revert to the original procedure under which the selection of the most suitable candidate is left to the board.  I propose also to reintroduce the direction that the use or attempted use of political influence in connection with such appointments shall lead to the disqualification of the candidate concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> I realise, of course, that the final responsibility for the appointments rests with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Finally, despite my short service as Minister, I think that I should express my appreciation of the efficient and zealous manner in which the important services for which the Department is responsible are operated by all ranks of the staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Estimate, as with the others, the Minister has had no time to examine the work of the Department and has presented the kind of Estimate which I would have had to present if I had been in his position, but I would like to say that we all of us had great regard for the Minister in his former capacity as Minister for Local Government and for the way he presented the work of his Department to the House, and in that connection I feel quite sure that his good qualities will be again reflected in the work he will do in his new Department.  I think I can say on behalf of all members of the Party which I represent, that we had considerable regard for the Minister during his last term of office.</P>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on having at his disposal officers for whom I had the highest admiration when I was in his place and, in connection with the service, which is largely, and should be, semi-commercial, he will find that the officers will give him advice on the many personal problems with which he will have to deal, relating to a staff of nearly 14,000 persons, advice which I found to be, in virtually every case, excellent and related not only to humane considerations but to the considerations of the service which these men have to perform and to the necessity of their being persons of undoubtedly high character.  I feel sure that the Minister in his new position will find that he can take the advice of his officers almost without any qualification in regard to all these matters because of the experience they have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the postal service, as the Minister has noted, the revenue, both from the parcel and letter end, has been reasonably stable throughout <Col N="353" /> the years and I am glad to hear that the Minister intends to continue with the revision of the rural post office services and to provide eventually a daily service throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will proceed with the plans that were being made for providing new and better uniforms for postmen.  I understand that uniforms of better material can be provided at what, at least two years ago, was less annual replacement cost and that the men will look better in the uniforms. I have always felt that the uniforms of the postmen were rather behind those of the Army and the Garda Síochána and even of such bodies as C.I.E. Officers have drafted some excellent designs and I hope the Minister will continue the work of finalising the arrangements for providing postmen with better uniforms.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that the work of the improvement of buildings is likely to continue.  I hope the Minister will set his face firmly against any attempt by anyone who would provide advice to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs with regard to the design of buildings to use drab, Victorian, British colours for the improvement or renovation of post offices.  Let us have reasonably bright colours so long as they are in conformity with the style of architecture involved.  There was a terrible tradition of bright, shiny, red brick and dull, dull brown and drab, drab grey.  Let us please get away from that in the future development of our post offices.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Minister will examine the proposals for a renewal of the permanent stamp issues.  We have a permanent stamp issue longer than any other country in the world.  There has been no change for many years. While it may be desired to preserve some of the best stamps amongst our stamp issue for reasons of national tradition, there is a case for improving some of the stamps and the Minister will be able to get valuable advice in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister has noted that the telegraph committee is proceeding with this work of investigating the loss on our telegraph services, which remains <Col N="354" /> at £300,000 for this year.  That is equivalent to one and a half times the tax on dance entrances which was repealed by the last Government.  May I mention that, in my opinion, it is absolutely wrong for the taxpayer to have to pay for the telegraph service? Of the total number of telegrams, about 32 per cent. are sent by business people.  The remainder consist of domestic, consolatory and congratulatory telegrams.  I suggest that in the case of a State service of this kind the richer users should pay for the element that is supposed to represent social services, namely, those sending messages by telegram on special occasions.</P>
    <P>I want to say that if the Minister makes some sensible proposals for the elimination of this loss&mdash;I might mention, in passing, that in Britain the telegraph service results in an annual loss of £3,000,000 or £4,000,000&mdash;and if he makes sensible proposals which may involve an increase in the charge for telegraph services in certain circumstances, if, for example, he proposes a night letter-telegram, a telegram to be delivered with the first post next morning, at a relatively cheap rate&mdash; we must remember that most telegraph rates were fixed away back in 1926&mdash; with a relatively expensive rate for the immediate urgent telegram, and if he can do that in a manner which will give reasonable facilities while making allowance for the change in the value of money since 1926 and the increase in wages since, I feel quite sure that the members of the Party which I represent will not criticise the Minister merely because he is increasing the charge.  I would ask him, as far as possible, not to feel afraid of making reasonable proposals which will not hit the poorer man but which will at the same time bring the telegraph service a little more into balance than it is at the present time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the telephone service, the most urgent work is that of enabling the programme in Dublin to be completed together with trunk circuits in areas where there is still not a satisfactory service and providing telephone services for those people who have long lines in the country and <Col N="355" /> have been waiting a long time in the interests of providing telephones for all post offices.  If this work is carried out as quickly as possible it should be practicable to give telephones more speedily in the future.  As the Minisster probably knows, even in Great Britain with all the panoply of engineering services available there, there are at this moment 350,000 people waiting for telephones and they have had to wait for a considerable time. A somewhat similar condition of affairs obtains in America, where last year there were 500,000 people waiting for telephones for a considerable period. Most telephone administrations think it best to ensure greater speed for trunk services rather than make concessions to telephone subscribers who wish to have installations in their homes as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I hope the work of the industrialist consultants who have been of great help in the engineering service will continue to prosper under the present Minister.  The consultants who have been in operation have been able to find that while the improvements introduced were of great importance, these improvements were of a kind they had been able to make in private commercial companies paying dividends and making profits.  The improvements were in no way abnormal or peculiar. I hope the work will continue under the present Minister.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, the work of the engineering branch in the year 1953 constituted a record in the history of the Department.  With a staff showing an increase of 16 per cent. there was a tremendous increase in the output of work.  I am sure that under the present Minister that increase will continue.</P>
    <P>In regard to the three services taken as a whole, the whole service, I understand, is estimated to lose £312,000 in the coming year&mdash;a profit on the telephone service, a small loss on the postal services and a large loss, as I have already mentioned, in the telegraph service.  The service was losing £840,000 in the last year of the last Government but one which held office and the last Government but one, in <Col N="356" /> which the present Minister held office, imposed charges totalling some £1,000,000 a year, the last of which was left to me to authenticate and which was approved of by the last Government. The last Government, of which I was a member, imposed further charges totalling £800,000 a year and the service still shows a loss.  Over a period of 20 years the three services showed a total net annual loss of half a million pounds.  While I realise that under the inflationary conditions under which we have been living, it may be difficult for the Minister to reduce that loss at the present time, I hope he agrees with me that as far as possible the service should be made to pay for itself.  It may take time to see what steps can be taken to reduce the current loss of £300,000, which I feel is unreasonable.  I feel that the richer users of the three services should be able to pay for the losses which arise from the social service elements in the three services and the taxpayer should not be asked to pay, if at all possible, for the person who uses the telegraph, telephone or postal services.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am speaking in a very general way.  I am aware of the difficulty which faces the Minister.  It may be quite impossible in present circumstances, in which there have been so many inflationary tendencies, high costs of living and tremendously high cost of materials&mdash;telephone material now costs three or four times what it cost in 1939&mdash;to apply the principle immediately.  Such a proposal might do more harm than good but I hope he will bear it in mind.  I might point out to the Minister that the charges for the postal and telegraph services are amongst the lowest to be found in this country compared with the general standard of charges in 1938.</P>
    <P>Most of the postal and parcel charges vary from 50 to 60 per cent. above 1938.  Telephone charges in the case of rentals are only 50 per cent. above 1938 and call charges are 30 to 66 per cent. above 1938.  Although there are other services in this country which have expanded and which have shown a greater traffic volume and where, on the principle of the old Ford car, the price should be kept down, the <Col N="357" /> fact is that, even comparing the telephone service with other services which have shown a great volume of expansion, the charges made at the present time, although people no doubt feel them keenly, are very low compared with 1938.  The Minister at least has not got to face the charge that the cost has been in any way unduly inflated.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some observation on the amendment that was made by myself in relation to the selection of sub-postmasters.  I found that the officers of the Department made very wise choices, taken as a whole, and out of a total of some 308 appointments made since 1951 there were changes made only in about 13 from the proposals already made by the officers of the Department.  If the Minister thinks that by going back to the original system he will get some advantage, I hope the result will be satisfactory; but I hope the Minister is also aware that the selection board as now proposed by him has no statutory justification in law and that he still is absolutely responsible and that when he says the board should determine the names of the persons to be appointed he nevertheless is entirely responsible himself.  As I have said, there were very few alterations made in the time of the last Government&mdash;only about 13 out of some 308 appointments, made in connection with the system as left by my predecessor.  In connection with the system as it was amended whereby the selection board put up a number of names, up to three, in all, there were only some five changes made out of 100 appointments.</P>
    <P>I would like to express the hope that the Minister will confer with the Minister for Finance with a view to preserving and expanding the work of the Director of Savings who was appointed by the last Government and whose special duty is to provide more modern publicity for the encouragement of savings in connection with the Post Office Savings Bank and with the other forms of savings provided by the Post Office.  While it is difficult to prove that savings increased in the last year from causes directly related to the work of the Director of Savings <Col N="358" /> and the expansion of publicity, it is my personal view that his work was of great assistance.  The point was being reached where some inquiry had been made into the possibility of establishing savings committees in industries and in large centres of employment, whereby workers could, by agreement, have savings voluntarily deducted from their wages and put into the Post Office Savings Bank.  Difficulty was found in that in many cases the leaders of industry or representatives of trade unions concerned reported that there was already a considerable number of different kinds of deductions made for various social purposes and that to add another deduction in the form of Post Office savings might be difficult.  However, the scheme has been propounded, it was propounded by the present Taoiseach, it has been examined by us and I commend it to the Minister for his further examination.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would like to express gratitude to Deputy Childers for the cordiality with which he has greeted me on taking up the office which he has vacated.  In the brief period I have been in office I have been able to assess even now the wonderful amount of energy put into the Department by my predecessor, with commendable success.  Therefore, any suggestions from Deputy Childers will have very serious consideration from me.  His aim and mine are the same, to make the Post Office service as efficient as possible and to aim at the day when it will be in truth the revenue Department it ought to be, without in any way impairing the efficiency of the service given to the people.  Along those lines I shall strive. I am very new to the work.  I may say I am taking a good deal of notice of what Deputy Childers has said and as far as I can, with my officials, I will follow along the road of energetic work.  I have sufficient optimism to hope, with the continuous growth of the telephone system, which is likely to be most profitable, that in the near future we may be able to give a completely satisfactory service to the people and at least pay our way. Towards reaching that day I shall <Col N="359" /> bend all my energies in my new Department.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £56,880 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>If there is no objection, I propose to follow the practice of previous years and deal now with group of Estimates Numbers 29 to 37 for which I am responsible as Minister.  These Estimates, which were all prepared before I took office as Minister for Justice, are for essential services.  In general they show little change as compared with last year and I am sure that the House will not expect me to give a detailed explanation of them.  The aggregate amount of the Estimates is £5,153,100 an increase of £139,750 as compared with the Estimates for 1953-54.</P>
      <P>The first Estimate, No. 29, is for a total of £85,280 for the Office of the Minister for Justice.  It shows an increase of £530 as compared with last year.  The increase is mainly due to normal increments on pay scales and to the extra cost of telephone facilities which are offset, in part, by a reduction of one in the number of staff employed. There is a matter of particular public interest to which I wish to make reference&mdash;the Adoption Act, 1952.  This Act came into operation on the 1st January, 1953, and the annual report of the board for the year 1953 was placed on the table of the House and is available for perusal by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The progress by the adoption board at the commencement was necessarily slow but 381 adoption orders were made during the year.  Applications for adoption are now being disposed of more rapidly and 268 orders were <Col N="360" /> made in the first quarter of the current year.  The appointment of a specially qualified inspector, which has been approved, will be of much assistance to the members of the board in their deliberations.</P>
    <P>The next Estimate, No. 30, is for £4,450,250 for the Garda Síochána.  It shows an increase of £136,210 as compared with the Estimate for 1953-54. It will be noted that the provision to meet the charge for pensions and gratuities payable to members of the force and to widows and children of members now appears in this Estimate. This provision was previously included in Estimate No. 16&mdash;Superannuation and Retired Allowances.  The amount voted for Garda pensions and gratuities for the year 1953-54 has been included as part of the Garda Estimate for that year for the purpose of making comparision with the figures for the current year.  The overall increase in the Estimate, as stated, is £136,210, of which £135,000 is due to increased cost of pensions and gratuities (sub-head P).  The pay of the force was also increased as from 1st April, 1953.</P>
    <P>Since 1948, the strength of the force has fallen from 7,425, all ranks, to 6,797 on the 1st June of this year, a reduction of 628.  The strength on the 1st June included 234 recruits who were enrolled in the month of May. As these men are in training and will not be competent to perform full duty, as members of the force, for several months, the strength available for duty is now only 6,563,862 less than in 1948</P>
    <P>The fall in numbers is due to recruiting having been stopped for some years and to the big increase in the number of retirements on pension during the past two years.  The force is now 30 years in existence and as the attainment of the age of 50 years and the completion of 30 years' service entitles a member to retire, with full pension, the wastage by reason of retirements on pension is increasing. There are approximately 2,810 members over 50 years of age who have sufficient service to retire voluntarily on pension.  The total number of members over 50 years of age is about 3,310. Retirements on pension in 1952 totalled <Col N="361" /> 156, in 1953 there were 310 and it is estimated that during the current financial year over 450 members of the force will retire on pension.  This anticipated increase in the number of retirements is reflected in the increase of £135,000 in the provision for pensions and gratuities.</P>
    <P>Arrangements were made in 1953 to step-up recruiting to meet the danger of a sudden exodus of a large number of men from the force and 332 recruits were enrolled.  The number enrolled in the year 1952 was 174.  Provision has been made to recruit 500 men during the current financial year, of whom 249 have already been enrolled.  The balance will it is expected, be enrolled by the end of the month of November of this year.  During the period from 30th April, 1953 to 30th April, 1954, it was found possible, despite retirements, to increase the overall strength of the force in the Dublin Metropolitan area from 1,593 to 1,628.</P>
    <P>With a view to offsetting any lessening of police supervision, which might result from the reduction in strength, steps have been taken to increase the mobility of the force.  During the year 1953-54 motor cars were supplied to 29 district headquarters outside Dublin and provision has been made in the Estimates for the current year for the supply of a car to each district which has not got one at present.  It is also proposed to purchase 24 motor cycles for use in certain outlaying areas, and also additional motor cycles for the supervision of traffic in Dublin and environs.  The mobility provided by the extra cars and motor cycles will go some way to make up for the fall in the strength of the Force.  Increased use of cars may eventually permit of a reduction being made in the number of stations.</P>
    <P>The Prisons Estimate No. 31, at £195,530 is £1,720 less than last year, The decrease is due to smaller provision being made for maintenance of buildings and equipment (sub-head H). Last year £10,000 was included for new steam plant in Mountjoy Prison.  The increased cost of feeding prisoners&mdash; £2,722 (sub-head B)&mdash;is caused by improvements in the dietaries and the increase of £6,874 in sub-head P, manufacturing <Col N="362" /> departments and farms, is due to the fact that materials which were on hands for the making of officers' uniforms and prisoners' clothing were used in 1953-54.  New purchases of raw materials for the manufacture of cloth require to be made this year.</P>
    <P>Estimate No. 32 provides for the payment of such salaries and expenses of the District Court as are not charged on the Central Fund.  The amount of the Estimate is £93,540, an increase of £5,560 as compared with the year 1953-54.  The increase is in the main accounted for by the necessity to make provision for temporary additional justices; lesser factors being normal increments in pay of staffs and the extra cost of telephone services. The increases have been largely offset by saving brought about by staff reductions and the suppression of parttime District Court Clerk posts by amalgamating them with whole-time posts as vacancies arise.</P>
    <P>Estimate No. 33, for the Circuit Court, at £123,970, shows a decrease of £720 as compared with the year 1953-54. This is mainly due to the retrenchment of two clerical posts and other changes in connection with the employment of stenographers.</P>
    <P>Estimate No. 34&mdash;Supreme and High Court of Justice&mdash;provides for such salaries and expenses of the courts as are not charged on the Central Fund. The provision for the current year, £95,150, is £590 less than last year.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is need for me to say anything about Estimates Nos. 35 to 37 for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, the Public Record Office and the Office of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  The small variations in the sums included for the current year as compared with 1953-54 are due to minor adjustments in staffs and adjustments of pay consequent on the grants of normal increments of salary.  I would, however, like to refer to the question of arrears of work in the Land Registry.  Very heavy arrears of Land Commission vestings accumulated in the registry owing to the progressive increase in Land Commission activities in vesting lands since the <Col N="363" /> emergency.  Over the last three years steps were taken to reorganise the registry and to introduce modern methods.  The modernisation so effected has resulted in increased output and I anticipate that when the Estimates are being introduced next year the Minister for Justice will be in a position to report that the arrears have been cleared off and that the work is up-to-date.</P>
    <P>It has been usual in the past years for the Minister for Justice when introducing the Estimates for his Department to give a brief summary of the volume of crime in this country and I propose to continue the practice.  Last year the then Minister had to report that the situation had not improved as compared with 1951 and I regret to say that 1953 does not show any improvement as compared with 1952.  The interim report on crime for the year 1953 submitted by the Commissioner, Garda Síochána, shows that the upward tendency during the past few years in the number of indictable offences committed has not halted.  In 1953, the number of such crimes was 15,695 as compared with 14,720 in 1952; 14,462 in 1951; 12,231 in 1950 and 6,769 in 1938.</P>
    <P>The increase in 1953 occurred mainly in connection with offences against property, but offences against the person at 532 show an increase of 67 as compared with 1952.  Compared with 1952, there was an increase of 710 in the number of pedal cycles stolen.  Of the 15,695 indictable offences reported, 10,023 were committed in the Dublin metropolitan area.</P>
    <P>The number of prosecutions in respect of summary offences in 1953 was 131,732, as compared with 140,115 in 1952 and 104,188 in 1938.  The number of prosecutions for offences under the Road Traffic Act, 1933, was 78,127; offences against the intoxicating liquor laws numbered 18,119, and cases of unlicensed dogs accounted for 8,339 prosecutions.  Failure of parents or guardians to send their children to school resulted in the institution of court proceedings in 4,469 cases.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Minister for Justice <Col N="364" /> was in the happy position to be able to report that there had been a decrease in juvenile crime in 1952 as compared with 1951.  This improvement has, unfortunately, not been maintained. The figures in respect of indictable offences committed by juveniles for 1953 being 2,475, as compared with 2,341 for 1952.  The figure 2,475 for 1953 is, however, 127 below that for the year 1951.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, the nine Estimates are all for essential services. They do not vary much from year to year and I trust that the House will find no difficulty in approving of them.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long on this Estimate as it is the same as I would have introduced had I been Minister.  I did intend to raise a matter on which I got an opportunity to make my position known, namely, the question of petitions to the Minister for Justice. I agree with the Taoiseach in his statement yesterday that that matter calls for re-examination.  I felt when the 1951 Act was going through that Section 23 was really an invitation to people to try to side-step the courts and petition the Minister, and I think if the Taoiseach has the records examined he will find that there was a big increase in the number of petitions from that date.  I agree that some change is necessary.  I am also glad to know that he is adopting my suggestion to take away from the Minister the distasteful job of having to decide on this question of restoring licences which had been taken away by the courts.  I expect that that will be done in the Road Traffic Bill which will be introduced shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of juvenile crime, I think the Taoiseach when he was over here used to say something about it.  I always thought that the Estimate for the Department of Justice was not the proper one on which to discuss that matter.  When it comes to the question of the police having to handle juvenile crime it is getting very serious.  I always held that the parents are responsible in the first instance much more than the <Col N="365" /> schools.  It is in the homes that the tendency of the juveniles should be checked.  Very little can be done when it comes to the stage that the police have to handle it.  I am sorry that the Minister has not been able to report a continued decrease in juvenile crime.  We can only hope that things will improve.</P>
    <P>As to the Garda Síochána, I think I can anticipate what the decision will be.  Whatever savings the Government may make, I do not see how they will make any saving on the Garda Síochána because, as the Taoiseach pointed out, large numbers of men have reached the time when they can retire on pension with gratuity and we are going to have in future two police forces, one on pension and the other serving.  That will be the normal thing in the future because policemen retire earlier than other public servants.  I thought it was a mistake to extend the age of retirement to 60.  I think that is too old for a policeman on the ordinary beat.  Of course it cannot be extended any further unless there is to be a decrease in efficiency.  Whatever saving is to be made, it will not be made on the Garda Síochána as far as I can see.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Taoiseach could give me some information as to the reorganisation of the District Court and the Circuit Court areas.  There was a promise made by me that I would set up a committee to consider the matter.  We actually got as far as getting the consent of a High Court judge to preside over that committee, but in view of the election I did not think it was right for the last Government to proceed with the matter.  I should like to know whether the Taoiseach intends to deal with that.</P>
    <P>Taoiseach how soon the decision to erect a Garda station at Nephin Road will be implemented.  I should also like to ask if he will examine the conditions under which the staff at the Bridewell are employed.  I have re-</P>

      <P>I want to mention a matter in which I was interested in <Col N="366" /> connection with the Constitution and that is the formal establishment of the courts under the Constitution.  It is really only a formal matter.  It was delayed because there was a desire to have the new Courts of Justice Bill with it.  I should like to know if it is the intention to consider that matter. Now that the matter is pretty ripe, I should like to know if the Taoiseach will deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give an assurance that that matter will be looked into and steps taken at the earliest possible moment.  Considerable delay has taken place in carrying out the provision of the Constitution so as to make the position of the courts conform with the Constitution.  I cannot say that since I came in here acting for the Minister for Justice I gave the matter any deep consideration, but, as a practitioner in the courts, I have known of the situation for a long time and I certainly will ask the Minister when he comes back to look into the matter and see what can be done.</P>
      <P>With regard to what Deputy Gogan said, I will have the matter looked into and a letter will be sent to him from the Department.  With regard to the question of reorganising the District Court and Circuit Court areas, I remember the matter being raised in the discussion on the Courts of Justice Bill and I will see what can be done in connection with the reorganisation.</P>
