      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (a) the acreage of wheat grown by the 12 largest growers of wheat in Leinster last season; (b) the total number of bushels produced, and (c) the estimated total amount of subsidy paid in respect of the yield in each case.</P>

      <P>As regards (a), particulars relating to individual farmers, collected at the annual statistical inquiries, cannot be divulged.  Furthermore, to ascertain the aggregate acreage of wheat grown by the 12 largest growers of wheat in Leinster would require an examination of the individual returns of wheat acreage on each of the holdings in Leinster as given at the June agricultural statistics enumeration.  I do not consider that the information obtained would justify such an extended investigation which would involve the inspection of over 100,000 individual entries.</P>
      <P>As regards (b), no data are available from which statistics of aggregate production of a specified group of farmers could be obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards (c), I assume that the Deputy has in mind the portion of the subsidy attributable to the flour and wheatenmeal manufactured from the aggregate wheat production of the farmers in question.  As no information is available regarding their aggregate production and sales of <Col N="548" /> wheat, this part of the question does not arise.</P>

      <P>The estimated average number of persons employed weekly in the year ended 31st December, 1952, in occupations formerly insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts was 364,700.  As a result of the coming into operation of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, it has not been possible to compile for the year 1952 the corresponding estimate for the average employment of persons in occupations formerly insured under the National Health Insurance Acts.  The compilation in respect of the year 1953 of an estimate of the average weekly number of persons employed, who were insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, is being examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount collected here in 1952 by non-Irish owned insurance companies and by syndicates of Lloyds' Underwriters was £9,130,350. <Col N="549" /> This figure relates only to insurance business particulars of which are required to be furnished under the Insurance Acts of 1909 and 1936 and does not, therefore, include marine, aviation and transit business to which the Acts do not refer and for which returns are not required to be made by the companies.  The figure for 1953 is not yet available as the statutory returns for that year are not yet due.</P>
      <P>It should not be assumed that the premium income collected is the amount of the drain on the national economy as the amounts paid by way of claims to policy holders and the expenses of management incurred within the State have to be deducted.  The actual drain is only a fraction of the premium income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the Belgooly area, which includes Riverstick, and the Tracton rural area, which includes Nohoval and Minane Bridge, have not so far qualified for selection under the rural electrification scheme due to the small number of householders in each of those areas who have undertaken to accept supply. The board is unable to state when development is likely to take place but suggest that the prospects of development could be improved by an increase in the number of householders in the areas willing to take supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Article 29, Section 3 of the Constitution, diplomatic representatives accredited to Ireland are accorded all those privileges and immunities to which they are entitled by international law or under a generally accepted international usage or courtesy.  Amongst the privileges and immunities to which diplomatic envoys are entitled by international law are those which concern their personal inviolability and their absolute immunity from the jurisdiction of the receiving State.  In respect of these privileges and immunities, there is no question of the receiving State having a discretion to grant or refuse them, even on a basis of reciprocity; to withhold them would be a breach of international law.  Those privileges and immunities which are accorded to diplomatic envoys under a generally accepted international usage or courtesy, however, such as freedom from customs duties on the importation of goods and from certain forms of internal taxation, may be withheld by the receiving State for good reasons.  In practice, it is the custom of all States to grant these fiscal privileges on a basis of reciprocity; and it is the custom of the Irish Government to make sure that Irish diplomatic officers abroad obtain similar privileges to those accorded in this country to the representatives of the countries in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it this Supplementary Estimate is to provide a sum of £5,000 to enable a sum of £40,000 to be paid during the present financial year in respect of the travelling expenses of Deputies.  I should have hoped that the Minister would have given to the Dáil some specific details in regard to the expenditure of that sum.  As a matter of fact, much as I would like to deal with it, I find I am hampered by not having the information.</P>
      <P>Like Gaul, the Dáil is divided into three parts.  We have the Ministers, the Parliamentary Secretaries, the Deputies who reside in Dublin, and the Deputies who do not reside in Dublin.  As Deputies know, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries are not entitled to any sum, at least, as I understand it, out of this £40,000. Deputies like myself who reside in Dublin are not paid any travelling expenses whatsoever and, with the exception of the parliamentary allowance that is made available for us, we receive no sum, good, bad or indifferent, from the Exchequer in regard to our membership of the Dáil.  We are left, then, with a sum of £40,000 which should be explained in some detail, if even in the broadest detail, to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>What I am anxious to know is: how much of that money for travelling expenses is paid in respect of attendance at the Dáil when the Dáil is sitting and how much is paid in respect of travelling to Dublin from constituencies when the Dáil is not sitting?  Without that information I find it somewhat difficult to discuss the motion now brought before the House by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are charges on this particular sub-head in regard to travelling which perhaps might be saved and could be saved.  I will instance one matter.  If I have to communicate with any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary and do so by telephone or by letter, as I do and do successfully, it costs me a matter of 3d. for a stamp on the letter, and the telephone call is somewhat cheaper&mdash;I <Col N="562" /> leave out of calculation the envelope and the stationery I use.  If, however, instead of sending a letter or telephoning, I travel a distance of 100 miles to see the Minister, the cost is a great deal higher, and I want to know if that is justifiable.  I want to know if, in fact, expenses are paid to Deputies for travelling to see a Minister when a letter or telephone message would do. I think the House would be interested in that matter and that the public would be interested, too.</P>
    <P>When Dáil Éireann was established and when certain allowances were prescribed and provided by law there was then the conception of service by a Deputy or Senator as being part-time, voluntary service except, of course, in the case of Parliamentary Secretaries and Ministers who are whole-time servants of the community and in my view do a tremendous amount of responsible work for which they are very badly remunerated by the people.  But the question of the Deputy is different.  He accepts service in this House to look after his constituents, to deal with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The conception of service was that it was of a voluntary and part-time nature and the feeling is abroad&mdash;and I can only be corrected by a clear and specific statement from the Minister in regard to the amounts that are paid&mdash;that membership of the Dáil in some cases is now becoming a full-time, professional occupation.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Minister has not indicated whether that represents additional travelling expenses to Deputies and Senators when the Dáil or the Seanad is sitting or whether it <Col N="564" /> represents additional expenses to Deputies or Senators who travel to Dublin to see Ministers when the Dáil or Seanad is not sitting.  I think, with respect, that I am entitled to ask the Minister for a statement.  I am perfectly certain he has all the details available.</P>
      <P>If this additional £5,000 arises because Deputies travel to Dublin to see a Minister rather than spend 3d. on a stamp and write to him, then it seems to me that there is some matter that might be considered and that might be discussed.  Looking at it in a broad general way, when the matter of our expenses is one for consideration by the people, the fullest information should be available not only to the Deputies but to the people whom the Deputies represent.  I am endeavouring to get from the Minister the fullest information possible in regard to this matter, not for my own personal information, but for the information of the people of this country whom we represent in the Dáil.  I would ask the Minister to make perfectly clear now the circumstances under which this additional money is available.</P>
      <P>I had intended, if I had got some additional days, to put down a question to the Minister and to ask him, in respect of members of the Dáil and the Seanad, the actual amount of travelling expenses paid to them (1) while the Dáil or the Seanad, as the case may be, is sitting in order to enable them to attend the sittings, and (2) to deal with other aspects.  It is desirable in the national interest that the fullest information in regard to this matter should be made available to the Dáil, and I ask the Minister to do it.  I hoped, in a matter of this importance which affects ourselves, that the fullest information would be available to the people, and it was for the purpose of obtaining that very full information that I intervened at all in this matter.  If you rule, a Cheann Comhairle, that I am not entitled to raise the matter now as to whether expenses should be paid to a Deputy for coming 200 miles to Dublin by car to deal with a matter that could be dealt with on a sheet of paper and the payment of 3d for a postage stamp&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I should hope that my intervention will enable this matter to be cleared up in the public interest and cleared up by the Deputies who may feel that they should avail of the travelling expenses arrangements to involve the State in substantial travelling expenses for matters that could be covered by a cheap telephone call or a very inexpensive stamp on a letter.</P>

I know that Deputies coming from the country can also say the same of themselves.  What a certain Deputy from Dublin says here on this matter does not worry us.  There is no need to dwell on it.  If I had anything to worry about then perhaps I would be slow about standing up here and speaking on this matter.  I should like, however, to say to the Minister, through the Chair, that I treat in the fashion of contempt it deserves the statement we have just heard from the Deputy from Dublin City.  It may be that he is disappointed that he is living in Dublin; it may be that he is disappointed that he had not the luck, long before now, to be elected for a country constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Cowan is trying to raise a very wide issue on a very narrow Supplementary Estimate. The Dáil has decided that members will get certain travelling expenses. Earlier in this financial year the Dáil voted a sum of £35,000 for the travelling expenses of Teachtaí and £5,500 for the travelling expenses of Seanadóirí. Those Estimates were prepared on the basis that the Dáil would meet this year about the same number of times as it met last year but, actually, in the first nine months of this financial year the Dáil met on 80 occasions as against 70 occasions in the first nine months of the previous year.  That is the reason that we have to come to the Dáil and ask for an additional sum for the travelling expenses of Teachtaí from now to the end of the financial year.  The Seanad expenses have gone up by £1,000&mdash;from £5,500 to £6,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They are in the White Paper that the Deputy has.  The Seanad travelling expenses were estimated to cost £5,500 and the Deputy will see from the Supplementary Estimate sheet that they are now estimated to cost £6,500, that is, an additional £1,000.  Between the Dáil and the Seanad, the travelling expenses are estimated to cost £6,000 more than they were estimated to cost at the beginning of the year.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Cowan wants to contest the whole basis of travelling expenses, as to whether Deputies down the country should have their travelling expenses by car or train met, he will have to raise it in some other fashion than by means of a debate on a Supplementary Estimate of this kind.</P>

      <P>In page 2, Section 3, to delete lines 35 to 40, and in page 3, to delete lines 1 to 3 and substitute a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a provisional order relating to any premises was quashed by order of <i>certiorari</i> made absolute before the passing of this Act and any arrears of rent are due in respect of the premises which would not be due if such provisional order were valid, the provisions of this section, shall have effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where judgment is given by the court for payment of any sum of money in respect of such arrears or for possession because of such arrears and the court is satisfied that it is <Col N="569" /> reasonable to do so, the court may stay the execution of the judgment for such time and upon such conditions as the court thinks proper.</P>
    <P>(3)  Such conditions may include a condition that the said sum and costs shall be paid by the debtor by such instalments and at such times as the court may appoint and, from time to time, the court may vary the said conditions, whether or not circumstances have arisen whereby the stay of execution upon the judgment may have ceased, and impose a further stay upon the execution thereof.</P>
    <P>(4)  No order or warrant of execution shall issue on breach of any condition upon which execution of judgment has been stayed under this section except by order of the court made on notice to the tenant after such breach.</P>
    <P>(5)  In this section &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; includes order and decree.</P>
    <P>We had a long discussion yesterday on Section 3.  The purpose of the amendment is to preserve in the individual case in respect of which there was the court decision the contractual rights that were created by that court decision as between the parties and to provide at the same time, while preserving those rights, that it would be in the discretion of the court to ensure that in the enforcement of the rights the maximum and the widest possible latitude that any court can give will be given so as to ensure that the enforcement of the rights will not create hardship to the individual.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to go over the arguments we put forward yesterday.  The amendment, in my view, saves the principle and saves the individual.  The Minister and I were at one in regard to Section 2 for the cases which had not been dealt with by the courts.  I do not think there is much difference between the Minister and me on the individual.  All we wanted to ensure was that the principle was not taken in this Bill that the Oireachtas could act as a court of appeal from a decision of the court.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Sweetman has said, we had a long debate on this yesterday and, as I said yesterday, it was not in a lighthearted way that we brought in this Bill because we realise that retrospective legislation of this kind is a thing that ought to be avoided if possible. Great hardship was being inflicted on two individuals, through no fault of their own, who firmly believed, and had every reason to believe, that they were entitled to this reduction in rent.  What I wanted to avoid was the hardship that would be inflicted on an individual&mdash;a working man living in a room&mdash;by having to pay out an enormous amount of money, which he probably would not be able to get.</P>
      <P>I have considered the matter since. Even after our debate yesterday, I again asked the Attorney-General for his opinion on the constitutionality of this section and he was quite positive, as far as he was concerned, that it was entirely in accordance with the Constitution. Nevertheless, as the thing has been eased by this amendment, I think the court will take the view that arrears to that amount could not be expected from a man in the position of this particular tenant and that they will give him adequate time to pay.  I will accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any idea as to when he will be able to bring a more general Bill to the House, particularly a general Bill dealing <Col N="571" /> with the point that was raised in the tribunal's report, where the good tenant who has never had his tenancy determined and who dies, does not get the statutory protection under the Act and the bad tenant, who has had his tenancy determined, gets it?  The Minister will agree with me that that is a complete reversal of what we intended in 1946.  The law should be weighted, if anything, in favour of the tenant who has lived up to his obligations in regard to repairs, maintenance, behaviour in premises, and so on.</P>
      <P>It is grossly unfair that the position should arise&mdash;just as unfair as this case &mdash;that where we made a mistake in the drafting of the 1946 Act&mdash;and I think the Minister will agree that we did make a mistake&mdash;a tenant who has behaved as a perfect tenant and who dies and because he was not a statutory tenant, because his tenancy was not determined, gets no benefit, while the person who perhaps ran into great arrears of rent, had his tenancy terminated and became a statutory tenant on paying up the arrears, then gets the benefit of the Act.  I would suggest to the Minister that that is as urgent a case, very nearly, as this and if it will be a long time before he brings his main Bill to the House he should consider bringing in an interim measure to cover that point.</P>

    <P>The object of this Bill is to establish a fund, the income of which will be derived mainly from a levy on salmon exports and on salmon rod licences, and from which payments can be made to any board of conservators whose income is deemed to be insufficient <Col N="574" /> to cover the cost of maintaining adequate protection of the salmon fisheries in their district.</P>
    <P>To meet the expenses of protection and conservation&mdash;represented in the main by employment of waterkeepers and supervisory staff&mdash;these boards are provided with two main statutory sources of income, namely, fishery rates and licence duties on the various nets, weirs, rods and other fishing engines used in their districts.  Where such revenue proves insufficient to meet the immediate requirements of protection expenses, grants have hitherto been made from voted moneys in an effort to make good the deficiency.  In recent years the demands for State assistance have mounted steadily higher and higher; thus where in 1949-50 a sum of only £2,500 was provided in the Vote for Fisheries for the payment of grants to boards of conservators, the corresponding figure for 1952-53 was £3,500 and that for 1953-54, £8,000.  As matters stand, there is every reason to expect that the statutory revenues of boards of conservators from the sources referred to will have to be supplemented to an even greater extent in the future.  Two main factors are at work in bringing about this situation. One is the very high level at which the price of salmon has been maintained for the past 12 years or so, which has led to increased activity by poachers.  Protection services have required to be strengthened all round to meet this new situation, and this brings us to the second factor in the situation, which is the fact that wages of protection staff have increased steadily over the same period and now stand, in some instances, at a rate of as much as three times what was paid prior to the increase in salmon prices dating from 1941.</P>
    <P>In an effort to meet their heavy commitments, boards of conservators have been obliged to strike progressively higher fishery rates, which, in many cases, now stand at a higher rate per £ than those of local authorities. It has been suggested that an increase in fishing licences, which were last revised in 1925, is overdue.  While this may be so in regard to some modes of fishing, I am not prepared to impose <Col N="575" /> an all-round increase on licence duties, which would need to be doubled in order to provide the revenue required to bridge the gap between total revenues of the boards throughout the country and their total expenditures. I am not satisfied that the burden of the increased costs would be equitably distributed by means of such an increase, which would bear very harshly on the working fisherman in particular, as adding to his overhead costs before he can start fishing.</P>
    <P>The salmon fishing industry is a particularly valuable one, producing as it does not only a catch by means of commercial methods yielding an exportable surplus valued at an average of £679,000 over the four years 1950, 1951, 1952 and 1953, but also the highly desirable sporting amenity, the value of which as a tourist asset is generally recognised.  It is in the interests of this industry that adequate protection should be afforded to breeding fish on which survival of the industry depends, and that those who engage in illegal methods of fishing should be dealt with as they deserve.  It is, therefore, no more than reasonable that the industry as a whole should contribute towards the expenses incurred by boards of conservators in carrying out this valuable work.</P>
    <P>The scheme of levies set out in this Bill has been drawn up with a view to securing that in the course of a few years a sum of approximately £15,000 per annum may be collected in a full normal year.  The rate of export levy is proposed by Section 3 to be limited to a maximum of 2d. per lb., only to be exceeded if, as provided for in subsection (4) of that section, an Order prescribing a higher rate is confirmed by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  So far as can now be foreseen, it should not be necessary to resort to this special expedient, save perhaps in the event of an abnormally low catch on which the amount of export levy would be entirely inadequate and insignificant in comparison with the higher prices to be expected in a time of scarcity.  Judging by the experience of recent years, however, it would seem sufficient that the rate of <Col N="576" /> export levy should be fixed at 2d. a lb. on exports up to the end of May in each year and ld. per lb. from 1st June until the end of the season, the latter period being that in which fish of the grilse type predominate, and market prices generally strike a lower level.</P>
    <P>In Section 4 a maximum limit of one-half the licence duty is specified in regard to the levy on salmon rod licences. As in the case of the export levy, it is not at present intended to prescribe the maximum rate of levy on rod fishermen who pay £2 for a salmon rod licence for the whole season and £1 for short-term licences such as those issued by certain boards for 14 days or for a period after 1st July in each season.</P>
    <P>Considering the usual annual catch by the average rod fisherman, and making allowance for the sale of a certain proportion of catch through commercial channels which would ultimately attract export levy, it has been calculated that a duty at the rate of 10/- on each full-season licence and 5/- on each part-season licence would be roughly equivalent to a levy of 2d. per lb. on the retained catch, that is the catch which is not sold commercially.  This is an approximate calculation, but I have no reason to think that it would operate unfairly. The effect of what is provided in subsection (4) of this section is that no levy is payable on the 10/- endorsement licence, this being a licence issued at a reduced rate in one district to a person who has already taken out a full season's licence in respect of another district.  Such persons will, of course, have, in fact, contributed levy on the original licence and are not called upon to pay again.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions, other than Section 7, of the Bill are in the main of the routine nature customary in regard to the establishment and maintenance of a statutory fund.  The provision in Section 7 for the making of payments, either by way of grant or by repayable advances into the fund out of voted moneys, is one which has been inserted as a precaution and should not be taken as indicating any <Col N="577" /> intention of maintaining this fund in credit by means of regular subventions from the Exchequer.  The sources of income feeding the fund should be ample for the purpose, taking one year with another, and, unless very exceptional circumstances should arise, it is not intended to have recourse to voted moneys, save, perhaps, by way of repayable advances to tide over some temporary shortage arising, say, from a disappointing salmon fishing season.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing which this Bill will do and that is it will increase the numerical strength of two classes in this country, namely, the poacher and the smuggler because, stripped of its trimmings, this Bill is going to increase the tax on the angler and encourage him to turn poacher.  It is going to impose a tax on the legitimate exportation of salmon and will thereby encourage the smuggler.</P>
      <P>For a good many years in this country angling was confined to a particular class, but, thank God, we succeeded in educating the former poacher and turned him to a legitimate angler. As a result of the acquisition of our fisheries, we have now a considerable number of legitimate anglers in the country, anglers who have paid their £2 licence duty each year to enable them to fish for salmon and sea trout. That £2 licence is going to be increased under this Bill by 50 per cent. to £3 of an annual licence, and not only that, but the fish which the angler procures by the exercise of his skill will be taxed if he exports the fish from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that our Irish market is not sufficient to deal with the supplies of salmon which are procured in this country in the very short season at our disposal, and that, consequently, we have to depend on the market in Great Britain for the sale of our surplus salmon.  Under this Bill, we are going to impose a levy of 2d. per lb. on every lb. of salmon which is legitimately exported from the country.  Who is going to pay that 2d.?  The unfortunate draught net and drift net fishermen in the first place, while the angler, in addition to paying an extra £1 in licence duty for his licence, is going to pay an extra 2d. per lb. on every lb. of <Col N="578" /> salmon which he exports out of the country.</P>
    <P>I think that this Bill is a most unfair Bill, but it is in line with what we expect from Fianna Fáil.  In every bit of legislation which they have introduced within the past few years there has been that tendency towards an increase in the cost of the particular commodity with which the legislation deals.  Here we have a Bill introduced under the caption of the Salmon Conservatory Fund Bill, 1953, the purpose of which is to increase and make more expensive the capture of salmon by legitimate sportsmen, thereby detracting from the price received by the unfortunate fisherman who catches them.</P>
    <P>For some time past we have endeavoured to persuade our Government to give local angling associations first preference in the leasing of our fisheries.  As we all know, non-nationals had a complete monopoly of our fisheries until quite recently, but those non-nationals are still on the market and they are still competing against the local angling associations. The Parliamentary Secretary knows better than I do how they have raised the ante within the last week in so far as a particular fishery in Donegal is concerned.  I refer to the river Owenea, one of the finest fisheries in Ireland. Through the good graces of the Parliamentary Secretary, the local angling association was able to procure the rights on that river at an annual rental of £400.  However, two competitors recently came on the market, one of them being the Minister for Finance, who is anxious to get a higher rental out of the fishery, and the other a nonnational of this country, with the result that this year the local angling association procured the fishing rights on the river Owenea at an increase in the annual rental of from £400 to £500. In addition to that, each member of the association who hopes to fish on that river during the coming season will, when this Bill becomes an Act, be paying an additional 50 per cent. in his licence duty, and if he wishes to export the fish which he legitimately catches, he will have to pay an extra 2d. per lb. by way of an export duty.</P>
    <P>I think it is very unfair to establish <Col N="579" /> this fund.  It is merely an excuse for raising money and nothing else.  We are told that its purpose is to supplement the funds of certain boards of conservators.  I know a particular board of conservators in the County Donegal which has a credit balance each year of £1,300, and is not permitted by the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to spend 1d. of that £1,300 on the protection of the fisheries in the area over which it as a board of conservators exercises control.  I say that the establishment of this fund is merely an excuse to collect further revenue for the Department.</P>
    <P>I would like to see bracketed with the fisheries the sporting rights and the shooting rights on the mountains and arable land of Ireland.  Another Department collects each year an annual sum from each sportsman who uses a gun, and no return whatsoever is given for that.  In my opinion, a less return is given for the £2 which is paid for the rod licence to fish for salmon.  Instead of doing something for the fisherman by way of setting up hatcheries, we are going to increase the annual rate of duty, and, at the same time, encourage poaching.  I always believed that the best water-keeper is a former poacher and there is only one way in which you will make him a water-keeper, that is, by interesting him in legitimate angling.  That has been done all over the country through local angling associations, but the one thing which held back the small farmer and the labourer from joining angling associations was the annual rate of rod licence of £2 per year. That is a considerable amount for a very short season, but under this Bill we find that amount being increased by 50 per cent., bringing it up to £3 per year.</P>
    <P>On this question of boards of conservators, might I mention that a number of non-nationals, non-residents of the State, take out an annual licence here and have the same say in the election of boards of conservators as residents of the State, as riparian owners and as rated occupiers of fisheries?  Some non-residents of the State are doing valuable work on <Col N="580" /> boards of conservators, but others are there merely for the purpose of obstructing the legitimate progress desired by local angling associations. Recently, at a meeting of an angling association in the county I represent, a resolution protesting against the right of non-nationals to serve on boards of conservators was passed. There is a lot to be said for and a lot to be said against.  Personally, I welcome residents of the Six Counties coming in here and assisting in legislation, and on one occasion quite recently I requested the Government from these benches to bring in an elected representative of the people of the Six Counties and to give him an opportunity of participating in the forming of legislation.</P>

I make one last appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to withdraw this Bill, because, stripped of its trimmings, it is merely a Bill to encourage the poacher and enlarge the army of smugglers in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Donnell I think the anglers of this country ought to be encouraged rather than treated as pariahs and driven off the rivers in the interests of outsiders.  If the Parliamentary Secretary hopes to raise some funds for this conservancy fund from the extra taxation on salmon going out and increasing the salmon licence he will need to give them that encouragement.  It is now going to cost the angler 50 per cent. more to fish the rivers of this country and I want to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the fact that over a considerable portion of these rivers somebody other than the Minister has a say in relation to the imposition of taxation.  I wonder what is to be the <Col N="581" /> fate of the anglers on the Shannon which is controlled by the E.S.B., a body which, without any consultation with the Department or anybody else, seems to take the law into its own hands and increase the cost of the permit to fish on the rivers governed by it from £2 to £10.  This year the salmon angler down there has to pay £8 on top of his £2, plus £2 to the State, making £12 for the right to fish on the banks of the Shannon.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister are really doing their duty in allowing the landlords, whether private landlords or public companies, who have control of certain rivers to have a free hand to do what they like, because I believe that anglers are people who ought to be encouraged.  Deputy O'Donnell has said that it is an encouraging sign to see anglers replacing poachers but the tendency now is for the anglers on the Shannon and its watershed to be driven off.  The E.S.B., for reasons best known to themselves, have taken the bit in their teeth and have declared total war against the anglers' associations down there.  These respectable citizens who wish to enjoy themselves at week-ends paid what they were asked to pay by the State and now they are to be asked to pay another 50 per cent., but instead of contributing to this fund they are being driven off the rivers.  If the Minister has not got the authority, he ought to have the authority to inquire into what is taking place which has the effect of decimating the number of anglers over a very big stretch of the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is to exercise control for the State he should do so, and should resent the usurpation of his powers by any body whose actions are tending to dislocate and disrupt what should be the functions of the Fisheries Department, an action which is being carried out under the authority of a public board which seems to be overriding the best desires and intentions of the Minister.  I draw his attention to what is taking place, and I wonder, in relation to this conservancy fund, which he wants to make a success, for whom he is conserving it.  The people whom the fishing should be serving <Col N="582" /> ought to be the citizens of this country &mdash;the legitimate anglers and legitimate exporters and net fishermen.  Outside people ought not to be permitted to undermine what the Minister is doing here in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell has spoken about the usurpation of our rivers by non-nationals. That is happening to a very great extent on the river I speak of. The lettings this year on tributaries of the Shannon are being holus-bolus tied up in stretches for the gentry who come from across the water and our anglers are being driven off.  This £10 being clapped on now instead of £2 is the last straw in an attempt to drive them completely off the river.  Hence I say that the Parliamentary Secretary is not going to get as much from the increased charge he is making as he is getting now from the £2, because the men will not pay it if something is not done to protect them from the ravages of the E.S.B.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Remembering something of the practical conditions of things in this country when I was a youth this Bill is certainly an eye-opener. When I was a youth of course nobody belonging to the class of the people that I sprang from, that was the people of rural Ireland, could look into a river, much less fish in it; and through the evolution of time and events we have now reached the stage when the citizens of this country, claiming no abnormal right, have acquired the right to go if they have a spare hour or two and fish in a river. It is not so much at all the catching of fish; in the main I think it can be said generally of our people irrespective of what is given off because some particular individual does something, that they are all sportsmen, every one of them.  I know them as well as anybody else, taking them in the main.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a commentary on the evolution of things that a workman, a tradesman, a shoe repairer or a bootmaker would once a week give up an hour or two to have a bit of sport.  He wants to do something for the hour or two, and out of his earnings he has been paying £2 in order to get a bit of enjoyment out of the particular sport he likes.  To <Col N="583" /> pay that £2 is a hardship on him.  Anybody in this House will know that it is a hardship on a man, particularly a small boot man or a boot repairer, who is a thoroughly decent man and is a decent sport.  It is not, you see, the fact of having money that makes a man a sportsman&mdash;very far from that.  That is not at all true, because one of the things that characterise our people is the sport that they are in for the love of it, and the expense and cost they put themselves to in order to pursue sport&mdash;costs that they cannot afford.</P>
    <P>This class of men that I am talking about&mdash;and there are hundreds and hundreds of them, and probably all over the country it would run into thousands&mdash;have bought a rod which is a rather expensive thing for those men, got a new line and a new set of hooks, and paid £2, and after all that for the whole season such a man does not catch one salmon.  I am dealing now with the rod men.  I really think that it is not hard to understand and appreciate the mentality of this class of people.  What does liberty mean to them?  I would like to hear what is behind it.  These are the type of men that were involved in all the suffering and the struggle in the country by which it reached its freedom.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary or this House think that the limits of these people are exhausted?  I think we know the history of this country well enough to know this, that you cannot press the screw too tightly on the people&mdash; because these people are the people; you cannot turn it down to the last thread on the screw without making them react to it.  They can effectively react, and there is nothing whereby you can so effectively react as with regard to the fishing of rivers.  I am old enough and young enough to know all the tricks of that trade, and to know how that can be done.  I think it would be a fatal thing.</P>
    <P>I have no object at all now except the welfare of our fishing industry.  It can be destroyed.  You can destroy it with this Bill.  It can be destroyed overnight and nothing can prevent it. You would want to put an army, a man standing with a sword, on every yard <Col N="584" /> of all the rivers in Ireland to prevent it.  Are we not inviting that?  Why should we do that by a paltry quid on each one of these men?  These are the class of people to whom by the operations of this House in the last number of years living has been made really hard, harder in fact than they have ever known it before.  Are we going to go on piling the straws on the camel's back until finally the camel revolts? We are doing that for this paltry sum. I do sincerely and in the utmost <i>bona fides</i> appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to drop that section of the Bill because he has not told us and it would be very hard to convince me that this fund that he is setting up to assist conservators is actually going to do anything of real benefit with regard to fishing on our rivers.  I do not want to labour that thing.  Anybody who is of my own age in this House who knows the history of this country knows that the people when driven to a certain point will revolt and defeat any power. They did it before, and these are the sons of the men who did it.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I have to talk this way and to issue this warning, but I would be failing in my duty if I did not do it.  We intend to do a certain thing in this Bill and we are doing it with a good intention, but a good intention does not always reap the harvest that was behind the intention.  It is for that reason that I am issuing this warning.</P>
    <P>I come to the part talked about by Deputy Keyes.  I do not know anything about Limerick, curiously.  I have passed through it a couple of times, and that is all I know about it.  I do not know anything about its citizens; but we can take it that it is a city with the average type of people, and, according to Deputy Keyes's statement here, the rod fishermen there, if I understand him correctly, have to pay a licence duty to the conservators and they have to pay £10 to the E.S.B. for the right to fish on the Shannon.  That is £10 additional to what that class of people have to pay throughout the country generally; £12 in order to get a rod of some kind and get a line on it and a couple of hooks and a right to pass an hour or two and perhaps not a <Col N="585" /> hope on earth of ever catching a salmon.  Yet you are clapping a tax of £12 a year on him.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary or the House think that that type of man has no power of reaction?  I again particularly apply that warning with regard to the people who are concerned there.</P>
    <P>I come now to the deep sea fishermen. Everybody in this House knows the class of people who fish for salmon in this country.  They are all very small men and they are incapable of engaging in the fishing industry except through the medium of substantial assistance from the State.  They are all poor men.  Not one of them could put up £100 for any purpose.  What are we going to do with them?  In order to increase the tourist industry, apparently, and bring more visitors here, we propose to tax these poor people.  How will we tax them?  By asking them to pay 2d. on the lb. What will that mean?  It will not mean just 2d per lb.&mdash;and I want those Deputies unacquainted with the seacoast to understand this: the all-in cost of sending 1 lb. of salmon from Donegal to London is now 10d. Add 2d. to that and we have 1/- per lb. Remember, it is the fisherman who will have to pay that 1/- on that.  He will be at the loss of it because this is an export market and the price that the salmon will bring in that market is the price the importing country will pay for it.  It is the producer, therefore, the poor fisherman, who will pay the 1/- per lb.</P>
    <P>Because of the increased impact of economic conditions generally there is bound to be a fall in the price of salmon once rationing is removed and other types of fish and foodstuffs become plentiful.  There will not be a rush to buy salmon and the price will not be pushed up.  Do not let us deceive ourselves into believing that the price will remain high when other foodstuffs become plentiful.  During the emergency people paid these excessive prices because they had to have something to eat in order to live.</P>
    <P>I would be talking through my hat if I were to hold that that position will obtain in the future.  I would be very glad if it did obtain but, knowing <Col N="586" /> that it will not obtain, I realise that these poor fishermen will have to meet a levy of 1/- per lb. on every lb. of salmon they catch.  Is it wise to set up this fund?  For what are we establishing it?  Nobody will be more delighted than I am to see everybody who buys an excursion ticket arriving in Ireland. But the question is: what are we doing?  We propose to hand over a huge sum of money for the purpose of appointing inspectors to go around the country setting up local Tóstal councils for the purpose of An Tóstal.  Has our patriotism reached the stage that no one will do anything for the benefit of the country without having a paid organiser and a whole hierarchy for the purpose of making things more attractive in our cities and towns?  Is that the plight we have reached?  We will make the poor fisherman leave his wife and family and go out into the sea and tax him for doing so in order to keep this collection of junk earning handy money and to keep up the farce. Work like that should be done voluntarily, if there is any public spirit in the country.  If there is not sufficient public spirit to induce people to carry out such work voluntarily and do everything possible to make the country more attractive, then God help the country.</P>

      <P>This money is required for protection duties, as I have already indicated.  There are two obvious courses open to us: one is that the industry itself should provide the money or, alternatively, that the taxpayer should provide it.  If the Minister for Finance came in here with a Budget proposal that the taxpayer should meet this sum for either the sport or the profit of others there would be justifiable cause for a genuine and real complaint.  In my travels around amongst those who are interested in this question of salmon protection I have canvassed the views of those concerned and I have found that there is recognition of the fact that both the sport and the industry should pay the cost of the protection necessary.  It is known that the rated fisheries contribute a very considerable sum towards that cost.  They contribute much more than the licence duties received in respect of nets and rods.  The income from these rates has doubled since pre-war but the income from licensed duties has remained practically static over the past 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in the year 1933 the price of exported salmon was 1/8 per lb. and the income derived therefrom in that year was £192,000. In the year 1953 the value of exports was £607,000 and the price per lb. was 7/2.  Can anybody here make even a semblance of a case in support of no increase in the contribution from the industry itself towards its own protection, because that is really what we are doing?  Can anybody make a justifiable case for that?  If we were to allow the present condition of affairs to continue both the nets men and the rods men would have very little to get in a few years' time.  We are, in other <Col N="588" /> words, protecting their sport and their livelihood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to note that in the Cork district some years ago, the local board succeeded in getting the nets men to contribute voluntarily 6d. per lb. for this work and the State did not come in on it at all.</P>
      <P>I attended a meeting of the National Salmon Anglers' Federation, and they are quite agreeable to this method of increasing the income for protection, and they recognise that the sport and the industry should provide the necessary money.  I do not think it comes very well from a Deputy from Donegal to decry the tourist industry.  If we do attract more tourists to Donegal by giving better protection to salmon angling, the whole community in Donegal will benefit by it.  At any rate, the protection is more urgent now because of the salmon prices which I have mentioned. The incentive for poaching is much greater than it has been at any time, and men are prepared to risk very, very heavy fines to catch salmon because the price is so big.  The job of protecting the remote stretches of rivers is a very difficult one indeed, and the wages for that work will have to be made commensurate with its responsibility and difficulty, and the money is being provided in this way for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree entirely with Deputy O'Donnell who said that poachers have become anglers.  The experience of the Fisheries Branch and of the local boards is quite the reverse.  I also want to point out that we do not propose to increase the salmon rod licence by 50 per cent.  The £2 licence will be subjected <Col N="589" /> to an excise duty of 10/-, and the part-time licence will pay an extra 5/-.  The endorsement licence, which is a licence which a man can take out in another district, having already paid his £2 licence in some other district, will not be subjected to any further charge.</P>
    <P>There have been representations made from many sources up and down the country to the Fisheries Branch to take some effective steps to deal with this question of poaching and the levy has been recommended from various sources.  With regard to the method of collecting from the commercial fishermen, such as the net men, I think it is preferable that it should be done in this manner of a levy per lb.  If we were to get the same income by an increase in licence duties it would be necessary to increase them by 100 per cent.  That would mean that a man who now pays £4 for a licence for a net would have to pay £8 before he caught a salmon and the £4 is not easily got by these net men when they are starting off.  Very often, I understand, they have to get a loan of the £4 to get a licence until they have sold some salmon.  In addition to that, it is the experience in various estuaries that one estuary may be good and another bad in any given year.  That means that a man would have his first charge doubled and might then experience a bad year.  Very often, even in the same estuaries, different crews have a varied experience in the matter of the return of catches and by this method of pay-as-you-earn a fisherman will only pay if, in fact, he catches a fish and we think that that is a very fair principle to apply to the matter.</P>
    <P>Extraneous matters were brought in, such as ownership, and Deputy Keyes referred particularly to the Shannon fisheries and to the disabilities which, he alleges, the anglers on the Shannon are being subjected to by the E.S.B. This parliament in two Acts has conferred ownership of the Shannon fisheries on the E.S.B. and whatever consequences have flown from the administration of those fisheries by the E.S.B. it flows from a deliberate Act of this Parliament and the only way in which that can be changed is by a <Col N="590" /> change of the legislation which vested these fisheries in the ownership of the E.S.B.  I am given no function whatsoever in relation to the management or control of those fisheries.  We do ensure that the E.S.B. comply with and observe the fishery laws and if they do not do that they will be prosecuted in the same way as any other person or group operating a fishery.</P>
    <P>No serious case has been adduced against the method of collecting this money.  Nobody has challenged the need to get it and I think that as between the two methods which I outlined by which it might be got, this is the one which we can all stand over with the greatest amount of justification. Nobody wants to increase the cost either of sport or of the industry, but when it can be demonstrated that the commercial return from these fisheries has increased to the extent which I have indicated.  I do not think any case whatsoever can be made for resisting this method of getting the money which is necessary to protect the livelihoods of about 7,000 people engaged in this industry.</P>

      <P>When I moved the adjournment last night, I was dealing with the point made by the Minister for Defence in answering objections that I had raised against the Bill as now drafted by him and in support of my amendment which is now before the House.  In the course of my observations I was asked by Deputy Major de Valera if Section 12 (1) of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, had <Col N="591" /> been used for the purpose of dealing with penal deductions and stoppages from the pay of members of the Garda. I have made search to-day and I have been unable to find that this particular section of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, had been used for anything except for prescribing the rates of pay of members of the Garda Síochána.  If I might just draw the attention of the House to the specific provision, Section 12 (1) of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may with the sanction of the Minister for Finance from time to time by Order regulate and appoint the rates of pay and allowances (including conditions applicable thereto) to be paid to the several ranks and to the several grades of each rank of the officers and men of the amalgamated force.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to it now only for the purposes of my argument. I was asked by Deputy Major de Valera if the words in brackets &ldquo;including conditions applicable thereto&rdquo; could, and in fact did, authorise the Garda Síochána or the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, to prescribe penal deductions and forfeitures from the pay of the Guards.  It was my view then, and it is still my view, that that section can only authorise the payment of pay and allowances to members of the Garda.  In the time at my disposal, I made an examination of all the pay Orders issued under that sub-section that were available to me and an examination of these pay Orders confirmed the view I had that that sub-section was not a precedent for what the Minister proposes to do in this case, although, as I pointed out last night, the Minister did say as reported in column 316, No. 1, Volume 144 on the 11th February:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In this country, for example, forfeitures and penal deductions in the case of the Garda Síochána are dealt with by regulations made by the Minister for Justice (with the concurrence <Col N="592" /> of the Minister for Finance) under Section 12 (1) of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have, as I stated, made an examination of the pay Orders that have been made in all the years that I have been able to find since 1925 and in each one of these pay Orders, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance were dealing with the pay of the Garda Síochána only.  I might refer the House to one of these as typical of the others because, in a number of cases, the pay Orders have been amended and replaced from time to time but substantially they are all the same.  I would refer in the first case to the first Garda Síochána Pay Order that was issued as far as I can understand under that sub-section. That was issued in 1927 by the then Minister for Justice, the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins, with the approval of the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Blythe.  It is in the Statutory Rules Orders of 1927 and it is indexed in the Library as page 241.  It was issued on the 30th March, 1927.</P>
    <P>To avoid repetition, I may say that it is typical of the pay Orders that have been made under that particular sub-section.  Having cited its authority as Section 12 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act of 1925, it sets out, in the ordinary way of statutory Orders, a section dealing with its title, a definition section, and then, in paragraph 3, it sets out the rates of pay of everybody in the Garda Síochána, from the commissioner down to the Garda, from the day he becomes a recruit until he has over 22 years' service. Conditions are set out&mdash;that was the point about which Deputy Major de Valera asked me&mdash;in regard to recruits and increments, and there are provisions in regard to Gardaí serving in the detective branch.  It dealt with the commissioner, the deputy commissioners, and it provided for increments of pay, incremental increases and, as one would expect, provided that the coming into effect of the new Order would not result in any reduction in pay.</P>

      <P>You see, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Minister said very specifically, as reported in the column I have already quoted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this country, for example, forfeitures and penal deductions in the case of the Garda Síochána are dealt with by regulations made by the Minister for Justice (with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance) under Section 12 (1) of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister was referring to deductions and forfeitures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out to the House that what the Minister said in that case is not correct.  That is not borne out by the statutory Orders that have, in fact, been made under that sub-section.  When the Minister asks the House to accept as a precedent regulations made under a particular sub-section of the Act of 1925, it is my duty to point out to the House that that is not, in fact, a precedent for the action of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am doing what I suggest that the Minister might have done when he made that blunt statement&mdash;to establish where the precedent would come in.  I am doing no more than pointing out that in every one of those pay Orders that have been issued under that sub-section by the Garda Síochána there has been no question of forfeiture or deduction of pay prescribed and that consequently the Minister&mdash;I accept absolutely that it was unintentional&mdash;misled the House in regard to the effect of what he stated was a precedent for the draftsmen of this particular Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not do any more in this regard than refer the Minister and the House to the pay Orders which are all statutory Orders that have been issued by the Garda Síochána in all the years that any Orders have been issued since 1925, and the Minister and the House will find these statutory regulations made in&mdash;as I stated&mdash;1926&mdash;nearly all the years since that&mdash;in 1940, 1942, 1946, 1947, 1949, 1952, and I think if I could find it, in 1953.  So far as I have been able to find them those are statutory <Col N="594" /> Orders that have been made under the sub-section of that Act and not one of them, as I myself believed, stipulated forfeitures or deductions from the pay of the Gardaí.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned last night the Garda Síochána are in a somewhat different position from that of the Army in that they have certain rights guaranteed to them by statute to establish representative boards that may make representations to the Minister for Justice in regard to matters of pay and allowances. From the point of view of their constitution, their statutory authority, from the point of view of their inception and development there is no precedent in the Garda Síochána that can or may be accepted by the Army in regard to forfeiture or deductions from pay.  I think I can say this from a study of the documents available to me that the Garda Síochána legislation is based to a considerable extent on the legislation that governed the old R.I.C. and that being so, in my view it is a pretty bad precedent for our Defence Forces&mdash;if one can find a precedent in it.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Police Forces Amalgamation Act of 1925 did in other sections provide for the discipline of the Garda Síochána and did set out a number of offences, the breach of which would be a breach of Garda discipline. For those things certain fines, rather limited fines, were provided.  But that is not in the section that the Minister quoted.  It has nothing to do with forfeitures or penal deductions. It has to do with fines for breaches of Garda regulations which may be imposed by an officer in the orderly room or one, say, in the depot, by a superior in the Garda, according to the regulations, or by the commissioner as a result of a sworn inquiry.  But these are matters entirely of discipline and have nothing to do with forfeiture or penal deductions from the pay of members of the Garda.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that I should be replying to the debate on this amendment and setting out an absolute contradiction of what the Minister said when he was replying to the observations I had made in favour of the amendment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> The position then is clear and I hope I have made it perfectly clear that in regard to the three matters of precedent laid down by the Minister that the first one under Section 12 (1) of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act of 1925 is not applicable and consequently I ask the House not to accept the defence of the proposed procedure that was advanced on the basis that that section was in fact a precedent.  I hope that what I have said now will satisfy Deputy Major de Valera in regard to the doubt that he appeared to have as to the effect of the section when I read it last night.  That is the position in regard to that particular precedent.</P>
    <P>I find in an examination to-day of the position of the Garda Síochána that they had very extensive protection in regard to their pay and allowances. I think it is well for them that they should be so protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I put a little question?  Suppose a Garda has an accident with a car and minor damages done, can that money be recovered from that Garda and what is the procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand, if a Garda has an accident with a car which is proved to be due to his fault a court of inquiry, similar in effect to the army system of court-martial, can penalise him under the disciplinary regulations but there is no means by which, if he has an accident, there can be a stoppage from his pay without judicial investigation into responsibility for that accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is interesting on that particular point to examine the disciplinary regulations that govern the Garda and which were made in 1926.  That is the position as I have been able to examine it in regard to the Garda. My own investigations have established to my satisfaction that the point that has been made that this is a precedent for what is proposed in the new Bill here does not stand examination. In the disciplinary regulations I have mentioned in 1926, Statutory Rules and Orders made by the Minister for Justice on the 1st May, 1926, Deputies will see the disciplinary <Col N="596" /> powers that are invested in the Garda authorities.  They will see how these disciplinary powers are exercised by, as I say, judicial investigation of the type that is peculiar to police forces but which is, nevertheless, a form of judicial investigation which enables the person concerned to make a defence. I hope I have disposed of that particular aspect to the satisfaction of the House.</P>
    <P>The second thing the Minister said was:&mdash;&ldquo;The British, in spite of having these provisions in their Army Act, deal by regulations with forfeitures and deductions in the case of the navy.&rdquo;  I have examined that matter and I have searched the relevant British Acts in relation to it.  While the period available to me is insufficient to make a comprehensive examination of all the Acts, nevertheless an examination of up-to-date authorities which refer to the different navy Acts show me that, again, the Minister was in error in the statement which I have quoted and which appears in columns 316-317 of the Debates for the 11th February, 1954.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1861, which is a basic Act in regard to the navy, there is some reference to the pay.  There is quite a number of disciplinary provisions. There is a provision as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;During the imprisonment of any person in pursuance of that Act, all pay and wages shall be suspended and stopped.&rdquo;  That is the Act of 1861. Then we come to the Act of 1865, which, I understand, is the basic Act in regard to the matter of regulations.</P>
    <P>It is laid down in Section 3 of that Act that:&mdash;&ldquo;all pay, wages, pensions, bounty money, grants or other allowances in the nature thereof payable in respect of services... shall be paid in such manner and subject to such restrictions, conditions and provisions as are from time to time directed by Order in council.&rdquo;  Again, we have a succession of law which I do not want to enter upon in regard to this matter of the Crown Orders in council and the different considerations that applied from time to time in the navy. The net and important point is that the British naval law is not a precedent, as the Minister says, for what <Col N="597" /> has been done in this Act.  It would be very strange if we went to 1861 or 1865 to get a precedent for something we are doing in 1954 having, for the past 30 years, exercised authority under an Act of our own Parliament which, in respect to this particular thing, was satisfactory.  I am not going to go into the historical business of the British Army and the British Navy, because, while I think it is most interesting&mdash;there is nothing I would enjoy more than a discussion in relation to it&mdash;the Chair might feel that it was not just right or necessarily relevant to the matter under discussion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was the historical position that there was no fear of the navy, whereas there was considerable fear of the army.  That was the basis for the annual Army Act in England, also the fact that the navy was not under an Act that had to be enacted annually as the Army Annual Act has to be.  It is an interesting subject, as I said, and perhaps when our own history of military law is to be written somebody will add a short chapter on that particular aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important thing, from my point of view and, I think, from the point of view of the House, is that whatever Order has to be made under the navy laws must be made by Order in council and not by Order made by the Secretary of the Navy, as I presume he is called, who would correspond in this case to the Minister for Defence.  It will be seen, therefore, that the British navy is subject, to a large extent, to Orders made by the King in council and there is that substantial difference as regards what has been suggested here.  I do not think the Minister would contend that an Order made by the King in council could be considered to be a regulation made by himself as Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  That <Col N="598" /> is the second precedent dealt with and I think it is unusual in a debate in this House that one could have such a volume of evidence that cannot be contradicted to establish that what were suggested as precedents are not, in fact, precedents, and cannot be relied upon.</P>
    <P>The same consideration applies in regard to the third precedent which I mentioned briefly last night and which I just want to mention in passing so as to tidy up the argument.  The Minister said at column 317, Volume 144, of the Official Debates of 11th February, 1954:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That this procedure is now the modern trend in other countries is indicated by the fact that the Canadians adopted the regulations system in their National Defence Act of 1950.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I said last night, I have looked into the Canadian Act of 1950 and the Consolidation Act of 1952 in which all the laws dealing with the Defence Forces up to 1952 have been consolidated and codified.  It is there laid down that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the pay and allowances of officers and men are subject to such forfeitures and deductions as are prescribed in regulations made by the governor in council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The governor in council in Canada, as the House knows, represents the British monarch and acts for the monarch with the assistance of the Canadian Privy Council, and it is in that capacity that he makes regulations for the army dealing with forfeitures and deductions.  But the very same Act which says that also says this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where in any section of this Act other than Section 14 and this section there is express reference to regulations made or prescribed by the governor in council in respect of any matter, the Minister does not have power to make regulations pertaining to that matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Canadians made no mistake about it.  They said the regulations would be made by the governor in council, and in case anybody might have any misapprehension as to what that meant they said in another section of the same <Col N="599" /> Act that where that is laid down the Minister has no power to make regulations pertaining to that matter.</P>
    <P>Therefore, of the three precedents that have been laid down for us it is clear that Section 12 (1) of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, does not apply.  It is clear also that British naval law does not apply and that Canadian law does not apply.  Might I ask the question then why, if that is the position, the Minister insists on sticking to an alteration in our military law that is not warranted, justified or authorised by any precedent, whether quoted in error or otherwise, and which, as has been pointed out in the course of the debate, is contrary to the best interests of the Defence Forces?</P>
    <P>It is significant that in the Bill we are now discussing there are many sections which deal with the question of fines.  There are provisions in it whereby fines of £25 may be imposed on an officer by court-martial.  There are provisions in it whereby a fine not exceeding £10 may be imposed by court-martial on a non-commissioned officer, and there are similar provisions whereby a private may be fined a sum not exceeding £5 by court-martial. There are also provisions in it whereby on being found guilty of an offence an officer or soldier whose case is investigated in a judicial way by his superior authority may also be fined certain sums of money.  If we provide all these sections in the Act in regard to fines, why do we want to include another omnibus section that gives the Minister power to make regulations which will enable him to deduct pay and allowances from an officer or from a soldier?</P>
    <P>In the course of his reply the Minister made the point that where a person was guilty of what one might term gross negligence, irresponsibility of a type that should be punished, he wanted to have power to deal with that.  May I refer the Minister to Section 156 of the Bill, and to quite a number of sections that surround that section in its location in the Bill? Section 156 reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every person subject to military law&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> (a)  who wilfully destroys or damages, loses by neglect, improperly sells or wastefully expends any money or property being&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  money or property belonging to the State, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  money or property received for, or administered by or through, service messes, institutes or canteens, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  money or property contributed by members of the Defence Forces for the collective benefit and welfare of such members, or</P>
    <P>(iv)  money or property derived from, purchased out of the proceeds of sale of, or received in exchange for money or property, mentioned in sub-paragraph (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph, or</P>
    <P>(b)  who wilfully destroys, damages or improperly sells, pawns, or pledges any property belonging to another person who is subject to military law,</P>
    <P>is guilty of an offence against military law and shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment or any less punishment awardable by a court-martial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a section, which I am not going to read, which deals with bribery, corruption and fraud whereby every person subject to military law who is guilty of bribery, corruption or fraud is guilty of an offence against military law and shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer penal servitude or any less punishment awardable by a court-martial.</P>
    <P>Section 158 deals with negligent or furious driving of service vehicles. Under that section, every person subject to military law who, having the charge of a service vehicle, by wanton or furious driving or racing or other wilful misconduct or by wilful neglect, does or causes to be done any bodily injury to any person or damage to any property or who drives a service vehicle on a street, road, highway or any other place, whether public or private, recklessly or in a manner that is dangerous <Col N="601" /> to any person or property having regard to all the circumstances of the case, or who drives a service vehicle while intoxicated or under the influence of a drug or narcotic, is guilty of an offence against military law and shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment or any less punishment awardable by a court-martial.</P>

Section 159&mdash;and I do not want to go into detail about it now&mdash; deals with the unauthorised use of service vehicles.  That, also, is an offence against military law and a person shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment or any less punishment awardable by a court-martial.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of sections deal with safeguards for military property of all descriptions.  Therefore it would be wrong to suggest that it is necessary for the Minister to have the power which he seeks here for the purpose of dealing with persons who he thinks are guilty of offences of, as he described it, &ldquo;a wanton or reckless character&rdquo;. The Defence Bill providing a very extensive code of law for dealing in a judicial manner with any negligence about which the Minister may complain and for dealing with any damage of a wilful kind to property, it is very difficult to see why, on top of that, he wants the right to make regulations to forfeit or make penal deductions from the pay of an officer or soldier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pay of an individual has been protected by the ordinary law of this country against any deductions from it.  The House will be familiar with what is known as the Truck Act, which prohibits an employer from deducting from the pay of an employee.  Any employer in the State who deducts from the pay of his employee is liable <Col N="602" /> to be proceeded against for a breach of that Act.  If we find that it is necessary to protect the pay of ordinary individuals there is all the more reason why we should seek to protect the pay of officers and soldiers who have very little redress if anything improper or illegal is being done in regard to their pay or to their allowances. If this House surrenders on that point just because, as the Minister stated, it makes for more flexibility&mdash;if we surrender a power of protection that we have in the law at the moment &mdash;then we shall be doing a very bad day's work for the officer and for the soldier.  I do not feel the same guarantee that every matter that comes before a Minister in the future &mdash;if the Bill is passed in its present form&mdash;will be dealt with mainly from the point of view of justice to the soldier.</P>
    <P>I was hoping that, in this Act, we could have maintained the protections that were in the old Act and that, in regard to the section of the old Act which gave the Minister power to make Orders against the pay of an officer and a soldier for damage done by him through negligence or through wrongful conduct, we might have introduced now an alternative proviso whereby the determination of a matter such as that would be in the hands of a military court consisting of three experienced officers who would provide for the person against whom the allegation was made every facility to make his defence to the allegation against him in person, with the assistance of such witnesses as he might feel it necessary to bring.  In that way we could have done very valuable work for the Defence Forces and the officers and soldiers in them.  Where such men are subject to a rigid code of discipline and where their only means of redress of grievances is a complicated and difficult procedure laid down in military law, it behoves every one of us to make sure that they are guaranteed, at least, that there will be no interference with their pay unless they are guilty of an offence against military law and the offence has been established by proper judicial inquiry at which the officer or <Col N="603" /> soldier concerned would have the full rights of a citizen to fight his case and submit such evidence as he considered necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at some length on this matter.  I can assure the House that I take no great pleasure in having to speak at length on a matter of this kind.  It is with a feeling of the deepest regret that I find it necessary to speak in the way I am speaking in 1954 in regard to what I consider to be a very serious and grave invasion of the rights of the officer and the soldier. I should have imagined that after 30 years' experience we would all be united in an effort to improve the things we knew were defective rather than that we should be witnessing all safeguards being wiped away and the souls and bodies of our officers and soldiers being handed over to the tender mercies of what we describe as the civil servants in the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>I have spent many years in association with the members of the Defence Forces, commencing in the very lowest rank, that of private, and, as an officer in the three grades of commissioned rank up to captain, serving in the line and in administrative grades, serving in every one of the senior staffs, including headquarters staff, spending, as I did, a very long period as an officer defending soldiers charged with offences, or sitting on courts-martial as a judge advocate, trying to see that justice was done to soldiers, and I feel this very keenly.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 52, which proposes the insertion of certain words, is entirely independent of this amendment and I understand certain Deputies want to say something about it.  I cannot be relevant for ever. Although I could talk for a considerable period longer on this point, I feel that I have made a very strong and substantial case and I sincerely hope it will be considered, whatever the decision of the House may be in regard to the deletion of these particular words.  I am satisfied that, if this is enacted by the House, that soldiers' and officers' pay will be subjected to deductions and stoppages, this new Act will mean no improvement in the conditions of officers and soldiers.  While it may make it easier to take away portions of their pay&mdash;which is not a very substantial pay at any time&mdash;it is detrimental to the service as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make this concluding point to the Minister.  He has grave difficulty in getting the Defence Forces up to strength.  There is nothing that contributes more to the success of a defence force or an army than the fact that there is no difficulty or trouble in regard to their pay.  I have endeavoured <Col N="605" /> in every way, both in the Special Committee and here, to induce the Minister to see the error of his ways in regard to that and to see the justice of the case I am making.  I can only hope that the effect of my contribution on this section will result in a reconsideration of this matter.</P>

      <P>(i)  forfeiture of pay except in respect of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(I)  absence on desertion or without leave,</P>
      <P>(II)  custody, imprisonment or detention,</P>
      <P>(III)  absence from duty on account of a disease or disability arising out of the commission of any offence,</P>
      <P>(IV)  unclaimed amounts;</P>
      <P>(ii)  deductions from pay except in respect of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(I)  articles or services provided,</P>

    <P>(V)  public or service debt or disallowance,</P>
    <P>(VI)  unauthorised expenditure or commitment;</P>
    <P>(c)  the total deduction to be made under regulations made under this sub-section from the pay of a man, except a man who is being transferred to the Reserve Defence Force or discharged from the Defence Forces, shall not in any week exceed such sum as would cause him to receive less than one-third of his pay for that week.</P>
    <P>As I have already said on amendments Nos. 51 and 52, this amendment is designed to meet, as far as possible, the views of Deputies who feel that the circumstances in which forfeitures and deductions will occur should be detailed in the Bill.  The general headings now proposed constitute a very real limitation of the power to make regulations. These headings are, I think, self-explanatory, and Deputies who have studied them should have no doubt as to their necessity.  The provision limiting the rate of deduction so as to leave a man not less than one-third of his pay in any week continues a similar provision in existing legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In Committee, and in principle I must say, I shared to some extent the fears which Deputy Cowan had expressed in regard to the section as originally drafted.  In principle, it would be highly desirable to <Col N="608" /> ensure, in all cases where there is any deduction from the pay or allowances of an officer, N.C.O. or man, that the deduction should be made in accordance with some form of judicial procedure. In other words, his liability for such a deduction should, clearly, be established.</P>
      <P>In the case of the larger type of deduction there is no trouble, because there is usually a court of inquiry or something of that nature.  It was in the case of the smaller deductions that the difficulties arose.  The problem is one of administration in the end, so that, in respect to these smaller amounts, I did think that some definite safeguard was required.  Where I would not go the whole road with Deputy Cowan was on the practical working out of a feasible scheme, and where you were going to prescribe, in the basic Act and in regulations, what was going to be purely administrative machinery.  It is desirable, as far as possible, to get the principles laid down in the Act.  It did seem that it was giving the Minister rather wide powers in the section, as originally drafted, to leave the regulation of these matters completely for departmental arrangement.</P>
      <P>The Minister has brought in this amendment to deal with the points which were raised.  Frankly, I think that the Minister has gone a long way to meet us on this matter, following all our discussions in Committee.  There are certain things in this amendment. It is fairly definite, I think, in the context of the section that regulations made under this sub-section shall not prescribe, etc.  That is in reference to sub-section (2) which empowers the Minister to make regulations.  The Minister is forbidden to make regulations except in the circumstances of (i), that is, in regard to forfeitures and deductions, and except in the circumstances of (2) (ii), and there is protection, in regard to total deduction, on which we commented in Committee, in regard to (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that we can reasonably ask the Minister to go much further than that, so far as this basic legislation is concerned.  Where I do not completely agree with Deputy Cowan is on this: that I feel there is <Col N="609" /> a certain futility in trying to cover all possible cases.  If you allow the principle of deduction at all, there is a certain futility in trying to cover it here in this House.  If Deputies, or anybody else, strongly make the case: &ldquo;No penalisation and no deductions at all,&rdquo; that is all right, but in the nature of things I do not think we can go that far.  It is then a question of nice balance as to how far we can insert a statutory protection.  I think it should be inserted as far as it can go, and how far it must be left to administration. The Minister knows that I joined in the criticisms of the original section, but I think it is only fair to say that he has gone a long way to meet the points which were raised.</P>
    <P>As I see it, there is in this whole matter the question of internal administration and organisation in the Department of Defence rather than the explicit things set out in the section. That, however, is another day's work. I think that I would be only taking up the time of the House if I were to repeat a number of the things which were said on this matter in Committee. They are on record, and there is no need to repeat them, but I would strongly commend to the Minister and, through him, to his Department some of the points that were made in that connection.  I would like to see, in the organisation of such matters, that adequate actual safeguards were given to the soldier, particularly the junior officer and the lower ranks who, from the nature of the case, are in a fairly vulnerable position.  I would urge at all times that, as far as this legislation is concerned, we have to guard against, on the one hand, being too rigid or rather too elastic&mdash;it is rigidity in another sense&mdash;and on the other of leaving things completely unspecified in the hands, technically, of the Minister which means to be operated departmentally. It is a choice between that and striking the right balance, not going too far the other way and trying to legislate for details we cannot possibly hope to control and bringing about an artificiality that would be nearly worse than the first evil we are trying to avoid.  In the middle somewhere is the right solution.  I will not <Col N="610" /> go so far as to say that the Minister's solution is the ideal, or even that it is the best that could be thought of, but I say that, in all the circumstances, he has gone a long way to meet the point made, and I think the amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This section was discussed at very great length at the Special Committee, and, as Deputy de Valera has said, the Minister has produced this amendment as a result of the arguments made.  I think that, on examination, it will be found that the amendment meets the arguments, but whether it was necessary or not is something I am not going to admit for the moment.  The Minister is empowered to make regulations in respect of forfeitures&mdash;things that are automatic, such as absence without leave, desertion, custody, imprisonment or detention and so on.  The section gives power to the Minister to make regulations to take back the money, and, if he had not that power, the position would be the same as that in regard to the pay of the British forces in this country which built the Royal Hospital &mdash;the money would be there and nobody could touch it, neither the State nor the individual, so that it would be hanging there like Mohammed's coffin. Deductions from pay which the regulations will authorise may be in respect of articles or services provided.  That is something which has been issued and everybody knows that the soldier or officer, if a serious amount is involved, can still claim a court of inquiry to decide whether or not he should pay the particular sum.</P>

      <P>Is it not a great blessing that we have you to tell us when we are wrong?  I want to protest against these interruptions by Deputy Cowan or anybody else.  The Deputy has held the fort here all the evening and nobody interrupted him.  There is a reference to fines, penalties and damages and these can only be deducted when a court or some other <Col N="611" /> procedure has found that the sums are due.  I submit that the Minister has gone a long way to meet the argument put forward at the Special Committee and I think that in the circumstances the amendment should be accepted without further debate, because if we continue to discuss these matters on this stage to the extent to which they were discussed at the Special Committee, the Act will never see the light of day.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I should be considered as having interrupted Deputy MacEoin, but when a Deputy says that a soldier can demand a court of inquiry, I can do nothing but say that he is incorrect and I wanted to have the objection to such a statement recorded as quickly as possible after the incorrect statement was made.  If we are to discuss this important matter, let us discuss it on the basis of fact and knowledge.  I can see Deputy de Valera's approach to this problem, that there was a difficult position.  The Minister has brought in this amendment in an effort to meet objections raised at the Special Committee to the procedure of the regulations.  I wonder would the House consider why was it necessary for the Minister to bring in this regulation. Why was it not brought in, in the first instance, if it is a protective clause or if it limits in any way?  Why was the Bill in the way it is before the House now brought in with the provision in Section 97 that the Minister would have power to make a regulation dealing with the forfeitures and deductions to which the pay, allowances, gratuities of or grants to members of the Defence Forces may be subjected, without any protective clause whatever? If it took the amendment I put down in the Special Committee and the debate that arose there to bring about this amendment which is considered to be of some assistance to the soldier, I think it does establish very clearly that a Deputy who takes the trouble to examine Bills and suggest amendments is, perhaps, helping the Bill in some way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say that where the Minister has conceded points made, on being satisfied that they were right, I pay tribute to him for doing so, but I want to say that the protection laid down in this amendment is, to my view, a complete illusion, that it provides no protection whatever and does not limit in any way what was in the Bill, in the first instance.  These are my views in regard to it for what they are worth. Could anyone suggest under what other heading could a regulation be made in regard to the pay or allowances of an officer or soldier?  I am asking that practical question&mdash;could anyone suggest any other heading under which a regulation might be made taking away the pay or allowances of an officer or soldier?  If that is so, where, then, is the protection in this?</P>
      <P>One could think out things that the Minister might do but of course would obviously lead to mutiny and to that extent they would not be done.  I want to examine this carefully, because what we are doing now in regard to Section 97, the amendment of Section 97, is that we are establishing a code of law that will be very important as far as officers and soldiers are concerned. The amendment which the Minister proposes to insert says that regulations made under the section shall not prescribe forfeiture of pay except in respect of (1) absence on desertion or without leave, (2) custody, imprisonment or detention, (3) absence from duty on account of a disease or disability arising out of the commission of any offence and (4) unclaimed amounts.  What exactly does the Minister propose will be done in regard to these headings?  That is what I am anxious to know and I thought I should have heard from the Minister, because I think it might have been of some assistance, if this amendment is passed to the Department and to the Army officers who would have to administer the law to have some indication as to what is in the mind of the Minister in regard to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> Under the amendment the Minister may make regulations dealing with the forfeiture of pay for absence.  Deputy Major Vivion de Valera and Deputy General MacEoin both assume that the Minister is going to make regulations in regard to forfeiture of pay for absence, and I assume that they assume that a person will lose a day's pay for a day of absence, and that he would not lose two days' pay for each day of absence.  I take it that Deputy General MacEoin and Deputy Major de Valera assumed that that will be so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  I could see the Minister making a regulation that it would be two days' forfeiture for one day's absence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with absence on desertion or absence without leave.  There are two sub-sections in that clause.  The Minister may provide for forfeiture of pay for absence on desertion or he may provide for forfeiture of pay on absence without leave.  What I am worried about is this, is the Minister going to limit himself in the regulations to forfeiture of one day's pay for each day of absence without leave, or is he going to make regulations where he would forfeit more than a day's pay, or will the basis of deduction of pay be a day's pay at all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, Sir.  I am dealing with what is considered to be an important limitation of the clause 2A (1).  What I am putting forward is that the Minister should have indicated to the House in a substantial way what he proposes to do in regard to this.  It is just bald that he may make a regulation in regard to absence without leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point that arises there is whether this forfeiture is to include more than simple regimental pay.  Will it include allowances?  That is where I think we might have had some idea from the Minister, because if we had it it would be a guide to the House <Col N="614" /> and what was on record as to the present intention of limitation, while it would not have legal validity, would be of some guidance in regard to it.  In the old Act&mdash;and this was important&mdash; when a man was absent without leave and was tried by a court-martial, the court-martial had a right to say whether he forfeited pay or not for the period that he was absent.  That was a right that vested in the members of the court, who for one reason or another on the explanation of the accused person could direct that he did not forfeit pay although he might be absent 14 days.  I would have been concerned to know would that protective provision be in the new regulations, and I think that is of some consequence, because if it is not, if it was not provided, it would be a very serious worsening of the conditions of the people who are in the Defence Forces.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in that, too.  Sub-section (c) of this says that the total deduction to be made under regulations made under this sub-section from the pay of a man shall not in any week exceed such sum as would cause him to receive less than one-third of his pay for that week.  There is the case of the married soldier and his marriage allowance.  There is the case of other allowances that he may be entitled to.  That is why I am so much concerned about this that I would rather have it written down so that nobody would have any doubt about it than that we should have it in this form, and that is why I take the view that while the Minister has endeavoured to meet a point of view put forward in the Special Committee what he has in fact done has not in any way limited what it was anticipated he might do if he got the full power that was in the regulations.  The matter of the wife's allowance arises not so much on when he has deserted as on desertion or absence without leave, which can be dealt with subsequently as it will arise in regard to other sub-sections there, while he is in custody, imprisonment or detention, or while he is absent from duty on account of a disease arising out of the commission <Col N="615" /> of any offence.  There always was the position that a court-martial, as I say, had power in regard to forfeiture of pay, in regard to absence without leave or desertion.  There were other safeguards also in regard to absence without leave where a commanding officer was concerned in investigation. I would be very anxious to know if the <i>status quo</i> will be maintained in any regulations that are made because, if it is not maintained, I can see a very difficult position arising.  If the regulations made by the Minister are in any way different from the regulations now in force that will have the effect of worsening conditions of service for both officers and men.  It is hardly necessary to mention that that could be a cause of very great concern to the Minister and his Department and to the Government.</P>
      <P>We have no guarantee that the forfeiture will be limited to the period for which a man is absent without leave or the period during which he is a deserter.  That will create substantial difficulty, particularly if the regulation conflicts with any other provision.  I take it that every care will be exercised to prevent any conflict of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same situation arises in relation to custody, imprisonment or detention. I am not worrying very much about imprisonment or detention because a person can only be imprisoned by order of a court-martial or of a civil court.  Unless the individual concerned is tried by a court he cannot be imprisoned. He cannot be put in detention unless his case is tried by a superior officer under the powers vested in him or unless he has been court-martialled.  The word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; creates some difficulty.  It has been the practice that where a person is held in custody on a charge and that, on subsequent trial, that charge is dismissed or terminates in his favour, he does not forfeit pay.  Will there be any change in that?  Is there any intention of stopping pay in that set of circumstances even though the individual concerned is subsequently acquitted or the charge is not proceeded with against him?  If there is to be no change, a situation I can hardly <Col N="616" /> visualise, it is difficult to understand why we have it in this particular way instead of leaving it as it was.</P>
    <P>The next point is absence from duty because of disease or disability arising out of the commission of an offence. If a soldier commits an offence, which results in disease or disability, he is liable to forfeit pay.  What pay will he forfeit?  Is it pay for the period during which he is inactive because of disease or disability?  My trouble in relation to that is that it specifically states: &ldquo;arising out of the commission of an offence&rdquo;; if it is the commission of an offence, will he be found guilty by a court-martial or by a superior officer in a proper trial?  The matter of dual punishment arises there.  He may be convicted of the offence.  He will be tried under one of the subsequent sections with which we will be dealing. If he is found guilty and punished in the way that the tribunal or court-martial considers proper, will there be on top of that a second punishment imposed by the Minister by means of which he will forfeit some of his pay? These are some of the points in relation to forfeitures to which I think it necessary to draw the Minister's attention. When he is replying, I hope he will make a clear and specific statement which will act as a headline to the Army in relation to all these matters.</P>
    <P>I am not very worried about these unclaimed amounts.  The Minister has explained that these are amounts which would be to the credit of officers or soldiers for such a period of time as would render it unlikely that the persons concerned would claim the amounts.  I take it the Department would take all steps to try to give this unclaimed pay to those to whom it belongs. I can understand that a deserter might have a certain sum of money due to him and I assume the Minister wants power to wipe that out from an accountancy point of view by means of forfeiture and thereby place it to the credit of the State.  I would like the Minister's views on these points when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>This amendment also deals with deductions from pay, deductions which are somewhat different from forfeitures. Deputy MacEoin mentioned <Col N="617" /> that deductions may be made for articles or services provided, and he said that these could be certain foodstuffs or other matters of that kind. The wording of the section causes me a little concern.  Has a member of the Defence Forces any right to refuse to accept such services or articles?  Can they be made available to him and must he be subject to deduction for them because they have been made available?  I would like the Minister to deal with that point.</P>
    <P>First and foremost, in a general way what are these articles and services? Will they be provided compulsorily or will the individual concerned have any say in the matter?  Is it a matter of voluntary acceptance so far as he is concerned?  I would like to have that point cleared up.</P>
    <P>The next point we come to is deductions in respect of marriage allotment. Up to the moment to a large extent marriage allotment was on a voluntary basis; in other words, a soldier was obliged to contribute a minimum sum each week to his wife, but quite a number of soldiers contributed more than that and, although there was an obligation to contribute, it was never looked upon as being something which a soldier was just obliged to do.  He knew when getting married that the rate of marriage allowance would be based on his contribution to his wife, plus certain contributions by the Minister under the marriage regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It should happen. The provision generally is that the soldier contributes a weekly sum to his wife which is deducted from his pay and added to the marriage allowance provided by the State, and both are then paid to the wife.  That has been the practice for a long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be some special circumstances I should like to know before I would venture a view in regard to it.  As far as this is concerned, I am only talking about the general principles with regard to it. The next thing is &ldquo;fines, penalties, damages, compensation or costs awarded&rdquo;.  That opens up a very wide position and again I should like the Minister to say what he has in mind in regard to it.  I take it that we can all accept &ldquo;fine&rdquo; as being a fine imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction, whether a military or a civil court. The next thing is &ldquo;penalties&rdquo;.  That is what I have great difficulty about. What does &ldquo;penalties&rdquo; mean?  What is a penalty?  Who is to decide what the penalty is or what it is for?  Is it a penalty that may be imposed by the Minister after a court of competent jurisdiction has decided that a soldier is not liable to bear a penalty?  A word of that kind means, as I said at the beginning, no limitation of the effect of this section in its original state.  I know of no legal limitation to the word &ldquo;penalties&rdquo; there. &ldquo;Damages&rdquo; again raises the same thing.  What are damages?  Are they damages that are awarded under the Act by a court of competent jurisdiction or who will decide what damages they are?</P>
      <P>Then we come to &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; which was the basis, to a large extent, of the discussion we have had over the past few days in regard to deductions. Compensation for what?  Is it compensation for an article that happens to be damaged or is it compensation for damage done in respect of which the soldier or the officer is charged and which he is ordered by a court-martial or a civil court to make good, or is it compensation that the Minister may think he should pay?  If it is compensation of that kind, will it be limited as it has been up to the present to compensation to make good damage done by a wrongful act or by negligence, or will it be compensation just for a loss which may not be proved to be due to negligence, or compensation on the lines of the example I gave when I was proposing my amendment, for articles that were lost out of a particular consignment of goods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> These are difficulties that arise and these make it very difficult for me to think, while the Minister may have the intention, and I accept that he had the intention, of endeavouring to meet the difficulties that were explained in the Special Committee, on examination of the amendment that he has put in, that there is no restriction whatsoever, nor is there any limitation, and that the full wide scope which was there originally is not still there in the amendment.</P>
    <P>Then one gets into much more serious difficulties when one comes to the next sub-section which says, &ldquo;public or service property lost, deficient, damaged or destroyed&rdquo;. There is not very much difference between public property and service property, but there are definitions in the Act which explain them.  For the practical purposes of this debate and for the purpose of trying to understand what is meant, one may take them as being military property, whether they are barracks, uniforms, arms, equipment or things of that kind.  The point is &ldquo;public or service property lost, deficient, damaged or destroyed&rdquo;. What does the Minister propose to do there?  Must there be any finding of negligence or wrongful action on the part of the individual before he is obliged to pay for something that is lost, something that is deficient, something that is damaged, or something that is destroyed; or will it be the purpose in the regulation to set out a code of law such as we have now done away with in which all these matters will be covered fully?  Who will be the deciding authority?  Will it be the Minister himself, will it be Army officers, or will it be members of his Department?  Will all these matters be subject to review?  Will any person who is aggrieved by a decision against him have the right to apply to the Minister under the section of the Act which deals with redress of grievances and have his case examined by any person?</P>
    <P>These are very material factors in regard to this amendment which the Minister should explain fully to the House.  Clearly, since the matter was discussed in the Special Committee there must have been considerable <Col N="620" /> consideration given to the aspects of the problem and, obviously, when the Minister agreed to introduce this amendment he only agreed to introduce it when he was satisfied as to the effect of it, and, being satisfied as to the effect of it, he should be in a position now to explain it very fully to the House.  I do not want to make the case that this is not a difficult matter, that it would not be difficult for the Minister to explain it.  I know it is exceptionally difficult.  All that I am asking the Minister at this stage is to give in broad outline what he thinks the effect of these sub-sections will be, if approved by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Then there is another one: &ldquo;public or service debt or disallowance.&rdquo;  That is something new to me, something novel.  We all know what the public debt is.  We have heard it described from time to time by our statesmen and politicians in millions of public debt.</P>
    <P>The amendment further says that deductions from pay will not be made except in respect of public debt.  I would be interested to know what exactly the Minister means by that. What would be considered a public debt as distinct from the public debt? What is a service debt or what is a disallowance, which again is new to me?  Is this disallowance the same thing that we have in local authorities where an auditor comes along and decides to surcharge members?  This particular heading or clause seems to me to be new and for that reason I am very anxious that it should be explained.  &ldquo;Public or service debt&rdquo;&mdash; I try to visualise it and I find the greatest difficulty in regard to it. &ldquo;Service debt&rdquo;&mdash;does that include, or is it proposed or intended that it should include, mess accounts or mess debts, moneys that might be due in a canteen, a dry canteen or a wet canteen?</P>
    <P>The last item is &ldquo;unauthorised expenditure or commitment&rdquo;.  I think the House could conceive that very few people would be caught out under &ldquo;unauthorised expenditure or commitment&rdquo;. What really does it mean? Does &ldquo;expenditure&rdquo; mean expenditure of money, or could it possibly mean expenditure of ammunition on a <Col N="621" /> range?  In a broad general way, what is &ldquo;unauthorised expenditure&rdquo; and who possibly could be guilty of unauthorised expenditure?  The Minister and the House know that, in peace-time at any rate, no member of the Army has any right to expend money without authority and, in fact, nobody but a fool in the Army would expend money without authority.  Does &ldquo;unauthorised expenditure&rdquo; mean expenditure of the type I have mentioned in regard to the purchase of military requirements, or could it include expenditure in regard to messes in the Army, where the expenditure might be by a member of the committee without the consent of the other members?  Could that sort of expenditure be recouped from the members of the mess?</P>
    <P>These are the difficulties I have in regard to the proposed addition to the section.  I think, on hearing what I am saying in regard to it, the House will come to the conclusion that these additions do not limit or restrict the Minister in any way from his original intention, but my detailed examination may have enabled me to take a view in regard to it that is not shared by some of my colleagues in this House. That is my objection, or rather my difficulty, in regard to this.  The view I hold is that whether this amendment which the Minister proposes is put in or left out, it does not in any way lessen the powers the Minister has been given in the first part of the section we have just dealt with.</P>
    <P>The last part of the proposed amendment says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The total deduction to be made under regulations made under this sub-section from the pay of a man, except a man who is being transferred to the Reserve Defence Force or discharged from the Defence Forces, shall not in any week exceed such sum as would cause him to receive less than one-third of his pay for that week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understood that the provisions in regard to forfeitures and deductions applied to officers and soldiers and I should like the Minister to explain was there any particular reason why this matter of reducing the deduction to <Col N="622" /> two-thirds was limited to soldiers.  Was there any specific reason for that and if so what was it?</P>
    <P>There is one other point which is a technical matter but I take it it will be corrected by the Minister.  It is only a small matter of drafting.  There are two sub-paragraphs (b) in the section but perhaps there may be a subsequent amendment dealing with that.  I have endeavoured in examining this proposed amendment to see how far it helps to protect the position of soldiers or officers and I would be anxious to know what powers the Minister considers he shed when he agreed to propose this amendment.  What powers did he propose to shed and deprive himself of?  What powers of forfeiture? What powers of deduction?  I am satisfied from an examination of it that it gives much wider powers than exist in the present Act, the 1923 Act, which is still the law; that it gives those wider powers in a very unsatisfactory way; that it enables the Minister to make regulations and to alter those regulations at will, giving, as somebody has said, flexibility.  If one thought that the alterations would be alterations made in favour of the officer or soldier one might agree that that type of flexible procedure which makes for ready amendment might be desirable but every soldier's experience has been that powers given to a Minister particularly powers to interfere with his pay are generally interpreted in an unfair way to the individual.  While a Minister looking over a file in which it is alleged an individual has caused damage, say, to the extent of £10, decides in a generous frame of mind to reduce that by half, may consider that as doing a substantial benefit to the soldier, in fact the deduction of the reduced amount, if it is not done in a just fashion, will have just the same detrimental effect on him as if the larger deduction was in fact made.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we can accept as a criterion the position that in examining the amount that a man is obliged or will be obliged to pay you help matters a great deal by deciding to take only half of what is being unjustly taken from him instead of taking <Col N="623" /> nothing at all from him as might be the just result if one had the type of judicial investigation that is in it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to say whether in the regulations which he projects the complete power to deal with them will be in the hands of the Minister; or in the hands of subordinate officers; whether the complete power of going into this matter will be in the hands of military officers or the hands of civilians or in the hands of some type of joint body composed of both officers and civilians.  I think if we had that information in regard to this section, in addition to the other points I have asked for, we would be in a position to say how far and to what extent this new procedure is going to interfere with the rights of the officers and soldiers.</P>
    <P>In the next sub-section it is proposed that the regulations shall be laid in the ordinary way before each House of the Oireachtas and the House will have the right, if it so desires, to annul. I take it that those regulations when made will be available for officers and soldiers, not only in the Stationery Office, but throughout the units.  As far as the Act is concerned as a whole, I think the old Act was generally and extensively understood right through the Defence Forces.  Will these new regulations be widely distributed? Will each soldier who may be bound by this regulation be supplied with a copy of it?  Will every officer be supplied with a copy or will it be made available to units?  Will it simply be sent as disciplinary regulations are sent at the moment to the different military organisations and not to the individuals?</P>
    <P>I am not very much concerned how the thing is done so long as proper efforts will be made to see that the regulations are known to the persons who are likely to be affected by them.</P>
    <P>I think I have said, perhaps, as much as I propose to say in regard to this amendment.  I reiterate what I said at the beginning in answer to points that were made, that in my view the insertion of this amendment does not in any way limit the Minister's powers and that there is no conceivable matter <Col N="624" /> on which there could be forfeiture or deduction where the Minister is not covered in the heads that he has set out here in regard to forfeiture and deduction.  It is and will be and must be important that when the regulations are drawn that they will be drawn in the way an Act of Parliament would be drawn.  I do not know whether the parliamentary draftsman or the Attorney-General would be consulted in matters of this kind but I do say where statutory regulations are to be made to replace provisions of Acts of Parliament those regulations should be prepared with the same care and attention as an Act of Parliament is prepared in the parliamentary draftsman's office because it must have the same effect as far as the Army is concerned not only from the point of view of the person who suffers the deduction or forfeiture but also from the point of view of any person in an administrative capacity who has to work on the decisions that are taken in regard to it.  In so far as officers of the different units are concerned who would be anxious to advise soldiers as to their rights, if any, under the regulations, it is desirable that the regulations which they have to interpret in that way should be as carefully drawn up as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I want to say in regard to this particular section relating to pay.  I regret that we are discussing it but that is unavoidable, I suppose, in view of the decision that has already been taken.  I hope the Minister, for the benefit of the House and the Army, will give in a broad, general way the explanations that I have asked from him in discussing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would want to be a superoptimist if I were to believe that I could produce anything, even through this amendment which he has criticised, or anything else that would satisfy Deputy Cowan.  He seems to think that there was something wrong in producing the amendment which I have introduced to meet the views expressed by the members of the Special Committee.  I think that instead of regarding it as something <Col N="625" /> that was forced out of the Minister he should regard it as a tribute to the Committee and as a proof that the Committee was capable of doing valuable work, and that it could improve the Bill, as we hope it will be improved, by the various amendments.</P>
      <P>I think we had a very fine demonstration here a few minutes ago of the wisdom, common sense, understanding and humanity that exist among the members of this House.  Deputy Cowan took five hours to deal with this small amendment, five hours of continuous denunciation of the Bill, civil servants and members of the Army&mdash;he did not even exclude the Minister.  However, it only took less than five minutes for the House to demonstrate its wisdom, common sense and belief in the fact that this Government and the last Government which was connected with this Bill had as much at heart the welfare of the Army and Army personnel as Deputy Cowan.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Cowan's general approach to discussion on this Bill is that all the experts, the drafting officers, the specialists of the Department of Defence who were involved in the rough drafting of it and the Minister's advisers, did not know their business, and that the only person who was right in all this thing was Deputy Cowan.  I do not know whether he genuinely believes that or not.</P>

      <P>But I myself am satisfied that this Bill will be a big improvement on the Acts which it will replace.  I can hardly conceive any reason why it would be deemed necessary to bring in a replacement of any Act which was up to date and satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my discussion on this Bill, I happened to use the words &ldquo;carelessness&rdquo; and &ldquo;irresponsibility&rdquo; and Deputy Cowan fastened on these two words and because they were not in the section that deals with the particular matter which we were discussing he tried to create the impression that the soldiers were penalised under something which was illegal.  I will just refer to it.  Deputy Cowan in the course of his remarks on that particular <Col N="626" /> point&mdash;I just took down a very short note as he was speaking&mdash;said, referring to me, that I had stated that I must penalise irresponsibility.  This is, in fact, what I did say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think Deputy Cowan is advocating that we should not penalise irresponsibilities.  I do not believe for a moment that he would stand over that sort of thing.  However, in the case he has been making, he has almost been suggesting that there should be no forfeiture, penal or otherwise.  If a soldier who has charge of valuable State property, in the form of a motor car or some other piece of equipment, damages that equipment through irresponsibility, through carelessness or through some other cause and if it is proved to have been caused through negligence on his part, he should have to pay some part of the cost of that damage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Cowan deliberately or through some omission left out the very vital words which I have there stated.  These words were &ldquo;damages that equipment through irresponsibility, through carelessness or through some other cause and if it is proved to have been caused through negligence on his part.&rdquo;  That was in conformity with the Act, but Deputy Cowan goes out of his way to create the impression that the Minister was signing ministerial Orders against soldiers for something that was not mentioned in the Act.  I do not think that that is the sort of fair discussion we expect in this House.</P>

The Deputy then said: &ldquo;Widespread injustices have been inflicted on the Army&rdquo;.  I do not know where or how he could possibly have got that impression. He stated that he could produce 100 of them; he did produce one and I am going to deal with the one he did produce.  He referred to this case in column 305, Volume 144 and said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Quite recently I came across a case where a particular officer was sent to do a job of work.  He had scarcely arrived on the job when he was ordered by a superior authority to go elsewhere.  Another officer took over from him.  There was a third officer concerned.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which is the impression the Deputy has tried to force on the House all the time.  It is a military court of inquiry that is dealing with it and I am only trying to show another misstatement.  If we are going to have discussions in this House let us have discussions on facts so that we can deal with facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a committee of inquiry on a £2 loss?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>And it is a military committee that is inquiring into it and we have to presume they are not the villains Deputy Cowan appears to think they are.  Furthermore, it is not some civil servant in a particular part of the premises that is squeezing out the last penny from an unfortunate soldier.  I realise that the more  speak the more ammunition I am providing for Deputy Cowan and I think the best thing I could do is to leave <Col N="629" /> the matter and try to answer some of the questions he has been asking, questions to which he himself knows the answers but in connection with which he wants answers from me.</P>
      <P>In regard to forfeiture of pay in respect of (I) absence on desertion or without leave, and (II) custody, imprisonment or detention, these are general provisions which cover the more particularised provisions in the existing Acts.  In relation to (III), absence from duty on account of a disease or disability arising out of the commission of any offence, the existing Acts contain a more detailed provision for men only.  Officers will in future be put on the same footing as men in this regard.  Stoppages at various rates are at present made where a man is incapacitated, whether he is in hospital or at home.  This position will be improved by providing in the regulations that only the lowest rate of stoppage will be made in future and then only when the officer or man is in hospital.</P>
      <P>As regards (IV), unclaimed amounts, it sometimes occurs that it is not possible to clear a soldier's account, for example, a deserter who is not apprehended and who may have a credit balance.  Obviously such a balance cannot be carried forward indefinitely and will be appropriated if unclaimed after 12 months.  Similarly it is necessary to limit the period in which an officer or man can make a claim to be entitled to pay he did not get.  In that respect I would like to point out that on at least two recent occasions, far from enforcing forfeiture, I went to the trouble of signing an Order ensuring that, even though it was outside the prescribed period, the money would in fact be given to those men.  That is another example of the humanity with which these matters are dealt with.  The existing regulations already provide time limitations of this kind as part of the conditions under which pay is issued.  It is felt, however, that the matter is more appropriate to the forfeiture provisions.  These limitations can, of course, be waived by the Minister in any particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards (ii) deductions in pay <Col N="630" /> except in respect of (I) articles or services provided: this will enable regulations to be made regarding day to day issues of stores, kit or provisions on repayment; laundry and haircutting charges, rent, etc.  There is nothing there to which anyone could take objection.  (II) Marriage allotment: this is also provided for in regulations at present as a non-penal deduction.  It means deducting a certain amount from the soldier's pay and paying it to his wife with her marriage allowance; (III) fines, penalties, damages, compensation or costs awarded, this general heading covers the more detailed provisions of the existing Acts regarding the recovery of amounts directed to be paid as fines, etc., by military or civil courts before which the officer or man has been charged with an offence; (IV) public or service property lost, deficient, damaged or destroyed; under this provision, the Minister will, as at present, recover in whole or in part as he may decide, the value of public or service property which after due investigation is held to have been lost, deficient, damaged or destroyed through the wrongful act or negligence of the officer or man.  An officer who is responsible for the care, custody or distribution of public or service property may also be held liable, if, after due investigation, he is unable to give a satisfactory explanation of losses, deficiencies, etc.; (V) public or service debt or disallowance, the Minister will, as at present, be empowered under this provision to recover public or service debts (e.g., income-tax, mess debts, etc). or disallowances, that is, over issues of pay and things of that kind.</P>
    <P>(VI) Unauthorised expenditure or commitment: this provision is to cover cases in which an officer or man acting contrary to the regulations, makes an unauthorised payment or irregularly issues an order for stores.  To safeguard public funds such amounts are usually recovered, but may be refunded to the person concerned in whole or in part after due investigation, the total deduction to be made under regulations made under this sub-section from the pay of a man, except a man who is being transferred to the Reserve Defence Force or discharged from the <Col N="631" /> Defence Forces, shall not in any week exceed such sum as would cause him to receive less than one-third of his pay for that week.  This is on the lines of the provision in the existing Acts but has been re-drafted for clarification.  It is intended to ensure that a man will, irrespective of the total amount of deductions for which he has been held liable, receive each week at least one-third of his pay.  In addition, such man will, of course, also receive his full allowances, including marriage allowance, where otherwise payable.</P>
    <P>This will mean that where for example deductions are being made, a married private (3-star) with three children will always receive somewhat more than two-thirds of his total emoluments (i.e. pay plus allowances).</P>
    <P>I think that that deals fairly with the queries which Deputy Cowan made.  I should like to conclude on this note.  Deputy Cowan went to very great trouble to examine the 1925 Police Act, the Canadian Act, to which I made reference, and the British Navy Act.  He went to very extreme pains to endeavour to prove to the House that what I stated as precedents were bad, that I was illadvised, that, in fact, they were not precedents and, generally, he would give the impression that in making the statement I was misleading the House. I find, on examination, that each of the countries to which I referred, Canada and Britain, have these regulations.  These regulations are made under their Acts and nothing that Deputy Cowan can say can change that.  Whatever may be the form in which they are issued or are in force, it makes no difference: the regulations are there and the statement which I made is a perfectly correct statement.</P>
    <P>Then, when he was dealing with the 1925 Garda Síochana Act&mdash;an Act by the Oireachtas&mdash;Deputy Cowan gave the impression that nothing could be done until it was submitted to the representative body.  He gave that impression&mdash;to my mind, at least.  I find, on examination, that the representative body is there all right but that the Minister's Order which is there&mdash;and which is given under the Official Seal dated 29th day of <Col N="632" /> December, 1951, and signed by Gerald Boland, as Minister for Justice, and by Seán MacEntee, as Minister for Finance&mdash;empowers the Minister to make Orders for deductions in respect of disciplinary fines, mess debts and public property lost, destroyed or damaged.  All it affords the representative body is to be allowed to examine the Minister's Order for their consideration. Beyond that, it does not go.</P>
    <P>After the long and, I was going to say, wearying speech we listened to in respect of these particular Acts, the facts of the matter are that the regulations exist in each of these countries to which I refer.  They are there and it is a question of how they are operated.  That may be something that differs from our own method of dealing with them.  However, I think that our own method of dealing with them by regulation and then placing them on the Table of this House for a period of 21 days for examination by any or all the Deputies who wish to examine them is as good a safeguard as you can get.</P>
    <P>In reply to a query which Deputy Cowan made as to whether the regulations will be available to the members of the Army, I am assured that they will.  They will be issued through the ordinary routine orders.  I will leave the matter at that.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to delete certain words &ldquo;in an action for divorce&rdquo; from paragraph (h).  Certainly, I shall not delay the Minister very long on this amendment.  I hope he will explain why&mdash;in this country, where divorce is specifically prohibited by the Constitution&mdash;we should make provision in an Army Act for an order made by a court for payment of alimony in an action for divorce.  I raised this matter before on the Special Committee.  The answer then seemed to be that divorce there did not mean divorce but that it meant what we have here&mdash;separation <i>a mensa et toro</i>&mdash;that is, a form of judicial separation.  In the Constitution, divorce is specifically excluded and yet that is the word which is used here.  I am wondering if that means that where a soldier has been in England or some other country and an action has been taken against him for divorce and he has been ordered to pay a particular sum of money, that order would carry to this country?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 55:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 52, to delete Section 99, lines 25 to 40.</P>
      <P>The section says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where it appears to the Minister that a person who is or subsequently becomes a man of the permanent Defence Force has deserted or left in destitute circumstances, without reasonable cause, his wife or any of his legitimate children under the age of 16 years, the <Col N="634" /> Minister may order to be deducted from the daily pay of such person as a man of the permanent Defence Force and applied in such manner as the Minister thinks fit towards the maintenance of the wife or such legitimate children such portion (not exceeding, in case he holds the rank of sergeant or a higher commissioned Army rank or the rank of petty officer or a higher non-commissioned naval rank, two thirds or, in any other case, three-fourths) of his daily pay as the Minister thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a reservist is called out on permanent service, sub-section (1) of this section shall apply in respect of him in like manner as it applies in respect of a man of the permanent Defence Force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is often very difficult to remember the good points one has in regard to sections.  My objection to this section is that, under the law of the country, if a woman is deserted by her husband she has full rights to go to court and have her case examined by a district justice and if it is found that the husband deserted her and has failed to maintain her he can be ordered to pay a sum of money not exceeding £4 per week.  Under the law of this country a woman who makes such an allegation against her husband may get such an order and it is already provided in the previous section that, where an order of that kind has been made, deductions may be made from the man's pay for the purpose of paying the amount ordered by the court. If that is so, why must we have this section?  It provides that the person who decides that there is desertion is not a court of competent jurisdiction but the Minister.  Without trespassing on the Minister's touchiness in regard to this particular matter, I may say that, in effect, it means some official in his Department and an official in his Department sets himself up as a judge of whether or not a person has deserted his wife.  That being so, the Minister then makes an Order that he will pay a certain sum of money for the maintenance of this woman.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has any practical experience in the courts&mdash;and, of course, in that matter as in the Army matters, <Col N="635" /> I must take second place to the Minister's advisers&mdash;knows that the proofs in a case of this kind are very difficult and the case must be established before the justice, in accordance with the law, before any such order is made.</P>
    <P>Here in this slipshod fashion a provision is inserted in a Bill that the Minister may appoint himself or one of his officers, civil or military, as a judge to decide whether or not a particular soldier will contribute money for the maintenance of his wife or children.</P>
    <P>Where did that section originate?  It is not new.  It is an old section which was in the old Act.  It was transferred to the old Act from the British Army Act.  Originally it was in some of the Mutiny Acts as far as I can find.  It was a power that was given to the Lord Kitcheners, the Lord Roberts, of the time, when they were going from Kabul to Kandahar and when there was no civil court functioning to deal with a soldier who did not maintain his wife.  That is the origin.  In one part of it the Minister is trying to be too new.  He is going to Canada to get something that they adopted in 1950.  I want to keep him on a tight rein, to deal with things as they are in regard to soldiers' pay.  On the other hand, the Minister wants nothing new. He wants to keep that section.  If the Minister could justify the retention of that section I would be very interested to hear him doing so.</P>
    <P>We raised this matter in the Special Committee.  We raised points and the Minister said he would consider them. He has considered them and he has left the section there.  I take it that in the meantime the Minister has been advised that the section is necessary for some reason or other.  I would like to know the reason.  Here the Minister has to decide whether or not a soldier has deserted or has left his wife and children in destitute circumstances without reasonable cause. What evidence of desertion will the Minister have before him?  Who will give him the evidence?  How will it be given?  Who is to give evidence, and how will it be given, that the woman is in destitute circumstances?  Will the <Col N="636" /> soldier against whom it is proposed to make such an Order be entitled to be present and to interrogate witnesses? Will it be done in his presence or behind his back?  Will it be done on a confidential, secret report from somebody outside or will it be done in the full light of day?  Under what circumstances would the Minister decide what was reasonable cause or what was not reasonable cause?  Would reasonable cause be a cause that would be accepted by a civil court?  What would reasonable cause be?</P>
    <P>I do not know if that section has ever been operated.  Personally, I have no knowledge that it ever was operated.  If it has never been operated, what is the sense in putting it in here?  Has the Minister consulted the Attorney-General as to whether, within the provisions of our own Constitution, that is the sort of thing that our courts would hold to be constitutional? Would the Attorney-General think that that is the type of power that it is right that the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Justice or any Minister should have?  In what way is it held that our own civil law is inadequate in regard to desertion?  If it is inadequate, is it better to amend the law in the appropriate Acts than to have this thing here?</P>
    <P>I am not going into the problem about the reservist who is called out on permanent service, any more than to say that he could be at home for one, two or three years.  For valid reasons he refuses to contribute to the support of his wife, and she has taken no steps to bring him to court although she might have done so.  If she were aware of this simple procedure of getting money from a husband who would not be bound in law or morally to support her, would she have the right to say to the Minister: &ldquo;This man has deserted me, he has left me in destitute circumstances, he is a reservist, he has now been called up on permanent service and I ask you to make a deduction from his pay for my maintenance and for the maintenance of certain children I have, which I say are legitimate, and which he might say are illegitimate&rdquo;?  Those are the difficulties about that section and I would <Col N="637" /> be very keen to hear the Minister as to why he wants to keep it there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the necessity for the section, and I can appreciate also Deputy Cowan's concern about the amendment.  I think the section would be necessary in the case of a national emergency or when the Army is called out on active service.  Then our courts possibly would not have the opportunity of functioning, or of functioning with the speed which would be necessary to deal with a case of this sort.  At the same time, I fully appreciate Deputy Cowan's point of view.  We people who have experience of cases such as this, realise the difficulty there is in proving, first of all, the desertion.  Here we must go further&mdash;we must prove that there are destitute circumstances so far as the wife is concerned.</P>
      <P>If the section provided for the setting up of a tribunal to inquire into these two matters, one could approve of the section being left as it is. Deputy Cowan has touched the right spot when he says that the Minister will make the Order but will make it on a report received from some of his servants.  It is dangerous to give to a Minister the power and authority given to him under this section.  It is dangerous to give it to him in ordinary times.  Thank God, our courts are functioning here and will continue to do so.  We should not abrogate their powers and give them the Minister or his servants.  On fully reconsidering the matter, the Minister might agree that the section could be amended, not by its deletion <i>in toto</i> but by its coming into operation in certain circumstances, namely, a national emergency or the Army being on active service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section does not say &ldquo;when it is proved to the Minister&rdquo; but it says &ldquo;when it appears to the Minister&rdquo;. That is a dangerous word.  The Minister may justify his action, in deducting from the pay of a soldier in certain circumstances, by saying that it appeared to him to warrant it.  If the words &ldquo;is proved&rdquo; were substituted for the word &ldquo;appears&rdquo; it might go some way towards the setting up of some sort of tribunal to inquire into <Col N="638" /> the pros and cons of an act of desertion, and the leaving of the spouse of the soldier in destitute circumstances. The Minister might amend the section by adding a sub-section saying that in the event of a national emergency or of the Army being on active service, Section 99, sub-sections (1) and (2) would become operative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>One must look ahead in this respect.  We had a long discussion on this particular section in the Special Committee.  After great pressure, I decided I would look into the matter.  I have done so and while I have not consulted the Attorney-General I have consulted the legal authorities. They strongly advise its retention.  It is certainly a protection for a wife who might be left in destitute circumstances, together with her children.  I am informed that there are now and again cases where the wife and family live outside the State.  It is for that particular reason that we want to retain it.  As I have said, it is practically inoperative but it is there as a safeguard.  We have in the Bill another section which gives a complete safeguard to the situation and covers other aspects of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is all a question of how the matter comes up.  First of all, we are dealing with a member of the Army, a soldier, and practically everything that can be known is known about him.  When it comes to the attention of the military authorities <Col N="639" /> that he has deserted his wife and children and that they are in destitution, a section like this could be operated. What I mean is, that it would not be a question of some outside influence operating.  We might not be involved in that particular case except to see that the court judgment was carried out, and in that case we would have to come in.  As I say, we are thoroughly acquainted with the individual.  He is known intimately to the authorities, and he may be known to have deserted his wife.  It would be protection to have the section remain.  My legal authorities advise that it should be retained, and I do not think it will cause any difficulty if it is left in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I want to say about this is that the Minister has considered it and he has been advised to retain it.  It reminds one of the junk heap where you get people who never like to do away with anything.  They dump and dump.  Here is a section of very little practical benefit.  The Minister realises that, and the Army authorities realise it. The legal people in the Army say that while it is not of very much use, it should be kept there.  That is why, I think, it should not be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a soldier joins the Army he must join as a single man.  That is the normal thing.  If, after he joins the Army, he marries he is entitled to be paid marriage allowance and his wife is entitled to receive an allowance from the State.  If he joins as a married man then, obviously, there is a responsibility on the Minister to pay marriage allowance.  If he takes in a married man to serve in the Army he must take him with the responsibility of providing for his wife.  If a married man joins illegally as a single man, then as far as I know he can be courtmartialled for making a false statement on enlistment.  Generally, I think what happens is that they get rid of such a person because armies do not want to have difficulties in regard to such cases.  But there are <Col N="640" /> circumstances in which a man is entitled to desert his wife.  I need not go into those circumstances, but they are well known, where a man is perfectly and absolutely entitled to desert his wife.  That is where one can have difficulties.</P>
    <P>I do not know where we are in regard to the wife who is living in England.  That raises another consideration. In the ordinary way marriage allowance will not be paid to a woman living outside the State. That has been the usual practice, but there are circumstances in which it can be paid to a person living outside the State.  It does seem to me rather tough if the Army will refuse to pay a man marriage allowance because his wife is living outside the State.  Then the Minister must make an Order against the man deducting a certain proportion of his pay to send to the wife because she happens to be in destitute circumstances.</P>
    <P>I see no reason in the world for this section.  I do not think it ought to be there.  It is a carry over from the old days when general officers commanding in the field were accompanied not only by their baggage but by the wives and families of the officers and soldiers. They had their travelling canteens and all that sort of thing.  They had them in Africa, India and elsewhere where the commanding officer was a kind of father to everybody.  The wife was on the spot.  If the husband was not looking after her, the commanding officer knowing everybody, because armies were not too big in those days, could and did order the soldier to pay a sum of money towards the maintenance and support of his wife.  That could not possibly apply in this country at the moment so far as I know.  I, personally, do not know of any Order made under this.  It may be that there have been Orders made under it, but I am not aware of any Order that has been made.  If the Minister has not consulted the Attorney-General in regard to it, I think he might, perhaps before the Bill reaches the Seanad, have a word with him about it.</P>

      <P>In the Special Committee I was asked to see if some safeguards could be attached to this section.  The Deputies who raised the matter admitted at the time that they could not suggest any.  It is undoubtedly difficult to do so.  This section may often be to the advantage of the man himself, because it may be better to have a particular item of pay withheld for a short time, pending examination of whether it is in fact payable, than to get it and then have to be paying it back over a long period.  On the other hand, the section, though necessary, could admittedly give rise to hardships. On the whole, I think it will have to be left to good common-sense administration, and the only safeguard I can think of is contained in this amendment which, if it does nothing else, will at least keep before everybody concerned the wishes of the Oireachtas and will provide ground for a protest if a man thinks that any entitlement is being too long withheld.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I may say, as I am speaking on this amendment, that I cannot accept Deputy Cowan's proposed amendment of this section which provides that every temporary withholding of pay and allowances, etc., must be authorised personally by the Minister.  I am afraid that would be impracticable in the cases which occur locally from time to time in which small amounts, may be only a few shillings, are involved.</P>

      <P>This, again, raises to a large extent the difficulty we have been discussing for several days.  I did appeal, in the Special Committee, that it was a section that would cause considerable trouble and I was anxious that, before a matter like this was determined&mdash;that is, the decision to withhold pay&mdash;it should be referred to, and determined by, the Minister.  In that respect, I felt that there would be <Col N="642" /> some protection, because I wanted to make sure that the Minister would have to give a written order before the pay or allowances could be withheld. The width of this matter can arise from an examination of the section, and the section says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where any question arises as to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  whether any pay, allowance, gratuity or grant is due, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the amount of any pay, allowance, gratuity or grant due, or</P>
      <P>(c)  whether a forfeiture or deduction falls to be made of or from any pay, allowance, gratuity or grant, or</P>
      <P>(d)  the amount of a forfeiture or deduction to be made of or from any pay, allowance, gratuity or grant due,</P>
      <P>the pay, allowance, gratuity or grant may be withheld, in whole or in part, pending the determination of that question.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister does appreciate that there may be hardship here and he has suggested this amendment, to the effect that the question shall be determined with all convenient speed and that, pending such determination, the pay, allowance, gratuity or grant may be withheld in whole or in part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see that operating very harshly, and while, in relation to the previous amendment, the Minister was concerned in the section about the fact that a man's wife or children might be left destitute, there is a possibility under this section, even with the Minister's amendment, that a man and his wife and children could be left destitute, because the section provides that where somebody has any doubt as to whether he is entitled to pay or allowances, or where somebody has any doubt whether there should be a forfeiture or deduction, or even the amount of it, a man's pay is to be withheld, pending a determination of the matter.  The Minister has endeavoured to meet it by saying it will be determined with all convenient speed. While the Minister has made an effort to mitigate the harshness of what is there, his amendment hardly goes far enough, and I think there ought to be <Col N="643" />&mdash;the Minister might consider this&mdash;a limited time during which the pay or allowance would be withheld, that is, if it is to be withheld at all.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a soldier depending on his weekly pay.  His wife depends on the payment every fortnight of her marriage allowance, and, if the pay and allowance are held up simply because there is some matter to be determined for two or three weeks, or even for one week, it can create very considerable hardship in that family. Similarly, it arises in the case of an officer who receives his complete pay and allowances at the end of the month.  A hold-up of his pay and allowances for even a day may operate to create difficulty for him and I feel that if one had the protection that the stoppage could not occur unless the Minister personally made the Order, it would stop people somewhere along the line holding up that pay or allowance. As the Minister knows, one of the most difficult people in the whole machinery of administration, whether in the Civil Service, the Army or elsewhere, is the nervous person, the person who is afraid to make up his mind quickly and who is afraid that, if he allows the pay to be paid, he may be mulcted in the amount under another section.</P>
    <P>The section is one I do not like and never liked.  The Minister has made an effort, but I do not think he has, in fact, removed the objections to it, and while I admit that even my own amendment is not the best that could be moved&mdash;I make that confession, because I am sure the Minister will be glad to have it&mdash;it at least would have the effect of saying that this matter of holding up a man's pay cannot be dealt with by a company commander or by a junior civil servant in the Department of Defence.  The decision, if it is to be taken, should be taken for very good reason and should be taken only by the person in a position such as that in which the Minister is.</P>
    <P>The effect of my amendment if it were adopted would be that a man's pay could not be held up until a good case for holding it up had been made to the <Col N="644" /> Minister who, having examined it, would say: &ldquo;Yes; I order this pay to be held up for a period of seven or eight days&rdquo;, and then the question of whether a forfeiture or deduction is to take place would have to be determined within that period.  But, understanding the administration as it is in the soldiers' pay section or the officers' pay section of the Department, neither of which is manned by either officers or soldiers, a question could arise as to the responsibility of an officer or soldier to forfeit pay or have the amount of it determined, and instructions would be sent down through the usual channels to hold up that pay and not to pay the particular man on the day he should be paid.</P>
    <P>Then the man's local commanding officer cannot give him any explanation for it.  They may live on in the hope that the thing will be put right next week, and it could be that in a unit where they had some funds and where the proper spirit was there a means would be found whereby there might be some local contribution made until the thing would be put right; but that would not occur in every unit, and there are places in which it could not occur.  By the time the soldier has to complain about this he has to go through a different procedure and through a different channel.  He has first of all to complain to his company commander and if he does not get satisfaction&mdash;of course, the company commander cannot give him satisfaction because he can do nothing about his pay&mdash;then he complains to his commanding officer, and if he takes the trouble and the time he has a right, or would have a right under this Act, to go to the adjutant-general, and there are further rights preferred, so that by the time the soldier could have his complaint into the hold up of his pay investigated he could be without it for several weeks.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment does not entirely meet the position, and he understands the difficulty of providing an amendment, but I personally think that my own amendment while not, perhaps, the best, would at least have the effect of saying that nobody except the Minister&mdash;and even if the Minister <Col N="645" /> were to agree that there might be some other authority nominated as well as himself&mdash;at least until some responsible authority took the decision to withhold pay it could not be withheld. All these matters of pay and allowances are serious matters as far as soldiers and officers are concerned, and for that reason I regret that the Minister did not find it possible either to eliminate the section, because I think it should be eliminated, or to provide more specifically for the authorities who could order the hold up on the lines of the amendment that I submitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, of course, is a difficult one, and I am inclined to agree that there is no great necessity for the section.  Neither the Minister's amendment to add &ldquo;convenient speed&rdquo; nor Deputy Cowan's amendment is of any great assistance to the person involved.  Everybody knows that &ldquo;convenient speed&rdquo; could be like the Dublin Corporation and the Town Planning Act and the Kathleen Mavourneen system&mdash;it could be for years or for ever&mdash;and Deputy Cowan knows well that to get the Minister to make an Order to withhold it would take time, and it would take nearly as long to take it off, so that there is no great help in either way.  I do not know, if we are to retain the section, how it can be amended so that you would have a reasonable time.  I would ask the Minister to see could he examine it with a view to seeing that during the hearing of the case neither the soldier nor his dependents were in need or in want.  I think it is long past the time when a local fund or the charity or benevolence of a soldier's or an officer's comrades should be called on to meet the maintenance charges of either a soldier or his wife or family.  &ldquo;Convenient speed&rdquo; is better than it was, I suppose, but I do not know that it meets the case.  It would be a very great hardship if the family of a man, whether he is a volunteer, an N.C.O. or an officer, were without their pay or allowances for any considerable length of time.  Take the officer.  Unfortunately the pay is not large enough for officers to have a very substantial nest egg to meet the <Col N="646" /> end of the month's requirements, and it would be a serious matter if an officer is expecting his pay cheque at the end of the month and has responsibilities and liabilities to meet then and has, perhaps, cheques issued to be paid on the second of the month and then there was no cheque in.  Then he would be put on another charge, that he had issued cheques and that he was guilty of conduct prejudicial to good order.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to examine it and see how far he could put a limit on it.  In the cases under the previous sections the stoppage cannot exceed such as would at least leave him with one-third of his pay, and I think that there should be something like that in this; that it cannot go so far as to leave him without anything.</P>

      <P>I realise all that has been said and the effects and so on that this would have, but Deputy Cowan, himself, in the course of the discussion in the Special Committee admitted that he himself could not produce what he might regard as a satisfactory amendment.  I do not mind admitting that we, too, found considerable difficulty in finding anything that would meet this while leaving the section there.  As far as I could I have made it very clear that speed will be the essence of this whole question.  It has been made clear to everybody concerned in the administration of this particular section when it becomes law that there must not be any question of undue delay, and I think we can leave it safely to the common sense of the people who will be dealing with this&mdash; and, mind you, they will be mainly Army people.</P>

      <P>That may be perfectly all right, but it emanates, as the Deputy knows, from the Army and then if a question arises with the civil authorities it is the civil authorities who naturally deal with the question of issue of pay and so on.  But it has been made very clear, anyhow, that with the passing of this section it must be operated in a manner in which it will <Col N="647" /> not be liable to cause any hardship.  I reiterate that statement now and the fact that I am doing so will, I think, emphasise what has already been made clear and from that point of view I do not think there will be any difficulties.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 60:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 53 to delete Section 103 (3), lines 28 to 38.</P>
      <P>This is an interesting section which calls for some consideration.  It deals with the prohibition on membership of political and secret societies.  The section states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  A member of the Permanent Defence Force shall not join, or be a member of, or subscribe to, any political organisation or society or any secret society whatsoever.</P>
      <P>(2)  A member of the Reserve Defence Force shall not join, or be a member of, or subscribe to any secret society whatsoever.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Minister may by regulations&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  prohibit officers of the Reserve Defence Force, who are, during a period during which a proclamation authorising the calling out of reservists on permanent service is in force, for the time being continuously engaged in military service or duties for which as officers of the Reserve Defence Force they are liable, from participating in specified political activities, and <Col N="648" /> (b)  prohibit reservists who stand called out on permanent service from participating in those specified political activities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Considerable difficulty can arise in relation to this section.  That part of the section which deals with secret societies is not new.  It has been there, and no one can take exception to it.  Indeed, no one would take exception to the fact that a member of the Permanent Defence Forces is prohibited from being a member, from joining or subscribing to a political organisation or society but when we come to interference with the ordinary rights of citizenship of members of the Reserve we are in a completely different position.  This section proposes that a member of the Reserve who is called out on permanent service can through the medium of regulations made by the Minister be prohibited from participating in specified political activities.</P>
    <P>The whole trouble in relation to this section is the difficulty in regard to what the Minister means by &ldquo;political.&rdquo; There are political organisations which are not of a Party nature.  For that reason I think it would be unwise to deprive members of the Reserve called out on permanent service of their rights as citizens.  Certain other matters in relation to that will arise in the subsequent section in which this particular viewpoint is elaborated and extended.  Not only does the Minister think that members of the Reserve should be prohibited by regulation from engaging in political activities but such members who belong to local authority committees, to vocational educational committees or county committees of agriculture will suffer a very specific disqualification and I make that reference to the subsequent section now for the purpose of illustrating how the Minister's mind is operating in relation to political activities.</P>
    <P>We are inclined to take a too serious view altogether of the meaning of &ldquo;political.&rdquo;  We are inclined to take too narrow a view; the idea that if one engages in certain political activities one is rendered thereby unsuitable as a member of the Reserve or unsuitable <Col N="649" /> to be called out on permanent service in the event of an emergency is, in my opinion, quite wrong.  We have the examples in Britain, and elsewhere, of public representatives serving their country and continuing as public representatives during such service. During the last war and in the previous war members of the British House of Commons on active service attended the British House of Commons in uniform and nobody felt there was anything wrong in that. Remember, the British House of Commons has been described as the Mother of Parliments.</P>
    <P>Engaging in political activities should not deprive us of the quality of being good citizens.  That is where my conception differs from what is set out by the Minister in this section and the subsequent section because the Minister makes it perfectly clear that there is something obnoxious, something wrong and something contrary to good citizenship in engaging in political activities whether or not these activities are of a Party nature.  We have been told very often that it is a sign of good citizenship for a person to engage in political activities; yet, here in this section we say that members of the Reserve who are called out on permanent service must cease from any political activities in which they are engaged.  If such an individual happens to be a member of a vocational educational committee or an agricultural committee, he must resign.  That, in my view, is putting on politics a censure they do not deserve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>We were discussing in Private Members' time last week a motion moved by Deputy Kyne concerning the sale of certain properties owned by An Bord Fáilte at Tramore, a motion which alleged that public uneasiness exists in Tramore because of the sale of these properties to three private individuals, as the motion stated, at a much lower figure than possibly might have been obtained if the properties had been sold at public auction.  When speaking previously, I dealt with the suggestion that the sale was to three private individuals who had no claims to special consideration in relation to the disposal of these properties which other private citizens might not have.  I pointed out that the three individuals were, in fact, directors of a company which was set up by the Tourist Board in 1946 to acquire, develop and manage these properties; that they had acted as directors of the company without fee on behalf of the Tourist Board, that they had managed the property during the whole period of the existence of that local company and had therefore a very special interest in its future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal now with the suggestion that the price paid by these local directors of the Tramore Development Company for the properties was less than might have been secured if the properties had been disposed of otherwise. That, I think, is the kernel of the case which Deputy Kyne made for the establishment of a committee of inquiry into the transaction.  I want to make it quite clear that, so far as I am aware, the suggestion that these properties might have realised more if disposed of otherwise has not been made by anybody outside this House. It certainly was not made to me by the town commissioners who were interested in the future of the properties or by anybody in Tramore.  When I met the town commissioners to <Col N="651" /> discuss this matter with them I asked them if they suggested that a higher price could have been realised for the properties if they had been sold by public auction or otherwise than to the directors of the local development company.  They did not make that claim.</P>
    <P>When the town commissioners were themselves exploring the possibility of taking over the properties, assuming that they had the legal power and the finances to do so, they had in mind an arrangement under which no payment whatever would be made and that their obligation would be confined to the payment of an annual sum by way of interest and what they described as a small contribution by way of repayment of capital.  I have already expressed my personal conviction that by adopting the recommendation of An Bord Fáilte in regard to the disposal of these properties a much higher price was realised for them than could otherwise have been obtained.</P>
    <P>What were these properties worth? Deputies have tried to convey a misleading picture to the House by stressing the fact that during the period in which the local development company, acting on behalf of the Tourist Board, was developing the amenities of Tramore some £84,000 was spent on these amenity works.  The fact that nearly £84,000 was spent from Tourist Board funds on the development of the amenities of Tramore does not mean that saleable assets worth £84,000 were created.  A large part of the expenditure at Tramore did not create any saleable asset at all. Furthermore, all expenditure on development in Tramore ceased in 1948 and no further capital expenditure was made for a period of four years for the improvement or maintenance of the properties previously acquired.</P>
    <P>Deputies who were familiar with the conditions prevailing in Tramore before the Tourist Board got to work there will appreciate the need for a considerable expenditure to improve these conditions which was unlikely to pay off directly in a financial sense.  There was an accumulation of shacks and objectionable buildings in the vicinity <Col N="652" /> of the promenade.  So unsightly was that collection of objectionable buildings that a very well-known English newspaper columnist who visited Tramore described it as &ldquo;like the back yard of a deserted mining village&rdquo;.  A considerable part of the money spent in Tramore was used for the acquisition and removal of these unsightly structures and the creation of an open space in the vicinity of the promenade. Obviously, no saleable asset was left behind.  The intention in acquiring and demolishing the buildings was to leave an open space so that the attractiveness of that part of the town would be enhanced.  There was never an anticipation that any part of that expenditure would be directly recovered in the sense in which that term is used here.</P>
    <P>The largest single item upon which money was spent in Tramore was the construction of the hydro.  That undoubtedly provided an amenity for Tramore.  It was hoped through the construction of the hydro that the tourist season in Tramore would be lengthened.  But when we come to consider what that property would be worth to somebody buying it as a commercial venture, we have the fact that it had lost money from the day it was opened.  Any businessman coming to consider the desirability of making a bid for Tourist Board properties on sale in Tramore would consider, not what the property cost but what his prospects were of getting his investment back or getting a reasonable dividend on his investment and, coming to consider the position of the hydro, he would have to regard it, on the basis of experience of its operation up to date, as a liability.  In fact, one of the reasons why from the beginning I decided that these properties would be sold as one unit and not in separate lots was the realisation that otherwise we might be left with some unsaleable properties in the locality.</P>
    <P>When the directors of the local company were proposing to the Tourist Board, as it was then called, that they should acquire these properties, following the decision of the previous Government that the properties were to be sold, they made a calculation <Col N="653" /> which indicated that the revenue surplus from all the properties in Tramore was approximately £1,000 per year, without making any provision for interest upon the capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>A businessman investing in a property of that kind would, of course, have regard to the revenue to be derived from it.  It has been suggested here that these local directors, who had come into the whole matter on the invitation of the Tourist Board and who had acted without fee for years in the management of these properties, were solely concerned with making a &ldquo;good thing&rdquo; for themselves.  On that basis, having regard to the fact that the surplus revenue to be derived from the property was expected to be £1,000 a year, and calculating the capital value of the properties on a ten years' purchase of the net revenue, they might have regarded £10,000 as the maximum price they could have afforded to pay for these properties. In fact, An Bord Fáilte have certified to me&mdash;and I have the certificate here &mdash;that the actual net revenue from the property is £270 a year.  In considering the suggestion that in buying these properties for £22,500 the local directors were thinking only of the profit they could derive from it, it should be borne in mind that the actual profit they could hope to get, unless they invested a great deal more in developing the properties, was £270 a year.  They would have got a great deal more by putting their money into Government stocks.  Apart from any other consideration that might be advanced here, that very fact alone demolishes the contention that these properties were sold at a lower price than might have been obtained in some other way.</P>
    <P>When I resumed office as Minister for Industry and Commerce, the position of these properties had not been settled and I had to take decisions in regard to them.  I did not altogether approve of the policy of the previous Government in disposing of Tourist Board properties, in the hasty and ill-considered way in which it was proposed to do so, but I was not prepared in 1951 to reverse that policy.  I informed the Tourist Board that the <Col N="654" /> decision to dispose of the Tramore properties stood.  I was particularly concerned to safeguard the interests of Tramore in the disposal of these properties.  It would clearly not be in the interests of Tramore as a holiday resort if the fields and buildings in the vicinity of the promenade were purchased by people who were going to use them as motor-car dumps or for the carrying on of some undesirable business, and consequently I informed the Tourist Board that my decision was that the properties should be sold by way of lease containing a restrictive covenant, confining the use of the properties to purposes which would not be inconsistent with the development of Tramore as a holiday resort. When that decision was communicated to the Tourist Board and when they learned that the lease would contain that restrictive covenant, the Tourist Board's solicitor &mdash; I think those opposite know who he is, that he is a politician not attached to the Government Party&mdash;advised that if the property were sold&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The board's solicitor advised that if the property was to be put up for sale by public auction with that restrictive covenant in the lease, it was likely that only a very poor price would be secured and that the knowledge of the restrictive covenant would depress the price which might be realised.  He further advised that there was a possibility that the restrictive covenant would be set aside later by the courts.  That was the factor which gave me most concern because, as £84,000 of Tourist Board money had been spent in developing the amenities of Tramore and in improving Tramore <Col N="655" /> as a holiday resort, I did not want to see that work undone, by what I have already described as hasty or ill-considered action.  If the restrictive covenant, which I contemplated, could not be made effective it was obviously my duty to reconsider the decision I had taken that the property should be offered for sale by public auction subject to that restrictive covenant.</P>
      <P>There is the fact, which I cannot overemphasise, that there was no other purchaser of these properties in sight except the people who bought them.  A couple of inquiries had been received from people who were interested in small lots but even these inquiries were not followed up by any definite proposals.  In any case I had decided, and the Tourist Board strongly concurred in the decision, that the property should be sold as a whole and not in individual lots.  The probabilities are that if the property had been put up for sale by public auction there would be no bidder at the auction other than the local development company which ultimately acquired it.  The net result of selling the property by public auction, in my opinion, would be that the same people who now have it would get it and they would have got it at a lower price than was actually negotiated by An Bord Fáilte.  Furthermore, these people who have purchased the property have accepted the condition that the property must be used solely for tourist development purposes.  They are people who came into the business because of their interest in Tramore as a holiday resort and their intention to develop it as a holiday resort is clearly stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that I told the commissioners no later than March, 1952, that the intention was to sell the property by public auction.  It was stated by Deputy O. Flanagan that in the speech which I made in Tramore I had given an assurance that the property would be sold by public auction.  To the best of my recollection in the last ten or 15 years I have spoken at only one public meeting at Tramore, in June, 1952, and in that <Col N="656" /> speech I made no reference whatever to the disposal of these properties.  I have got the report of the speech which was published in a local newspaper at the time and it contains no reference to the disposal of these properties.  I further checked it up with the number of individuals who are most highly critical of my action in regard to the disposal of these properties and they agreed that I gave no assurance of the type suggested by Deputy O. Flanagan at that meeting.  They said that I told them privately that an offer from a local development company would be considered.  I must confess that at that time I was not very clear in my mind that there were two local development companies.  I was not aware that there was any conflict of local interest in the matter at all.  In any event if I gave that assurance in June, 1952, I would draw attention to the fact that the announcement of the sale of the property to the existing company was not made until January, 1953, and during that period no other offer for the acquisition of these properties came to An Bord Fáilte.  My sole interest in this matter was and is to ensure that the attractions of an important holiday resort such as Tramore will be properly developed.</P>
    <P>An attempt has been made to suggest that some political considerations entered into this disposal.  I have on many occasions been in Waterford and Tramore in the presence of large gatherings of people to whom I was introduced.  I want to say that to the best of my recollection I have never met any of the three local directors to whom this property was sold.  In this matter I have acted entirely upon the advice of An Bord Fáilte.  As I said, they gave the same advice to my predecessor. My predecessor also received the same advice from some of his Cabinet colleagues.  They were constant and emphatic in their view that in the interests of the development of Tramore as a holiday resort the best way of disposing of this property if it was disposed of, was to sell it to the local company that they had themselves set up.</P>
    <P>There are, perhaps, one or two minor matters to which I should refer <Col N="657" /> for the purpose of disposing of this business.  During the course of the debate Deputy Kyne said that the Waterford County Council made application for portion of the Tramore property to be used as parking space for tourist-cars and that the conditions under which they were given the property by the present owners were such that a sum of £870 for a stretch of land roughly 30 yards long by 30 feet deep had to be expended by the council so that the town commissioners could make the use of it available to tourists.  I am going to assume that Deputy Kyne does not know all the facts.  What were the conditions under which this property was acquired from the owners?  They got it for nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy also said that the Irish Countrywomen's Association rented a plot of ground from An Bord Fáilte and that they were required by the new owners to give immediate possession of that property, so that thousands of bulbs which the Irish Countrywomen's Association had planted to be in flower during the Tóstal period had <Col N="658" /> to be rooted up and that property left free of these bulbs for the new owners. Again I am going to assume that Deputy Kyne does not know the facts. An Bord Fáilte gave that plot to the Irish Countrywomen's Association for nothing.  They did not rent it: they got it free of charge and had occupation of that plot until the end of May, 1953, for three or four weeks after the Tóstal period had concluded, and the Irish Countrywomen's Association were given every opportunity to lift the bulbs and did lift them and sell them.</P>
      <P>A great deal of misinformation has been spread about this whole business and some unnecessary heat has been created.  I want to suggest that what has happened has happened now. Whether my decision was a wise decision or a wrong decision, it cannot be undone.  I said here, in speaking last week, that although the purchase price had been paid over by the local directors to An Bord Fáilte, the transaction had not been finally completed in the sense that the lease had not been signed.  The lease has been signed since and the whole business is now finished and I suggest that, instead of trying to create misunderstanding and spread a false impression regarding this business, all those who are interested in the development of Tramore as a holiday resort should now get together and see what they can do to improve it.</P>
      <P>Since the decision to dispose of these properties was taken the Tourist Act has been passed and is now in operation. There is a possibility under that Act of Tramore securing very practical financial help for development purposes.  It will greatly enhance the prospects of that help being available if an agreed scheme for the development of Tramore can be produced between all those who are interested, from the town commissioners to the owners of property who may be affected by any such development scheme.  Practical common sense now suggests that this business should be allowed to drop and that those concerned should concentrate on the work of future development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat what I said here already <Col N="659" /> that by selling this property to the local directors of the company which the Tourist Board set up in 1946 to develop it they were handing it over to those who were best fitted in many respects to develop the property in the interests of Tramore as a holiday resort, the people who had themselves invested private funds in the purchase of adjacent properties in order to protect the interests of Tourist Board property at a time when it was Government policy not to proceed with that programme.  I repeat that by the successful negotiations carried on between An Bord Fáilte and the local directors a price was secured substantially higher than could have been secured from anybody else and certainly very much higher than could have been obtained by public auction.</P>

    <P>I want to say just one final word. Many of those who have been most critical of the action taken in Tramore and who have been most prominently associated with the agitation there, are personal and political friends of my own.  I hope I have not lost either their personal or political friendship because of the course I took in the best interests of Tramore's development. I ask them, knowing them to be public-spirited people who have no other interest in this matter <Col N="660" /> except the welfare of their own town to believe that in my action in this matter I had no other interest either and now that the whole transaction has been completed they should show the genuineness of their concern for the future of Tramore by getting all interested parties together and seeing what they can work out that would ensure the development of Tramore in harmony with all interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in so stating tried to give the impression that the other two cases to which he referred were cases which could be compared with the circumstances of this one.  Of course, the fact is that that is entirely untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in this case and in the case of Killarney and the couple of acres in Portmarnock is entirely different.  What happened in Killarney was&mdash;I do not know whether it was at the direction of the present Minister&mdash;that at least with the Minister's consent the former chairman of the Tourist Board went in and bought over the heads of the Killarney Golf Club the property in which the Killarney Golf Club had facilities.  As a result of the action by the Tourist Board, the Killarney Golf Club were deprived of those facilities.  In 1948 or 1949&mdash;I forget which year it was&mdash;the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, when it was put up to him that it was most unfair to the Killarney Golf Club, being a body that catered not merely for the people of Killarney but also for tourists who visited Killarney, should have been evicted in this manner, said that provided the Killarney Golf Club paid every penny that had been paid for the property and made good the interest that had been lost to the public Exchequer by reason of the public Exchequer being out of the money, it could be bought by private treaty at cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have a very different situation, indeed, a sale at approximately a quarter of the cost.  To suggest that those two cases are comparable is just nonsense and the Minister knows perfectly well it is nonsense and was only trying to take a chance on it.  In respect of Portmarnock, there was a small area of two or three acres which <Col N="662" /> jutted out from the main property which was about one-half per cent. of the total value.  The whole property in Portmarnock was sold by public auction as the Minister admitted when we had this discussion a year ago.  It is nonsense to suggest that these examples are precedents in the manner in which the Minister tried to rely on them last Friday.  But there is something much more than that in this case which I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>This matter arose about a year ago. I have not got the date on which Deputy Kyne put down his motion in the House, but I remember the dates on which the matter was raised, first by way of question and then on the adjournment.  It was raised on the 4th February and the 11th February, 1953.  At that time and subsequently, when the agreement was put in the Library in that month, the only legal conditions that were binding on the three purchasers were the conditions that were included in the agreement signed on the 19th December, 1952. Those legal conditions contained no condition whatever that the properties were to be used restrictively for the provision of tourism in Tramore as the Minister suggested.  Deputy Little, who is a person of legal training, can go to the Library and see the agreement or, if he likes, I will send it across to him.  There was absolutely no legal provision whatsoever in the agreement that the properties were to be used for tourist purposes.  I want to suggest to the Minister that the restrictive covenant put in the lease, and very properly so, has been put in solely because of the agitation raised this time last year on the motion put down by Deputy Kyne.  The agreement, which was signed on the 19th December, 1952, and which is tabled in the Library says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The assurance to the Purchasers of the property mentioned in Part I of the said Schedule shall be by way of Lease of the said property for the term of 99 years from the 1st day of January, 1953, subject to the yearly rent of £3 clear of all deductions&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Any person used to agreements of sale such as that and who read them in <Col N="663" /> connection with their business as lawyers or otherwise, knows perfectly well that where it is intended to put restrictive covenants in a lease that is going to follow a contract for private treaty or conditions by public auction, that reference to restrictive covenants must be included in the original agreement; otherwise they are not binding on the purchasers and the purchasers can, at their option, refuse to complete such restrictive covenants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think that An Bord Fáilte had competent legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can try and bluff his way out of this but he was caught on it just as he was caught on the 4th February, 1953, when he tried to make it clear that it was being sold to the local development company and when, as a result of subsequent questions, he had to agree he was wrong and that it was the three persons as individuals.  I have not the slightest doubt but what the Minister says now is correct and that there has been a restrictive covenant put in the lease.  I accept that assurance but I say that it was not in the original agreement and it was not legally binding on the three parties concerned.  It is only being included now because the three parties concerned knew that unless they agreed to that covenant now in the lease the Minister would not have a leg to stand upon in regard thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position that has arisen in respect of these properties shows how valueless was the advice that was accepted and acted upon by the Minister during his former term of office. No matter what was spent on taking down these shacks&mdash;it was, perhaps, good business that they should be taken down; I am not prepared to argue with the Minister on that&mdash;it is fantastic to suggest that there could be anything like the difference between £22,000 and £84,000.  Either the position is that money was absolutely thrown away during that period of lavish spending or else the price now is not adequate.  I am not a valuer and I do not propose to try and assess something which I am not competent <Col N="664" /> to determine.  But I say this.  There are only two criteria of value that can be taken at any time.  One is the criterion of cost and the other is the criterion of what property makes in the open market.</P>
    <P>The Minister has abandoned the criterion of cost in this case and he has not adopted the criterion of the open market because the only way in which the criterion of the open market can be taken is to have the sale by public auction.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree on reflection that this time last year when we were discussing this matter in the House he denied he had ever said publicly that the sale was going to be by public auction.  He has now told us to-night that he did write a letter stating it was the intention to have the sale by public auction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We all have it.  The position in regard to this is perfectly clear.  Anybody knows that when notification is given that a property is going up for sale by public auction, that is tantamount to persons interested holding their hand and not disclosing their hand until the auction is held.  The Minister said he did not make a statement on a public platform. He agrees that he did make it in a public letter&mdash;it is not suggested even by the Minister that the letter was private.  It was, therefore, known that the Minister had indicated that it was his intention that the property would be put up for sale by auction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a long time previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who had that information would obviously wait until the auction was announced before they went along to make an offer because otherwise they would be only disclosing their hand without any hope of being able to get anywhere.  It would naturally be assumed that when the Minister so states, he would act according to the statement he had made.  As I say, there are two criteria of value.  So far as the criterion of cost is concerned the Minister says it is not a fair criterion.  It is the criterion of £84,000 against £22,000.  As regards the criterion of the open market, the circumstances were entirely different from those to which the Minister tried to make reference the other night.  It seems clear now, having regard to the terms of the agreement that are in the Library available for anybody who wants to read them, that it is as a result of the publicity given to the motion put down by Deputy Kyne that we have got in that lease a restricted <Col N="666" /> covenant which there was no liability on the purchasers to accept under the legal agreement they signed on the 19th December, 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection I have to this motion is that it is entirely unconstructive, that it is a purely political fishing in troubled waters.  It is not that I object to politicians; I repudiate the idea that politicians are disreputable people, but I think in the interests of Tramore, which I have very much at heart, what we want is to approach this question from a constructive point of view.  An inquiry into this matter which would lead to a barging match about what who said when, who mended their hand and whether it was the Minister or the Tourist Board that was responsible, would only mean that Tramore would suffer all the time while this barren controversy continued.</P>
      <P>I have been interested in Tramore for a very long time, since 1927.  I had all sorts of ideas as to what might be done to make improvements, for instance, the engagement of consulting engineers with a view to reclaiming the old back strand which could have been done at one period, and had further hopes of seeing improvements in the awful appearance of the old buildings in Tramore.  I also have recollections of what was done there, a matter to which reference has not been made.  At one stage the construction corps was brought in there.  The work of the construction corps had by no means merely a tourist purpose.  It was useful work and had a certain disciplinary effect upon people taken into the Army during that period on whom a considerable amount of money was spent in training.  The operation in connection with the land behind the promenade was a very expensive one, but the money was not entirely for tourist purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman spoke of the criterion of price and what should be done with regard to selling property. It is no use trying to sell property when the job is half-way through.  I happened to be over in Liverpool some time last year and I saw the condition which the present cathedral is in and in connection with which so much money is proposed to be spent. <Col N="667" /> To see it now the place is not worth anything because the work has only commenced and it has hardly got under way.  The same thing can be said of Tramore.</P>
    <P>The difficulty about Tramore is that a great deal of money will have to be spent in future if the place is to be developed.  When one thinks of places abroad which are of a real tourist type, one realises the amount of capital which ultimately must be spent. That is why I feel the Minister's appeal for some sort of united effort should be heeded.  I may say, incidentally, that for years I have been listening to complaints made about the people concerned in this property, that they represented individual interests rather than the interests of all the people of Tramore; I have heard complaints about the way this property was treated and the way certain properties were allowed to fall into decay. I had considerable sympathy with the people of Tramore but that approach is not going to lead us anywhere.  The complaints that were made in the past should be a warning to those who are undertaking operations now to make sure that the interests of the people of Tramore will be consulted.  I do hope that when the present company goes to look for money they will be able to get it from the Tourist Board.  I think that, if they get public money, public authority in some way should be represented in the management.  Somebody from the Tourist Board should be in close co-operation with those who will be managing it.  Then I believe that the town commissioners themselves&mdash;a body of good, honest, enthusiastic people about the interests of Tramore &mdash;should also have representation in the guidance and, together with that, you would want to have a really able and imaginative person with initiative who will have very definite plans as to what has to be done and who will have the courage and the energy to carry them through.  If one thinks of what has been done in other places one realises that the plans must be large plans and that, however long it may take to carry out all the plans, it should be planned on a big scale.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the <Col N="668" /> cultural side of things and I hope that aspect also will be attended to.  There are buildings which will have to go up there.  I hope the architecture of the buildings will be looked to, so that they will be something of beauty which will be an attraction to tourists and I hope they will supply the kinds of facilities which make buildings in other countries useful for festivals, concerts, drama and other entertainments.</P>
    <P>The wide fields which are in Tramore should be extremely useful from the point of view of sports and games.  The place lends itself to tremendous development.  I hope there will be that co-operation which will get representation for public interests as well as private interests and that the Tourist Board will be encouraged to put such capital into the enterprise as will make it a success and an example to the rest of the country.  Sometimes we see that the rural representation are indifferent to the interests of places like Tramore. It should be brought home to them that the market for farmers near Tramore is that which is nearest to them; that Tramore is the place where they can get the best value for their own produce and that if they have a big centre of tourism in Tramore they will have the best market possible there.</P>

      <P>On a point of information. Deputy Sweetman believes that the idea of restrictive covenant arose only following discussion in the Dáil. I should like to read an extract from a letter which was sent to the town commissioners, dealing with this question of sale by public auction, on the 21st March, 1952:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am to say that the Minister shares the views of your commissioners that it is desirable that the properties in question should be developed in the interests of Tramore as a tourist resort.  He has already given the matter careful consideration and has decided that this object can best be achieved by the sale of the properties by public auction on the basis of a long lease which will include such covenants as will ensure that the properties will be developed in the interests of the tourist traffic industry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> The idea of restrictive covenant was there from the beginning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that not stress the point?  In other words, the Minister stated in a public letter that it would be sold with those restrictive covenants and then, on the 19th December, 1952, a private deal was made, without those people being informed and without any restrictive covenants.</P>

      <P>Just before I conclude, as a matter of justice to myself, I should like to clear up something which, perhaps, I may have misunderstood. I understood the Minister in a statement to-night to quote me as saying in my opening speech that the Waterford County Council had purchased from the present owners of the <Col N="670" /> property at Tramore, property which cost them £870.  He states that the sellers did not charge that money for it.  It is not possible to have the typescript so soon, but I am sure that the Minister misunderstood me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not intentional: I quoted the Deputy's remarks as they appeared to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what I actually said, as reported in the Official Report of 12th February, 1954, column 390:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is a fact that since this land was sold to three private individuals the Waterford County Council, on behalf of the Tramore Town Commissioners, made application for a portion of the property to be used as a parking-place for the cars of tourists visiting the town, and the conditions under which they were given the property by the present owners were such that a sum of £870 for a stretch of land roughly 30 yards long by 30 feet deep had to be expended by the council so that the town commissioners in Tramore could carry out work essential to tourism.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That statement is perfectly correct.</P>

      <P>That is a different matter altogether.  The point is that they got it.  So long as I have made what I said clear, I will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>I opened the debate on this motion on a note that no charge was being preferred by me of political corruption or of bribery against the Minister or his Department and that there was no suggestion of political patronage or any underhand dealings on behalf of the buyers.  I think anyone who read my opening statement will agree that I made that very clear from the start. I also indicated that I was not prepared to take advantage of the shelter given me by the privilege of this House to make allegations against people that I could not substantiate or would not make were I not speaking in this House.  I have, in fact, endeavoured not to use a name where at all possible and I am certain that I have succeeded in making no suggestion that would lead anyone reading what I had said to believe that anybody concerned in these transactions was dishonest, either politically or in his ordinary life.  I am pretty certain of that.  I intend to conclude on the very same line.</P>
      <P>I will endeavour as far as I can to keep this matter above the line that Deputy Little alleged when he referred to me in his allegations.  He suggested that we are fishing in the troubled waters of politics.  I am seeking to establish to the satisfaction of Deputies that the trail of facts as related by me and supported by the additional information derived from various Dáil questions, replies and speeches of the Minister, Mr. Lemass, both last week and this week and last February gives ample ground for a full investigation by a Select Committee of this House so that the minds of the people can be cleared as to whether something was done, either intentionally or unintentionally, which involved the use of public money in the interest of private people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> The Minister or his Department is not on trial in this motion.  This motion does not attempt to say that in the Tramore proceedings anything was done by him or his Department or by the buyers that would hold them up to odium, that would put their character in disrepute, but it is suggested that the circumstances, so altering and changing, so different from what happened before, are such as to cause uneasiness, suspicion and distrust, that they have actually caused that uneasiness, suspicion and distrust and that it is as much in the Minister's interests and the interests of the buyers as in that of the whole people, that the matter should be once and for all cleared.  It is only by the appointment of a Select Committee, comprised of all Parties in this House, who would investigate the facts and bring a report to the Dáil that all that cloud, that suspicion, all that unrest that there is, particularly in Waterford City and County, can be cleared once and for all.</P>
    <P>I suggest that is not unreasonable.  I suggest that the motion is not one that the Minister should object to.  In the interests of good government, in the interests of the people as a whole, the motion should be accepted and welcomed. There will be no one more pleased than I will be if, the Select Committee having investigated the matter, a report comes to this House saying that everything has been fair and honourable, that there is no need for uneasiness.  Then I certainly will feel that I have done a good job for my county and my country, that I have assisted the Minister in carrying out his duties and that I have assisted future Ministers who will be supported by the fact that such an investigation can always be held should doubt arise.</P>
    <P>If wrong has been done and if the report is contrary to what I hope it will be, it will be for this House to indicate whether punishment should be inflicted and where it should be inflicted but at the present moment there is no suggestion in the motion that something wrong has been done or that anybody should be punished.  It is a request for investigation, free and <Col N="673" /> full, so that this country may have confidence in good government.</P>
    <P>In opening the debate I suggested that there were three points that Deputies might put to themselves when listening to the facts as outlined and when listening to the discussion. I asked was the sale carried out in the normal manner.  Deputy Sweetman made a case to-night that I would have attempted to make had he not spoken prior to me.  I was amazed to hear the Minister state here on last Friday that this was not an exception; it had been done by the inter-Party Government; it had been done by the Government before that; that there was nothing exceptional in the fact that Tourist Board property was sold by private treaty without having been first offered to the public by public auction. He gave me the impression, whether he intended it or not, that in the case he quoted not only was it so, but there was no question about it.  Deputy Sweetman indicated pretty clearly to-night that that was not so.  On the 11th November, speaking on an adjournment debate in this House, Deputy Sweetman replied to that suggestion in even more detail than he did to-night.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to establish whether or not this was a customary method of disposing of property, sale by private treaty, or whether it was an exceptional way.  In order to clear our minds on that I quote Deputy Sweetman speaking in the Dáil on the 11th February, 1953, recorded in the Official Reports, Volume 136, No. 5, at column 818:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Two properties were sold by private treaty.  One was the Killarney property, which had been bought over the heads of the Killarney Golf Club by the previous chairman of the Tourist Board at the instigation of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It was bought over their heads by the Tourist Board and when it came up for sale they were given the option of buying it back.  And at what price?  At the full cost to the Tourist Board, plus interest on the money <Col N="674" /> that had been expended.  If this was a case in which these people in Tramore were being offered a chance of buying this property for £84,000 plus interest on the £84,000, it would be one thing, but instead it is being handed over to these people secretly and privately at quarter of the cost, compared to the other case where they were charged the full cost, plus interest.  The other sale by private treaty was one concerning two or three acres that jutted into the golf club on the site of the Portmarnock property and which did not in any way affect the sale of the property.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That makes it pretty clear that even though things were sold by private treaty there were exceptional circumstances which justified that.  There is no attempt by the Minister to prove that there is anything at all appertaining to Tramore under that heading which justified the sale by private treaty.  In fact, it is quite the contrary. I can quote the Minister from his own speech as indicating that as late as March of 1953 he was satisfied that the property should be sold and sold by public auction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait until I make sure. Yes, March, 1952, is correct.  Let me be fair to the Minister.  He said that &ldquo;reluctantly&rdquo; he came to that conclusion, but that he was satisfied, at that stage.  The Minister denies that he made a statement in Tramore in June, 1952, indicating that he was still of that opinion.  Although in Tramore on the same evening, I cannot claim&mdash;as I very well might claim&mdash;having heard him say it.  I did not: I was engaged equally in political speech-making.  But I can quote from the <i>Waterford Star</i> of January 9th, 1953.</P>

      <P>Maybe I am growing blind.  If you can see something different in it from what I see, that is all right with me.  I am suggesting that the Minister was quite convinced&mdash;certainly in March, likely enough in June, and then by a letter, not sent from him, it is true, at least I do not think it was, but the letter arrived to the town commissioners on the 16th September <Col N="677" /> from the Minister's office&mdash;that before any definite decision would be come to, Tramore Town Commissioners would be notified.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;On the 21st August, 1952, An <Col N="678" /> Bord Fáilte reported to me that there had been further discussions with the local directors of Tráigh Mhór (Tramore Development) Teo. as a result of which the local directors had submitted a firm offer to purchase the properties for £20,000, payable in cash, and had given an undertaking that the properties to be acquired would be developed in the interests of tourism. An Bord Fáilte stated to me that they were satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, and in particular to the requirement that the Tramore properties be developed in the interests of tourism, it would be preferable to accept this offer and not to proceed to dispose of the property by public auction.  In the light of this recommendation from An Bord Fáilte, and after consultation with the Minister for Finance, I indicated to An Bord Fáilte that I was prepared to agree to the sale of the properties on the basis proposed if, after further negotiations, the local directors could not be induced to improve on their offer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If I knew that the Minister was going to make the point which he has made I could have got quotations going further back indicating that he had his mind made up to give it to these three people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the letter to the town commissioners made it clear that the matter was being considered by An Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a considerable difference of opinion as between the interpretation which the Minister places upon it and the interpretation placed on it by the town commissioners. That may be unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>An announcement was not made for four months after that and we got no offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement was made just too late for them to have an opportunity of doing anything.  The point is as to whether it is the usual procedure to sell by public auction or by private treaty.  I think I have given enough facts to enable any honest <Col N="679" /> Deputy to decide that in this case the normal thing would be a public auction.  The Minister indicated, up to a point at least, that he favoured that. He made that public in a letter and it is to be implied from a public speech he made that the normal procedure is a public auction.</P>
      <P>If a change took place, and we know there was a change, I suggest that the next point to be examined is this: were there any particular circumstances that justified either the Minister in agreeing or An Bord Fáilte in recommending that such a change be carried out?  The Minister states in justification of his change of mind that he did it on the advice of An Bord Fáilte.  He suggests that he feared that other interests, alien interests, might purchase the property if it was put up for public auction and use it against the town of Tramore and against the interests of tourism in Ireland generally.  He implied in his speech in this House on 4th February, 1953, that he suggested a covenant be put into this private treaty that would protect the interests of Tramore. Deputy Morrissey challenged him on the fact as to whether or not that very same covenant could not be put in, in the case of a sale by public auction. The Minister did not repudiate that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that the board's solicitor said that such a covenant in a lease sold by public auction could be upset in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that Deputy Morrissey in his statement said that the very same covenant could be put in in the case of a sale by public auction just as well as it could in a sale by private treaty, and that the Minister did not repudiate that.  Rather the Minister agreed that was so.  I will give the quotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the letter written to the town commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that, because the people who were to receive the property had been, or were, the directors of Tramore Limited, and <Col N="680" /> had in the past given good service, he felt justified, having assured himself that the best price was got, in sanctioning the sale to these people.  To my mind, at any rate, that would imply, as I am quite sure it would to the minds of most people, that these people had some outstanding merit.  I would remind the Minister that among the Tramore Commissioners there was a former director of the same company, and that in Tramore town there also was a former member who, when approached to take part in this deal, indicated that he would have none of it unless a public company was floated in which shares were offered to the people of Tramore in general.  That was Mr. Fleming.  I think it is to his credit.  I have no hesitation in using his name, and I use it because of that. I use it to verify my words that he said he would have none of it because the ordinary people of Tramore were not getting an opportunity of taking part in this company.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister knows well that the Tramore Town Commissioners is comprised of a body of very keen pro-Tramorites, of people who in their own right could produce finance equally with the people who have purchased this property and who could get credit in their own right to bid for this property.  Mr. Morris, a member of the town commissioners, was also a director with the two people concerned, but he is not a member who purchased the property. I suggest to the House that there is not a single circumstance that could justify an alteration from the decision to sell by public auction and to sell through private treaty.</P>
      <P>The final point I want to make is whether or not the best price was got, or as to whether or not the best interests were served by this private treaty sale.  All I can say is that I am authorised to state that the chairman of the Town Commissioners of Tramore &mdash;that he and other members, in company with a number of businessmen, were prepared to pay a higher price than £22,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did they not tell me that?  This is the first time that <Col N="681" /> has been said, after the deal has been completed.  They came to me and said they would pay nothing except a yearly contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that the chairman of the Tramore Town Commissioners is telling an untruth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that he <Col N="682" /> made no such offer to my Department or to An Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that he said it.  I said that I was authorised to state it.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
