      <P>While there are many points upon which I could speak in this Estimate, it would be unfair of me to keep the Minister waiting any longer, particularly as there are other members anxious to speak.  There are, however, one or two points I should like to mention before concluding. First of all, I ask the Minister to realise, as I believe he does, the danger which would affect our whole political life, and particularly that of local government, if we were to have a continuation of the system of dictatorship from the top administered through county managers dealing with members of local authorities.  If there is to be any hope of success for people who give their time on local authorities, county councils and corporations, the Minister should realise that there should be less red tape in his Department.  I believe that the Minister will endeavour to see that within the next 12 months much of what has happened in the past 12 months will be obliterated. <Col N="702" /> Members of the various authorities and officials in the various county councils have had to put up with a system which was, to say the least of it, most embarrassing.</P>
      <P>Time and again we have had occasion to draw attention to files being held in the Department of Local Government without any decisions being reached thereon.  One of the best ways to tackle the problem for the benefit of the local authorities is for the Minister to make sure, as I believe he contemplates, that there will be a greater degree of co-operation between his Department and the local authorities and, what is also of great importance, that a greater degree of freedom be given to local authorities in the matter of their everyday decisions.</P>
      <P>The problem of rents was mentioned. I do not propose going into a matter which, I presume, will be before the House in the near future.  There is the matter of rents which affect tenants in the various council houses.  We have all met that problem, and at times it seems rather difficult to try and solve it at all.  We do not wish to impose severely on the people who pay through the rates.  We cannot demand 100 per cent. grants from Government Departments for everything.  However, this problem of rents must be faced.  In County Cork&mdash;I am sure the problem also exists in other counties&mdash;we have tenants who find it practically impossible to pay the rents for the houses allocated to them.  It is not sufficient to say: &ldquo;Here is a council house.&rdquo; Even in the case of new homes provided by county councils, tenants are not in a position to pay some of the exorbitantly high rents charged by local authorities at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, the Minister informed us that he intends considering legislation to deal with the County Management Act.  Local authority members wish it to be understood that, when they are prepared to give their time to local authorities, they at least expect fair consideration not alone from the Department and the Minister but also from the officials who are known in County Cork as assistant county managers.  Other members of the House who will speak from other parts of the Chamber will, I believe, <Col N="703" /> also draw attention to the problem created where members unanimously suggested certain recommendations to an assistant county manager and they were refused.</P>
    <P>I will finish by saying that, in whatever legislation the Minister may intend to introduce here, let us approach it from the viewpoint of trying to make it as easy as possible for the local authority members and officials all to combine.  If we can do that, and if the Minister can, during his term of office, give to local government that true feeling of local independence, he will have achieved a great deal for local authorities, and ultimately for the people, who depend so much to get their everyday problems solved through local authorities, and will have given a contribution to this State which in itself will, perhaps, mean much more than some of the activities we hear so much of in other Departments of State.</P>

      <P>I have listened to Deputy Desmond and Deputy McQuillan yesterday on this question of the roads.  I have also listened to Deputy Desmond advocating the restoration of the haphazard scheme of the previous inter-Party Government under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, and God help the country if the Minister takes his advice to restore that scheme, which had neither a beginning nor end and which did more harm than good. Public money was expended under the Local Authorities (Works) Act shovelling out bits of drains, heaping the sides of the drain with rubble and everything else, and before 12 months was out the stuff shovelled on the banks was shoved in by cattle and the position was worse than in the beginning. There was no system.  There was no inspection.</P>

      <P>That money was spent all over the Midlands and it was not economically spent.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will not listen to the appeal by Deputy Desmond to restore the spending of similar sums under that Local Authorities (Works) Act. There are arterial drainage schemes, and I would suggest that if the areas served by these arterial drainage schemes, which are now done under direct labour, was extended to include the larger catchment there would be much more valuable service rendered in the drainage of land than under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
      <P>There is a system there handed down from the contract time whereby there was a method of dealing with what was removed from the bed of the river and where the work was done under engineers trained and with a knowledge of their subject.  That has been carried out, and the maps and the system have been handed over to the county engineering staff, and it has been worked very effectively all over the country.  My suggestion is that the catchment area could be enlarged and the yearly drainage and maintenance of smaller streams could be carried out in those large areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, might I point out that there was wholesale abuse under the <Col N="705" /> Local Authorities (Works) Act, that large farmers in my area with areas of anything from 500 to 1,000 acres of land got their whole farms drained at the public expense and that the labour content in these farms dropped?  Men used to be employed for periods each year in doing the drainage which they should do themselves but which was done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I suggest that if it is resurrected again the way it was some years ago these men will avail of it again and use their influence and get their large farms drained, work which they should do themselves.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister does not accede to the Deputy's request to give large sums of money under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>Are we going to have a reversal of the policy in regard to roads?  The roads are being tackled now.  Under the previous Minister a five year plan was worked out for the doing of the county roads.  That plan is now in course of implementation.  Roads are being done in the country parts and large tracts of county roads are in the middle of their construction under the five year plan.  Is that going to be abandoned?  Is that what Deputy Desmond wants, and the money taken out of the Road Fund and given to those useless schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act?  Surely the people in rural Ireland are entitled to as good roads as the people in the big towns.  Surely the people who have to go to Mass every Sunday distances of seven and eight miles over county roads and by-roads, and send their children to school, are entitled to as good a highway as persons living, say, in Mullingar or Athlone.  We should like to hear the Minister on that particular matter.</P>
    <P>The five year plan is there, and in my particular county the county surveyor at our request has made out a second five year plan to follow the first. In the County of Westmeath when we considered this problem we got 920 miles of road full of pot holes and we can do only about ten or 12 miles a year.  Are we going to abandon that now?  Is that the policy of the inter-Party? Is that the policy that the <Col N="706" /> Labour Party are advocating through Deputy Desmond?  Are these people not entitled to as good roads to their churches, their schools, their sports grounds and their burial grounds as the people in the larger towns?  Is the Road Fund going to be raided?  We are in the motoring age.  Along these roads, if our farmers are not using their own car or lorry their produce whether it be eggs, fowl, cattle or sheep, is all brought by lorry now.</P>
    <P>A request came to a colleague of mine during the present week, a county councillor in the Coole area.  The road from Delvin to Raharney is in the Dublin milk district, a distance of over five miles, and the lorries have to come down from here and the people have to bring out the milk to the roadside to serve the City of Dublin.  With the big traffic the road has become impassable. It is in our second five-year plan.  Is that going to be abandoned?</P>
    <P>Again, Bord na Móna have opened up at Inny Junction.  There are hundreds of men employed there at good wages all the year round.  There is a day and night shift there.  The road into it is impassable from Multyfarnham to Coole.  There are men constantly employed throwing gravel and broken stones into the pot holes.  Is the Labour Party policy to abandon the scheme to do that road?  Those men go in on bicycles to work in Inny Junction and must go over those pot holed roads and no relief given to them.  Instead we must get millions and give them to the big graziers of Westmeath to do the drains in their land which heretofore they employed men to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he was.  Anyway in the last few years the Road <Col N="707" /> Fund was devoted to the roads and we would like to know where we are with the inter-Party.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister to indicate to us, if it is in order, what the policy is regarding the county roads.  Deputy McQuillan is the very man who advocated at the Roscommon County Council that cul-de-sac roads, which it is now legal for the council to deal with under legislation passed here, should be included.  I remember seeing in the local papers circulating in Roscommon and Westmeath a number of these roads advertised and they ran into hundreds of miles.  I think the cost of doing a county road at present is £3,500.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond talked about low rents.  In the building of all these houses by municipal authorities and county councils, the principle of a trade union wage and short hours has been laid down, and I want to ask him and the Labour Party how we are to have cheap houses while paying the highest wages, with short hours.  I stand for a good wage and short hours, but there is no magical solution of the problem of providing very cheap houses on the basis of paying these wages. The very people who advocate this&mdash;I am not charging Deputy Desmond or his Party with it; I refer to the Party with which they are associated&mdash;are the people who advocate a low rate. One of the principal charges on the rates is housing and there are large sums amounting to 5/- and 6/- every year&mdash;a rising amount&mdash;for the repayment of loans in order that houses may be let at the rents at which they are let.  How is that problem to be solved and the rents brought down?  Are we to have a high rate for it?  We should be very clear on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of valuations was dealt with and it is a matter which needs to be examined by everybody because its solution is very difficult.  One man builds an extension to his premises which can be seen, and another man extends back and the extension is not known of.  Both may be business houses and one gets an increased valuation, while the other escapes.  It is the duty of the rate collector to report both and <Col N="708" /> the rate collector may be unaware of the second extension.  I am very conversant with this whole subject and I know what I am talking about.  It has occurred all over the country and I suggest that there should be considerable tightening up of this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell) Patrick O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Local Government has anything to do with valuations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Beyond collecting the money when the valuation is made. However, I will not pursue that point. The Department has something to do with the compilation of the register and again the rate collector is responsible. After an election, we hear about so many people having been left off the register, and, in one area I know of, there were 26 people off the register in two elections.  They were not all my supporters, either.  One hears that complaint in every area.  I know that various Ministers have sent out directions to the secretaries of county councils to tighten up on this matter, but, after every election, whether municipal, county council or Dáil election, one hears the same complaints &mdash;not universal but sufficient to be serious&mdash;as to a proportion of the electorate in a particular electoral district having been disfranch sed.  I have seen cases of a wife being left off and in other cases the husband being left off, and cases also of a new spelling of a name, but that is probably got over in the booth.  I put it to the Minister that he should examine the question afresh.  I congratulate the Department&mdash;if it has been done at their direction&mdash;on the register being published on one side of the sheet.  I have seen it in a few places and it is a great improvement and a help to those fighting an election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge that there should be full co-operation between the Minister's Department and other Departments in the matter of having the <i>hotel de ville</i> idea in local administration, to have all the municipal and Government buildings together.  When a person comes into a town and wants to go to the county council office for a birth-certificate, to the old age pension <Col N="709" /> officer, to the labour exchange or to the national health offices, it may involve a visit to the county council office, a walk of half a mile to the pension officer and a further walk to the labour exchange somewhere else.  If there was co-operation between all the Departments&mdash;I have been advocating this for a number of years&mdash;and if there was one composite building, with full co-operation between the municipal authorities, the local authorities and the various Government Departments, the public whom we are all out to serve would be given a very good service. Sin iad na rudaí a bhí le plé agam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, the most important section of the Minister's Department is the housing section. I have sat through the long watches of this debate and was amazed to find that more stress was not put on housing and on suggestions for its improvement, for its speeding-up.  I come from the constituency of Waterford, and I have the honour to be a member of the local authority there. Our housing problem is acute.  As a matter of fact, I often thought it was desperate, but listening to Deputies from other centres, especially Cork, I have come to the conclusion that we have not done so badly in Waterford.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to something which I think would ease the housing situation. Newly-weds do not qualify for council houses, and they cannot get a house under the existing regulations.  There are quite a number of these people, of the working and artisan class, who earn good wages and who could build houses for themselves under the Small Dwellings Act.  They could put down £100 but they are afraid to incur the high liability which the building of such a house would impose upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They therefore have to go into lodgings or digs for four or five years and if during that period they have three or four children they then qualify for a council house having suffered the hardships of living in lodgings and in tenements.  They are then given one of the houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Act at a rent of about <Col N="710" /> £1 a week.  They are no sooner in it than they are informed that they can notify the local authority that they wish to purchase their house.</P>
    <P>I do not think I should waste the time of the House or the Minister in explaining every detail and giving all the figures, but it would be a good thing if the Minister gave the same attention to private building under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  The man would put down £100 and the rent would be in the region of £1 a week and that newly-wed young man or artisan with a reasonably good job could build his own house.  This type of people form themselves into guilds and build four, eight or ten houses.  I have heard Deputies here say that the reason that is not done in Dublin or maybe in Cork is that there are no sites available.  This is something we can compliment ourselves on in Waterford. Through the competence and foresight of the city manager&mdash;who was in limbo for four years after the passing of the Managerial Act and then was brought into his own and made city manager&mdash;and through the foresight of the council to which I have the honour to belong, we purchased extensive tracts of land in the green belt of Waterford at from £60 to £120 an acre.  We are in the enviable position that we are prepared to give a lease to anybody who wants to build a house under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  We will give him a lease of a site for £2 a year and no fine.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give this his serious consideration.  In the long watches of this debate&mdash;I have heard every word of it and, being a greenhorn, I only got in now &mdash; I thought for a long, long period that the Minister was the Minister for Cork City. Now I am going to talk about roads and the Minister need not be afraid that the roads I will talk about will be the long, weary, weary roads we heard spoken about yesterday through three different sessions.  I know my colleagues&mdash;there is one of them in the House, a Deputy from Waterford&mdash;will not stand up after me and weary the House with what I have already said.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> There is a very beautiful village and seaside resort, Dunmore in County Waterford, and this is an example of first things first.  Many thousands of pounds were spent on straightening the road to Dunmore.  The people of Dunmore are often without water for a month at a time.  I think that engineers' and workmen's time would be better spent in putting the water into Dunmore first.  I would also respectfully submit to the Minister that that money would be better spent in surfacing many of the byroads and when we have the byroads done we could get back to the main roads and take away those bends.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned red tape.  With one exception I have always found the officials of the Department of Local Government both courteous and anxious to meet me in regard to any matter I put before them.  What I have to say is not an attack on them but on the system.  I have opposed the managerial system since I came into public life.  I am in the happy position of being a member of a council that is administered by a manager who is an opponent of the managerial system and who hopes and prays that the managerial system will be done away with, and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>A great deal of time has been lost and is being lost because of red tape, the production of plans and specifications and sending them to the Department for sanction.  Goodness knows how long some of these matters have taken.  I have often discussed the building of houses with people in Waterford who were newly-weds with three and four children.  They were in digs for probably four and five years, and I said: &ldquo;We are about to start a scheme in such a place at such a time.&rdquo; They would probably have three more children before the scheme would be started.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that the Department send out a book of approved plans if they <Col N="712" /> are so insistent that they and only they can design a house.  It was done before in 1925.  I am under the impression that all the county engineers and county surveyors down the country have built so many houses according to the rules laid down by the Department that they are just as conversant with them now as any engineering department.</P>
      <P>Yesterday it was a blow to my principle of opposing the managerial system and it was a blow to me to think that the great City of Cork, through their Deputies here, were inviting two senior officials of the Department to go down and show them what they could do.  What I am asking the Minister to do is to keep his officials out of the City of Waterford and we will do our own business ourselves.</P>
      <P>In regard to this matter of sanction, I believe that the plans and specifications could be left to the local officials, the local engineers and architects who are qualified and competent to draw up plans and specifications.  Under the present system we have two men doing one man's job.  An engineer or an architect in the local authority will draw up the plans and the specifications of a housing scheme.  He has the local knowledge, and they are drawn up in conjunction with his manager and, very often, in conjunction with the council. They then disappear into the limbo of the Custom House and if any small quibble arises the engineer down the country and the engineer in the Custom House get into a tug-of-war.</P>
      <P>They are like two goats spancelled together, one pulling in one direction and the other pulling in the other direction; they get nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hope that one day our writ will run in the Six Counties.  I know they have a lot of laws and regulations there which would not fit in with ours, but there is one regulation that I think we could adopt with advantage. The Minister lives in close proximity to the Six Counties and he is probably more conversant with affairs there than I am.  In the Six Counties there is a rule that if a local authority does not receive a reply to the proposals put up to the appropriate Department there within a period of three weeks <Col N="713" /> that local authority may take it that they have sanction to go on with the job.  I think that rule is worthy of the Minister's consideration.</P>
    <P>In Waterford City, through the foresight of the city manager and the corporation, we have acquired large tracts of land.  One of these tracts consisting of nearly 65 acres is capable of providing sites for nearly 600 houses.  We are at the moment building 39 by contract and 39 by direct labour. Those being built by direct labour will be completed very shortly.  The site plan for the whole of this 65 acres was drawn up by our town planner.  Years ago, when everyone was talking about post-war development, we were doing something about it.  That plan was submitted to the Department of Local Government and, so far as I know, it was approved.</P>
    <P>Now, according to the Department's regulations, when the 39 houses being built by direct labour are completed, further plans and specifications to cover another 39, or 69, or 109 will have to be sent up to the Department though the intention is to build the same type of house on the entire site. The men engaged on the direct labour scheme will be walking about the streets of Waterford waiting for sanction to come down.  I cannot see any necessity for sending up these plans and specifications at all.  Only that the Department has a lever in relation to the withholding of grants, the Mayor of Waterford and the corporation would go on with the building of these houses and take no notice of the Department at all.</P>
    <P>I thought that the Minister had jurisdiction in connection with valuations, but, during the course of this debate, I discovered that he had no such authority at all.  I will refrain, therefore, from mentioning valuations.  I can assure the Minister that he has my good wishes and the good wishes of the people whom I represent.  We look to him in the very important task that he has before him and his Department in relation to the housing of our people. When I return to Waterford, I will bring back with me a message of hope. I will be able to assure the people that <Col N="714" /> I have no doubt but that we will solve the very acute housing problem in less than four years and we will not sentence our people to ten years of bad housing&mdash;a period I heard mentioned here yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing that we can say now, and that is that Waterford will not go without being heard whilst we have Deputy Lynch here.  I was surprised, however, to hear that they are only building 39 houses by direct labour and 39 houses by contract in a big city like Waterford.  That figure looks very small to me.</P>

      <P>We have built a couple of hundred houses in the town of Cobh and we intend building a couple of hundred more there.  Cobh is a small town.  Small as this bit of an island is, I am afraid we will always find that &ldquo;what is one man's meat is another man's poison.&rdquo;  I heard Deputy Kennedy talking about Westmeath a while ago.  Now, I happened to get a job down in Westmeath away back about 1929 or 1930.  I was sent there on a by-election.</P>
      <P>The people were very nice and very hospitable but they did not fit in with my ideas at all because I was accustomed to a farming district where we are knocked up out of bed at 6 o'clock in the morning.  In Westmeath no one gets up before 11 o'clock.  They go out then and they have a look at the bullocks.  They come back and they have a read of the paper.  They eat their dinner and they go out to have another look at the bullocks.  I spent five very happy weeks there.  I am not surprised at Deputy Kennedy's statement that the Local Authorities (Works) Act will not suit them.  I have had a long experience of that Act as a representative of the ratepayers for some 30 years odd in Cork County Council.  I had the honour of having letters from me to the Minister being read out here when the Local Authorities (Works) Act was introduced. I know the good work that was done in my constituency under that Act.  I know the good work that is still waiting to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> Only last Monday at the meeting of the county council we had a deputation from an area known as Ballymacoda in connection with the problem of the Gortnawaddy River where there is an area of something in the region of 200 to 300 acres of land destroyed by flooding and where I had to advise the tenants to have the lands declared derelict in order to get out of paying both their rates and their annuities. The scheme in connection with this river was put forward some years ago and some four years ago money was granted.  Unfortunately one does not receive sanction for schemes like this until the month of November and, as everyone knows, work cannot be done on rivers between November and March.  If the work is not finished on 31st March the money is gone.  Let there be an end to that kind of thing. That was the sole reason why we had the deputation to which I have referred before us last Monday.</P>
    <P>The position was that we could not get sanction for the drainage of that river from the Department of Local Government before the month of November, and we all know what can be done on rivers between November and March.  We have a lot of other proposals of the same kind.  I admit that some of the work that was done under the Act was not a complete success, but that was the fault of something here in Dublin which I propose to deal with as well as I can now.  It is that an endeavour should be made to get some co-operation between the brass hats of Local Government and the brass hats in the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I have repeatedly appealed in this House for co-operation between, for instance, the Department of Local Government and the Department of the Board of Works in regard to roads.  I will give an example of what I mean.  About seven years ago I was walloping principally at the Board of Works, I admit, to get an advance for a road down in my place at Churchtown South.  It is in my constituency.  I succeeded ultimately in getting a grant of £1,000 on condition that the county council would put up £400 to make this new road. That was all right and the scheme came down to the county council.</P>
      <P>At once we found that there was a difference between the two Departments. The Board of Works specified and estimated for a road 11 feet wide. Our county surveyor told us that under his regulations he could not build that road unless it was 16 feet wide.  As a result of the difference between the two Departments the road has not been made.  The position is that you have one road there which is 12½ feet wide and another road which is ten feet wide, and the road to connect the two according to the county council surveyor, under the regulations of the Local Government Department, should be 16 feet wide.</P>
      <P>I suggest that some of the gentlemen who were mentioned here yesterday as being engaged in the planning of schemes should get a job such as this of trying to bring some sanity into the two Departments.  This difficulty, as I have said, arose about six or seven years ago.  The Minister will find a letter in his Department from the Cork County Council asking that an official from his Department and an official from the Board of Works should be sent down to discuss this problem with us with a view to seeing if we could get the two Departments to agree so that we could go ahead with the work.  The Minister will find a lot of material on the files in his Department about this particular matter, and I suggest that he should have a look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been invited to talk about Youghal bridge, and I have no hesitation <Col N="717" /> in doing so.  When the representatives of the ratepayers of two counties set up a committee to consider a problem of this description and a consultant is to be appointed, I should like to know who is to appoint the consultant?  Do the two managers take it on themselves to ignore that committee, which is representative of the ratepayers of two counties, by setting up a little selection board of their own to appoint the consultant and not even have the courtesy to tell the representatives of the ratepayers who the consultant is that has been appointed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <P>I can guarantee that I will see the finish of this matter.  It is a matter that concerns the expenditure of roughly £500,000 by the ratepayers and the taxpayers.  I do not know how much of that the taxpayer has to face, but I do know what the ratepayer has to face; but if the Minister intends introducing an amendment to the County Management Act, as evidently his predecessors in office also found it necessary to do, I can give him this guarantee that the more he cuts off the powers of these poohbahs, the more pleased I will be.  I have no hesitation in saying that.</P>

      <Col N="718" /> I find myself in the unenviable position that, in order to protect my constituency, instead of being in this House next Thursday, I shall have to be present as a witness in regard to some of the things that have been carried out in the name of the board of health, of which I am chairman, by the manager against a unanimous decision given on two occasions by that board of health.</P>

I should like to talk of the number of officials employed, say, by the Cork County Council on the day the county manager was appointed, the number of officials employed to-day, and the cost under both heads.  When we talk about the rates, we know that there is one particular item in regard to the rates that cannot be reduced, one that will always go up, and that is the salaries of officials.  Anyone walking into some of our county council offices to-day would almost think that he was in the Department of Local Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am dealing with now.  Last Monday, not alone had we one assistant but we decided on getting them two to catch up with arrears.  I say this much, and have no hesitation in saying it, that if they carried out their duties in a commonsense manner and a little more in keeping with the wishes of the elected representatives of the people, their work would be a lot easier and shorter, and they would not want any assistants. Some of those gentlemen, once they begin to expand when they get into office, become Hitlers before they are six months in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you ever tell them that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; and I hope to tell them a lot more next Thursday when we can deal with them out in the open.</P>
      <P>Those are some of the matters I would like to have dealt with and I would like particularly when the Minister is considering the powers of the managers under the new Bill that he would consider the question of rents alluded to here by Deputy Desmond. We find ourselves in this extraordinary position: houses were built under our local authority and rents were charged on them.  Agreements were issued and a rent of 8/- per head plus rates was specified and the applicants for those houses were asked whether they were prepared to pay that rent before they went in.  They signed forms stating that they were.  They had been two years in the houses when the manager got another idea and said the rents should be 11/- per week plus rates&mdash;an increase of 3/- a week&mdash;and he claps it on, although the unanimous voice of 20 members of the South Cork Board of Health has on two occasions decided that the rent shall be only 8/-.  He has persisted in that and issued notices to quit and he has now summoned a tenant in court for possession. I think it is about time that we had some sense or ruling in matters of that description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know what my duties are.  I want to be fair to everybody.  When the manager fails in one idea&mdash;differential <Col N="720" /> rents&mdash;and when he finds the board would not have that, he switches over to this game.  In various districts, and in my own area as well, we have our water rents increased by as much as 350 per cent., and apparently the elected representatives of the people have no power or authority on these matters.  I would like to know where we stand.</P>
    <P>In a reply to a question here yesterday we were told that a certain part of a road about four miles from Cork City is going to cost £40,000 and the local authority is to pay £1,000. I would like to know who is to pay for the removal of six houses on that road&mdash;six good houses?  Who is to be responsible for finding alternative accommodation for the tenants of these houses?  And who is to be responsible for the compensation per house that is being paid to the owners of the houses?</P>
    <P>Regarding the expenditure of whatever money we have on roads, whether it be out of the Road Fund or out of the ratepayers' pockets I would like to say this much: there is no pleasure for the ratepayers in my constituency in finding that in those modern times the modern machinery cannot be brought into their farms because they have culs-de-sac or boreens leading to their farms and therefore, they have to do without this machinery.  For instance, they cannot have even the lorries to remove their beet and that beet has to be dragged out for a mile or a mile and a half of boreen first.  They have to forget that there are such things in the world as combine-harvesters or other machinery.  But they are paying rates and taxes for the expenditure on this four miles of road of £41,000 plus&mdash;to my mind&mdash;at least £10,000 compensation which has not appeared in the Minister's reply given yesterday.</P>
    <P>To my mind this country would be better served and the producers of food and wealth in this country would be better served if that money and money like it&mdash;whatever money we have in that line&mdash;was devoted to giving those people who have spent all their lifetime livin under conditions that are unfair and unjust to them, and who <Col N="721" /> are paying through the nose for the £40,000 roads for those who can afford them, relief of their burdens and in giving them a means by which their families and children can go to Mass and to school; giving them the means at some period of benefiting to some extent out of schemes for which two or three generations of these people have paid in rates.  These are the facts I should like the Minister to consider.</P>
    <P>I have a fair idea of the Minister's constituency.  He has problems just as I have and just as his predecessor in office had.  If he follows in the footsteps of his predecessor in office he will, I think, have a very good headline. We have all to meet our problems. We are here as the elected representatives of the people and it is our duty to speak of the problems our people have to face.  If any of these gentlemen went down to have a look at a job, took a ramble into one of the local public houses, where he will meet the fellows coming home from the city, fellows living in the area who see where the money is going and listens to them, he will not have such a high opinion of the Department of Local Government when he has finished listening to them.</P>
    <P>I am anxious in particular in regard to the operation of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, because I have seen some hundreds of acres of land in my own constituency which formerly were flooded, growing rushes and good for nothing, converted, after we succeeded in getting money for the clearing of the rivers, into land that to-day is growing beet and wheat.  These lands formerly grew nothing but rushes, although they were carrying a poor law valuation of from 40/- to 45/- per statute acre.  Now I am up against the problem in the Ballymacoda area, in regard to which I shall be having a word with the Minister in the next week.  We shall have to find a remedy for that problem.  I am not going to see the county council losing rates on 200 acres and the Land Commision losing annuities on the same land, all for the want of proper working and for lack of co-operation in the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to consider the suggestion I have made that there should be some co-operation between the Minister's Department and the Department of Lands.  I have good reason for making that suggestion.  A sum of £2,000 was spent on the river at Garryvoe.  That was blocked by a sluice operated by the Land Commission.  Owing to the manner in which the Land Commission had done their job in building the sluice, our work is useless.  That is why I ask that there should be some co-operation between the Land Commission on the one hand and the Department of Local Government on the other.  In particular, there should be some co-operation and some definite line of demarcation between the activities of the Local Government Department and the Department of Public Works in regard to the width of these roads and the manner of their construction.  If we have that co-operation, we can go ahead and relieve our people of the difficulties under which they are labouring and under which they will continue to labour until these matters are remedied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended intervening in this debate but having listened to my friends from the South of Ireland, I was rapidly being driven to the conclusion that there was no problem for the Local Government Department except problems of the South of Ireland and the Midlands.  Yet when I bought a paper this morning, I found staring me right in the face an item of news in regard to a problem with which I believe we shall be faced in Dublin almost immediately.  In one of this morning's papers I saw the headline &ldquo;Corporation loan fails to attract investors.&rdquo;  I think it is initially important to ask the Minister for Local Government and his colleagues in the Cabinet to make their policy on housing quite plain, to make it plain to everybody in the city and in the country whether they intend to carry out the programme visualised in 1948, when the then Minister for Local Government stated that in Dublin he understood there were 30,000 dwellings required and that he intended to attack that problem on the basis of building <Col N="723" /> up to a production of houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Act until we had reached an output of 3,000 houses per year.  He said that he intended to keep the output going until this problem, not just of our capital city but the problem of the country as a whole, was solved once and for all.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister when he is replying to the debate on this Estimate to make his position at least clear.  I would further ask him to relieve the anxiety and the worries of a very large number of people who at present are applicants for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  I would ask him to arrange at the earliest moment that a public statement be issued with respect to the rates of interest which will be payable by applicants under that Act in regard to moneys granted to them out of the current 4½ per cent.  Dublin Corporation Loan.  I have been informed that many applicants are delaying the submission of their applications for loans until they know definitely what the interest charge will be.  In view of the fact that this loan bears a lower rate of interest than the last housing loan I would like to take it that there will be a reduction to the applicants but it is advisable that an official statement should be made and that applicants would be informed as to the date from which the new terms will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of a new Minister for Local Government because I hope that, with a new Minister for Local Government and with, I hope, a Government following out the housing programme as announced in 1948, there will be a new deal in the housing position.  When I say a new deal, I would like to recall to members of the House the position that has obtained over the last five or six years. At the end of the emergency, materials and skilled labour were short and no Government could be expected to get a housing drive under way immediately. However, the then Government made plans to improve the position and to speed up the building of houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Act.  There was a slight <Col N="724" /> increase in the years 1946-47 and 1947-48 and again in 1948-49.  In 1949-50 the total output of houses reached a figure of 1,574, and in the year 1950-51 the output went to the highest figure for the number of houses ever produced in Dublin under the Housing of the Working Classes Act&mdash; 2,588.  In 1951-52, instead of a continuation of that upward drive, there was a pause and for that year the output in Dublin was 1,982.  That decline in one year might be accounted for by the difficulty of obtaining sites or other difficulties but did the output go up to the 1950-51 level the following year, 1952-53?  No.  It reached a figure of 2,200 during that year and then came a very significant and substantial decline; the figure for 1953-54 dropped well below 2,000.</P>
    <P>These figures of houses built or houses reconditioned may not mean very much to somebody who has a home, may not mean very much to somebody who has a regular job, but they mean a great deal to the citizens of Dublin.  We must realise that after 30 years of native government in our capital city there are still families of six in one room, in need of housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>I was interested very much the other day when, in answer to a question by one of the Cork Deputies, the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that there were somewhere around 209 families of five living in one room in Cork. To-day in Dublin there are many, many families of six, such as families comprised of a father and mother and four children or even families comprised of four adults and two children, condemned to live in one room.  Many of these rooms are hardly half a mile from this Chamber.</P>
    <P>A particular feature in regard to housing output, in addition to the necessity of providing decent homes for our people, is the importance of such efforts in providing constructive employment.</P>
    <P>In to-day's <i>Irish Times</i>, the following statement is quoted by an unnamed economist:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The investor is no longer keen to subscribe to any more corporation <Col N="725" /> stock as they think the corporation has borrowed too much already.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Other experts indicated, according to the <i>Irish Times</i>, that the theory was growing that there should be a limit to public investment for such nonproductive enterprises.  The building of houses for our people may not be productive from a purely financial point of view, but what more productive activity can we engage in than the provision of homes for our people in the cities and towns and villages?  As I have said, the first aspect and the first effect of real effort to provide houses is that work is provided and work of a most constructive nature.</P>
    <P>The following figures will give an indication of the effect of speeding up the housing drive.  In 1951, the end of June, there were 3,206 houses either under construction or being reconditioned, and there were 3,028 men employed in that work, including work of construction and site development work.  In 1952, the number of houses and flats under construction and being reconditioned, in the same month, was 2,899.  The number of men employed was 3,599.  But in 1953, when this decline took place, the corresponding number at the end of June for houses and flats under construction was 2,123 and for men employed 2,699, a falling graph. Now we are faced with the position that in the last week in May there were only 2,203 houses or flats under construction and the number of men employed on that work or on city development was only 2,329.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the century our city was described as having the worst slums in Europe.  A lot of work has gone into removing that slur on our city.  But we are still a long way from reaching our goal, and our goal should be that every man with a family should have a house of his own.  In 1948 it was estimated that 30,000 dwellings were required and, after six years, it is now estimated that there are 20,000 dwellings required to solve the housing problem.  Consequently I think it is necessary that an official statement on the matter should be issued.  It is not, however, just sufficient to issue Government <Col N="726" /> or ministerial statements, because it is too easy to say that we are able to build 3,000 houses yearly, but it is another thing doing it.</P>
    <P>Not only, as Deputies have mentioned, have we difficulties with the Department of Local Government in regard to the rural areas but we have to face the same difficulties in the city, and I think that unless some definite effort is made&mdash;and the Minister for Local Government is the one on whom the responsibility must fall&mdash;to coordinate the work of this Department and the responsible local authorities, no matter what plans are made to speed up the provision of houses there will be no very successful result.</P>
    <P>In the few years immediately ahead the problem in Dublin will be one of extreme difficulty.  With the last extension of the city boundary by some 6,000 acres and the building since then we have reached the position that there is only one substantial area of virgin sites on which cottages can be built, and to continue at the proper rate in the provision of houses it is essential that plans be expedited for the construction of dwellings in the central city areas on every available vacant site and on every site that can be acquired.  I would, therefore, suggest that in considering this question of central city development the Minister should take into account that our present limitation in regard to the height of flat dwellings means approximately a 33 per cent. reduction on the housing of any specified area.  In other words, if an area is taken over for the purpose of development for houses o for building working-class flats, under the present regulation we immediately face a loss in density of some 33 per cent. and out of every 100 people in the area accommodation must be found, not just temporary accommodation, but accommodation on a long-term basis, for some 33 per cent. in some other place.</P>
    <P>We have in the city many derelict sites.  Plans have been made for some of them.  In one particular area, Lower Mount Street, I think plans were submitted something like seven years ago. I think we did get approval for these <Col N="727" /> plans about a month ago.  The peculiar position we are in as between two sets of officials is that the plans have to go back and forward for one, two, three, four and five years and our people have still to live in some of the insanitary dens in which they are living.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question by me the other day the Minister indicated one of the difficulties, that in the City of Dublin we are able to build 3,000 houses per year but, for some reason or other, we cannot get a housing architect. Surely Deputies on all sides of the House will agree that if we are to build homes for our people and if we are to consider what I think is essential, the question of building modern high flats, we at least require an architect in charge responsible to nobody but the city manager or elected representatives.  We are offered an architect who will be an assistant to another architect and the architect profession, having some pride in their craft, pride in their profession, know that&mdash;and although we have been informed that three separate attempts were made to fill the post since 1948 it has not been found possible to get a person with the qualifications.  I would seriously ask the Minister to look at that position.</P>
    <P>It is necessary and advisable that the Minister and the Department immediately examine again the difficulties of acquisition, the difficulties of obtaining possession of ground for building, and consider again the question of reviewing their existing machinery.  One of our troubles in Dublin&mdash;I think the City of Cork has it to a lesser extent&mdash;is that we are not a self-contained town, we are not dealing with problems arising just from the natural increase in the population. We are dealing with the problem in the City of Dublin of an increase in the beginning of this century of from 300,000 to 550,000.  We are not dealing with the problem that we may expect in the course of natural increase in the population that there will be 100 or 200 more houses required after a number of years.  Our position is a very fluid position.  Unfortunately, the sufferers from that fluid position in <Col N="728" /> many cases are people who have their roots, and the roots of their fathers and forefathers before them, in the city.  Consequently, we think it is desirable that the question of housing in Dublin should be looked upon and dealt with as an emergency measure. Within five years, if we build 3,000 houses, we may have an increase in the population of a further 10,000 and we are nearly as badly off as we were before.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister that the policy adopted by his predecessor in regard to the provision of houses by direct labour units is put in the wastepaper basket.  Of all the most reactionary decision, unfortunate decisions, this was one of the worst. Here at any particular time we may be faced, as we were faced before, with the possibility of putting some hundreds of men to work for a short term by utilising a direct labour unit set up in 1948 by the then Minister for Local Government, the late Deputy Murphy.  During the last year or so, during the life of our Minister's predecessor, we had to go on more than one occasion and almost appeal to let men be put to work.  This sounds most peculiar when we consider that yesterday in the debate Deputy Briscoe was telling us a lot about the same Minister's activities and special works. There were 400 men employed on special works&mdash;I hope they are kept in employment and I hope we increase the number&mdash;but it is little consolation to unemployed workers in this city if 400 men are placed in employment on special works and there is a reduction of around 1,000 men in the building of houses.  That has happened in the last few months.</P>
    <P>We have also to consider the indication that has been given that it is intended to amend the County Management Acts.  I submit that the amendment should not be confined to county management but should include the Act governing the county boroughs and that the County Borough of Dublin be included in the proposed amendments. We have&mdash;contrary to what Deputy Corry said&mdash;a fairly good manager, who gets on reasonably well with the local representatives.  He is prepared, within limits, to hear their views and <Col N="729" /> to accept their advice on matters that come within his scope.  We submit that the amendment of the Acts should not have the effect of taking the power from the manager and transferring it to the Department.  If the powers of the managers are to be returned to the elected representatives&mdash;as I think it is proper to do&mdash;return the powers to the elected representatives and do not bring in an amendment which will substitute some clerical officer in the Department for the present manager. Our experience is that we can get some progress from the manager&mdash;some progress.</P>
    <P>On this point I may be permitted to refer to an answer given by the Minister for Local Government.  I was somewhat perturbed and amazed at the Department's treatment of a recommendation sent by the manager on the question of differential renting in October, 1952.  The particular recommendation sent forward had been under consideration and discussion by elected representatives from August, 1950, until October, 1952.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's reply of the 16th June, the city manager indicated in his reply that the city council were fully informed of the financial implications of the proposed amendments before they made their recommendation. Surely, when the manager had made the recommendations and, in answer to a query, had made his statement, he was not again going to be asked to make further observations. However, we can take up that matter in another place, where I intend to raise it.  I mentioned it specifically here because of the fact that the amendment of that scheme is urgently necessary in view of the inability of many of Dublin's families to meet the rents charged under the scheme.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that, increasingly over the years, workers and their families have been compelled, through no fault of their own, to accept accommodation three, four and five miles away from their work.  I think the distance is now almost six miles out from the centre of the city.  The extra expense they are burdened with, arising out of increased transport costs not only for themselves but for their families, is a serious addition to the cost of <Col N="730" /> living of the average working-class family living in Ballyfermot, Finglas and other outlying districts which you might almost describe now as towns. Their outgoings are so heavy that it is almost impossible for them to meet the rents under the particular schemes.  I need hardly say that the burden is particularly heavy in families where there are the father, mother and three, four or five young children to be catered for and where there is no other financial support coming into the house except the father's earnings.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister is going to be a very busy man, but, on the question of the general housing position, I would ask him to have a word with his colleague, the Minister for Education, and with the Board of Works with a view to seeing what can be done about the deplorable position of primary schools.  This morning I received a report that, at its next meeting, the corporation will be asked to approve of the allocation of some 14 acres of land at Finglas to the education authorities.  As Deputy Burke can testify, houses are being built in Finglas now for almost the past three years. There are hundreds of children there, and if these children are to attend school at all they must travel into the centre of the city, some five miles away from their homes.  That has been the position in practically every case where the corporation&mdash;with Government assistance, of course&mdash;has launched substantial housing schemes.  Schools are not provided for two, three or, maybe, four years after the completion of the schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I sincerely trust that the Minister for Local Government will give to us in Dublin what I asked for at the beginning of my speech, namely, a new deal, <Col N="731" /> a fresh deal, in the matter of the provision of houses.  I make that appeal not only for the citizens of Dublin but, in many cases, for citizens who have come to us from Cork, Kerry, Kildare, Westmeath, Galway and, indeed, from every part of our country.  They come to this city, and I think it can be said about our city that we welcome everyone.  This capital city has the peculiar reputation that everyone who comes to it from the country is, in effect, a native of the city 24 hours after he reaches it.  Certainly, he is no stranger, because the best part of our city is comprised, in particular, of people from the South of Ireland.  I myself come from the North.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying that I was gratified by the reply the Minister gave me to the question I asked him the other day on the matter of the approval given by the Department to the corporation's request for permission to build houses at Walkinstown by direct labour.  The Minister may rest assured that, in any activity he engages for the purpose of helping us in Dublin to house those of our people who need housing so badly, he will receive at least my full co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In his participation in debates in this House, the Minister, like his predecessor, has shown his very wide knowledge of rural Ireland. I know that, coming as he does from a county where the only characteristics of our civilisation and of our traditions still exist, despite all obstacles down through the years, he will treat all problems drawn attention to by all sides of the House with a courtesy and consideration that will be of advantage to his Department.  Furthermore, in his dealings with members of the House, he has shown himself on all occasions a man of his word.  In our dealings with him, his attributes will be of advantage to the country generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During this debate, we have heard of the problems in cities and in rural areas.  One fundamental fact is clearly evident and that is that only by encouraging local effort and enterprise can progress be made.  If the Minister encourages that and gives local <Col N="732" /> authorities, whether they be corporations, borough councils or county councils, the scope to make progress in their own particular areas in accordance with their own judgment, then the country will, I think, make more progress than has been made in some spheres already.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for me and for members of the House to come here, generalise from particular instances and complain against officials of the Department because there was some delay in regard to some particular problem.  I heard Deputy Desmond speaking on that matter here to-day. I know what is at the back of his mind even though he did not say it.  It is because two housing schemes were held up for a long period but he did not mention the considerations which led to that delay.</P>
    <P>I was with Deputy Desmond on the selection of these sites.  We thought we were doing what was best, but when the departmental officials started to examine them they found snags that had not appeared to us at that time. One, for example, was that by putting the houses nearer to a village there would be a better chance of having serviced houses with the amenities the people would require than by putting them in a rather remote place which was what we suggested.  The Department tried to encourage that change. There was some objection from some of the public representatives who did not want to make it.  The delay was not due to the Department but to a clash of judgments as between the Department and some of the public representatives.</P>
    <P>The other case concerned a housing scheme which was to be put in a more or less cul-de-sac area.  There was not a direct approach to the public road. The local government officials wanted to insist on that being done before they approved of the houses.  That led to considerable delay.  Whilst I may have my own grievances with departmental officials sometimes, I say that we must be fair to them in our criticism and put their point of view just as well as our own and let this House and the public decide.  That is <Col N="733" /> the only fair way.  The Ten Commandments are there for public representatives just as they are for the ordinary citizen.  There is no use in this House or on public platforms bearing false witness either against our opponents or against our officials whether they are county managers or departmental officials.</P>
    <P>We heard here to-day about fair deals and so on.  Let us have a fair deal as between one and the other and then some progress will be made.  If we are honest with ourselves and are not trying to get personal advantage out of what may be a public problem we should all co-operate.  I have in the first place put to the manager the question of encouraging local initiative in connection with housing, roads, sewerage, servicing of houses etc.  We have local engineers who are qualified and have been appointed by the Local Appointments Commissioners as having a knowledge of their work.  Schemes should be submitted and they should be approved of with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>As between the public representatives and the departmental officials, the public representatives sometimes make a decision perhaps contrary to the wishes of the manager.  We sometimes have a grievance because there is a considerable delay.  We find in the long run that it is our own officials in the cities or in the counties who give no encouragement towards the sanction of these particular schemes because they are not in accordance with their own views but in accordance with the views of the public representatives on the board.  There is either a delay in sending them up or if they send them up they attach some snag to them which prevents their quick sanction.  Is not that true?  Does not everybody know that the managers have sometimes in that way retarded local progress?</P>
    <P>I would not condemn the managerial system <i>in toto</i> at all.  It has its snags no doubt and these snags could and should be remedied in this House.  One of our big problems in Cork and Dublin is housing.  I am sure that is also the position elsewhere.  The previous Minister told us that no housing scheme would be held up through lack of <Col N="734" /> money, that the money would be made available.  Lists were read out here to-day.  Has not the local authority responsibility for housing in each particular district?  Why blame the officials always?  As I say, it is easy to generalise from a particular instance but it carries no weight.  You must have a basis for your objections and that basis must be wider than a particular instance.  That has been the case.  I know that our own officials have been very slow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin mentioned building on derelict sites.  I would ask the Minister &mdash;I am sure he will be favourably disposed&mdash;to ensure that instead of taking up good agricultural land which produces for the nation, these derelict sites with roads, sewerage, churches and everything else available near at hand be built on.  It would be better to do that than to claim fresh land where new schools, churches, roads have to be built, and where extensions of sewerage schemes are necessary.  These derelict sites are left in the heart of cities where people are near their work.  They are not built on for years.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will also see, as far as his powers permit him, that those old, grey, derelict and decaying walls, mementoes of the past in our towns and cities, are demolished, and that houses are built in their stead.  No matter how humble these particular sites may be, in my opinion, in these particular localities you have two or three people occupying houses which would house a big family in comfort.  A smaller house could be made available to them which would enable us to solve our housing problem.</P>
    <P>The late Deputy T.J. Murphy, former Minister for Local Government, trócaire Dé ar a anam, said to the manager in one particular town&mdash;his own, I think&mdash;to put in whatever type of house that could be fitted into the derelict sites, that there surely was a family, big or small, requiring such a house.  We would have lower rents and smaller bus fares.  The people would be nearer their work and the children nearer their schools.  That problem should be tackled and, instead of leaving those dead walls there as dumps for the gathering of flies and insects of <Col N="735" /> every kind, centres of infestation, they should be got rid of.  The town and country areas would be brightened up by building on the derelict sites.</P>
    <P>We should not have the Department saying that you must have five or six or seven rooms in the house.  You should build whatever houses there is need for.  Sometimes we have lone couples, old age pensioners, who would like a small home, and if these homes were made available to them they would perhaps vacate a house which would serve a larger family.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin was talking a good deal about housing and about direct labour.  Direct labour did not come from the Department.  There was a direct labour scheme in Cork many years ago.  We resurrected it quite recently and it has been a great success because we have direct labour and contract on every second scheme and one is competing with the other. The workers on a direct labour scheme know that if they do not make a success of their job a contract will probably replace them in time to come. They make a success of their job and the progress made up to the present, at any rate, even though there are faults from time to time, is in general pretty satisfactory.</P>
    <P>We hear talk about the differential rents.  I do not know whether it is the function of the Minister&mdash;it is, I presume&mdash;to sanction these schemes when they come along if they appeal to him.  Here is what I feel&mdash;that the public authorities are becoming the biggest landlords in this country, and that is not desirable; that the man&mdash; let him be a humble worker or an artisan or a man in some other station of life&mdash;is as entitled to purchase and own his home as the farmer is to purchase and own his land, and that we should encourage purchase schemes. Let there be a small deposit on some but do not sacrifice a man in trying to own his own home because he cannot make a deposit.</P>
    <P>Have different schemes of houses in different areas, and over a long period of years let it be so arranged that the <Col N="736" /> house will eventually become the man's own property, but make it a long term of years.  If you get a deposit it provides money for further building.  If you cannot get a deposit at the same time you are getting rid of all the system of differential rent and all the rest, the man is paying for a house of his own, and he will make every effort to try to keep that house well and to own it eventually. Managers say sometimes &ldquo;you are extending this money over a long period of years and there is a lot more paid in interest in the end&rdquo;, but I hold that it is the impact on the weekly income of the family that is the biggest problem for the woman of the house and for her husband who is the wage earner, and if that weekly demand is lessened, even though it is spread over a longer period of years and even though posterity has to provide some of it, you are helping the family in not making the weekly demand too heavy upon them.  That is in general my view on housing&mdash;that we should encourage in every way the purchase of the homes of the people and that our local authorities would not become the huge landlords they are becoming day after day.  We are talking about decentralising authority.  We should also decentralise ownership by getting these schemes.  We have some of these schemes in Cork and we have not half enough of them.  When we talk about housing drives and so on not producing more results we have always to remember that the demand is being met in part at any rate, and that according as the demand is being met the attraction of certain types of scheme where people get loans from the corporation and so on to build for themselves will from time to time fluctuate, perhaps on rates of interest and perhaps on other things of that kind.</P>
    <P>We have the rural cottages and the rural cottage sites.  I came up against a problem recently, and if I have to bring it to the Minister I hope he is going to consider and stand by my view on the matter, which is this.  We published in the papers in Cork an advertisement asking rural workers who required houses to put in an application for them.  We had a <Col N="737" /> number of applications and in consequence we adopted a scheme.  In that scheme one man was put down as living in overcrowded conditions and when it came to an examination subsequently by the officials they cut him out.</P>
    <P>I went to investigate why it was that he was cut off, and the answer I got was that he would be more overcrowded in a labourer's cottage than in the house he was in, that he had better accommodation.  He had 11 children.  He and his two eldest children were working on the land; and when I put further questions about it, I saw a big red line around his application form saying that he had an income of, I think, £19 and consequently should be able to pay for another bigger house.  To my mind that had no bearing at all on it.  Two or three of his sons had grown to manhood and were earning, and every good luck to them for having good wages.  They come from a humble home.  They will be going one of these days to make homes of their own.  Because of that it is sought to deprive the father of a cottage and a home.  I have got it restored by notice of motion to the list, but the site has not yet been selected because the officials object. I hope that if I have to appeal to the Minister in that case he will be sympathetic. Two of the children have gone away now.  One has joined a convent and another has gone to work somewhere else.  But there are still 11 in the house and four children going to school.  I think it is unpardonable to have objection to a man and two sons working and to seek to deprive him of the benefit to which he is entitled to have a rural worker's cottage.</P>
    <P>As far as roads are concerned, we have heard about big schemes and small schemes.  There is no use now in members coming in here and talking of the days when only horse-drawn vehicles had to be provided for on the roads.  Three or four men here and there on the country roads are no longer able to deal with the problem of big tractors, of every kind of lorry, buses and all the rest.  It is only useless to be throwing out a few shovels <Col N="738" /> of earth and stones on the road and have them swept away by the first lorry that comes along.  They must get the help of machinery.  Perhaps two gangs will have to be coupled up into a bigger group or something like that.  It is a problem at any rate that has to be examined.  The only thing that I think we would all agree on is that the big schemes should not take all the money and all the effort, that the country roads should get their fair share of the development.  Then the rural needs will be satisfied.  Everything cannot be done right away. Labour, money and sometimes machinery have to be provided to make it effective.  The main thing is to see that the views of the local representatives count for a good deal more than they do at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of abolishing the Managerial Act.  I am in favour of amending it, and amending it pretty stringently as far as the manager's powers are concerned.  If there is co-operation and goodwill, we will find that things will go on well.  The departmental officials, in their own way, have their own duties to perform, and if they treat sympathetically the representations made from members of this House either through the Department or through the Minister or in communications with themselves, and take as much notice at least of them as they do of the managers' and officials' representations, then we will have progress made and, as the years go by, snags that have appeared in our administration will disappear; and instead of fighting one with the other as to who is responsible for the delay, we will be encouraging one another as to who is responsible for progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The weekly rent to the tenant is supposed to be fixed by the cost of the house in which he lives. I wish to make a plea for those living in houses built since 1940.  In 1940, as a result of the commencement of the war some time previously, the cost of construction of houses became at least twice as much as it had been before.  Undoubtedly, the then Government tried to do their best to solve the problem by increasing <Col N="739" /> the subsidy payable from State funds to corporations and county councils who were creating housing to two-thirds, to a maximum of £950. Unfortunately housing costs rocketed far beyond that sum and we find the position now in which a person occupying a house built since 1940 is responsible for the interest rates on at least £1,000, which has resulted in working people having to pay a rent for their houses of something closely approximating £1 or 25/- per week.  Everybody knows that this, to a person living on £6 or £7 a week, with a family of two, three or four, is an uneconomic rent.</P>
      <P>I want to make a plea to the Minister that if it is possible at any time during his period of office&mdash;and I wish him a very long and very successful period of office&mdash;he will consider the needs of these people and perhaps make more funds available for the alleviation of their position, which is very bad.  It may be that he or some following Minister may have to do this, because these rents will remain static but economic trends will not, and we may very easily reach a position in which the rent which these people have to pay is completely beyond their ability to pay.  I appeal to the Minister to keep this in mind and to do his best with regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been amazed since my very recent advent into public life to find that local government is a maze of regulations and of difficulties which cannot be got over, even by the Minister himself.  I have discovered that, as a result of the intricacies of the Department regulations governing housing, the Minister is precluded by law, notwithstanding his honest and sincere desire to do so, from making available from State funds a comparatively small sum to remedy a position in which one half of a group of people, all of whom are in the same income group, in one housing scheme received a back payment of rent overpaid of over £30 per person, while the other half did not.  The Minister has now solved the problem by enabling the Drogheda Corporation to make this <Col N="740" /> back payment without any increase in the rate.  I thank him for that, but I should like him to consider this incomprehensible maze of regulations which precludes him from exercising his functions and make an effort to frame legislation to put himself and local authorities in a freer and better position to draft their own laws and look after their own cases and their own groups.</P>
    <P>As I say, I wish him a very long and very successful term of office.  I may say that he has a very hard job.  I know a village in my constituency in which there are 160 schoolchildren, with no sanitary accommodation, and in which there is an unwritten law that they can take one bucket of water from the pump in the morning and one in the evening.  Otherwise, the water runs out.  There is another village and a doctor has told me that, if he were brought to it, he would condemn every house in it.  That perhaps is hyperbole&mdash;he would condemn about 95 per cent.  In the solving of these problems, I wish the Minister every success and I hope that, five years hence, we shall have solved very many of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to this Ministry and to express the hope that he will be very successful in his conduct of the affairs of the Department.  There are a few matters of importance to which I wish to refer briefly and the first is the provision of houses for all the people who need them and the clearance of slum areas in our cities and big towns. That is a problem on the urgency of which there is unanimity of opinion amongst all Parties and a problem to which successive Governments have devoted their efforts with rather singular success&mdash;success which has brought about a solution of the problem in many areas of the country.  It is generally believed that if the effort is maintained, outside our big cities, the problem will be solved in a matter of five or six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the progress which has been achieved over the past few years, however, <Col N="741" /> there still remains a very acute problem, and, in spite of the suggestion of my colleague, Deputy Lynch from Waterford, that we may be wearying the House by repetition of statements made in regard to housing, I feel that I have to travel some distance along the road he has already traversed.</P>
    <P>In Waterford, our housing problem is very acute and this was brought home to me in no uncertain fashion during the recent election.  While, in the county, we have reached a position in which we will very shortly be able to provide the housing needs of our people, the position in the city is none too happy.</P>
    <P>I very recently made a tour of the city, a canvass of the houses, which showed me that there is still a tremendous problem before the corporation despite the enormous amount of work that has been done in the provision of houses.  The number of houses in which there are living four, five and even six people to a room was to me a revelation. I do not exaggerate when I say that in one out of every 13 houses we approached we were met with an appeal for housing accommodation. &ldquo;We will vote for the Party which gives us a house or helps us out of the unhealthy and squalid conditions in which we are living,&rdquo; was the invariable reply we got from these people to whom we appealed for support.</P>
    <P>What struck me most was the number of newly-weds&mdash;when I speak of newly-weds, I refer to people married within the past five years&mdash;receiving the barest of accommodation in the homes of their parents, or married brothers and sisters, and there is no doubt that this question of the provision of houses for newly-weds is one of the greatest problems in our big towns and cities.  Lack of accommodation for these people is the principal cause of overcrowding in the city, and it is a problem to which the Government should devote their most urgent attention.</P>
    <P>While the Department and local authorities are making a very sincere effort to provide houses for our people as quickly as possible, there appears to <Col N="742" /> me, from complaints which have been made to me from time to time, to be unnecessary delay in the issuing of building licences, in the payment of building grants to people building houses for themselves and to builders erecting houses for renting and to utility societies, and also in the inspection of work and payment of grants for reconstructed houses, all leading inevitably to a slowing up to some extent of building progress.  I do not know what is the cause of that, but I feel that, in a matter of such great urgency as the provision of houses, some way should be found to cut the red tape which is hindering progress and threatening to sabotage the housing drive.  I know I am pushing an open door in appealing to the Minister to give his attention to it with a view to the elimination of these delays.</P>
    <P>While on the question of delay in the building of houses, I wonder would there be any possibility of cutting out the red tape and heart-breaking delays experienced in relation to the building of rural cottages.  Waterford County Council initiated a scheme of rural cottages over two and a half years ago, and, despite all the efforts of the councillors to have the cottages erected with the utmost speed, the scheme is not yet under way.  One cannot hope for speed under a cumbersome system which calls for triple approval of housing sites&mdash;approval by the council, by the medical officer of health and by the council's engineer&mdash;which calls for agreement on the purchase price between the council's solicitor and some person acting for the owner of the land, for the establishment of title, involving endless delays in the Land Commission, for submission of the scheme to the Department for sanction, for putting up the scheme for contract and resubmission to the Department for sanction.  All this leads to endless delays.  The system calls for simplification and this might be effected by doing away with duplication, and in some cases even triplication, of control and by ensuring that the establishment of title, which is the principal cause of delay, would be treated as a priority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> There is one other matter which I consider of some importance.  It is the question of the improvement of our county roads and byroads.  There is no doubt that the increased expenditure on our main roads over the past years was an absolute necessity and provided much-needed employment in the rural areas.  There should, however, now be a diversion of some of this money to our county roads and byroads.  They have been neglected and the time has arrived for the farmers, cottiers and other people whom these roads serve to receive a better return for the high taxes and rates they are paying.</P>
    <P>The condition of these roads is a matter with which every Deputy in the country is familiar, as I feel sure it is the subject of constant complaint in every other county as well as my own. These roads are not now fit to carry the traffic to which they are subject by reason of the almost complete mechanisation of farm work.  The surface of these roads is in most cases hopeless, and their width is not sufficient to carry modern traffic, while the bends and corners on them are not negotiable by heavy farm machinery. It must be absolutely exasperating for the rural community to find their efforts at improvement and development frustrated by the failure of the local authority to give them the simple amenity of decent roads to which they are entitled.  Although this increased expenditure on main roads in recent years, in addition to providing good safe roads, was for the purpose of providing much-needed employment in local areas, I hold that the expenditure of this money on county roads and by-roads would be productive of far more employment in view of the lack of facilities for the use of heavy council machinery on these roads.  There would be a much greater need for the employment of hand labour on the county roads than there would be on the main roads.  The improvement of these county roads would also, to some extent, help the tourist drive.  All our most beautiful scenery and our places of local and public interest are not located in the neighbourhood of the <Col N="744" /> main roads.  Furthermore, good, clean, dry roads on which to walk, cycle or motor would have their effect in helping to curb the flight from the land.</P>
    <P>In Waterford we can boast of the best main roads in the country, roads which do not require any particular attention for some years to come.  We would like greater freedom of action in our attention to the county roads.  We would like permission for greater expenditure on the county roads and by-roads. This may be achieved by the diversion of some of the money, free grants for the improvement of our main roads, to our county roads.  The use of portion of the ordinary grant for main road maintenance might be permitted, too, for county road upkeep.</P>
    <P>This problem of the improvement of our county roads and byroads is a subject of constant complaint among our rural community through county councils, and it is a matter of ever-recurring worry.  If the Minister were to treat the matter with urgency and to give some decision in the matter, it would relieve our problem in the council very much.</P>

      <P>As a new Deputy to the House, I was very glad, listening to this debate, to find that most of the Deputies could get away from the atmosphere of political acrimony which had permeated the House on the previous debate.  I was also very glad to see that they could approach this matter not from a Party political point of view but from the point of view as to how it affected the country generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with most of the remarks which the Deputies who spoke before me have made.  There were, of course, exceptions.  The suggestion by Deputy Kennedy that in Westmeath, and, I suppose, in other counties, big landowners were able to use their influence for the purpose of having work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act carried out on their farms and having their farms completely drained at the expense of the State was a charge, in my opinion, against the local officials and against Department officials.  I am glad to say that in the constituency of Meath there was no necessity for such a charge because they carried out <Col N="745" /> their work very well and, in my view, the Local Authorities (Works) Act is something which should receive the attention of the Minister and the Department and should be revived with the greatest possible speed.</P>
    <P>During the period of office of the inter-Party Government, not alone was there a very big amount of useful work carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, but employment was found for almost double the number of men which is being employed at the present time by Meath County Council. If we are going to face up to the fact that employment is to be given in rural areas, there is no other readymade solution except the reintroduction of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It is all right to say that while the Act was in part suspended those people found employment elsewhere. I do not think that would be entirely true, because very many of the people who were employed have emigrated for want of employment and very many of them have been almost all the time unemployed since the cessation of the Act.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that several hundred men were employed by Bord na Móna at Inny Junction over the entire year. One of our big problems as a trade union official is to persuade Bord na Móna to employ men over the year at their bigger jobs, and I feel the reference to several hundred men being employed at Inny Junction is irresponsible.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the point made by the last speaker of transferring some of the grants for main roads to county roads and particularly to the improvement of lanes and culs-de-sac which were put under the county council by the last Government when Deputy McQuillan's Bill was carried through this House.  It is, I am sure, galling to people who live along these lanes and bad byroads to find that while thousands of pounds can be found for the improvement of already very fine roads, apparently no money at all can be granted for the improvement of the lanes where numerous families have to live.  It is a very disheartening thing for the father of a family to find that not <Col N="746" /> alone has he to wade through the mud on his way to work in the morning and back in the evening but his wife, on her occasional visits into town, and his children, going to school, must do the same.  In many cases I know they have to wade ankle-deep in mud until they reach the main road.  When they get to the main road they are all right because the high-powered cars are there.</P>
    <P>This is not an easy problem to solve, because there are so many of these roads in the country, and perhaps it is considered the problem is nearly too big to be faced, but I believe it will have to be faced some time and I think now is the correct time to do it.  I know the Minister's reputation is one of facing up to matters and that should help to carry him through in this connection.</P>
    <P>For some time past there has been considerable delay in the sanctioning of wage increases when the local authority or the county manager recommends such increases.  It was the practice of the Minister's predecessor to wait weeks and months before giving sanction and then in some cases he decided to reduce the small increase recommended of 2/- or 3/- per week.  I cannot understand why a Minister should take such a long time to consider such a matter, particularly when the county council and the county manager are prepared to make the money available and are of the opinion, apparently, that the increase offered is a fair one.  I do not think the present Minister should continue that practice and I hope that he will give the matter his early attention.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which has worried me as a trade union official for years past and I would like to take this opportunity of bringing it to the notice of the Minister and the House.  I refer to the conditions of employment of county council workers. We know that at the moment the Department of Local Government cannot insist on certain things being carried out by the county councils.  We have been told that county councils have authority to do certain things themselves and the Department cannot interfere.  There is a practice in some <Col N="747" /> councils not to pay their workmen on Church holidays.  That means that certain workers in certain counties must go short when a Church holiday occurs.  I think that is most unfair and I think a recommendation from the Department might solve that problem. There is also the problem of wet time. I notice that it is not necessary for Deputies to attend in the House at all times.  As a matter of fact, I understand some Deputies just attend once or twice during the entire session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference I am making is that in county council employment a man who is unable to work because of wet weather for half a day loses a half day's wages despite the fact that he presents himself for work and is willing and able to work.  I think that is most unfair and a recommendation from the Minister, something on the lines of the recommendation made by his predecessor some years ago, might solve the problem.</P>
      <P>I would ask also that local authorities should be requested to obtain materials for the repair of roads, etc., as far as possible locally. I admit that the engineers are experts at their own jobs and we have been told on occasions that the type of stone available in a local quarry is not the most suitable type of stone for a particular job.  It has often puzzled me to discover that a year or two later a similar job is carried out somewhere else in the county and the stone previously described as unsuitable is found quite suitable for the job and is used.  I think there should be some uniformity in the type of material and stone used.  Perhaps the Minister would recommend that if stone found locally is at all suitable it should be used rather than have the local authority bringing stone a long distance or materials from outside the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have our own problems in Meath in connection with housing.  I am not a member of the Meath County Council <Col N="748" /> but, in fairness to that body, they have made a very good attempt so far to solve their problems.  In my opinion, perhaps, they are going a bit too slowly.  Possibly I am asking too much of them.  They have got a number of schemes through and they are in process of preparing further schemes.</P>
    <P>Now one of the biggest problems in connection with housing is the question of rents.  As suggested by a representative from Cork, county councils should be in a position, first of all, to make available sites at a nominal rent and, secondly, the grant and loan should be substantially increased to enable more people to build houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>In some counties repairs to council cottages amount annually to £20,000. This year in Meath the sum is £25,000. I am sure everyone will agree that is a colossal sum for repairs.  Some scheme should be introduced to enable the tenants to become owners of their houses when the houses are in a good state of repair.  The owners and occupiers would then be themselves responsible for repairs and would, I believe, keep the houses in a much better state of repair.  That might solve the present problem.</P>
    <P>Numbers of people are anxious to buy out their houses in County Meath but they will not do so until they are put into a proper state of repair. There is neither enough money nor a sufficiency of labour to carry out all the repairs necessary.</P>
    <P>The question of sanctioning schemes submitted by local authorities is a problem.  When the county council engineers and the local authorities have decided on the suitability of a site I fail to see why the engineers from the Department of Local Government should then proceed to consider the matter for months before a decision is given.  I believe that has happened in many parts of the country as well as in County Meath.  Surely the considered opinion of two or three experts should be sufficient in relation to the erection of county council cottages.  Surely it is unnecessary for departmental officials to spend time going into small details and holding <Col N="749" /> up the implementation of schemes. Standard specification houses should be made available to local authorities. That would help to solve the present problem.</P>
    <P>The people in County Meath have been looking for water supplies and sewerage for years.  The scheme for providing sewerage for the village of Slane is still awaiting sanction.  Slane village is a very beautiful village.  It has been said that it should be removed from its present setting and put somewhere down in Cork; it is not the usual type of village one finds in County Meath.  Tourists come to visit it every week.  There is no public convenience. The same is true of Kells. Tourists also visit Kells.  Fairs are held there.  Yet there is no public convenience in that very big town.  I believe the delay in providing these amenities is due to the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>In Kells, too, we have the position every year that there is no water supply for a couple of months in the summer.  I believe the water cannot get through the pipes and a new scheme is to be put into operation.  The people have been warned that the water may be cut off completely unless something is done in the very near future.  If the Department is responsible for holding up that scheme, the Minister should give it his immediate attention.  In the town of Kells there is no water supply and no sewerage scheme, with the result that there is always the danger of an epidemic.  We have quite a big number of men unemployed in the town.  If the provision of water and sewerage schemes were sanctioned for that town it would mean putting these men into employment.</P>
    <P>As regards housing, in the County Meath, and I suppose the same applies in other counties, when the tenant of a council cottage dies and the widow or the son is appointed as the new tenant, a very high rent is charged.  I think the Department should do something about that, because I do not think it is fair. The widow, or the son, of the old tenant is treated as if she were a new tenant coming into the cottage.  That family may have been living in the cottage for 30 or 40 years.  I do not think <Col N="750" /> she should be charged a higher rent than her husband had been paying. Even though this system is approved of by the local council, I think it should not be allowed by the Department.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion yesterday about new Ministries.  In view of the fact that there is such a demand for housing, I think it would be a good idea if, for a temporary period anyway, a Ministry of Housing was set up.  It might be one way of solving this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A problem that I am deeply concerned about is the provision of supplies of pure drinking water for the people in County Dublin. This is a matter which I have discussed with the previous Minister, with the county manager and with members of the county council.  We should do everything possible to bring supplies of pure drinking water to the homes of our people.  The people who have gone into occupation of houses on some of the new housing estates built by the Dublin County Council have not even a pump available to them.  It is absolutely essential for the health of the people that a good clean water supply should be provided for them.  Every other day I am getting letters from my constituents in the County Dublin complaining that the pump in their area is broken, and that they have to depend on getting a supply of water from small streams running along by the roadside.</P>
      <P>The county council, of course, is the responsible body, and when I make representations about this to the council or the county manager I am told that an effort will be made to do something in the following year's estimate. Meantime, there may be an outbreak of sickness.  I attribute the ill-health of the people living on these new housing estates to the fact that they are obliged to use water from the shallow wells which are to be found along the main roads and into which every sort of refuse runs.  The members of the farming community, labourers and all others living in County Dublin areas are suffering in this way.  A clean water supply is also very badly needed for cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the remedy for this is the provision of a national water <Col N="751" /> supply scheme.  I am not blaming the present Minister for it.  I wish him good luck in his new office.  I know he has a big job to do and I wish him luck in carrying it out.  The previous Minister did his best in trying to remedy this grievance.  I have been urging for years that this problem should be tackled through a coordinated effort on the part of the Department of Local Government, the county manager and the county council. The rural electrification scheme is being carried out on a national basis, and I suggest that the same plan should be adopted in regard to the provision of water supplies for the people.  I would ask the present Minister to see what he can do.  The Dublin County Council has been tinkering at the provision of a water supply in the county for years.  Take Skerries, for example, which is a tourist resort. During the summer months you may have a population of 7,000 people there.</P>
    <P>The water supply is cut off at 7 o'clock in the evening and is not on again until 7 o'clock the following morning.  There is a holiday camp in Balbriggan.  The position is bad all over North County Dublin.  We just have makeshift water supplies in these areas.</P>
    <P>We are in a rather unfortunate position in the County Dublin inasmuch as we are, say, at the tail end of the city which has a good water supply. Some time about 1938 Deputy MacEntee gave approval to the North County Dublin regional water supply scheme.  He made great strides to bring increased water supplies to the city and to part of County Dublin. His efforts were continued by his successor, but, unfortunately, some dead hand seems to be there all the time which is delaying the full execution of that scheme.  I am now 11 years in the Dáil, and this was one of the first questions that I raised here.  The problem is still urgent, and I would appeal to the Minister to get the position examined and see what can be done about it.  The previous Minister gave every encouragement to the county council, but yet the position is as I have stated.  It is really a <Col N="752" /> national disgrace that people should be obliged to get supplies of drinking water from shallow wells and from streams running along by the roadside. If the Minister is able to do anything to ease the position I certainly will be delighted to give him all the co-operation I can.</P>
    <P>As regards housing, we have succeeded over the years in building quite a number of council houses in County Dublin.  Despite that, we have failed to act in as enlightened a way as the Dublin Corporation by providing homes for newly-weds.  At present when a young man and woman get married they are obliged to live in a room.  It is only when they have a family of three or four children that they become eligible for a house.  One of the results of that situation is that we have so many people in hospitals and in sanatoria.  A young married woman who is cooped up in a room all day with a couple of children is bound to lose her health.  Hence many are obliged to go to a sanatorium or to a hospital for treatment.</P>
    <P>I believe it is a national necessity that the Minister should give a lead on problems of that sort, and while Dublin Corporation are doing it for many citizens I feel in County Dublin we should do something in that regard also.</P>
    <P>Another problem I am concerned about is the improvement of our cul-de-sac roads&mdash;and we have quite a number of them.  I have spoken of this problem before on numerous occasions and I am still getting a number of complaints about the cul-de-sac roads we have.  There is one road very near Dublin where there are six or seven families with farms beside the road on a Land Commission holding.  While the rural improvements scheme was there for them to avail of, there were, perhaps, one or two contrary people on that estate who would not contribute.  I feel that that is a problem.  While there was an Act introduced to deal with that, I know it is a big problem and I know in speaking of matters of this kind we have to take into consideration the expense, and we have to be fair to all our citizens&mdash;as fair as we can be. <Col N="753" /> In dealing with this problem, I would like that the Minister should get the position examined again and see what can be done at least to alleviate much of the hardships that people such as those to whom I have referred have to undergo from time to time living in places of that kind.</P>
    <P>As far as our differential rents in County Dublin are concerned, the previous Minister settled that for us and sanctioned purchase schemes for the houses there, but in my constituency, I have another big portion of Dublin Corporation where, both in Finglas and Ballyfermot and in Walkinstown, the people are still speaking about the way in which the differential rents system is administered.</P>
    <P>They feel, of course, that the administration of the differential rents system is very heavy on a number of families.  They feel it is beyond their means to meet the rents in the manner in which these are charged up.  The one ugly feature of the system that I have seen and that I have spoken against&mdash;it is the one thing I did not like&mdash;is the way in which the inspector comes round and says: &ldquo;Was Margaret working last week?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Was Peter working the week before last, and you never reported it?&rdquo;  That means that there is £5 or £6 back money due and, if there were 12 children in the house the same question would arise.  The families get very little satisfaction except to pay up.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister should get this problem re-examined and see what can be done.  I know the Minister or anybody else can say that it will only mean piling something on to the rates, but I do not think that is really so, or that the reexamination is merely a matter for Dublin Corporation and not for the Minister.  I do know that I had deputations to the Minister's predecessor in connection with County Dublin and he met me fairly.  I am sure the present Minister will definitely deal with the position in the area that I still have the honour to represent&mdash; Finglas and Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need annoy the House any longer.  I wish the Minister luck in the big job he has to do.</P>
    <Col N="754" />

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to waste many minutes of the time of the House this morning covering points that have been already dealt with by Deputies who are colleagues of mine in the Cork Corporation.  But I should like to make one or two points.  It was most encouraging to me as a Deputy from Cork City to hear the Minister in introducing his Estimate stating that he was fully aware of the awful position that existed in Cork City regarding the accommodation of people in houses, that he was deeply concerned with it and intended to do all in his power to grapple with the situation at the very earliest possible date. He has learned since he came into office that there are up to 4,000 families in Cork City anxious to secure housing accommodation and at the rate of building progress at present in the city, many of these families will be waiting 12 or maybe 14 years before they can be accommodated.</P>
      <P>These figures, while they may reveal the enormity of the problem to the Minister, cannot reveal in any way the degree of misery in which the vast majority of these 4,000 applicants are compelled to live.  I think it is only members of the corporation like myself, people in public life in Cork City who are dealing with these matters day after day, who have any idea of the degradation and misery in which this class of people are compelled to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not bore the House by quoting cases but I could give many harrowing details.  I could tell of a man with his wife and eight children, whose ages range from 18 years to six months, who are cooking, washing, eating and sleeping in one room in a tenement house.  I could tell of several cases of newly-married people living apart because they have been unable to get a roof over their heads.  I could tell the House of basement flats and dungeons in which decent people are trying to raise a Christian family.  Any Cork Deputy will tell you that every week of the year, women come along in tears to us, asking for God's sake to be taken out of their present surroundings and given a chance to raise a <Col N="755" /> Christian family in an ordinary home in Cork City.  When we have a scheme completed and we allocate houses, we find for every one of these unfortunate people we can accommodate, we must send 99 people back again to the misery and degradation they had hoped to be able to rise from.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to know that the Minister intends to send departmental officials down to Cork next week to look at the whole question and I would suggest to the Minister, when he is briefing his officials for that visit, that he would suggest that as well as visiting Cork City Hall and seeing the city manager and the corporation, they might profitably spend an hour or two in company with members of the corporation in visiting some of the worst of our slum areas in the City of Cork. Rightly or wrongly, I feel that any official cannot adequately grasp the seriousness of the situation from his desk in the Department of Local Government, but that if he did visit one or two of these places&mdash;and I am sure any of my colleagues in this House who are members of Cork Corporation would be very glad to take the representatives of the Department on a very short tour&mdash;it would enable them to get a grasp of the really serious situation which exists in Cork.</P>
    <P>I do hope that these officials who visit Cork next week will not deal with the matter in the same way as it was dealt with by an official who visited the the city last week&mdash;and I am not blaming the official; I want to be clear on that.  It was only as a result of a reply given in this House yesterday, by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, that I heard for the first time that an official of the Department had been making housing inquiries in Cork last week. From the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, I found he had interviewed the city manager and the Lord Mayor and two unnamed councillors of the Cork Corporation.  One would have thought that people like Deputy Barrett and Deputy Barry of Fine Gael and myself of the Labour Party, might have been taken into consultation on that very important matter.  I am not going to <Col N="756" /> state whose fault it was, but I have a very good idea.  I do hope that when the Minister is sending his officials to Cork next week, he will ask them to contact other members of the Cork Corporation who may be of some assistance to him in the inquiries.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear to the Minister that he is in the happy position of having unanimity of desire in the Cork Corporation amongst members of all Parties in their efforts to solve the housing problem.  The present corporation has been there since 1950, and I can readily assert that every member of it is deeply desirous of reaching an early and satisfactory solution of our problems.  With that end in view, we set up a direct labour organisation about which I should like to say a few words.  It was not the desire of the corporation in setting up the direct labour organisation to squeeze out the private contractor.  We have made it very clear that all we wish is that the direct labour organisation should function side by side with the private contractor.  So far we have found that the system has been eminently satisfactory, because over the past few years we were in a position to build up a very efficient and satisfactory labour unit.  I think, on the other hand, that the direct labour unit served as a deterrent to the private contractor who might be inclined to step out of line, and that it has also resulted in establishing a standard of performance which the private contractor must emulate.  I must say that the private contractor has lived up to his obligations in that respect but I would urge that the continued existence of the direct labour unit is justified because of the quality and quantity of its work.  I, therefore, suggest that it is most essential that the direct labour unit should be continued and maintained in existence.</P>
    <P>With that end in view, we have been endeavouring to ensure that the officers and technicians in our direct labour unit are provided with continuous employment.  I am stressing that particularly because in the last year a regulation was issued from the Department of Local Government that in future the Cork Corporation could not <Col N="757" /> confine a scheme to the direct labour unit and that the direct labour unit, in common with private contractors, would have to tender for the erection of any scheme of houses with which the Cork Corporation wished to proceed. I am quite sure the Minister can see a very real danger of squeezing out the direct labour unit in that respect because private contractors, by adopting the very simple expedient of undercutting in one or two cases, compelling the corporation to accept the lowest tender, could put the direct labour unit out of operation.  Then when the unit was disbanded it would be utterly impossible to try to start to create another one.</P>
    <P>I want to say in favour of the last Minister that, even though he had issued that regulation, when a case arose in which the corporation desired that a scheme should be carried out by the direct labour unit, the Minister yielded to representations that were made to him on behalf of the Cork Corporation and allowed us to continue with the arrangement, warning us at the same time that it was not to be taken as a precedent and that in future the direct labour unit would have to tender against outside contractors. I would ask the Minister to examine the record of the direct labour unit in Cork and to decide for himself whether or not we have done a good job for the people we represent.  I suggest that if he does so, he will come to the conclusion that the corporation were quite right in their desire to have the direct labour unit continued in operation side by side with the private contractor and that no means should be given to the private contractor to squeeze out the direct labour unit.</P>
    <P>In common with other Deputies, I should also like to ask the Minister to try to yield in the matter of the red tape with which his Department is obviously hamstrung.  We have had instances in Cork where plans have been tossed up and down between Cork and Dublin over simple minor matters and all this time our schemes had been held up.  We are fortunate in Cork in that we have excellent technical advice at our disposal, people who have had experience for some <Col N="758" /> years in these matters and who have turned out very fine schemes.  One would imagine that at this stage the Department of Local Government would display the same confidence in them that we in the Cork Corporation display and that some system could be devised whereby it would be only in exceptional cases that plans would have to be sent back for alteration.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister dealt briefly here yesterday in reply to a question about the Marsh area with our desire to build on derelict sites.  We feel in view of the fact that the vast majority of schemes dealt with by the Cork Corporation have been built on virgin soil, that the time is now ripe, particularly since we have removed a number of people out of slum areas, to tackle the problem of clearing slum areas and building houses on them for our people.  The advantages of building on these sites are very obvious.  We have already water, gas and electricity laid on to these sites and the workers who would be housed in the dwellings built on these sites would not have to pay high bus fares to travel to work or to visit shopping centres.  I feel, in view of the attitude adopted up to now by the Department in the matter of this very tiny scheme of acquiring derelict sites in the Marsh area, that there is a dead hand of officialdom which is apparently determined to ensure that we shall have to go into the middle of the country to acquire land, compulsorily or otherwise, to continue our housing schemes.  I would ask the Minister in this respect to display some practical sympathy with the Cork Corporation in their endeavours to build on central sites which have been recently cleared.</P>
    <P>In connection with schemes given to private contractors, I would ask the Department, if at all possible, to try to encourage a policy of parcelling out schemes into smaller lots.  Naturally in a place like Cork City, we have a number of smaller builders who would be able and willing to tackle a scheme of say 30 to 50 houses but who could not hope to tender for a scheme of 250 houses.  We feel that when the corporation have a scheme of 250 <Col N="759" /> houses, it would be far better if five small builders were encouraged to tender for 50 of these houses each, working all the time in competition with one another but giving the smaller man a chance.  If that policy was adopted by the Department, I think we would make further progress with the schemes that are being allocated to private contractors.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter to which I wish to refer, namely, the matter of town planning.  We have a committee in the corporation which deals with matters arising out of town planning.  A person who wishes to carry out some building or some alteration to his premises applies to the corporation and the matter is dealt with by the committee which deals with town planning.  In the main, we try to be most co-operative with these people.  If we have any objection to their plans we invite them to come in and we hear their side of the story. Sometimes, in the interest of the city and that of the citizens, we have to refuse permission to people to proceed with works that they desire to carry out.  The person has a right of appeal to the Minister.  It has been our experience that more often than not the Minister readily reverses the decision of the town planning committee. In my opinion, it should be in only an exceptional case that the Minister should take the serious step of reversing the decision made by local people in conjunction with their technical advisers.  I would urge the Minister to make quite sure that he will not be influenced by political or any other pressure when such cases come to him for decision.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to co-operate with us as far as he possibly can.  I can assure him on my own behalf and on behalf of every member of every Party in Cork Corporation of our co-operation with the Department of Local Government to see an end to our housing problems.</P>

      <P>One would think there was no place in this country but Cork.  Why do not the members from Cork on both sides of the House confine <Col N="760" /> their activities to the Cork County Council and do their business down there and not be delaying us up here with their parish pump politics?</P>
      <P>I would say to the Minister at the outset that I wish him and the Parliamentary Secretary luck.  They have a very difficult task before them but they will get every co-operation from this side of the House in this very important problem.</P>
      <P>There are many people who expect a decrease in the rate of interest on housing and I would be glad if the Minister would make a statement on that matter.  I am personally interested in the design, building and disposal of speculative houses.  Many people are delaying purchase awaiting an announcement from the Department of Local Government in regard to the rate of interest.  I appreciate that this is governed by the rate at which money can be borrowed.</P>
      <P>There is a method which I would recommend to the Minister whereby he may be able to make a very substantial saving.  The second half of the Government grant is administered by inspectors from the Department of Local Government.  The first half of the Government grant, say, £150, is paid on the certificate of the local engineer and yet the final £125 is not paid until a local government inspector comes down.  I suggest to the Minister that he would consider giving the local authority full power to pay the Government grant, including the final grant. If they are competent enough to certify under the Small Dwellings Act, if they are competent enough to pay the supplementary grant, if they are competent enough to pay the grant on roofing, they should be equally competent to pay the small sum of £125 and the Minister would save a considerable amount in administrative expenses.</P>
      <P>There are inspectors traversing the country trying to justify their existence and sending reports to the Department and holding up builders who are trying to do their best when money is hard enough to get.  I would appeal to the Minister, on these grounds, to cut out the administration of the second half of the grant by the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> There is grave concern throughout the country about the payment of the supplementary grant.  It depends on an Act of 1888 as to the definition of &ldquo;working classes.&rdquo;  The sooner that is cleared up the better.  It is not good enough that the Limerick Corporation can give one definition and the Dublin Corporation can give another definition. It should be clear and aboveboard. People come to me and say they are going to buy a house and ask me if they will get the grant.  They go to the town hall where they are told it is purely hypothetical; that they are not too sure.  People cannot be walked into commitments in that way.</P>
    <P>I want to refute a statement that was made to-day about the previous Minister for Local Government.  I can definitely state that he never refused to sanction a wage increase for any local authority.  The only thing he insisted upon was that that increase should be included in the estimate for the current year or, if not for the current year, for the next year; that it should be agreed that it would be included in the rates for the following year and not made a charge on the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to accept my suggestion in regard to the second half of the Government grant it would result in a very large administrative saving and he could possibly make a small reduction in the interest rate for housing.</P>
    <P>Various Ministries have been criticised in regard to the large outlay on legal costs to house purchasers.  The one solution to that is to let every local authority appoint their own law agent and to pay him a decent salary. The smallest charges in the country are in the Limerick Corporation.  The legal cost to a purchaser is about £3 15s.  In Clare it is £70 or £80.  Every local authority should have their own fulltime law agent.  I would recommend that strongly to the Minister because I know he is anxious to bring down the cost of housing, particularly, as various speakers have said, to newly-weds.</P>
    <P>If earlier payment of grants could be <Col N="762" /> made, local authorities would not have to pay large interests to the bank for future loans.</P>
    <P>As to the differential rent, as far as Limerick is concerned, the minimum is too high and it should be reduced to something reasonable.  There is no parity between the maximum and the minimum.  The minimum should be much lower.  I would strongly recommend that to the Minister.  There are widows and poor people for whom the minimum is much too high.</P>
    <P>The former Minister and I had many an argument in regard to housing.  He did excellent work but I always asked that he would set up a housing board. The Minister knows that there are members of this House who are conversant with housing, such as Deputy Belton and myself, and he could bring in architects and builders.  The Minister has the best Department of State at his disposal in the Department of Local Government, the best officials, but they see one side of the story. There are two sides to every story.  I would strongly recommend the setting up of a housing board representative of all interests, including skilled trades, design, the builder and even the selling end.</P>

      <P>I would like to urge upon the Minister that where plans have been received in his Department for the provision of a water-supply in villages sanction of his Department would be given with the least possible delay.  I need not point out that this is a very important aspect of national development in rural areas.  I am referring to villages of a couple of hundred or more people who are without water supplies.  I understand that in my own constituency plans for the provision of water supplies for at least one village have been with the Department for some time.  It is very desirable that villages and rural communities should have these facilities and I would urge upon the Minister that this is an important matter and that in fact it should receive priority. Sanction of these plans and schemes should receive high priority in his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming from a rural area, I would <Col N="763" /> like to ask the Minister, as soon as possible, to increase the grant to county councils under the Local Authorities (Works) Act for the improvement of rural areas.  A great deal has been said during the course of this debate about urban areas but the amount spent on the development of rural areas, which, to my mind, is more important&mdash;certainly, equally important&mdash;is <Col N="764" /> negligible in comparison with the amount spent in the relief of urban areas.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 30th June.</P>
