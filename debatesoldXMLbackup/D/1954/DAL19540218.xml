      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the reconstruction work of the viaduct at Fenit, County Kerry, is near completion and that repeated applications have been made to his Department for financial assistance to complete the dredging of the harbour; and, if so, if he will state if it is proposed to make a grant available to carry out the work.</P>

      <P>A State grant amounting to over £200,000 is being made available to the Tralee and Fenit Harbour Commissioners to meet the cost of an approved scheme of works which is now approaching completion. In addition, a grant of over £17,000 was made for the repair of the commissioners' dredger.  The position is, therefore, that the State has made a direct and substantial contribution to the cost of the dredging referred to in the question and no further contribution is contemplated.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question No. 2 and Question No. 3 together.  From the information available in my Department, it appears that two industrial projects for the Fermoy area have reached an advanced stage, but the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to answer for the plans of, or the progress made by, private interests engaged in industrial activity.</P>
      <P>The formulation of further industrial proposals for the Fermoy area is a matter for private enterprise.  I will give every encouragement to the promoters of any sound project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether, in view of the reduction in the price of malting barley from 84/- per barrel to 63/9 per barrel, which represents 1d. per pint of stout, the consumers of stout and porter may expect to receive the benefit of this reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the price paid for malting barley of the 1953 crop was 66/9 per barrel delivered. The price of barley is only one of the factors concerned and there is no prospect of a reduction in the price of intoxicating liquor by reason only of the reduction in the price of barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

      <P>Is the Minister aware that one of the brewing firms concerned increased its gross profit from £5,242,000 in 1952 to £5,681,000 last year, an increase of over £400,000?  In these circumstances, would the Minister not think that the reduced price which is being paid for barley should be passed on to the consumer?</P>
      <P>In view of the unsatisfactory nature of the reply, I propose, with your permission, Sir, to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not so that a duty of 20 per cent. is levied on imports of superphosphate, except in the case of those who get licences to import it duty free and that they are required to give an undertaking that they will not sell it in competition with the Irish manure ring?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy wants to close down the artificial manure factories in this country or not, but the fact is that, although there is a duty of 20 per cent. we imported in the year referred to in the question £2,606,000 worth of fertilisers and the total amount collected was £4,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Beegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.  The lands of Moorepark, Kilworth, County Cork, have not yet been transferred to the Land Commission for sub-division as the necessary enabling legislation has not been enacted.</P>
      <P>Pending the transfer to the Land Commission it is not proposed to have the lands let for tillage purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are close on 1,000 acres of good tillage land there and in view of the suggestion made by the Government that we should have more production of agricultural produce by the general farming community one would think that land owned by the State would be used as an example instead of being used as it is, as a grazing ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that there are about 450 acres of arable land there.  During the emergency years a considerable portion of the arable land was let in conacre.  From 1944 there was a progressive decline in the amount of tillage let there each year until 1949, when there were only 10½ acres taken, and at that time the commissioners had to have the land laid down and reseeded.  In view of that and also the absence of evidence that there are applicants for any considerable amount of tillage there it would not be warranted to have the land let.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether the question of the <Col N="688" /> name to be given to the chest hospital at Abbotstown, County Dublin, is being considered; and, if so, whether, in view of James Connolly's devotion to the cause of Dublin workers and his work as founder and leader of the Irish Citizen Army, and because of the respect and regard of Dubliners for him, this hospital will be named after him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons engaged in fishing, other than share fishermen, are, if employed under a contract of service, insurable under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, for all the benefits provided under that Act.  They are accordingly eligible to receive unemployment benefit, if unemployed and otherwise qualified. Contributions at a reduced rate are payable in respect of share fishermen, that is, persons employed as members of the crew of a fishing vessel and wholly remunerated by a share in the profits or gross earnings of the working of the vessel.  These reduced contributions are available for all the benefits of the Act other than unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to unemployment assistance, fishermen who work for an employer and receive wages or other remuneration are in the same position as other employees.  They are eligible to receive unemployment assistance if unemployed and otherwise qualified. Fishermen who engage in fishing on <Col N="689" /> their own account may, if not otherwise ineligible, receive unemployment assistance but at rates reduced in accordance with the means derived from fishing, the means being assessed on the net profits in the same way as for other self-employed persons.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware. Quite a number of sale schemes have been carried out by urban housing <Col N="692" /> authorities over the past 30 years.  As recently as last July a circular letter was issued to all urban housing authorities outlining for their guidance standard minimum terms and conditions which might be observed in formulating further sale schemes.  The question of introducing proposals for legislation in the matter does not arise.</P>

There will be considerably more work involved than has been involved in the past.  I think the House will agree there is very substantial room for improvement. It is a matter for the members themselves, or for the appointing committee, to consider whether they will reconsider the whole matter in the light of the changed circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of this short Bill is to continue for some time further the operation of the General Cattle Diseases Fund established under the Diseases of Animals Acts for the purpose of effecting a more equitable incidence among local authorities of the cost of performing their functions under the Acts in dealing with certain animal diseases, which may happen to affect some areas&mdash; especially the poorer areas&mdash;more than others.  Moneys are paid into the fund from three sources, (1) local rate assessments, constituting the principal source, (2) contributions from the Exchequer equivalent to one-fourth of the compensation paid by local authorities for animals slaughtered under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order <Col N="703" /> of 1926, and (3) fines recovered for certain offences against the Diseases of Animals Acts.  The maximum contribution to the fund from local rate assessments was fixed in 1894 at ½d. in the £ at any one time, subject to a maximum total of assessments of 8d. in the £. The maximum total of assessments has since been increased by a number of amending Acts.  The last increase in the maximum total of assessments was 2d. under the 1949 Act, bringing the total from 1894 onwards to ? in the £.  This total amount has now been assessed and the fund is nearing exhaustion.  The amount in the fund on 31st December, 1953, was £9,236; the payments out of the fund during the year 1953 amounted to £34,584. The further increase of the maximum total of assessments by 2d. in the £ is now proposed under Clause I of the Bill.  The maximum local rate assessment which may be made at any one time for contribution to the fund remains at ½d. in the £.  An assessment of ½d. in the £ realises about £27,500.</P>
    <P>The payments out of the fund to local authorities comprise half of each local authority's expenditure under the Diseases of Animals Acts.  The main items of such expenditure are (1) the salaries for duties under the Acts of the local authority veterinary inspectors who are mostly part-time; (2) compensation payments under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order of 1926, and (3) expenditure in connection with sheep dipping.  The main duties of local authority veterinary inspectors under the Acts comprise&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  examination of all animals reported under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order of 1926 and the slaughtering of the animal where appropriate;</P>
    <P>(b)  supervision of sheep dipping;</P>
    <P>(c)  attendance at fairs in connection with the operation of the Sheep Scab Order and other Orders under the Diseases of Animals Acts;</P>
    <P>(d)  attendance at all cases or suspected cases of scheduled animal diseases.</P>
    <P>Veterinary inspectors are, of course, <Col N="704" /> also employed by local authorities for public health duties in relation to meat and milk hygiene but the expenditure in that connection does not come within the scope of the General Cattle Diseases Fund.  According as the central veterinary services of my Department have developed through the years, some of the veterinary functions formerly proper to the local authorities have become the responsibility of the central authority. It is obvious that, for example, should diseases of national significance occur here, such as foot and mouth disease, fowl pest, etc.&mdash;from which we are of course happily free&mdash;they could only be dealt with adequately by the central authority.  It would not be appropriate, however, to abolish entirely the local authority veterinary services under the Diseases of Animals Acts although they may be expected to diminish as such&mdash;for example as regards bovine tuberculosis in respect of which a comprehensive national scheme is now envisaged.  The existing local authority veterinary arrangements need some reorganisation, however, and this has been receiving my Department's attention.</P>
    <P>Certain anomalies as regards the extent and grouping of individual districts, the salaries attached to the posts, etc., have accumulated through the years.  These anomalies are being remedied as far as circumstances allow but it will be some time before the reorganisation can be completed throughout the entire country, as the existing tenure of posts in many cases makes immediate reorganisation rather difficult.  The local authority veterinary inspectors may, of course, engage in private practice and an important effect of reorganisation in some counties should be to bring about a better distribution of veterinary surgeons in the counties concerned.  In some areas veterinary surgeons are sparse and farmers frequently have to incur considerable expenditure in obtaining the services of a veterinary surgeon.  Where, as in some counties on the west coast, the reorganisation measures will involve an increase in the number of local part-time inspectors the veterinary services <Col N="705" /> available to farmers generally in the counties will be considerably improved. The significant increase in the number of practising veterinary surgeons in recent years is to be welcomed but many more are needed, particularly in the Gaeltacht and congested districts generally.  The increase in the number will materially assist the reorganisation of the local authority veterinary services which is now proceeding.</P>
    <P>With regard to expenditure by local authorities under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order of 1926 the position has been that three-fourths of such expenditure is met from the Exchequer, i.e., one-half direct from the Vote for Agriculture and one-fourth indirectly through the General Cattle Diseases Fund.  The number of animals slaughtered under this Order in recent years has been less than 1,000 per annum and it is clear that not much headway could be made under the Order towards the control of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>As already announced, it is proposed to introduce at an early date a comprehensive scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Proposals for obtaining some money from American Aid Grant Counterpart funds in connection with initiation of the scheme were submitted early last year to the American authorities and I hope to be able to start on the scheme this year.  I am not yet, however, in a position to give details of it but, in general, the intention is that the scheme will provide for commencing with intensive eradication measures in one area with less intensive measures for a start in the rest of the country.  The scheme will commence in each area on a voluntary basis but will have to be made compulsory when the proportion of farmers participating in it warrants such action.  The administration of the Bovine Tuberculosis Order which is financed out of the General Cattle Diseases Fund will, of course, be reviewed in connection with the initiation of the comprehensive scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards the administration by local authorities of the annual sheepdipping requirements, the number of <Col N="706" /> outbreaks of sheep scab has been declining in recent years and is now very small.  The decrease may largely be attributed to the increased use of benzene-hexachloride single-type dips which have proved very effective not only against sheep scab but also against skin parasites which are important means of spreading disease and in addition cause wastage of the animals and damage to the fleeces.  With full co-operation by flock-owners, sheep scab could be entirely eradicated in a very short time.</P>
    <P>Clause 2 of the Bill provides for extension of the power of making Orders under the Diseases of Animals Acts to enable the export of live pigeons to be prohibited except under licence.  Since 1950, because of the position regarding animal disease (including poultry disease) in Britain and in continental countries, the export of live pigeons has been prohibited by an Order made under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Acts, but this control will lapse when the supplies and services legislation will expire next year.  There is a possibility that in the course of return flights to this country, racing pigeons may introduce poultry or other animal disease, and it is, accordingly, essential that there should be power to regulate the export of such pigeons.  It is not possible, however, to say at present whether or not the export prohibition will need to be continued when the present control Order will lapse next year; this will depend on the disease situation in Britain and elsewhere at the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a depressing discovery that we are in exactly the same position in regard to this matter in February, 1954, as we were in June, 1949.  I introduced an amending Bill in 1949 to permit the local authorities to levy four more several halfpennies for the purposes of these Acts.  I then told Dáil Éireann that we had in mind plans for the reorganisation of the veterinary services, and that was true. I want to know what has become of the scheme to reorganise the veterinary services.  The veterinary division of the Department of Agriculture has had express instructions now for at least seven years to produce proposals to <Col N="707" /> that end.  They never got round to producing them while I was there, and I will be glad to know from the Minister if they have got round to doing it yet.</P>
      <P>Now, the second matter I wish to refer to is this, that we are told to-day that the Minister proposes to bring in further proposals for the control of bovine tuberculosis and he would appear to imply that the delay in doing so is in some way associated with the fact that he is waiting approbation from the Congress of the United States for the user of a part of the Marshall Aid Grant Counterpart Fund for the purpose of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme.  It is interesting to note that the Minister still has unused £6,000,000 odd of the Marshall Aid Grant Counterpart Fund.  What I want to warn the House of is that this is a threadbare and fraudulent alibi. I think the proposal was that one-fifth of that Grant Counterpart Fund&mdash;or was it so much; perhaps the Minister will tell us&mdash;was appropriated to the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>£1,250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, one-fifth.  Does the House seriously imagine that any substantial progress can be made in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in this country with the expenditure of £1,250,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my considered judgment, if and when a scheme designed to achieve the purpose of eradicating bovine tuberculosis from this country is in operation, £1,250,000 will not finance the operations requisite in any given year.  It is positively suicidal to &ldquo;fluther&rdquo; along, putting this whole matter on the long finger, on the ground that we are awaiting permission from the Congress of the United States of America to get it going.  I do not want for a single moment to underestimate the formidable nature of the task which confronts whoever may be Minister for Agriculture in connection with this business but, if we are right in our anticipations that in the foreseeable future the British Government may require all cattle exported to Great Britain to be certified free from tuberculosis, no expenditure <Col N="708" /> requisite to eliminate that disease in this country can be considered excessive, provided it is prudently dispensed and effectively used.</P>
    <P>Now I ask the House to remember that I have present to my mind that I inaugurated a scheme in Bansha which was designed, and which I think was effective, to eliminate in that individual parish all uneconomic cows, including those which appeared to be reactors to the tuberculin test.  The House might bear in mind, in dealing with this whole problem, that in applying tuberculin reaction test to cattle, you have got to face the fact that 70 per cent. of all reactors may on slaughter show no clinical sign or pathological evidence of tubercular infection. In fact, it is reasonable to believe that up to 50 per cent. of all reacting cattle would, in fact, recover from the disease if allowed to survive. Furthermore, we have got to face the fact that cattle suffering from Johne's disease will react to the tuberculin test.  So far as I know, there is no means to distinguish the reaction of Johne's disease from the reaction of tuberculosis to the tuberculin test.  Yet the tuberculin test is the best instrument we have for locating incipient tuberculosis in cattle, and it is on that test we may have, in the main, to depend.</P>
    <P>It was my intention, when the parish of Bansha was dealt with, to authorise the veterinary officers of my Department, with those of the local authority in Limerick, Cork and Tipperary, to deal with the three adjoining parishes to Bansha, and from that centre, as the Minister will find in his records, to move out to parishes contiguous to those three adjoining parishes, and thus steadily to push into the very heart of the dairy districts, eliminating tubercular reacting cattle as we went along.  Nobody in the Department underestimated the formidable nature of the task which confronted us, and it was realised that some very considerable expense might be involved but it was also realised that the sooner we put our hand to it, the more time we would have to get the job done before any emergency was upon us.</P>
    <P>An interesting fact is that, by a <Col N="709" /> peculiar concatenation of circumstances, it was possible to eradicate all the uneconomic cattle in the parish of Bansha without any charge to the Exchequer at all, and it is a source of amazement to me that the Minister has not, <i>ad interim</i> at least, pressed forward with that plan until such other plans as he has in mind could be brought into operation.  I am wholly at a loss to understand the logic of the procedure which he has envisaged in this House of inaugurating a scheme for the elimination of tuberculosis in cattle in Counties Clare and Donegal. What nexus there is between these centres is a complete mystery to me. Perhaps the Minister will explain that to us.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister is really fair to the House in saying: &ldquo;Pass this Bill which authorises us to carry on with the Diseases of Animals Acts for another four years and I will tell you about my proposals for the elimination of tuberculosis in cattle as soon as they are ready.&rdquo;  I think he should have told us to-day.  It causes me acute concern to learn that he is not in a position to tell us to-day, that his scheme is not formulated and that he does not know what he is going to do.  Surely if he does know, now is the time to tell us.  Why does he not? Surely if he is asking for funds wherewith to carry on the Diseases of Animals Acts for another four years, he should be in a position to say: &ldquo;But this is not all we plan to do; over and above what I can do under this Bill an efficient scheme is to be launched for the radical elimination of disease.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am warning the House that it is suicidal to let this matter drift on.  I am warning the House that seven years ago the veterinary section of the Department of Agriculture was directed to produce a scheme for the reorganisation of the whole veterinary services of the country and it has not been produced yet.  I consider that to be a grave reflection on the veterinary division of the Department of Agriculture, unless the reflection is on the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister has a scheme and that he is unable to make <Col N="710" /> up his mind about it.  I cannot imagine that we are in the position that the Minister has no scheme from his technical advisers for dealing with bovine tuberculosis.  I assume that he has and that we are in the deplorable position that he is himself vacillating and cannot make up his mind whether to put it into operation.  Surely if he has a scheme which he intends ultimately to operate now is the time to tell us about it.  Now is the time to give to the live-stock industry an assurance that we are going ahead with a scheme to eradicate tuberculosis in cattle, whether or not any part of the Marshall Aid Counterpart Fund is made available for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister may submit to the House that he is waiting to see what progress has been made in connection with the scheme which was operated in Bansha for the elimination of uneconomic cows and whether that scheme has succeeded where it has been extended into an adjoining parish.  I think the House should be warned that the methods for the elimination of bovine tuberculosis permitted under the existing Diseases of Animals Act are antediluvian and wholly ineffective because under these Acts you have the position arising, from precedents established under them, that no beast may be compulsorily slaughtered unless and until it shows clinical signs of tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>When you venture to inquire into what are the clinical signs of tuberculosis within the meaning of these Acts you discover they include both emaciation and chronic cough but by the time either&mdash;never mind both&mdash;of those symptoms manifest themselves a cow has already long been a menace to any human creature who consumes her milk and to every other beast with which she comes in contact.  The methods appropriate to the elimination of tuberculosis under our modern conditions must be far more radical and must be designed to catch the complaint at a very much earlier stage.</P>
    <P>I think it right for the House to advert to the formidable character of the difficulty we have before us.  Let me tell the House of my own experience of a herd of which I have some <Col N="711" /> knowledge and in which there were 14 dairy cows.  On the semi-annual test being made of that herd five of the best cows were found to be reactors.  None of them had any sign whatever of clinical tuberculosis; yet all five had to be disposed of.  Such resolute action has, however, its rewards because at the next semi-annual test of that herd there was no reactor in the herd at all.  And six months later the same story could be told.  I mention that fact for this reason.  One of our big difficulties will be to carry conviction into the minds of farmers throughout the country that the vital and essential thing is courageously to accept the drastic measures requisite to get your herd on to a sound foundation, but that you have every prospect if you courageously take those necessary measures in the first case of enjoying a prolonged period of immunity from future infection, especially if it be possible to maintain a closed herd the heifers for which one breeds oneself.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to know that he is assured of the co-operation and help of every section of this House if and when he puts his hand to the task of eliminating bovine tuberculosis in the country.  I think he ought equally be assured that he will expose himself to the sternest reprobation of all responsible Deputies in this House if he allows himself to be fluthered, flustered, bullied or bluffed into a long postponement of what is in fact a very urgent consideration.  I think it right to tell him now that the alibi about the Marshall Aid Grant Counterpart Fund cuts no ice.  I do not believe it. I am quite certain it is being used simply for the purpose of concealing the fact that the Minister for Agriculture is not himself ready to go ahead.  In the last analysis it is this Oireachtas which must find the means to deal with the bovine tuberculosis problem.  We are not depending on the American Treasury and it would be madness to suggest that in default of assistance from that source it was impossible for us to tackle the problem ourselves.  It should be tackled forthwith by ourselves.  If there is any <Col N="712" /> subvention forthcoming from the Marshall Aid Grant Counterpart Fund so much the better, and were we not to get a penny piece from that source our own resources must be employed and that without delay to deal with this matter effectively.</P>
    <P>In regard to racing pigeons I know that capital might be made by seeking to embarrass the Minister on behalf of the racing pigeon enthusiasts in this country.  I do not propose to stoop to that kind of fraud much as I experienced it myself from the present Minister when I was in office.  I know perfectly well the Minister for Agriculture desires no more than I do unduly to restrict the pleasures of the racing pigeon fanciers but the fact is that the dangers associated with the importation of Newcastle disease by birds wild or tame are so great that no rational person would withhold from the Minister the right to make the kind of Orders which I myself made when I was Minister for Agriculture restricting the export of homing pigeons lest on release abroad they fly home carrying with them disease which could cost this country dear.</P>
    <P>God knows there was a time when Newcastle disease was really thought to be a catastrophe for this country. Those were the halcyon days when the lowest price payable for eggs was 2/6 per dozen.  Those were the halcyon days when Deputy Allen used to cry salt tears when he thought of eggs being only 2/6 per dozen.  Poor Deputy Carter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It seems incongruous to us that tripe of that sort should be flogged about, but it is good to remind those who spend time flogging tripe of that kind around the country of what they used to do.  The Minister is entitled to the power and with the disappearance of the Supplies and Services Act under which I acted he will require express power under this which he had not heretofore had.  We make no difficulty for him.  We think it right that he should have those powers and use them where he gets reliable technical advice to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one last word to say on that. It is this.  I exhort the Minister to <Col N="714" /> bear in mind that ultimately he is the responsible person.  I yield to no one in my respect for the value of technical advice.  I should like to warn the Minister of this. If the technical officers of his Department for the shortest possible period get his authority to clamp down some restriction in the name of safety, there is a strong tendency, once that restriction goes on, to leave it on for ever and they will always say: &ldquo;Look, everything is going grand now.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been an accepted tradition in this House that civil servants are not to be criticised. The Minister is really responsible to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not criticising civil servants.  If he calls together, as he will do, a group of bacteriologists&mdash;I am not referring to the advisers in the Department&mdash;to advise him on the incidence of Newcastle disease they will so advise him.  The advisory body may consist of bacteriologists, biologists, zoologists and so forth and they will advise the Minister while they are examining this problem to exclude all birds and the Minister will wisely do that.  They may then come back and, having examined the whole of the question, find that the dangers are not as evident as they first appeared to be. But they will say: &ldquo;You have succeeded in persuading the Dáil to accept the proposal and the wise thing to do is to keep it on.&rdquo;  The Minister's view should be that he is not asking the advisory body to tell him what to do but that he is asking them for their advice and that he will make up his mind what he ought to do.  He should weigh their views and accept what he thinks best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that it is a very heavy burden for a layman to say to technical advisers: &ldquo;I have listened to your advice and up to a certain point I am prepared to give legislative effect to it, but I am not prepared to go to the excessive extremes you think would provide 100 per cent. safety and which, I think, goes far beyond the reasonable limits to effect the purpose we have in mind.&rdquo;  It is a mistake to delegate the <Col N="715" /> task of taking the final decision to technical advisers because they are bound to give advice which in their judgment is 110 per cent. safe.  It is the Minister who sometimes has to take the risk of saying: &ldquo;I am prepared to go so far, but I am not prepared to go 110 per cent. because that is oppressive and unnecessarily irritating, whereas we are justified for the common good in taking 10 per cent. of the risk rather than leave the shackles permanent in order that there will be 110 per cent. safety.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Subject to these observations, we have no objection to this Bill.  I earnestly press on the Minister that he should avail of the opportunity at some stage of this Bill to give us an outline of what his intentions are and reassure us that he is not going to wait on the Congress of the United States.  If he gets a windfall from that source he will be glad to add it to the other funds, but in the meantime he should go full steam ahead as there is no time to be lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why the House should delay on this matter.  It is one which has met, I think, with universal approval.  I should like to support the point of view put forward by Deputy Dillon in regard to the importance of this measure.  It is a matter of extreme urgency.  If information is to be relied upon, the British are about to insist that any cattle allowed into Britain in the near future must be tuberculin tested.  I do not think anyone has to be told the serious situation that would develop if, in a month's time, or to-morrow, Britain said: &ldquo;We will not allow any Irish cattle in here unless they are tuberculin tested.&rdquo;  I know Britain will not say that, but she is quite at liberty to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since she has indicated in no uncertain terms that she will do that in the not distant future, why should we delay here?  If this were a small matter, people might say: &ldquo;Look at the cost,&rdquo; but what will the cost be in comparison with the amount of money this country would lose if caught on the wrong foot?  It is such a serious question that the Minister and his <Col N="716" /> Department cannot possibly have overlooked it.  It would be desirable if we were to get financial assistance for this scheme which is going to cost money but at the same time I do not see what is to be gained by postponing a decision on that matter.</P>
    <P>I doubt very much if the appointment of a large number of veterinary surgeons throughout the country, if and when the scheme is put into operation, is the most economic way to deal with the matter.  Thinking over this matter, I imagine that the most expeditious and most economical way it could be achieved would be by mobile units rather than by planting a very large number of veterinary surgeons throughout the country.  I submit to the Minister that that is a point worthy of consideration.  I do not think it is going to be solved by a large number of veterinary surgeons in every county nor do I think that that is the most expeditious and economic way.</P>
    <P>The matter is one which should claim the urgent attention of the Minister. If he cannot get financial assistance from outside sources, he should face up to the fact that the finances to solve the problem must be found here.  There is no advantage to be gained by deferring a decision on it. The British people have left no doubt whatever in my mind, at any rate, that in the not very distant future it is most unlikely that any exports of store cattle will be allowed into Britain unless they are tuberculin tested. Whether that is a good or solid test or not I am not going to argue.  The fact that they accept it will do us.</P>
    <P>I said before in this House&mdash;I do not think anybody will dispute it with me&mdash;that the magnitude of our store cattle exports is such that we should spare no effort to prevent anything endangering it.  We use them to purchase many of the things we could not have at all.  Whatever the future may hold&mdash;and there is some uncertainty&mdash;for the trade and no matter what happens to the prices, it is one of the most important factors of our economic life.  We are justified in spending whatever money is necessary to protect it and I am sure that any <Col N="717" /> measure the Minister may take in that direction will have the support of every member of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the importance of our live-stock population generally, I think nobody will hesitate to give the Minister support in seeking additional financial provision for our veterinary service.  It is true to say that while a great deal has been done there is still a very substantial measure of loss to the agricultural industry through wasting and deaths on account of various animal diseases. Everything that can be done should be done to speed up all possible improvements in our veterinary service.  The House will welcome the Minister's statement that it is proposed to take action on a nation wide scale to deal with bovine tuberculosis.  The suggestion which he has outlined, that action will be taken on a very intensive scale in some counties and less intensively in others for a time would appear to be the sound way to approach this problem.  Whatever may be done by compulsory action it is desirable to encourage the maximum amount of voluntary action.  Every farmer should be encouraged to avail of all the services that can be secured to eliminate this disease from his own particular herd.  If there is a large number of farmers throughout the country who have carried out this elimination of the disease on a voluntary basis, it will make it easier to clean up the remainder of the country.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that this problem is urgent and I am sure the Minister realises that.  There is no doubt that the British, having taken action to clean up their own herds, will seek to prevent contamination from abroad.  I do not go as far, perhaps, as Deputy Finan in saying that they have absolute power, at the moment at any rate, ruthlessly to exclude non-tested cattle; I do not think they are in a position to do that because of the supply position.  However, in order to preserve our export trade we must eliminate this disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we should look at it from that point of view alone although that point of view is very important. <Col N="718" /> We should also look at it from the aspect of preserving and maintaining the health of our people.  We should seek, as far as possible, not to have a form of infection in our live stock and dairy herds which may extend to the human population.  That is an important consideration and one which, I am sure, weighs with the Minister.</P>
    <P>On the question of exports I am one of those who believe that in future we will have to lay more emphasis on the export of meat rather than of dairy produce.  It is in the expansion, perhaps, of the volume of our meat exports rather than in the expansion, of our dairy produce surplus that we shall be able to develop agriculture. Therefore it is essential that we should be in the top grade not only in regard to the quality of our stock exported but also in regard to the health of our live-stock exports.</P>
    <P>While measures for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis may be expensive and may be somewhat inconvenient it is recognised by the farming community in general that they are essential, and the Minister and his Department will have a large measure of goodwill and co-operation from them in regard to this matter.</P>

      <P>One expected that the Minister in his opening statement on this measure would have outlined a detailed scheme for the eradication of tuberculosis.  Britain has been dealing <Col N="719" /> with this problem over the last five or six years and they have quite a large area of the country now clear of tuberculosis.  That will have a very serious effect on our live-stock trade, especially in our store trade.  It is quite apparent that a number of markets are closed to our cattle at the present time and we have been doing nothing to remedy the position. The attention of the people all over the country has been drawn to the situation and they are very much alarmed.  I was sure we would hear a more detailed account of what was intended to be done.  It seems that the question of American aid on this scheme is holding it up to some extent.</P>
      <P>I remember as far back as five years ago speaking to one of the veterinary people in Britain who told me that if we did not proceed with some scheme of this kind we would be out of the British market altogether, that they were moving along and we seemed to be doing nothing in that direction. Some people here have the idea that the British have nowhere to get their stores except from Ireland but it is quite natural to expect that, if the British Government are spending large sums of money on the eradication of tuberculosis, they are not going to allow in our cattle and will compel us to send our cattle over in the same condition.  I appeal to the Minister to push this scheme forward immediately. I believe every Deputy in the House is very anxious that that should be done.</P>

      <P>I was very pleased indeed with Deputy Dillon's approach to this Bill.  If it were not for the little outburst at the end it was very reasonable.  As regards the Bill itself, I think I covered it pretty well in my opening statement and explained what it is designed to do, namely, to make more money available for the purposes of the Diseases of Animals Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of diseases generally and the reorganisation of the veterinary services, I think I mentioned some time ago that it was necessary that we should reorganise the veterinary services in the country. We have been doing that.  As a matter <Col N="720" /> of fact, arrangements are being made at the present time for permanent appointments in many areas in different counties.  For instance permanent appointments have been made in Galway and Donegal and there has been a greater extension of the services there.</P>
    <P>We have been carrying out experiments in the matter of the eradication of white scour, parasitic diseases, and so forth.  From the general viewpoint, there has been no neglect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have continued Deputy Dillon's Bansha scheme even though he said to-day that it did not cost the State anything.  It cost somebody something: it cost the meat exporters much money. Due to the high profits they were getting on the American market for meat they were enabled to subsidise the scheme in Bansha.  Later, these prices dropped.  It is not the lucrative market now that it was when Deputy Dillon was sitting on this side of the House.  The result is that the fund which was created in that period is now almost exhausted.</P>

I do not know whether the Deputy was present on that occasion.  I stated that we were starting this scheme in Clare and that in our submission to the American Congress, we stated that we could utilise a certain sum of this money&mdash;about a fifth of it&mdash;for the purpose of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  We have done that.  I do not suppose that we would be paying any tribute to the Americans if we started out without their approval, but we hope to have that approval within a very short space of time and then we will be able to proceed with the work.  Do not let any Deputy on the opposite side of the House imagine for one moment that we are not as deeply concerned about the eradication of bovine tuberculosis as he and his Party are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On that, I want to direct the Minister's attention to something which, I think, will cause the country <Col N="723" /> considerable malaise.  If the Minister has completed the scheme for the eradication of tuberculosis, I do implore him not to wait to inaugurate that scheme pending approbation by the Congress of the United States.  Let me remind him that I had exactly the same difficulty to deal with in connection with the ground limestone subsidy scheme which was to be financed out of the Marshall Aid Grant Counterpart Fund.  If I had waited to get the approbation of the Marshall Aid administration to inaugurate that scheme&mdash;albeit the funds to finance it were to be derived from that fund&mdash;there would be no ground limestone in the country now.  But, in exactly the same circumstances, I asked the Government&mdash;once we had taken the decision to go ahead with the scheme&mdash;to finance it <i>ad interim</i> from the Irish Exchequer and then recoup the Exchequer in so far as it might seem proper so to do if and when the Marshall Aid Grant Counterpart Fund came to hand, but, in the meantime, to get on with the job.</P>
      <P>I fully sympathise with the difficulties of the Minister for Agriculture. I know what it is to have to surmount the Treasury when you are trying to get work of this kind done.  But if you come to Dáil Éireann and get legislation authorising the Government to borrow and spend £5,000,000 a year, without Supplementary Estimates, surely the Minister could persuade his colleagues to give him, out of that annual grant, a sum sufficient to get the tuberculosis elimination scheme working&mdash;and then let the Minister for Finance appropriate to the recoupment of the Exchequer whatever sum the Government think proper if and when the Marshall Aid money comes to hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do not let the people think we are all agreed on every side of the House that the elimination of bovine tuberculosis is urgent, that we are all agreed that we would like to see the scheme and that we are all agreed and willing to help to make it better, if we can, but that, despite those facts, everybody in Oireachtas Éireann is allowing himself to be held up because the Congress of the United States has not had time to get round <Col N="724" /> to the consideration of the draft plan we submitted consequent upon the Government's inability to complete their schemes before the Marshall Aid administration went out of existence. I assure the Minister that he is quite entitled to say to his colleagues that the pressure brought to bear upon him in the Dáil to get on with this job pending an ultimate decision as to the disposition of the Marshall Aid Grant Counterpart Fund was irresistible.  If I thought it would help the Minister I would have held up this Bill and generally upset the whole applecart, which I was legitimately entitled to do.  If I thought it would have strengthened the hands of the Minister for Agriculture, I would have refused him any accommodation in respect of this Bill here to-day.  I assume that what I am saying will carry as much weight as if I had taken the most energetic action along those lines.  I do urge on the Minister to say that little short of scandal will be created in the country at large if, when every side of the House is unanimous in saying to the Minister that this is a matter of urgency and prime importance, the Minister for Agriculture should come into the House and say: &ldquo;My hands are tied unless and until we hear from Washington.&rdquo;  That should not be and the Minister has the full authority of the Opposition to say to his colleagues that it makes his position intolerable to ask him to stand over such a proposition in Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon regarding going ahead with the scheme now, but I would remind him that one of the conditions laid down to avail of the Grant Counterpart Fund is that there cannot be retrospective payments.  That is the only reason. If we went ahead now with our scheme for the country generally, we would not be able to get any money from the Grant Counterpart Fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>What is in this Bill is little; it is not much.  It is a very insignificant gesture on the part of the Minister to ease a very serious, widespread grievance in the country. Although hampered by the terms and long title of the Bill we on this side of the House endeavoured to amend the Bill in Committee, to widen its scope, to make its concessions more generous and generally to give it some reality.  Unfortunately, the Committee of the House were against us in that and the Bill passed through Committee in the same way as it entered it&mdash;an insignificant measure that falls far short of requirements.  All we can say now is that we hope whatever little concession is given in the operation of this Bill will impress the Minister or future Ministers that the problem of rate relief and valuation reform must be tackled in the very near future. More and more people realise the fearful consequences in store for them if they do anything, even of a trivial nature, to their premises.  They realise that even a small improvement will result in the imposition of considerable taxation.  That brings about a condition of stagnation so far as business is concerned and a general feeling of insecurity.  We on this side of the House hoped to solve that situation by the Bill which we introduced some months ago but which was not adopted by the House.  I do not think the present Bill goes any worthwhile distance towards solving the problem but, in so far as it is a little step forward, it has our good wishes.</P>

      <P>Because of the way in which this institution is fashioned it is only natural that members of the Opposition will try to enlarge and expand proposals of this kind which are introduced. Deputy Cogan, on Second <Col N="726" /> Reading, reminded the Deputies opposite that a Government has responsibility and the position of those having responsibility is very different from the position of members of the Opposition Party.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to the fact that the country is clamouring for a remodelling of valuation methods and our whole valuation system.

Even if it were the case, why should they not; and why should not the Minister, speaking for them and for the House, be influenced by such expressions of opinion?  After all, Deputy O'Higgins could have taken some steps as a member of this House&mdash;for a shorter period, I admit, than we have had the responsibility.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the statement made by Deputy O'Higgins <Col N="727" /> that because of the chaotic condition of our rural valuation system some effort should be made by the Government to recondition it and refashion it. These words are all very well, they are nice to listen to, but they mean nothing, because the Deputy who gives expression to them does not follow them up and say what the result would be.</P>
      <P>This measure is designed to encourage people in business and elsewhere who might not otherwise carry out certain desirable improvements, which in themselves would give employment, and so on.  We have gone as far as we could reasonably go, having regard to the other interests involved in this. There are such other interests and Deputy O'Higgins, if he were more closely connected with local bodies, would have learned what those interests are.  We can all be very generous &mdash;and members of the Opposition Parties can be generous&mdash;when a measure of this nature is introduced, in efforts to expand it and spread it and to relieve further burdens from those whom the measure is intended to relieve.  However, urban councils must, according to law, pay county demands on the basis of gross valuation. Certain hardships may result even from the provisions of this measure as it is.</P>

I am sure it will be appreciated by those who, in the years ahead, will proceed to make use of it.  They will obtain the advantages of these improvements themselves, while there will be a consequent effect on the countryside and in towns and villages because of the employment that will occur as a result of the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting-Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now <Col N="728" /> read a Second Time.  This Bill makes provision for further issues from the Local Loans Fund in respect of local loans.  The existing statutory limit on aggregate issues as fixed by the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1953, is £70,000,000.  The Bill extends this limit to £90,000,000.</P>
      <P>Issues from the fund from the 1st May, 1935&mdash;when it was established&mdash; up to 31st December, 1953, amounted to approximately £57,500,000, of which £47,500,000 was for housing loans, £6,500,000 for public health loans, over £780,000 for a temporary advance to Dublin Corporation under the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1945, in connection with redemption of stock, over £1,000,000 for vocational education loans and £1,500,000 for loans for other services.</P>
      <P>Over the same period, sanctions for loans from the fund&mdash;including a carry-over from before 1st May, 1935&mdash; came to approximately £68,500,000.  The difference between the figure for sanctions and the figure for issues is accounted for by the fact that while loans are normally sanctioned in full they are issued in instalments as required by the borrowing authorities.</P>
      <P>The total of commitments at 31st December, 1953, stood within £1,500,000 of the present limit of £70,000,000, and the additional margin of £20,000,000 provided for in the Bill should suffice to cover commitments for another two years or so at the present rate of issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose there is any purpose for which it can be more proper for Oireachtas Éireann to authorise the issue of loan money than the purpose of the Local Loans Fund, particularly in so far as that money is advanced to local authorities for the purpose of financing loans to citizens under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  I want to ask the House, now that we are about to authorise the issue of a further £20,000,000 for this purpose, how can we under the rule of reason continue to approve of an arrangement initiated in February, 1953, whereunder we increased the interest rate chargeable on money borrowed to build houses for our own people by 2 per cent. at a time when, for reasons that seemed good and sufficient to the Minister for Finance, we are actually lending £62,000,000 sterling at 2 per cent. to the British Government to build houses for their people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do Deputies appreciate what the increase in the interest rate charged on the Local Loans Fund loans from 3¼ per cent. to 5¼ per cent. effected in February, 1953, involves?  It means this, that if a young man contemplating matrimony in the City of Dublin or the City of Cork, the County Limerick, County Mayo, County Westmeath or any other county in Ireland, desires to build his own house and applies to the local authority for a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act wherewith to purchase or build a new house for himself, two consequences flow from his application.  One is that, when you had made due allowance for the fact that he got a housing grant under the housing legislation of this Oireachtas and got further assistance by way of grant from the local authority, full allowance for that having been made, the fact that he <Col N="730" /> built his own house and proceeded to pay for it through the machinery of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, resulted in a net saving to the Exchequer and the local authority of £500 in respect of that house as compared with the charge that would have come in course of payment if that man had sought to secure a municipal house for renting.</P>
    <P>It was cheaper to the local authority and to the Government by £500 to facilitate that man to build his own house than it was to get the local authority to build a house and set it to that man at the rents approved by the Department of Local Government. So that, quite apart from the desirable social end of seeing every man build and own his own house, on the purely fiduciary aspect of the question, there was a net saving to the Exchequer and to the local authority in facilitating the man in doing so.</P>
    <P>Prior to February, 1953, if such a young man applied to the local authority for a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act to finance the purchase or erection of a house the total cost of which was going to be in the order of £2,000, he redeemed the purchase price of his house over a period, I think, of 30 years by the payment of a weekly rent of 22/- a week.  Now, if that young man's brother in February, 1953, purchased an adjoining plot and commissioned a contractor to build him an identical house he would discover that, while his brother had paid out £2,000, owing to the reduced cost of building materials the identical house was only going to cost him about £1,900.  Can you conceive of that youth's astonishment when he learned that, as a result of the Government's increasing the interest rate payable on the loan by 2 per cent. he had to pay 34/- a week for 30 years to redeem the cost of his house, while his brother could redeem the cost of a dearer house for a weekly payment of 22/-?</P>
    <P>Now, outside of bedlam where is there someone to be found who will justify the proposition that we ought to raise the cost of money by 12/- a week for 30 years for one of our own people while we lend money to the <Col N="731" /> British Government at 2 per cent. to build houses for their people?</P>

      <P>I hope that pious resolution will long survive with the Deputy. Outside of bedlam can there be anyone found to defend the proposition that we should levy 12/- a week upon one of our own young people who is seeking to establish a home in his own country by reason of the cost, not of building materials, not of land and not of labour, but of money at a time when we are lending £62,000,000 sterling to the British Government at 2 per cent. and for what purpose?  To build houses for their people.  I ask Deputies, if they have familiarised themselves with the proceedings of the British House of Commons, to advert to the fact that the Tory Government in England in the course of the past six weeks had it to say that they were not satisfied that people seeking to borrow money from building societies under the local loans administration there were doing it in sufficient quantity and that they, therefore, proposed to introduce legislation to provide that, if a building society was prepared to advance 80 per cent. of the present valuation of a house, the Government would insure them for the remaining 20 per cent. so that they could advance 100 per cent. to a young person desiring to raise money to build a house in Great Britain.  It is our £62,000,000 that is going to be hypothecated by the British Government to insure the building society in Great Britain and to enable it to advance 100 per cent. of the valuation of a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> It is particularly interesting that it should be the acting-Minister for Finance we should have here to-day, because I pressed the acting-Minister for Finance on a previous occasion, as did certain Deputies on the Labour benches, and he professed to be under the impression that members of the Labour Party were persuading him that he had been directed by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer to raise the lending rate from 3½ per cent. which obtained while our Government was in office, to 5 per cent. which he offered for the National Loan of 1953. The acting-Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to make one thing perfectly clear.  Our Government raised the borrowing rate by 2 per cent. on our own initiative, because we thought the people who were going to lend us money ought to get a fair interest on the money they lent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As to £5,000,000 of that money, it was provided by the joint stock banks of this country and we have, apparently, accepted this astonishing proposition: that, in order to secure that the joint stock banks of this country will get a fair interest on the money they lend to the Government of this country, a man who wants to build a house in Ireland under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts must pay 12/- a week over and above what his brother had to pay two years ago.  I think that is daft.</P>
    <P>Is there any form of credit the redemption of which is more certain than the credit provided to a man to build a house?  Suppose the man himself fails to redeem the loan.  Is the house not still there?  A human being is not like a tortoise&mdash;he cannot walk away with his house on his back.  The loan is charged on the house, and if the present occupier does not meet the loan charges, his successor in title will.  Why should a man be fined 12/- a week for 30 years because he wants to build a house for his own family?  Is there anybody in the Dáil who does not want to help a young married man to build his own house?  If it is true, and I say it is true, that the British Government can borrow from us £62,000,000 of money at 2 per cent. is <Col N="734" /> there any reason why the credit authorities of this country should not make money available to our Government for the same purpose, particularly in so far as our Government wants that money to relend it to our people to build their own houses?</P>
    <P>Do Deputies realise that if we could get that principle accepted and made the consequential reduction in the interest rate levied on Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act loans, the rent of every house in Ireland which has been built under this legislation, and about to be built under this legislation, could be reduced by from 15/- to £1 per week?  I want to ask the acting-Minister to pause here and to tell the House does he think it right that money should be offered to a local authority at 5¼ per cent. and that they should relend it to people seeking loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act at 6½ per cent.  Does he think that equitable or fair?</P>
    <P>I am going to suggest that there is evidence in the record to prove the acting-Minister knows that that course of conduct is wrong and it is rather an interesting story.  In February, 1953, the lending rate to local authorities under the Local Loans Fund Act was raised to 5¼ per cent. and I ask Deputies to give special attention to that, because it is a most significant revelation.  The question was at once raised in this House: what was going to happen to applicants in the City of Dublin who were already committed to building houses and who were awaiting issue of their loans?  I remember certain T.D.s of the Fianna Fáil Party going with an all-Party deputation to the Minister for Finance and I remember the Minister for Finance, after some deliberation, saying: &ldquo;Where any person's application for a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act has been filed with Dublin Corporation prior to a certain date, that person will get the loan at the old rate and that makes provision for anybody who has his house half built.&rdquo;  Then the case was put forward: &ldquo;Is that concession not an admission that, if the new rate is charged, a great many people who <Col N="735" /> wanted to build houses will not be able to do so?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark this well, for here was the interesting revelation.  The Minister could not resist the logic of that argument and this device was employed. Deputies will have noticed that, under the Local Loans Fund Acts, a local authority can borrow money from the fund for a variety of purposes and not only the purposes of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  Dublin Corporation had borrowed from the Local Loans Fund prior to February, 1943, £1,000,000 for another purpose, and of that sum there remained unspent £365,000.  The Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for Local Government, told the Dublin Corporation to transfer that £365,000 which they had borrowed at the cheaper rate from the other purpose into the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act fund and to go on issuing loans to applicants at the old rate so long as that balance remained available.  That balance has now gone and those who borrow to-day must pay the new rate of 6½ per cent.</P>
    <P>I am asking Dáil Éireann now, on the occasion of giving the Government authority to issue a further £20,000,000, to instruct the Government, at least in so far as the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts are concerned, to issue the loan under the Local Loans Fund Acts to a local authority at a rate not exceeding 3¼ per cent. and to take under immediate review the question of whether it might not be made available for this purpose at a cheaper rate.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that, without involving any charge on the Exchequer whatever, we can make the money available forthwith at 3¼ per cent., and I am prepared to make this case, and I think it overdue: the acting-Minister for Finance has justified his Father Christmas Act, the National Development Fund, or whatever cod title he gave it, on the grounds that he was entitled to create a deficit in the Budget without Supplementary Estimates when the unemployment situation was bad.  I want to suggest to him that if it is that he has in mind, <Col N="736" /> the relief of unemployment, there is no more effective way to create permanent, remunerative and productive employment throughout the whole of Ireland than to restore vitality to the building industry.  If he would proclaim to-morrow that in respect of this £20,000,000, the whole of it, he would appropriate from the National Development Fund a sum sufficient to reduce the annual rate of interest charged to local authorities to 2 per cent., or 1 per cent., on the understanding that they would proceed to advance it to applicants under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act at 2¼ per cent. or 2 per cent., to allow for their administrative costs, I warrant he would put in employment more men in three months than will be put in employment by all the local authority schemes put forward by every county council in Ireland under the National Development Fund.  He is quite welcome to go full steam ahead with the other works he has envisaged.  Would the Minister be good enough to remind me how long he expects the £20,000,000 to last at the present rate of interest?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>£500,000 a year out of the National Development Fund to make available loans for the purposes of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act to the local authorities at 1 per cent. on condition that the local authority will lend it out under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act at an increase in rate not greater than will discharge their administrative expenses. That might be 2 or 2¼ per cent. or even less.  Does any Deputy in this House doubt that if that announcement were made to-morrow morning an immense stimulus would be given forthwith to housebuilding throughout the whole country that would absorb more unemployed men than any other device that can be envisaged or any other form of expenditure that a local authority could undertake?  There is no administrative expense, no supervisors required, no gangers, no engineers, no clerical work in the office, simply the machinery of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act and then leave it to the small contractor and the individual purchaser to <Col N="737" /> make their own arrangement for digging foundations and building the houses.</P>
      <P>Surely, if the present Government has created a situation in which it is addled by the problem of unemployment what we want to do to remedy that situation is not to create a multitude of slush funds to pour out money to such of the unemployed as are prepared to come out and pot-wallop for Fianna Fáil.  What we want is to create employment that will be available to everybody and will give those whom Fianna Fáil have thrown into unemployment not a temporary relief job but the prospect of permanent employment again at real trade union wages, a job that is going to last, that will entitle them to look forward to something that will not put them under the monthly obligation to come hawking their principles or their souls to the backdoor of a Fianna Fáil cumann for the right to live in their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let this be the test: do we want to provide permanent employment for our people at work that is dignified, productive and honest?  Do we want them to get trade union wages for a fair day's work building homes for themselves and their neighbours?  Or do we want to put them cleaning up the Dodder at so much a week or applying to Deputy Cowan's committee&mdash;or is it Deputy Briscoe's committee&mdash;of the Dublin Corporation for the right to live in their own city?  I want to give, and I believe most honest Deputies in this House want to give our people dignified honest employment doing productive work to the advantage of themselves and the nation as a whole.  What type of work more accurately corresponds to that criterion than individuals building their own homes and paying for them out of their own earnings? One million pounds out of the £20,000,000 that Fianna Fáil proposes to spend on relief works will put every building operative in Ireland to work within six months.  It will make available to every local authority in Ireland all the money they want at an interest rate identical with that at which we are lending money to the British Government&mdash;no more.  It is no extravagant proposal.  On one condition&mdash;<Col N="738" /> that they will relend it, adding nothing more to the cost than their cost of administration, to those who wish to borrow it under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  Come, now, are the Deputies of Fianna Fáil so downtrodden and afraid that they dare not get up to approve that proposal?  Is there one amongst them with the guts to say: &ldquo;We know that to enable every man in this country to build his house for a pound a week less than it is costing him now would give more employment than any other single proposal that could be brought before Dáil Éireann?&rdquo; There is your chance.</P>
    <P>One million out of £20,000,000 will put the humblest citizen of this State in a better position to own his own home than can be said of the citizen of any State in the world, and I do not exclude the United States of America or Great Britain.  You can build the Bray Road, you can find £9,000,000 to rebuild Dublin Castle, you can send out your message to every county engineer in Ireland to put every scheme that is submitted to him by county councillors into operation without reference to the Department of Local Government or the Department of Finance for prior sanction&mdash;you have money to do all that.  Why?  Because you are going to have a general election in June and you hope, if you do, to add Deputy McQuillan to your numbers between this and then.</P>

If that sounds too radical for the Fianna Fáil Party, let them make it available at the same rate as we are lending it to the British Government, for that will cost nothing at all and they can keep then the £1,000,000 for the slush fund they require.  Surely they will not say that in order that their slush fund may be kept intact, and in order that British securities may accumulate in sufficient quantity to maintain calm in Foster Place, our people must go on paying 6¼ per cent. and 6½ per cent. if they aspire to own their own homes, while the British may claim from us <i>ad infinitum</i> the proceeds of the currency reserve at less than 2 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has recently changed its policy, more because of political considerations than out of any particular solicitude for the effect that policy has had on a great number of workers here.  I want to direct the attention of the House to the very substantial decline that has occurred in the numbers employed in building houses.  Deputy Dillon has stated very fully the effect which the increase in the interest rate has had on persons building houses or persons availing of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act facilities to acquire houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June, 1951, when the inter-Party Government left office the number of persons employed on local authority housing throughout the country, according to the figures which I have been able to discover, was 11,400 persons employed on that work.  That included skilled and unskilled labour. Within two years of June, 1951, the number had dropped to something over 7,200 and at the same time there was a <Col N="740" /> substantial drop in the number of houses under construction by private builders.</P>
    <P>All Parties here have from time to time expressed the view that housing is not a political matter and there is general agreement that the housing problem has the support of all those interested in solving the legacy of bad housing, slums and so forth.  But that substantial decline is in itself a condemnation of the efforts made in the last two and a half years to deal with the problem.  I do not ask the House to accept my views in this matter, but just before Christmas the Fair Trade Commission conducted an investigation into the cost of building materials.  It had evidence from builders' providers and builders themselves.  Amongst others who gave evidence at that commission was Mr. Bailey, chairman of the Dublin and District Housebuilders' Association.</P>
    <P>He expressed the view that there was a slump in building such as had not been seen in the experience of many builders.  He was asked by the chairman when did that occur and he said in the last 18 months or two years. He went on to say that last week&mdash; he was speaking on 6th December&mdash; there were 400 carpenters idle in Dublin.  Allowing for the fact that it may have been the slack time from the point of view of the building trade, because of weather and so forth, that fact is indicative of the extraordinary slump that has taken place in building, a slump which has affected not only local authority building but all other building as well.  In the main, whatever activity is still being carried on is being carried on on local authority housing schemes.  The substantial drop in private building cannot be due to the fact that the demand has been met.  Deputies are familiar with the clamour for houses and the clamour for accommodation by every section of the community.</P>
    <P>If local authorities are being inundated with applications for houses under construction the same is true in relation to persons availing of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act loans.  I do not think there has ever been a spontaneous <Col N="741" /> expression comparable to that to which effect was given in October or November of 1952 when it was announced that it was proposed to raise the interest rate in respect of Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act loans.  Without any approach from political Parties, a large number of persons came together, representative of those building houses or acquiring them throughout the City and County of Dublin, and an overflow meeting was held in the Commercial Club in Upper O'Connell Street.  As a result of that meeting representations were made to the Minister for Finance and an alteration was effected in so far as persons who had undertaken or entered into commitments to buy or build houses were concerned.  That overflow meeting represented people who had saved or who had undertaken commitments on the basis of whatever income they had.</P>
    <P>Now, last year, the bank advances showed that in respect of money advanced to builders and persons undertaking that type of work there was a drop of nearly £750,000 as compared with 1952.  It is also significant that in the addresses by the various chairmen of the different banks the phrase was used: &ldquo;There has been no undue restriction of credit.&rdquo; That, of course, implies and admits that there has been a restriction of credit.  In fact, I think that is the most emphatic indication given by anybody speaking on this matter.  I invite anybody interested to read the addresses of the various chairmen. They all use more or less the same language and that includes the phrase: &ldquo;No undue restriction of credit.&rdquo; That in itself indicates that they recognise that there has been a restriction of credit and that that restriction of credit has operated in the manner shown by the figures and by the views expressed particularly before the inquiry conducted by the Fair Trade Commission.</P>

      <P>If you bear with me, Sir, you will realise that this matter all turns on the effect of the rise in the <Col N="742" /> interest rate and the serious deterioration that has occurred as a result of that alteration.  I believe that there is no scheme which could be embarked upon, either directly by the Government or indirectly by means of State aid to local authorities, which would give in the long run a greater return than the expenditure of money or the advancing of money for housing purposes. It is true that many people consider that in the strictly economic sense money spent on housing does not show an economic return in the same way as it would if advanced for an industrial project or for some other purpose of that nature or probably even for drainage et cetera.  But it is agreed national policy that, if it does not show an economic return in the ordinary accepted interpretation of that term, it does give substantial social benefits, benefits which are reflected in better social conditions and which must be reflected in improved health as well.</P>
      <P>I believe that there are few projects in which the State could invest money to a considerable extent that would show a return comparable to that given for money invested in housing.  For that reason I urge the Minister to alter the interest rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time after this Government was elected, they pretended that there was a crisis affecting them which prevented them from spending money. They have now thrown all that sham talk, all that preaching, overboard.  As far as the Government are concerned, they are prepared now to spend money freely and foolishly if it will show a political return.  I ask the Minister to give a small proportion of the £5,000,000 which it is proposed to provide for the National Development Fund for the purpose of providing our own people with adequate housing.  We have given substantial advances in money provided for local authorities for housing.  The money that is being provided under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act is, I believe, given to a section of the community who have been hit harder than any other section, the section commonly referred to as the white collar workers.  They have felt the impact of heavy taxation.  They have felt to a considerable degree the <Col N="743" /> heavy burdens placed upon them by the Budget of 1952 which were continued in the Budget of 1953.  They have been affected, in common with other sections, by the enormous rise in the cost of living in the last couple of years, a rise which the O.E.E.C. investigation showed was greater than in any other country in Europe.  All these things have affected that section of the community.  They are thrifty, hard-working and anxious to collaborate with the State in whatever facilities are afforded, and they are prepared to do their share to solve the housing problem.</P>
    <P>I believe that the machinery for that is available, that it only requires a Government decision.  There is no reason, financial or otherwise, which would prevent the rate of interest from being reduced.  There is no reason outside our own control which prevents that.  We have within the control of the Government, and within the control of the Oireachtas, the means whereby that decision can be made effective, and it only requires the will to do it.  I believe that the Minister would be acting in conformity with the desires of the vast majority of the Deputies, as well as the desires of the majority of the people, if he did that. If he wishes to give expression to it, it is easy to get a Government decision authorising it.  I suggest to the Minister that he would substantially alleviate the burdens which persons at present repaying such loans are obliged to bear, and it would act as an incentive to those who have not so far availed of these facilities and who are probably nervous about doing so on account of the heavy interest commitments that they would be obliged to undertake as long as the present interest rate operates.</P>

      <P>The more I hear Deputy Dillon the more I am amazed at his impudence.  How Deputy Dillon can have the cheek to stand up in this House and say that because the Central Bank holds certain funds in British securities it is lending money to the British Government at 2 per cent.  How he can demand that this Government <Col N="744" /> should instruct the Central Bank to withdraw those securities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He must know, as I pointed out in this House time and again, that from April, 1948, until April, 1951, during the term of office of the Coalition Government the sterling holdings of the Central Bank went up by £36,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>During the time he was in office the sterling assets of the Central Bank went up by £36,000,000, the sterling assets of Government funds went up by £6,200,000, and the rate of interest on the sterling securities which they bought for that extra £42,000,000 was ½ per cent.  Was it to enable John Bull, as Deputy Dillon is wont to call him, or the brutal and bloody Saxon, as he called him on other occasions, to build at a cheap rate that the Coalition Government allowed the Central Bank to increase its sterling holdings by £36,000,000 and the Minister for Finance to increase the holdings of Government funds by £6,000,000?  Deputy Dillon is very voluble.  On every occasion when I ask him that question, he looks coy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that now if you sit down.  What a preposterous fraud this is.  My plea to-day is that money should be made available to our people at a low rate of interest to build houses.  During the years of the inter-Party Government money was available to a person in this country to build his own house under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act at a rate which enabled him to pay it off at 22/- per week.  Is that not so?  It is now available to him at a rate which costs him 34/- a week.  The Minister is now going to borrow £20,000,000 for the National Development Fund.  I am asking him, first, to bring back the interest charged on Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act loans to the level obtaining during our administration and out of the National Development <Col N="745" /> Fund, which is designed for the promotion of employment, to contribute a further 1 per cent. reduction in the rates of interest to be charged on loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, thus reducing the rate to 2¼ per cent., and reducing the rent on these houses to £1 per week.  What is unreasonable in that?  Is there anything coy about that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot, by interruptions, when I am making my argument, avoid the issue or prevent me from making my point.  The Deputy accused us of deliberately giving £62,000,000 to the British Government to build houses at 2 per cent. because the Central Bank had certain funds which it holds partly in gold, partly in British Government securities and partly in dollar securities. During the Deputy's tenure of office as a member of the Coalition Government, the Central Bank did not get 2 per cent. on the money which is held in London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And they did not charge 6¼ per cent. on loans either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They got one-fourth of the rate which the Central Bank is getting now.  They got ½ per cent.  In spite of the fact that there was a report early in 1947 that we required 60,000 or 70,000 odd houses, the Coalition Government allowed the Central Bank to increase its sterling holdings by £36,000,000 during its term of office and allowed the holdings of <Col N="746" /> Government funds to be increased by £6.2 millions&mdash;£42,000,000 in all.  During the time that the rate paid on the sterling holdings of these institutions was ½ per cent., the local loans rate here was 3¾ per cent.  I want to put this question to anybody who listened to Deputy Dillon and who might be carried away by what he says: Why did the Government here at that time, the Coalition Government, charge 3¾ per cent. for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, the Central Bank held British securities yielding ½ per cent.  Why did the Coalition Government allow that to go on? Was it to enable the British Governmen to build cheap houses that they gave them this money at ½ per cent., as the Deputy put it, while the young man about whom he spoke, who wanted to marry, had to pay 3¾ per cent.?  I explained on the Appropriation Bill last November&mdash;I do not intend to go into the technicalities of this business again&mdash;the difference between the rate of interest on the external reserves held by the Central Bank and the rate of interest on internal credit.  I pointed out that, if we wanted to do it, the Government could have created credit and lent money at nil per cent., at no rate of interest.  To-day, if we wanted <Col N="747" /> to do it, we could have money created on behalf of the State and lend it out of the Local Loans Fund at ½ per cent. or less.  The reason we do not do it is that we want to secure that the economic development of our country will be steady and progressive.  Why should we run after every harebrained idea that Deputy Dillon propounds, when he is out of office?  In office, he is quite prepared to increase the holdings of British securities of the Central Bank and Government funds, even though these securities yield only ½ per cent.&mdash;to increase them by £42,000,000 in three years.  In almost the next breath, once he is out of office, he condemns us for allowing the Central Bank to hold securities in London at four times the rate of interest that the Government of which he was a member got on such securities during their term of office.  If any Deputy is interested in pursuing that matter further, and seeing the considerations involved, I would refer him to the speeches I made on the Appropriation Bill in the Dáil and in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>To come back to the question of housebuilding, the plea is that we should reduce the rate of interest and make money more freely available for the building of houses, particularly through the Local Loans Fund, for the purposes of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  Actually, during the past couple of years the amount of money going out for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act has been increasing.  In 1948-49, the first year of the Coalition, £217,000 went out for this purpose.</P>

      <P>I remember when the party with which Deputy Dillon became associated and for which he now speaks, was here as a Government in 1931.  The then Minister for Local Government was asked to embark on a housebuilding campaign and he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We cannot go on with any big campaign until the cost of materials falls, until the wage levels fall, to the point where we can build and let houses at an economic rent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we came along a year or so afterwards we started to show what was the right thing to do in regard to housebuilding and no Government in the northern hemisphere has given such help for the building of houses, <Col N="750" /> both public and private, as the Fianna Fáil Government.  The people were lucky that the Fianna Fáil Government came in in 1932 because otherwise in 1939, when the war broke out, they would be about 120,000 houses short. Between 1932 and 1948 we succeeded in getting something like 46,000 houses built and reconstructed.  Our Housing Act of 1947 prepared the way for the great post-war boom in housing.  It was only in 1948-49 that timber and other materials became reasonably freely available.  Those who remember the difficulty with which anyone who wanted to build a house was faced in 1946-47 will remember that it was impossible to get a piece of piping. You had to pay a black market price for a piece of lead to put in a valley, or if you could not get lead you had to use some poor substitute.  We have reached the point now in a large number of local authorities when the demand for houses is falling because those on the waiting list for houses have been given houses.  There are two big pockets of bad housing left: one is in Dublin and the other in Cork. The Deputies here from Dublin know that one of the reasons for the slowness in building houses in Dublin in the last year has not been the want of money or the rate of interest but the physical fact that the northern side of the city required a completely new sewerage system.  But housing by the public authorities in Dublin is picking up and in the last quarter of 1953 there were 3,006 persons employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The acting-Minister for Finance seems to be under some illusion.  What I am asking for on the purely fiduciary aspect of this legislation is that rates of interest shall be reduced to our own people.  I am calling into comparision the fact that while we are charging an individual in the City of Dublin 6¼ per cent.&mdash;or is it 6½ per cent.?&mdash;for small dwellings acquisition loans, we are lending £62,000,000 sterling at less than 2 per cent. to the British Government.  Here is my modest proposal.  It ought to be accepted as axiomatic by Oireachtas Eireann that if our people make accessible to the British Government £62,000,000 at less than 2 per cent., ways and means must be found to make money available to our own Government at 2 per cent.  Is that an extravagant proposition?  I then said that you have taken the decision to spend £20,000,000 over the next four years on what you are pleased to call national development and what I describe as putting whiskers and a red gown on de Valera to make him look like Father Christmas.  You defended him on the ground that you were troubled about the staggering increase in unemployment and that that was the reason why you ventured to approach the Oireachtas for authority to spend £5,000,000 of borrowed money without introducing a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister what method would produce remunerative employment of a permanent character for unemployed men better than to take £1,000,000 out of that £20,000,000 and use it to bring down the rate of interest on loans made to local authorities out of the Local Loans Fund for the purposes of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act at a rate of interest of 1 per cent. on condition that they would charge borrowers no more than the cost of the administration of the loan&mdash;¼ per cent. or ½ per cent.  If the Government would expend £1,000,000 out of this £20,000,000 that we have authorised over two or three years&mdash;<Col N="754" /> not £1,000,000 in one year but £1,000,000 spent over two or three years while the £20,000,000 we have authorised under this new Bill is going out&mdash;it would produce more remunerative, permanent and dignified employment for our people building houses for their own neighbours in six months than all the other schemes envisaged by the Government and local authorities.  Is that modest proposal one which should drive the acting-Minister for Finance to a frenzy of indignation with me?</P>
    <P>The acting-Minister for Finance speaks in derision of the fact that, while we were in Government, the external assets of the Central Bank increased by some £40,000,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate is also relevant. We were told at one time that we dissipated our assets; now we are being told we accumulated them too fast. Here is the record.  In September, 1948, we reduced the rate on local loans for the purposes of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts from 4¼ per cent. to 3¼ per cent.  I ask Deputies to note that.  The last year when the rate of <Col N="755" /> 4¼ per cent. operated, there was issued £217,000 over the whole country. We brought it down to 3¼ per cent. and the issue went up to £1,118,000.  We held it at 3¼ per cent. and the issue went up to £1,149,000 in 1950; it then went up to £2,791,000.  I do not think any issues were made before the end of the financial year 1953 after the rate was changed.  The rate was changed on October 10th but there was not a local authority in Ireland that had not a very large balance on hand.  I think it is true to say that up to 31st March, 1953 there was not a penny of the new dear money issued to borrowers under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  As a result of that the issue went up to £3,041,000.</P>
      <P>In regard to the issue up to March, 1954, the Minister naturally would not have the figure complete but he would have it up to 31st December.  However, he was determined not to give it but gave some footling figure about the total number of houses built which amply justified my case that we should provide cheap money.  There are plenty of hard-working people in this country who are anxious to build their own houses.  The Minister stopped giving me the figures after the financial year ended 31st March, 1953.  He started giving me numbers and mixing up municipal housing with Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts housing.  He then told me that if there had been a reduction in the rate of building it was because the demand for houses was dying down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that thought dwells in the acting-Minister for Finance's mind he is mad. I craved from the Dublin Corporation a municipal house for a man who was living with his wife and two children in one room in a tenement house and who was willing and anxious to pay rent for a municipal house.  I was told by the officials of the Dublin Corporation, who I am satisfied were doing their best, that they had not yet dealt with the families living six in a room and that they could not consider the case of people living four in a room for at least 18 months.  Are we all daft to believe the acting-Minister for Finance when he stands up here and says that <Col N="756" /> one of the reasons the housing industry is declining is that the demand for houses has been largely satisfied?  He then adds that there are two areas which may be affected, Dublin and Cork, and that as regards Dublin the reason is that a sewerage scheme is under construction in North Dublin. That is tripe.  Ask the builders of this city what is the position.  How many people who wanted to build houses of their own abandoned the hope of doing so when the cost of money went up to 6½ per cent. under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts?  Ask any practical builders around the City of Dublin what the demand for houses of the £2,000 class would be if money were readily available to borrowers at 2 per cent. or 2½ per cent.?</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that every man who sets about building a house and who is at present resident in Dublin is not living in a nest in a tree. When he builds his own house and moves into it, he vacates other apartments which become available to someone else who is, perhaps, living in one room.  A tenement dweller need not necessarily move straight away into a house.  It might be well to allow the thing to filter down, to let the tenement dweller move into a modest house which has been vacated by a man who has obtained a Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts house, the occupier of which has in turn built his own house.  Thus you have people moving up gradually until everyone is living in a modest but adequate house.</P>
    <P>I ask those Fianna Fáil Deputies who are listening to me&mdash;there are three there, one of whom is asleep&mdash;if there is one of them, if he but spoke his honest heart, who would not agree with me that what I said here to-day is relevant and true.  Would there be any hope of their taking the acting Minister for Finance aside and telling him that they insisted on his changing his mind, that there was no use trying to hold that line that it is a good thing to lend money to the British Government at 1? per cent. and charge our own people 6½ per cent.?</P>
    <P>I happen to know that a large number of the members of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="757" /> Party think this is wrong.  I happen to know that a number of them, if they had the courage, would force the Minister for Finance to do something about it.  I have put forward a new proposal not only for the adjustment of interest rates but for the allotment of £1,000,000 out of £20,000,000 to house our people and to give employment.  Is there a member of Fianna Fáil now who has the spunk to stand up and support me?  If so, I will give him an undertaking in advance that I will not call for a division or force him into the wrong Lobby.  Is there a man amongst you who has the spunk to say what he believes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply rose to clear the point that Deputy Dillon made&mdash; that Dublin Corporation were charging 6½ per cent. in respect of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  I think he made a mistake <Col N="759" /> there.  I do not want to attack anybody but I feel it is important that the actual facts of the case should be stated clearly&mdash;especially by a Deputy like Deputy Dillon who is a former Minister.  If an insignificant Deputy such as myself made wild statements, people would not pay a great deal of attention to them: I do not know whether or not people pay a great deal of attention to Deputy Dillon.  However, the rate of interest for Dublin Corporation loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts is 5½ per cent.&mdash;a ½ per cent. more than it costs Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>I feel I would not be in order now in going into questions on municipal housing.  The Dublin Corporation are more than satisfied with the generous grants we get from the Government. Some of this money will go to Dublin Corporation for housing purposes in the way of grants.  If we house a person who is ordinarily due for housing we get one-third of the interest charges.  If we clear a slum district we get two-thirds of the interest charges and, in addition, substantial grants. We would get as much as £1,000 for an ordinary weekly rented house: I am subject to correction there but I think the figure is close on £1,000, if not more.  If we house a person under the tenant purchase scheme, we get £275.  All this money which comes our way for housing is doing a good job of work.  We are more than satisfied with the generous grants which we have been getting to meet the interest charges and for slum clearance.  I rose mainly for the purpose of clearing up that point.  I do not think it is right for anybody to say that it is a question of 6½ per cent. when the correct figure is 5½ per cent.  I should like to meet Deputy Dillon anywhere on a good housing debate.  I am sure I could satisfy him that we are doing a good job of work in Dublin and that he should not be criticising the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1947, the housing needs of the local authorities outside Dublin and Cork were found to be, on survey, about 40,000 houses.  By the 31st March of this year, 24,000 of those 40,000 houses will have been completed. <Col N="760" /> Already, ten county councils have either finished or almost finished their programme and then there are a large number of other local authorities that are in course of meeting the demand for houses and, within a year or two, they will have built all the houses for which there is a demand. That is not to say, as Deputy Dillon tried to make the House believe, that I regard the housing condition of the country as a whole as satisfactory. There are still a large number of houses to be built in Dublin.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Gallagher said, the provision which the Government is making for public authority housing is very generous indeed.  The provision that we are making for people who can build houses for themselves&mdash;people who have some money and who get the balance out of the Local Loans Fund&mdash; is very generous.  The amount of money they can get has been increased very considerably.  It used to be a few hundred pounds.  Now it is up almost to £2,000.  I think that that is what they can now get out of the Local Loans Fund.  Further, it is at a reasonable rate of interest, having regard to what the Government pay for money and, indeed, having regard to what is paid for money in other countries in Europe.</P>
      <P>I do not want to follow Deputy Dillon into technical points.  If we wanted to have a system here whereby the Government would lend money free of interest, we could have that system. However, we have a system whereby we induce our people to save and we give them a rate of interest to induce them to do so.  We have to get back from the people who borrow from the Government a rate of interest something like that which we give to the people from whom we borrow.  The rates of interest at which people are getting money for building houses here are very reasonable indeed.  I do not know of any other country in which a person can get 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. of the total money that he requires to build a house.  In many countries they have to have at least 50 per cent. of the money themselves before they can get a loan even at a much higher rate of interest than people have to pay here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> Last October, we heard the rates for advances in various countries.  It is interesting to hear what the position is in a few European countries.  The rate here was about 5¾ per cent.  In Holland it was 4 to 4½ per cent.  In England it was 4½ to 6½ per cent.  In Belgium it was 5 to 6½ per cent.  In France it was 6 to 8 per cent.  In Italy in was 7 to 9 per cent., and in Western Germany it was from 6 to 10 per cent. As I have said, the rate here was about 5¾ per cent.  In lots of those countries a person who wanted to build a house for himself and who had very little money could not get anything like 50 per cent. of the money he required: he could not get 25 per cent. of it.  In many of those countries the people could not get 5 per cent. of the money they required.  If they had not the complete amount of money, no one would advance them money to build their own houses.</P>

      <P>So what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We have here a system whereby people who have a couple of hundred pounds can get the balance on loan from us to build a house&mdash;and, by and large, we give it to them at a reasonable rate of interest and under conditions of repayment that they are very glad to avail of.  The Government borrow money from people at a certain rate of interest and administer loans at some expense.  Are the Government to subsidise that rate of interest by lending it at less than it costs the Government? If the local authority borrows money from the Government at 4¾ per cent. will the local authority lend the money to the private individual at less than 4¾ per cent.?  The usual thing is for the local authorities to put on about ½ or ¾ per cent. to the charges for this house purchase scheme over and above the rate at which it gets the money or, as Deputy Gallagher pointed out, in the case of the Dublin Corporation, over the rate at which the corporation borrows from the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who have built houses for themselves out of their earnings or savings are all contributing to the pool out of which these funds are granted and large subsidies paid.  Is it right <Col N="762" /> that we should give a higher subsidy than we are giving at the present time? The subsidies here are very high indeed and the terms and conditions of these Small Dwellings Act loans are very good, having regard to our circumstances.</P>
    <P>I, for one, do not trust Deputy Dillon's wild promises of what he would do if he got into government again.  The experience of our community, the last time the Coalition group got into power, was that when they became the Government they did exactly what they promised the people not to do and failed to do the things they promised.  One matter in which they did exactly the opposite to what they had promised was in relation to the cost of money for local loans.</P>
    <P>On 13th June, 1946, I was Minister for Finance and I reduced the rate which local authorities had to pay for local loans from 4¼ to 2½ per cent. and from 16th June, 1946, until the next Government came in&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Until when?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait now for a second. I am coming to the &ldquo;when&rdquo;.  From 13th June, 1946, when the rate for local loans was reduced to 2½ per cent. until the Coalition Government came in, night, noon and morning, Deputy Dillon, Deputy McGilligan and all the rest of them were prating about the waste paper in which we had our money invested in England and why were we charging 2½ per cent. to the unfortunate people of this country, why would not we realise some of this waste paper and give it to them to build houses at less than 2½ per cent. What do you think happened when they came in?  They were not in a week&mdash;that is a slight exaggeration&mdash; they came in on the 18th February and on 5th May they changed the rate for the Local Loans Fund from 2½ per cent., at which it had stood for a couple of years. Did they change it to this 1 per cent. that Deputy Dillon is talking about? No.  They changed it from 2½ per cent. up to 3¼ per cent.  If this country had the misfortune to have Deputy Dillon and the Government that he would collect in power in the morning, instead of having a decrease in the rate of <Col N="763" /> interest on local loans, we might have an increase and it might come up to what people in other parts of the world have to pay for money for this purpose.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Simply because the rate of interest on money is a matter of policy rather than necessity.  If any Government decided it was the right policy that money should be made available at ½ per cent., it could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, in the Schedule, to delete the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>3. Tea Importers, Limited. £6,000,000.</P>
      <P>I put this amendment down to draw attention to what I consider to be a matter of very vital importance.  The purpose of the amendment is to delete from the Schedule Tea Importers, Limited.  The consequence of the amendment would be that the current authorised overdraft of Tea Importers could no longer be guaranteed by the Government.  What I envisaged was that Tea Importers should cease to function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If my advice in that matter had been adopted 18 months ago, when this question arose in the House, we could have bought all the tea we wanted at about 1/8½ per lb. for the lowest grade and from that upwards according to quality.  As a result of the retention of the system of buying all our tea centrally through Calcutta, the lowest grades are costing 3/2 to 3/4 per lb. Albeit the Minister committed himself to the proposition when he was so exasperated by the failure of the London wholesale tea trade to deliver stocks to this country at the beginning of the 1939 war, and then <Col N="767" /> resolved that he would never deal with them again, I want to urge on the Minister that in matters of this kind understandable reactions of pique should not become the signpost of policy.  Surely the interest of our community is to buy tea where they can get it best and cheapest.</P>
    <P>The most strait-laced protectionist will not, I suppose, advocate the growing of tea in this country.  It is true that at one time the Taoiseach was prepared to suggest we could cut out tea and live on light beer.  So far as I know he has abandoned that policy, together with the recommendation of the Egyptian bee and the growing of Irish tobacco.  I could understand the Minister restricting imports of tea if he had in mind the prosecution of the Taoiseach's policy of living on light beer but I understand that has now been dropped from Fianna Fáil policy and it is not intended to grow a tea substitute.  Surely then the prime object of our Government should be to enable our people to buy the best tea for the lowest price wherever they can get it.</P>
    <P>Now, I happen to have some knowledge of the tea trade and I happen to know that there are thousands of experienced grocers in Ireland who bought their own tea for generations and who always had access to the wholesale distributors in Dublin, London, Liverpool and elsewhere.  Some of the grocers bought their tea through wholesalers in Dublin and London; some of them bought through agents bidding on their behalf at the Mincing Lane auctions.  Let us remember that when our merchants went, by their agents, into the tea auctions of Mincing Lane, they were bidding against buyers from America, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, Denmark and all over the world. We must be now one of the only countries who put upon ourselves the obligation of purchasing tea in Calcutta. I do not want to restrict anybody from buying tea in Calcutta if that is the way he wants to buy it. All I am asking is that the ordinary grocers should have restored to them the right to buy for their customers <Col N="768" /> the best tea they can get at the lowest possible penny and to compete then with their neighbours for trade by offering better tea for less money than the shop down the street.</P>
    <P>The present position is that every grocer in Ireland is obliged to buy his tea from a certain number of wholesalers who draw their supplies from Tea Importers, Limited.  We are now told that these wholesalers are to be allowed to form a monopoly, a teabuying monopoly, that thereafter the grocers will be obliged to buy their tea from the members of this monopoly, who can only function for the purpose of purchasing as a monopoly.  You may go through all the movements of giving them the right to deal on the Calcutta market and consign the tea to Tea Importers only in name, but if you bring 15 wholesalers together and tell them they are the only people who in practice are going to be able to import tea and that everybody thereafter will have to buy tea from one of the 15, how long do you think that competition will survive amongst them?  I warn the House that the net result of such an arrangement is that, taking quality and price into consideration, our people will be paying 6d. a lb. more for their tea than they otherwise would.</P>
    <P>The price of the lowest grade tea has gone up 4d. per lb. in the last three months as a result of the increase in the world price.  Bear in mind that had we been free to buy tea wherever we could get it in the last two years the stores of the tea merchants in this country could have been full of tea at a cost of about 1/10 per lb. delivered in this country.  It has gone up because we were operating on the Calcutta market.  I do not know how Tea Importers manage their affairs, but the fact is that they have advanced the price of the lower grade tea by 4d per lb., and that increase has had to be passed on <i>in toto</i> to the customer.  In respect of tea, retailed at 5/- and 6/-per lb., the quality has been brought down while the price at 5/- and 6/- has been maintained; but in respect of tea retailing at 4/- per lb. the price has gone up to 4/4.</P>
    <P>I do not know what induced the <Col N="769" /> Minister to get this bee into his bonnet.  It is ludicrous for us to be confined to a few London wholesalers. They will sell off all they can and the only effect of the present arrangement is to leave us stripped and naked and exposed to the Calcutta tea merchants. They are no soft bunch.  So long as the Indian Government can levy an export tax on tea they will levy it to the last farthing.  Immediately there is a surplus they will set about reducing the output of the tea gardens. The same is true of Ceylon.  As long as there is an export tax on tea they will levy it to the last halfpenny.  I strongly urge on the Minister to wind up Tea Importers and get out of this business and allow the merchants of this country to buy their tea wherever they like, so that through the operation of competition we can secure for our people the best teas at the lowest price.  Any other course is going to cost our people money.  You have in this a form of exploitation that it is extremely difficult to expose because excessive prices can be more effectively concealed in tea by wangling quality than in almost any other commodity that our people habitually buy and use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the present prices of teas sold by Tea Importers to Irish wholesalers are from 4d. to 1/- per lb. below Mincing Lane prices.  Tea Importers informed me that the situation was such that inevitably there would be a tendency amongst wholesalers to buy in tea in excessive quantities as a speculation, and that the only alternative course was either to increase the prices of teas on their list to the world prices or to restrict the deliveries of tea to the <Col N="770" /> wholesalers.  I decided in favour of restricting the deliveries to wholesalers. Deliveries are now restricted to 105 per cent. of their normal purchases. That situation is not something that we planned.  That is a situation which is due entirely to the fact that very substantial stocks of tea had been imported by Tea Importers before the world price went up.  If the world price had gone down, then the situation would be the reverse, but it has worked out that way, that the stock position here was very good when world prices went up.  Our stock position is very much better than the British stock position according to the published reports.  British tea supplies are sufficient to meet from two to three months' requirements, while we have enough in total quantity to last until about the end of October.  I do not say that we have similar quantities of every grade of tea, but the total stock position here is satisfactory.  I cannot say what the future trend in tea prices may be.  I do not think that this amendment which Deputy Dillon has proposed would have the effect that he says.  It would not put Tea Importers out of business.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose of this Bill is to raise the limits of the Grant-in-Aid to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards from the present level of £15,000 per year to a maximum of £35,000 per year.  It is necessary to make provision for a large annual <Col N="772" /> grant because the institute cannot effectively discharge its functions within the limits of the present grant.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Research and Standards Act of 1946 established the institute with the primary functions of undertaking and carrying out scientific research, and of formulating specifications for commodities, processes and practices.  As the House is probably aware, the institute consists of a council, the Industrial Research Committee, the Standards Committee and the director.  The functions of the council are mainly advisory.  The Industrial Research Committee are responsible for deciding what research work will be undertaken and responsible also for the general administration of the whole institute.  The Standards Committee formulates standard specifications and, as the law stands at present, these are ultimately brought into operation by ministerial Order.  The primary duties of the director are to direct and supervise the conduct of both the research and standards work of the institute.  The institute, at present, is financed by this fixed statutory grant of £15,000.  It may, under the legislation, and has, in fact, received grants towards defraying the capital cost of land, buildings and equipment.  The Act provides also for grants for special investigations at the request of the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, but, in fact, no such grants have been made.  The Act also contemplates the institute charging fees for researches, tests and analyses carried out for private firms, but the revenue accruing to it under that head has not, as yet, proved very substantial.  In practice, the institute is dependent almost entirely on the annual State grant of £15,000 to cover working costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institute developed rather gradually.  At first, it had to acquire suitable office accommodation and laboratory premises and build up a skilled staff, purchase a large amount of technical equipment and  a satisfactory reference library.  The premises were secured in Glasnevin House and the laboratories were erected there.  The cost of Glasnevin <Col N="773" /> House was approximately £9,000; the laboratories cost £27,000 to erect; and the equipment and reference library cost about £15,000, making a total of about £51,000 which was given by way of special grants under the appropriate section of the 1946 Act for these capital purposes.  While these facilities were being provided, the institute was not spending the whole of the fixed annual grant of £15,000 per year.  In the earlier years of its operations, that grant was more than enough to meet its outgoings and the result was that, over a period of time, the institute accumulated a reserve of about £29,000, representing the unspent balances of annual grants.  In the past few years, however, the expenditure of the institute has been running above the level of the annual grant and that excess spending has been met out of the accumulated reserve which had been reduced to about £27,000 on 31st March last.</P>
    <P>Since it was set up in 1946, the institute has had to some extent to avoid attracting work with which it was not equipped to cope.  The institute, however, has carried out some very useful research projects and Deputies will have seen in this evening's newspapers a report of the operation of a machine developed in the institute for the cleaning and grading of carrageen moss.  They have carried out a number of important investigations mainly on their own initiative in matters which were of particular concern and some at the specific request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>A good deal of progress has been made in the field of standards.  At present, standard specifications for commodities are formulated by the committee of the institute and are declared by the Minister to be standard specifications under the Act.  I should like to say that, in formulating the standard specifications, the committee have always had the full co-operation of Irish manufacturers and are greatly indebted to the technical men in industry for their assistance in drafting specifications.  There has been a very useful combination of effort in that field.  The advisory committees which were set up to help in the <Col N="774" /> formulation of specifications almost invariably invite technologists from the industries interested in the investigations, either as manufacturers or users.</P>
    <P>Up to date, standard specification Orders have been made in respect of 54 commodities.  There are six more standard specification Orders about to be made and work is proceeding on specifications for about 20 further commodities.  The Standards Committee has before it requests from me for the formulation of specifications for a further 60 commodities upon which work has not yet started.</P>
    <P>Reference to the standard specification Orders brings in the question of the standard mark.  Up to date, standard marks have been prescribed for 46 of the commodities for which standard specification Orders have been made.  For some time past, I have been endeavouring to encourage manufacturers of goods for which there are standard specifications to produce their goods in conformity with the specifications and to use the standard mark. I must say, however, that the results have been rather disappointing.  So far, only 68 applications for licences to use the standard mark have been received and granted.</P>
    <P>I have had under consideration the further steps that might be taken to popularise the use of the standard mark.  I have stated publicly on more than one occasion that decisions upon applications for the amendment of tariffs or for other concessions by firms or associations of firms interested in goods for which there is a standard specification will be influenced by the extent to which the applicants are making the goods to the specification and using the standard mark as proof of the fact that they are so doing.  I have also arranged that, for an experimental period of one year, Government Departments will in appropriate cases ask firms tendering for the supply of goods whether the goods they propose to supply would bear the standard mark and a similar arrangement is under consideration in relation to purchases made by State-sponsored bodies. That arrangement will be reviewed at the end of the year in the light of its effectiveness when decisions may be <Col N="775" /> made as to what further measures may be required.</P>
    <P>For some time past, the institute has had under consideration an extension of its activities in the field of research, as well as in the field of standards, and has been planning an extension of its organisation which would involve it in annual expenditure considerably in excess of the present statutory provision of £15,000.  The institute is anxious to adopt a more aggressive policy in relation to industrial research and plans to have some of the scientists and engineers in its service go out and canvass manufacturers in their factories, to act as field men who will report back to the institute on the problems they may uncover and help the institute to set about seeking solutions of these problems.</P>
    <P>The institute is the official technical information centre for this country under O.E.E.C. and it obtains a great deal of useful information from that body and also from the Office of Technical Services of the United States Department of Commerce.  That information, however, has not been disseminated amongst manufacturers who should be interested in it as adequately as would have been desirable, and a further part of the institute's plans involves the distribution of that information, both information already accumulated and information which may come to hand in future, to industrialists and other interested persons and organisations on a much wider and more intensive scale.</P>
    <P>The application of scientific methods to the problems of industry is dependent to a great extent on the co-operation which the industrialist is prepared to give in bringing specific problems to the institute and adopting the suggestions which the institute may make for their solution.  Industrial firms which employ trained scientists and engineers are in a much stronger position to apply the results of scientific discoveries made elsewhere.</P>
    <P>On the standards side, I have said that the institute has at present a list of 60 commodities in respect of which specifications are desired but on which <Col N="776" /> work has not yet started.  That list will, no doubt, be added to and, furthermore, it is desirable that the institute should keep under constant review developments in manufacturing processes and improvements in the methods of testing the quality of goods or the performance of apparatus with a view to making such revisions of the specifications already published as may be found to be desirable.  During the past few years the rate of production of specifications has been six to eight per year.  That output is too low.  The output of Irish standards is very small by comparison with the work of the standards organisations of other small European countries.  The institute, therefore, proposes to provide more staff for standards work with a view to keeping up to date the work of revising the specifications which have already been published and to increasing the rate of output of new specifications to something approaching twice the present rate.</P>
    <P>Industrial research and the formulation of standard specifications are essential to the development of a sound industrial organisation within the protection afforded by tariffs and import quotas.  The extension of the activities of the institute is an integral part of the whole campaign to raise the all-round efficiency of Irish industry.  I have on many occasions recently spoken on the importance of that campaign to raise the level of efficiency in Irish industry and the reduction of its production costs.  I hold strongly to the view that getting industrial costs down is now a matter of vital importance if industrial employment is to be maintained and if further industrial development is to be achieved.  In any case where costs are too high at present or where costs are tending to rise unduly, action will have to be taken to rectify that position, and I should, I think, make it clear that action will not stop short of reducing or withdrawing protection where no other measure seems likely to be effective. Most of us, however, will agree that it is far preferable to endeavour to deal with the situation in industry by getting increased efficiency and higher output, and the Institute of Industrial Research can make a useful contribution <Col N="777" /> to that end with the co-operation of Irish industrialists.  The institute can play a much more effective part than it has been able to play up to the present in solving the many problems relating to production and manufacturing techniques.  With regard to standard specifications it will be, I think, generally desired that those specifications should be prepared for as many commodities as possible, and particularly for commodities which are manufactured here under protection.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see the institute in a position to undertake work on the testing of commodities on a larger scale than has been possible up to the present.  The testing of commodities is of dual importance.  It is useful in the preparation of standard specifications and in the solution of the technical problems of industry.  It is also of importance in protecting the purchasing public against the sale of inferior goods.  At the last annual meeting of the council of the institute which I was invited to address I expressed the desire that the institute should undertake more testing work on goods for which there are standard specifications with a view to seeing whether these goods are manufactured in conformity with the specifications; and I urged that the institute should consider publishing the results of those tests so that the consumer may be in a position to judge for himself whether he is getting value for his money.</P>
    <P>Coming on to the specific matter of finance, I have explained that the institute has accumulated a reserve fund of £27,000.  Notwithstanding the fact that the enactment of this Bill will not involve any contribution from the Exchequer in the immediate future in excess of the £15,000 a year which has been allocated to the institute previously, notwithstanding that with this reserve fund the institute could have of its own initiative enlarged its expenditure, I felt myself precluded from sanctioning proposals which involved continuing commitments which would bring the expenditure of the institute permanently above the £15,000 a year level without first obtaining the approval of the Oireachtas by the introduction of a Bill <Col N="778" /> of this kind.  The situation in future will be somewhat different from what it has been in the past.  In the past the institute got £15,000 a year automatically under the provisions of the legislation. In future moneys will be paid out to the institute as they are voted by the Dáil to a maximum of £35,000 in any one year.  In other words, there now will be, instead of a fixed annual contribution, a grant of an amount determined on the basis of an estimate of expenditure to be incurred in the financial year, an estimate which will be prepared and submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce by the Industrial Research Committee of the institute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean by that that if the £35,000 is not used up it will come back as an Appropriation-in-Aid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Up to the present the institute got £15,000 a year without any investigation as to whether it needed it.  In some years it got it even though its expenditure was considerably less.  In future there will be an estimate of its expenditure during the year and that will represent the amount that will be paid to the institute, up to a maximum of £35,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The position in the immediate future will be this.  In agreement with the committee of the institute expenditure will be met out of the reserve fund they have accumulated until that reserve fund has been reduced to £10,000; in other words, the committee will continue to receive next year just the £15,000 which it has been getting up to the present, but the difference will be that it can now plan a programme of work which will involve a continuing annual expenditure on a higher level.  Whatever level of expenditure may be reached, it will <Col N="779" /> have to be met by annual Votes from the Dáil up to the limit of £35,000 per year.  That is the only change which is being made in the Bill.</P>
      <P>So far as the financing of the institute is concerned, the provisions in the existing Act relative to the making of capital grants for land, building and equipment will remain unchanged, as will also the provision for the making of grants for special investigations.  I think the House is aware that the Government has sought the approval of the United States authorities for the allocation of £130,000 from the Grant Counterpart Fund for the provision of additional laboratories for the institute. It is hoped that that matter will be finalised in the early future.</P>
      <P>The Bill, however, contemplates certain other changes based upon our experience of the 1946 Act and the provisions of that Act.  The original Act contemplated a procedure for the declaration of standard specifications and the prescribing of standard marks on the basis of Orders made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. These specifications are technical documents and I have come to the conclusion, as has the committee of the institute, that it would be more appropriate that they should be declared to be standard specifications by the institute rather than by the Minister.  It is therefore proposed to repeal Section 20 of the 1946 Act and to replace it by Section 2 of this Bill which provides that the institute may, with the consent of the Minister, declare specifications to be standard specifications; and in future standard specifications will be published and placed on sale by the institute instead of by the Stationery Office.  Notice of the declaration of standard specifications will be published by the institute in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in such other manner as the Minister may direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a change contemplated in relation to the standard mark.  The 1946 Act provided that the Minister may prescribe a standard mark for a specified commodity, process or practice, to indicate that it conforms to the standard specification.  Under the section as it was framed a separate <Col N="780" /> standard mark Order had to be made for each commodity for which there was a standard specification.  It is proposed under Section 5 of this Bill to take power to prescribe a standard mark for use in connection with all commodities to indicate that they conform to standard specifications.  When the Bill is passed one standard mark Order, therefore, will be made which will prescribe the mark to be used in connection with all commodities which conform to the specifications.  It is provided that that general standard mark may not be used in connection with a commodity except in conjunction with a serial number assigned by the institute to the standard specification for that commodity.  Standard marks may not, of course, be used except under licence from the Minister and the relevant licensing provisions of the 1946 Act are not being changed.</P>
    <P>The institute has for some time past not been very happy about the position in relation to its staff and I have had under consideration representations made by it particularly in regard to the difficulty it experiences in recruiting temporary staff and also certain difficulties in the matter of the recruitment of permanent staff.  The original Act provided that the numbers, grades, remuneration, tenure of office and conditions of service of members of the staff should be determined by the director with the approval of the Minister, given after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  It also provided that consultation would not be required in respect of persons proposed to be employed for less than a period of 12 months.  Under this Bill that period of 12 months is being extended to three years.  The institute argue, and I think with force, that investigations undertaken by it for which temporary staff are recruited usually last longer than 12 months and difficulty was likely to be experienced in recruiting suitable temporary staff for yearly periods.  The existing limit of 12 months proved to be an inconvenience to the institute.  The committee is satisfied that a limit of three years would be more reasonable and provision to that effect is accordingly being made in this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> That will solve the institute's difficulties so far as the temporary staff is concerned.  So far as they have had problems relating to permanent staff, discussions are taking place at present with the institute with a view to giving it as much freedom as possible in the recruitment of its staff.  When final agreement has been reached in that matter, and I anticipate that will not be long delayed, the institute will be in a position to recruit quickly the permanent staff it requires.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other minor changes which this Bill proposes. Under the Act of 1946 the Industrial Research Committee was empowered to fix the remuneration of the members of that committee as well as of the Standards Committee.  Under this Bill it is proposed that in future the remuneration of members of these committees will be fixed by the Minister. The Industrial Research Committee have always felt that it was invidious that they should be asked to determine the value of their own services as well as the value of the services of the Standards Committee, and I think we made a mistake in framing the original Act in that form. In any event, this is a change which would follow logically from the change in the method of financing the institute that is now proposed.</P>
    <P>The idea in 1946 was that the committee got £15,000 per year, and that was all it would get, the committee being entrusted to use that sum in the best way, paying themselves such fees as they thought proper to their work and devoting the rest to the service of the institute.  In the new circumstances, where an estimate of expenditure will be required and where the amount to be voted may vary from time to time according to the work to be done, then the normal practice of having the fees of the committee fixed by ministerial Order seems more proper and appropriate.</P>
    <P>One other change of minor importance relates to the filling of casual vacancies on the council.  The council is, as I mentioned, an advisory body. It consists of some 50, or so, people prominent in scientific, academic, or <Col N="782" /> industrial fields and the position at present is that casual vacancies are filled by the Minister on the recommendation of the Industrial Research Committee with the prior approval of the council.  There is, however, only one meeting of the council every year and consequently if the Industrial Research Committee felt that casual vacancies should be filled, there is a delay of at least a year in the making of appointments by the Minister on the recommendation of the committee.  Section 9 of this Bill proposes to amend that clause so as to permit the filling of casual vacancies without the prior approval of the council.</P>
    <P>These are all the changes contemplated in this legislation in relation to this Institute of Industrial Research and Standards and I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be general approval for the proposals in the Bill.  I am somewhat surprised that the increase from £15,000 per annum to £35,000 per annum is sufficient. From my contact with the institute, I know that they were always afraid of being short of money, if they did not actually expend the amount allocated in certain years, and I think the institute, in fact, felt that the ceiling imposed by the 1946 Act was too low.  If the Minister says that the sum proposed in this amending Bill is sufficient, then I assume that this body is satisfied with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we are all prepared to recognise the extent to which scientific and industrial research has advanced.  In fact, the very remarkable developments which have occurred down through the years, but more particularly in recent years, and the advances in science have brought home to people the extent to which in many cases communities are indebted to scientists, engineers and other persons skilled in dealing with what are generally regarded as scientific matters.  We are also aware of the very costly plant and equipment required for a laboratory when research has to be carried on. For that reason, it is, I think, in general appreciated that the financial assistance which is provided under the <Col N="783" /> facilities afforded by the 1946 Act, which it is proposed to extend now, are not nearly adequate for the general requirements of the community.  I believe that we should have some system under which grants would be made available directly to firms or undertakings that are prepared to carry out industrial or scientific research.</P>
    <P>It is commonly known that the larger firms in this country have laboratories and employ either engineers, scientists or chemists who are engaged on particular matters pertaining to the particular firm's requirements.  The same is true of the larger firms, and indeed some smaller firms, in other countries. But in this country most of the research is either carried on through whatever facilities are provided in the universities or by the direct work done in individual cases where the firms are in a position to finance the undertaking themselves.  I do not think it advisable to mention individual firms by name, but it is generally known that a great number of the larger firms have laboratories and engage scientists and engineers.  Because of the fact, however, that this is confined almost exclusively to these firms, the prospects for skilled personnel in this country to secure employment are almost entirely dependent either on local authorities in the case of engineers or some of the bigger undertakings like the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna and, with a few exceptions, skilled personnel are obliged when they are trained or receive their degree to seek employment abroad.  For that reason alone, I think any steps which it is possible to take to provide facilities under which research, either of a scientific or industrial engineering character, can be undertaken should receive the maximum possible assistance.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody has ever been particularly happy about the success that has attended the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. It is not that the personnel in charge or the work carried out is not up to the highest level, but that it has failed to attract the requisite public notice which it should receive.  I notice from the figures given by the Minister in <Col N="784" /> connection with the standard specifications and marks the extraordinarily low number of applications, amounting only to 68 altogether, for permission to use the standard mark.  I believe that the standard mark is not sufficiently recognised as entitling those who use it to have their products or commodities regarded as up to a specified standard.</P>
    <P>I must say that in my experience, when matters came up for approval of standard specifications or approval for the issue of a standard mark, it always seemed to me that the matter was formal rather than a reality.  The standard mark is issued and if anybody inquires about it they will probably be able to get the information.  But, generally, standard specifications and marks do not get sufficient public notice.  That may not be the fault of the institute; it may lie with manufacturers or persons entitled to use the standard mark.  But I feel that the extent to which the quality of the commodity produced is known to be due to the standard mark is not getting anything like the recognition which it should.  I believe that the time has come when certainly, in so far as certain commodities are concerned, the Minister's Department and other Departments dealing with certain particular commodities will require to be rather vigilant.  I do not wish to have my remarks misinterpreted, but where foodstuffs are concerned or, in particular where exports from this country are concerned, only goods of the highest quality should be marketed.</P>
    <P>Many years ago when the creameries were first organised there was difficulty about getting butter of the highest quality, and I think about the same time there was difficulty about getting eggs of the highest quality.  Since then standards have improved to the highest level and the butter and eggs now exported from this country measure up to the best standards available anywhere. But, if any commodities exported from this country have attached to them a suspicion that they are not measuring up to the highest standard of quality, that will inevitably react, not merely on the firms concerned, but on the general good name of the goods exported from this <Col N="785" /> country.  So far as that is concerned, I believe that the Minister should consider, in consultation with the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, what steps are available to him, in collaboration with any other Department affected, to see that all commodities exported measure up to the highest standards, certainly in any case where facilities are afforded either directly or indirectly by the State through protection or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently referred on a number of occasions to the need for efficiency in industrial production with particular attention to costs.  He stated that every effort must be made to get costs down and that the continuance of protection or of other assistance will depend on the efforts made to reduce costs.  I think there will be general agreement with the object which he hopes to achieve, but I believe that he has not paid sufficient attention to a number of factors over which industrialists have no control. A variety of factors affect costs.  Those generally considered are the price of raw materials, labour content, transport charges and so forth.  In so far as industrialists are concerned, some of these costs may be within their own control.  In others, such as taxation, rates and matters of that sort, it is either the Government or some other external body over which manufacturers have no control that determines the level at which these costs or charges will operate.  So far as industry here is concerned, taxation and rates affect costs very considerably and the tendency recently has been for taxation and rates to increase.  There are in certain cases other factors.  The import prices of some raw materials are higher here than in Great Britain.  I have in mind one particular item.  It is not a matter for which the Government is responsible but for years we know that the price of coal imported here is something like £1 or 25/- per ton more than is charged to consumers in Great Britain.  The same remarks apply to steel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister referred to costs, and I think I would be in order in referring to any steps that would be available under this measure to reduce costs.  I believe the Minister in discussing these matters should take into account the effect of external factors over which management or labour has no direct control. The amendments of a minor character which it is proposed to make are all desirable.  So far as staff are concerned, I think it has always been considered unsatisfactory, from the point of view of those employed, that their position was not more clearly defined and while this amendment will alter the position somewhat, it might be possible to establish the staff there on a basis which would give them that security which persons of their training, and generally persons with appropriate degrees, would expect.  The fact that anybody working in an institution of this character has any worries about his personal position, emoluments, prospects of future retention and so forth, must to some extent affect his efficiency and usefulness.  In so far as the proposals contained in this Bill are designed to advance industrial research or to provide more definite facilities for that work, it will receive the general welcome which a proposal of that nature should get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to make a few remarks, and to ask a few questions in relation to the Bill which, like Deputy Cosgrave, I welcome as a very desirable and very necessary measure in the present circumstances of Irish industry.  I think that the Minister's figures in relation to the number of inquiries made in regard to the use of the mark, leave us in no doubt at all that Deputy Cosgrave is right when he says that the public, and I think, to a large extent, manufacturers, have not had their attention sufficiently drawn to the existence of the standard mark or standard specifications.  I suggest that the Minister answered that to a certain extent when he said that the council in its early years was attempting to keep away work rather than to attract work.  That may be partly the reason why there has been such a small demand from manufacturers for the use of the standard mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> It is good to know that manufacturers are favourably disposed to the proposition that we should have an enactment of this nature which appears to establish a mark of quality for the products of Irish industry.  My own feeling is that there was more than one factor in the past which militated against improving to the maximum the quality of the products of the majority of our industries.  Protection by tariffs, which is no doubt a help, and quota restrictions meant that the manufacturer had not got the competition from outside which would make him produce high quality goods at the lowest possible cost.  On the whole, I think Irish manufacturers must be congratulated on the fact that the majority of them, at any rate, have not exploited that position to the extent which was possible.  Equally, the fact that there is such a small market here for the products of these industries has meant that there is an absence of that actuality of competition that one would expect to find in a country where there would be more than one manufacturer producing the same goods.  I know that there is competition in relation to some commodities produced in this country, but it is only natural that when you have one manufacturer equipped with modern machinery to produce in sufficient quantities for the home market, a potential competitor may not consider it worth while to set up another factory to produce a comparable article for that market.  The result has been that the small size of the market is adding to the likelihood that in time manufacturers may decide to produce a slipshod article or a poor quality commodity, knowing that they will have no competition either from home or abroad.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the other factor which, up to recently, operated in a most deliberate way, namely, restrictive trade practices which, again, restricted competition and permitted manufacturers to produce one quality of article only.  Even where apparently there was competition, an agreement was arrived at between manufacturers under which, while there was a semblance of competition, in effect there was no competition at all.  That meant <Col N="788" /> that there could be an agreement among manufacturers to produce a low quality article.  To a certain extent these abuses are being met, in one case by the inquiry into these practices which is producing so much interesting information for the consuming public and which has met with a certain amount of resentment on the part of some producers.  The second antidote to limited competition is being provided by the incentive of the Minister's encouragement to our industrialists to go into the export market.  Of course, once that happens, there is the free trade competition which means that the low-cost, high-quality article is the only one with a chance of survival as a result of tariffs and other considerations, if it gets into a foreign market.</P>
    <P>The third factor in establishing Irish industry on a proper footing and in getting the best value for consumers would be the widening out of this standard work of quality.  What I would like to know is&mdash;has the Minister any positive proposals to encourage extensively the use of this mark here at home?  On the one side, it is necessary to encourage the public to understand that it is a sign for their protection, a sign which will tell them that an article covered by this particular mark or marked in this particular way means an article of the highest possible quality.  Equally, if the public become conscious of that and start asking for this sign and asking to see it on the commodities provided, the manufacturer will follow suit.  Is it the intention of the Minister to publicise in a positive, aggressive way or give the Standards Council the power and the money to publicise to the maximum the fact that this organisation exists and that it can do magnificent work, and has done magnificent work in a limited way in the past, and that the personnel, the ability and know-how are there?  These people can protect the consumer if the consumer insists on getting an article with this standard mark on it.  I believe very much greater publicity and propaganda must be given to the existence of this organisation if the public are to become conscious that they can be sure of a very high quality article if marked by the standard mark.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> The Minister has made one reference to this question of the consideration given to the granting of tariffs and the likelihood of tariffs being granted in return for agreement by the manuturer that the standard mark will be used by him.  Of course that is a very definite move on the part of the Minister to encourage&mdash;I think that is a nice word&mdash;to encourage the manufacturer to take out the standard specifications in relation to goods for home consumption and also in relation to goods for export.</P>
    <P>Again, I think there is a point which must be considered&mdash;I would imagine it must arise at any rate&mdash;that if a manufacturer is asked to produce really high quality articles the question of cost enters into it.  I wonder if we do demand a wide extension of the use of this mark are we going to get any appreciable increase in the cost content of the articles produced?  I understand the Minister has also suggested we should aim at greater efficiency and reduce costs in that way but would he cancel out reduced costs attained by increased efficiency by insisting on very much higher standards? The fact of the matter is that many people have become accustomed to existing standards and possibly do not recognise that they are not getting as high a quality article for their money as they have a right to expect. The question is would there be a very slight fall in prices as a result of increased efficiency and insistence on a much higher standard in quality of the goods?  I am all for higher quality, of course, but can you have your cake and eat it?  We may not be able to do that.  The Minister may be aware of more facts which will give him to understand that we can get higher quality at more or less the same price as we pay at the moment.</P>
    <P>The point about encouragement for the public to go looking for the mark &mdash;I think that is only a question of intensive propaganda over a period, as soon as there are sufficient articles with the standard mark in the market at home or for export.  Is there any likelihood that the Minister could give some incentive to manufacturers?  I find it difficult to blame a manufacturer <Col N="790" /> or industrialist if in the home or the export market he can get away with a low standard of quality for thinking he will have no reason to change.  One could see him asking himself: Why should I bother to go looking for this mark which commits me to a high-class article, and a higher cost will cut my profit?  I would imagine, unless some definite incentive is given to a manufacturer, he is unlikely to go looking for this mark which will insist on his maintaining very high standards of quality.  Is there any likelihood that any form of incentive would be given to the manufacturer, some form of tax remission for goods exported with the mark on them or some form of facility abroad by Córas Tráchtála, a facility that we will push articles of this kind or that we will publicise the standard mark abroad and advise our people abroad in the export market that they can be absolutely certain of the quality of the goods under this mark and in that way make it worth while for the industrialist to go for the mark and go into the export market with goods with the Caighdeán Éireann mark on them?</P>
    <P>That brings us to the question as to why should the manufacturer go for the mark or go looking for the mark for his goods for the export market unless the export market knows of the very marked difference between the high quality article under the mark, compared with those unmarked and not guaranteed articles.  To what extent is the Minister going to publicise this or will he give the powers and facilities to this Standards Council to publicise the fact abroad that the article under this mark is a really high quality article?  Unless there is aggressive publicity abroad on that particular point, I fail to see why an industrialist should go out of his way to market an article with the mark on it unless he knows that he will get preference by the buyers in the foreign or export market.  I do not see any reference to any arrangement of that kind and my own point of view&mdash;knowing to some extent, I suppose, the tremendous high-pressure advertising abroad in America, Great Britain and other countries&mdash;is that unless the fact that the really high quality article is the one under the standard mark is publicised <Col N="791" /> and propagandised to a very great extent I cannot see the manufacturer looking for the protection of that mark.</P>
    <P>One other point in relation to the protection of the research council's imprimatur that the article is of the highest quality.  If a person applies for the standard mark what is the machinery whereby he obtains the mark?  If he violates the standards laid down under the mark, has the council any redress if he sends out a particular commodity under the mark?  Does the council preserve its own reliability in the home and foreign market?  Does it provide for an inspection of industries? If, say, there is an incident, as has recently occurred, where a particular commodity is believed to be infected or polluted in some way or other &mdash;it has not been proved to anybody's satisfaction&mdash;is there any redress internationally by the council by which it could re-establish its name in the minds of foreigners?  That may be an insuperable problem.  At the same time, I think that incidents such as the recent regrettable one, whatever may be the truth about it, could do tremendous damage to the trade mark. Has the council any way of protecting itself?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it would be a very big and difficult problem to see that every product to which it gives its trade mark maintained the same high standard indefinitely.  I may be trespassing on the 1946 Act but I will not pursue that point.  At the same time, for the good name of the country, the council, the energy and initiative of producers and industrialists who insist on going to the trouble of getting the standard mark it is very important that they should feel that everybody else in the same category as themselves covered by the trade mark would maintain the same high standard of quality.</P>
    <P>Is there any penalty to be imposed on anybody who uses the standard mark without authority?  Is there any penalty in regard to a person who has the right to use the standard mark but falls below the standard mark in the article to be disposed of?  Has the <Col N="792" /> council any intention of pursuing the sale of these goods and examining them from time to time or does it merely issue the mark and then forget about it?</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in another question.  I wonder whether this cuts across in any way at all the standard specifications for food, drink and patent medicines?  Is this going to be isolated from the standards to be laid down under the 1947 Health Act or does the Minister intend in relation to things such as tinned foods, patent medicines, jams, sauces and other commodities the council to have any functions in relation to that aspect of exports generally?  Will they initiate investigations or will they be associated with the Department of Health in the establishment of food and drink standards generally under the 1947 Health Act?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the provision is a very welcome one.  The Bill is very welcome, indeed.  The only thing is that it seems to me to be very dependent on the collaboration of the public at home.  It is very dependent on their enlightenment in a very extensive way.  Very few people have any knowledge of the activity of this council at the moment.  The Minister has explained that but I do not see how they can browse along in their quiet way.  They were justified for so doing up to the present.  I do not see any provision for wide publicisation of the activities of the Research Standards Council.</P>
    <P>The other point concerns publicity amongst the manufacturers.  I do not think that matters so much because, if the public is aware of the possibility of a high standard, the manufacturers will have to act accordingly.  I think publicity abroad is very necessary if we expect manufacturers to take on the mark and go into the export market in any extensive way.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is a question I would like to ask the Minister.  Section 2 (1) of the Bill states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The institute shall formulate specifications for such commodities, processes and practices as the Minister may from time to time request.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> Does the word &ldquo;specifications&rdquo; cover the question of efficiency of the particular article or the content of the article?  Is efficiency covered in any way?  Will they have the right to go into a factory and talk to manufacturers about improved methods of production?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good many doubts&mdash;not the usual type of doubts &mdash;about this Bill.  I believe in the necessity for the institute.  When I cross-questioned the Tánaiste during the course of his address I did so from the point of view of trying to elicit from him whether the ceiling he proposes in this Bill is a permissive ceiling as distinct from a final decision. If the attitude is to be that this institute is to submit estimates of the cost of the work it intends to do, I feel the Minister would be justified in fixing a far higher ceiling than he proposes.  If this institute gets under way properly and carries out its functions, I can quite envisage that the ceiling we fix now will become outmoded.  I would rather see the Minister taking a permissive power under which he could grant to them such moneys as they might require to carry on their work properly as distinct from putting a ceiling on it.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister think if the situation is to develop and this grant of £130,000 is acceded to by America that the ultimately enhanced and developed institute will be able to run from the point of view of its administration and of its work on the figure he now proposes?  I do not think they could and I do not believe the Minister thinks they could.  It is a bad policy in legislation of this nature, where you are trying to encourage and enhance something that is absolutely necessary to the improvement of industry, that we should take powers that might involve making further amendments to Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having read with a good deal of care the Minister's recent line of argument on industry, on exports and on the improvement of the standards within industry, I wonder whether the Minister has not been unwise in the limitations of this amending Bill.  The Minister no <Col N="794" /> doubt contemplates this research institute as a fair testing ground for the technical improvement and the improvement of the quality of articles produced by Irish manufacturers.  Day after day the Minister speaks at chamber of commerce after chamber of commerce expounding the necessity for the development and efficiency of industry.  He emphasises the question of technical assistance.  There is no doubt about this institute itself if developed properly can be of immense technical value to industry.  But why does the Minister not consider approaching the problem in what I believe to be the right way, making available to the institute funds for its disposal where it feels that some Grant-in-Aid for technical assistance to an industry would improve the standards and efficiency of that industry?</P>
    <P>We know perfectly well that the ultimate sale of our goods is dependent on the quality of cloth or the quality of the basic substance that is used, added to the cost of production, and the cost of production is inevitably bound up with efficiency.  If the Minister can find through this institute a way of ensuring that worthwhile manufacturers here, who are hampered by limitation of capital, restriction of credit, or anything else, will be in a position with the assistance of highly skilled technical advice to improve the quality and production and output of their manufacturing concern, he should instead of talking about the problem, make a proper gesture to those people by enabling an institute such as this to place at their disposal, by way of Grant-in-Aid or otherwise, the money to effect this improvement.</P>
    <P>The Minister preaches the doctrine&mdash; and I think the right doctrine&mdash;that it is only on quality that we will sell in an export market.  If articles are to compete in an export market they must inevitably be articles efficiently produced because the export price of that commodity will depend on the cost of production.  The Minister is well aware, and has repeatedly said so in public, that it is the quality of that article plus its reasonable price that will edge it into any export market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> While not quarrelling with the Minister on the issue of this amending Bill, I wonder if the mind that is approach-it is not too narrow in its vision and if the scope of this amending Bill has not been cut down too fine.  We are to have within the course of the next couple of years these huge new expensive laboratories in Glasnevin and if we are to have the technical staff with the ability to which we would aspire, does it not immediately strike anybody thinking rationally in this House that most of the £35,000, which is the ceiling proposed by the Minister, would be eaten up in emoluments, and justifiable emoluments, to those people before any work of a research nature is done at all?</P>
    <P>I am all against this kind of piecemeal legislation that has an embryo idea, in connection with which the legislation keeps changing as the embryo grows into something more substantial.  I am possibly different from most people in public life in this, that I would like to see a person aim at something big from the start and attain it rather than try to kill something by smallness of outlook or mediocrity of attempt.  When I pass a criticism on the Minister in relation to this amending Bill I do so in the spirit of one who thinks that advances of this type should be of the broadest possible conception.</P>
    <P>This amending Bill should have devised a more effective means of educating the public into the significance of the standard mark.  As sure as the public are educated into the significance of the standard mark, they themselves will force the manufacturer into the realisation of the necessity for putting his goods within the range and quality that the standard mark would cover.  We are too well aware of inferior goods flooding the market. Low quality Irish goods appear on the market from time to time and we know of some salubriously named exports that were sent out of this country from places that nobody could describe as a factory.  That is the inevitable consequence of the policy of get rich quick merchants who can exploit a situation that may arise from a shortage or from <Col N="796" /> immediate post-war conditions.  However I take it that the Minister's design is that this institute should ultimately be a place to which all people anxious to produce goods of quality for home consumption or for export would go to look for the imprimatur of our standards institute.  That imprimatur itself would by virtue of its requirements, establish all Irish goods whether on the home market or the foreign market to be of a really worth while standard by virtue of the fact that they were carrying the imprimatur of the standard mark no matter what its relative number might be.  If that is to be done, I think we will ultimately have to arrive at the stage where there will have to be some kind of insistence, whether by virtue of a clamour from the public or by virtue of an insistence by way of regulation, that goods will have to attain, within a reasonable period, anyway, the quality that will make them worthy of a mark or else will, of necessity, have to fail.</P>
    <P>There is no point in having a high standard set for goods and there is no point in having a registration mark fixing a standard of quality if diverse tricks and methods of connotation of goods will still let inferior goods out into the world market carrying the tag of Ireland with them.  We have known in the past how effectively, whether by the stencilling of multiple shamrocks or by the violent quality of the greenness of labels, people have succeeded in sending, as I might describe them, salubrious types of exports throughout Great Britain and parts of Europe carrying the torch of Ireland but hardly the standard of quality that Ireland might like to boast of.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Minister is sincere in his effort to ensure that Irish industry, in the building up of which he himself has played a considerable part, shall reach a standard worthy of the nation as a whole.  If that is to be done, I am saying now to the Minister in all seriousness that he is tying his hands too much in this amending measure.  If the Minister is right in his concept for the basis of this amending measure then I contend, quite seriously, that his concept is too niggardly and that it would be better for him in <Col N="797" /> the spirit this House receives such a measure to give himself a permissive ceiling that would give him more scope for work and give the institute itself more scope for rapid development.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that in the immediate past, with its multiple difficulties and its initial difficulties, the institute had not the capacity to expand that it now has.  The time has come when the institute and the Minister, under whose aegis they work, will have to ensure that there is more and more recourse to this institute by various people, by all industrialists, and that more and more information will be available on demand to the public from this institute as to the nature and type of work it is doing and, in particular, it should be available to people who are making inquiries about various types of goods.  Information should be available to people who may be inquiring from abroad for Irish goods.  Information should be available to them as to what standard has been set by this institute and what Irish manufacturers are producing goods to that standard.  If that is to be done, a good deal of money will be necessary for publicity and a good deal of money will be necessary for a proper recording department within the institute and for the proper availability of records for inspection at the institute. Whether or not it is contemplated to make available to the public at a small fee an examination of the register in relation to marks, and the people who are registered under that mark&mdash;even if that is contemplated&mdash;I say to the Minister, that, initially, his concept with regard to the spreading of the wings of this institute out into the activities that it can properly pursue will involve something more than the commitment envisaged by himself. Rather than have us in the situation that we will have to come back next year or some time in the future to argue on this issue again, I should like to see the Minister exercise a more generous approach to what work can be done.</P>
    <P>I believe, and I believe the Minister believes, that this institute is capable of very considerable expansion and, at each particular point of expansion, <Col N="798" /> it will have a considerable increase in personnel; it will have a considerable increase in technical personnel as well as in administrative personnel. Even though the 1946 Act makes adequate provision under which certain capital contingencies can be met, I think it would have been better if the Minister had left out a ceiling in the Bill altogether and had said that such money as their estimates demand will be available.</P>
    <P>I know quite a number of the personnel of the council of this institute and I know quite a number of the technicians attached to this institute. I feel it is really in its infancy and that there is in that particular institute a wealth of enthusiasm and anxiety to get to grips with the job that this amending measure, designed to help, might ultimately stultify.  I want the Minister to contemplate&mdash;and I have raised it with him by way of correspondence before&mdash;the question of the help that can be given to industry, particularly on the question of efficiency.  I want the Minister to consider whether it would not be possible to use this institute to enable worth while first-class Irish industries, with a little bit of technical assistance and a little bit of expert advice, to cut costs considerably, to produce an improved article in greater quantity per working hour.  I want the Minister to consider whether it would not be a wise thing to contemplate that an institute such as this might be an authority to which they could apply for certain Grants-in-Aid to enable them attain to the standard which the institute itself contemplates and which we all, no matter what our political beliefs may be, want to see arrive.</P>
    <P>We want to see Irish goods of range and quality from all the various industries attain to the mark that an Irish Institute of Research and Standards fixes.  We want to see all goods in this country reach the quality that will prove them a worth while article on the home market and an article worthy of our pride in whatever export market they can capture.  I think the Minister can do that if he will bear with, possibly, my more youthful outlook and take the view that it would be better <Col N="799" />&mdash;rather than fixing a ceiling of £35,000 and necessarily involving all kinds of expense subsequently by way of various amending legislation that may come&mdash; if he has to fix a ceiling at all, to make it infinitely higher or, if not, allow a general permissive power that money can be voted under this Act at the discretion of the Minister to enable the institute to do its full work and to ensure that it will not be stopped from doing it for lack of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel like having a little recreation in industrial research standards instead of discussing another Bill.  Deputy Collins referred to what he describes as his youthful outlook. I listened very carefully to what he said but did not perceive the youthful outlook that he thinks he has.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister and with other Deputies that this is an important matter that is worthy of serious consideration.  It is worthy of more serious consideration than it is receiving this evening.  There are very big problems involved.  I gathered from the Minister and other speakers that their outlook is to have a high standard of quality for internal consumption and a very high standard for export.  I wonder if that is the proper outlook at the moment.  For many years, all over the world there has been considerable discussion on the question of standards. Pre-1939 and perhaps subsequent to the war certain nations that did well in the manufacturing and export business produced cheap articles with a limited life rather than high-standard articles that might be expected to last a very long time.  That is a problem that we might consider from our point of view.  Will we concentrate on what I might term luxury production because, with world ideas as they are, it is luxury production to produce articles of exceptionally high standard designed to last a very long period?</P>
      <P>I feel that the other idea of producing a great quantity of cheap articles that may not have such a long life is perhaps better policy.  It is a matter that might be seriously considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems clear to me that it is vitally essential that we should have an export market.  How will we get that <Col N="800" /> export market in industrial goods if we insist on a very high standard that makes it impossible for those articles to meet competition abroad?  In so far as we can get into a foreign market, we get into a market in which we can only appeal to a limited number of people, people of considerable property and money.</P>
    <P>The measure introduced by the Minister in 1946 and this amending Bill have for their objective the production of a very high standard of goods that would have a long life, which, in present world conditions, cannot be produced at a price that will appeal to the ordinary person in Britain or elsewhere.  As the Minister and the House know, the whole tendency in Europe at the moment is to liberalise trade, in other words, to remove tariff and other barriers that prevent goods of one country going into another.  If we follow in that line, as I think we will be forced to do&mdash;and I think we are keeping pace with it and are perhaps a little forward of some nations&mdash;we will have the competition in this country of goods that are cheap, that have a limited life, that are useful and that can be dumped when their period of usefulness ends, and replaced by something new.</P>
    <P>That is a problem we must discuss and consider.  We must watch what is happening in the world and try, by means of State assistance, State aid, State subvention and active State participation to manufacture goods that will be as good as those produced in other countries for the particular market and that will, if possible, be sold in foreign markets at a price somewhat cheaper than the price of the goods of our competitors.  That is the problem which we must face.</P>
    <P>Where we have a particular commodity that is peculiarly Irish and recognised to be Irish, where we have a particular pride in that commodity, it is right that it should be protected by the very highest standards but where it is a matter of other things that are expendable, where the period of usefulness may be somewhat longer than what might be termed a short period, a year or two years or three years, where we produce these expendable articles, we have not got the same <Col N="801" /> problems in regard to trade protection or in regard to high standards.</P>
    <P>The question of food is in a completely different category.  Any food that we produce for consumption here or elsewhere, must be of the very highest quality.  Whether it is food that is exported on the hoof or in tins, cans, cellophane or anything else, it must be of the highest standard.  The very fact that it is known to be Irish will be an indication that it is of the highest standard.</P>
    <P>I agree that it is necessary to have laboratory and scientific research. Whatever steps are necessary must be taken to ensure that.  Deputy Cosgrave mentioned assistance to individual firms for scientific and industrial research. I have often thought that we should have more centralised laboratory and scientific research.  Instead of providing money, as has been suggested here, for particular firms to carry out this research themselves, the research could be carried out by one of the central institutions of the State, by the allocation of staff temporarily to a particular firm or group of firms. The idea of trying to increase industrial production has for its object the provision of employment under good conditions for our own people.  On studying this question, we may discover that, under the system we have at the moment, the individual firms are unable, as Deputy Cosgrave said, because of taxation, rates and other expenses to produce goods at a proper price.  To assist industry of that kind, it may be necessary to establish, under the control of the Minister, other industries that will assist those which are unable to face the difficulties of competition.</P>
    <P>No matter what one may say about the advantages of private enterprise as such, where it is a matter of maintaining our own population under good standards it may be necessary to have the incentive I mention, of State industries which will work in cooperation with the industries controlled by private enterprise and which, because of State assistance, will be able to improve the machinery and processes of production.  The matters which arise out of consideration of this <Col N="802" /> Bill are matters of the highest importance.</P>

      <P>As I was saying when Deputy Collins called for a House, it is a subject of serious importance, that deserves more consideration than is being given to it this evening.  Those dealing with the development of industry must be concerned about the home market as well as the foreign or export market.  One of our great difficulties has been that our population has been declining for over a century.  I always believe that if a country is to have a substantial industrial production, if a country is to have prosperity, it must have an increasing population rather than a decreasing one.  I think, in regard to that matter, that what I mentioned earlier of a reconsideration of the problem of production, we should go in for the large-scale production of cheaper articles which in itself would <Col N="803" /> provide more industrial employment at good incomes and good wages.  We ought seriously to consider the two matters as of vital importance in connection with this whole problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the small number of people who have applied for the standard mark.  I feel that in itself is not a matter that we need be too worried about for the reasons which I have already stated.  I think that our national standard mark should be limited entirely to goods that are peculiarly Irish goods that we are proud of and that we require to maintain at the very highest possible standard. Certainly, in so far as there can be a standard mark for food, I think that ought to be available.  I agree with Deputy Dr. Browne and with Deputy Cosgrave that we should have more propaganda not only here but elsewhere as to the meaning and effect of our standard mark, and of what it involves in regard to quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will conclude on an observation which was made in a different way by Deputy Dr. Browne.  He referred to the problem that is created by an incident, such as the recent one in Great Britain, where very considerable damage could be done to an Irish product as a result of rumour.  That could always happen, and the firm concerned, or any firm that may be similarly concerned, may be struck a very grievous blow.  I think that in those circumstances there ought to be available for that particular industry the resources of the State to enable it to recapture its position in the world market.  We have such a big problem in obtaining a market abroad that we have to insist, when we get that market abroad, on maintaining it when we know that the goods, and particularly the foods, that we export are of the highest quality, and that there is in regard to those foods that we export, no defect and nothing that could in any way lower our standards. We should ourselves consider it of vital importance, in connection with an incident of this kind, that the resources of the State should be available to assist that particular product or that particular industry to overcome the temporary damage that has been done <Col N="804" /> to it by the incident.  I, like every other Deputy, welcome the Bill.  It has been explained by the Minister in a way that makes it very simple for Deputies to understand it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill.  I would remind the House that two or three months ago many Deputies raised the question of the Irish whiskey distilling industry.  I should be glad to know from the Minister if the operation of this Bill will extend to that industry so as to ensure that no goods will go out of this country in bottles with heavy green labels on them if the stuff is not up to standard.  People who came from the Continent recently told me that they saw there stuff that was supposed to be Irish whiskey.  It was on the shelves, heavily labelled with green labels, but when taken down it had no likeness whatever to the genuine good Irish whiskey we have here.  I am anxious to know from the Minister if, under this measure, power will be taken to ask for samples of such goods that may be going out with an Irish badge on them.  These could do harm to the genuine article which we produce here. When it goes abroad it creates good trade for this country and its production provides good employment at home.  I welcome the measure and earnestly hope that it will be applied in the direction of seeing that no goods will go out of the country that are not up to standard, no matter who sends them out with labels coloured highly with our own national colours, maybe with a round tower and that kind of thing, to deceive people.  I am confident that the Minister will do something in the direction of seeing that our Irish distilling industry is protected.</P>

      <P>I am rather appalled by the suggestion that seems to be contained in the few words spoken by the last speaker, that, in fact, some of our exports are substandard. That is not the reason for. nor is it the case for, this measure, and any such false impression should not be allowed to go abroad.  Such goods as we export are of a very high standard. As I am on that subject, Deputy <Col N="805" /> Cowan mentioned a matter which should be seen in its true light.  The fact is that the Irish products which have been examined intact have been found to be all right so far.  The fact is that the Irish product which was under suspicion had already been opened and tampered with before it came for analysis at all.  Every tin that was intact and subsequently analysed was found to be of the required high standard.  That is as I understand the story.  Anyone who has the slightest acquaintance with the processes of evidence will realise that no case whatever could be made when the tin had already been opened for a long time and had been tampered with, and that it should not be the cause of such a scare.  I do not think that these matters are relevant to this Bill at all.</P>
      <P>I think that we should look at the statement of the Minister in introducing the Bill.  It is here more for the purpose of getting uniformity and of giving a guarantee.  The particular value of this Bill is that it gives a guarantee and protection to the manufacturer and to the product.  There is that great point in it, that there is for any commodity a standard specification to which the producer voluntarily conforms.  It is voluntary.  The producer can elect to do it or not, but once he elects he brings himself within the sanctions.  If he does so, he has then the great advantage that there is a scheme there to ensure that that standard is maintained, and he is not to rely solely on such evidence as he himself may produce as to the high quality of the goods.  There is a guarantee, over and above himself and of his productive unit, of the quality of these goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this can be organised, and I think it can be, this Bill will be a great advantage to manufacturers, and it will also be an incentive to people who are working in producing commodities, in that they have to live up to specification, and gradually the whole measure will make for a higher standard, an improving standard, of productive methods and craftsmanship. That is why I rather deplore the suggestions which have been made and the fact that the discussion seemed to <Col N="806" /> be getting slightly out of focus.  I join with others in saying that this is a step forward and that the operations of this standards wing of the research and standards bureau will be useful.  I wonder do Deputies realise that this body set up in 1946 is steadily growing and is quietly organising itself to play a real part and make a real contribution to our requirements in that field for which, until the passing of the 1946 Act, we had no provision?</P>

      <P>Regarding the amount which may be provided under the Bill for the work of the Institute of Research and Standards, I did not endeavour to leave the Dáil under the impression that the Committee on Industrial Research would not prefer to have a larger sum.  Anybody responsible <Col N="807" /> for the activities of an organisation of that kind and anxious to see them grow would naturally fix a fairly high target when determining the amount that could usefully and reasonably be spent.  The need for increased subvention to the institute was obvious. The amount of the increase was discussed with the committee of the institute and eventually this figure of £35,000 was arrived at.  The Industrial Research Committee will regard it as a considerable improvement on the present position and will be able to do a great deal with it.  The main effect of the amendment of the legislation in the immediate future is that the committee will be able to go ahead with its plans for extension, knowing that the finance will be available to them. Up to the present, they have not been limited by actual lack of funds.  As I said, they had accumulated a reserve fund, out of the existing grants, of £27,000.  They were unable to spend that fund upon a long-term programme because they could not enter into the commitments which would be involved in such a programme, without having the limits fixed in the previous Act raised as is proposed in the Bill.  If and when the new laboratories to be provided out of the American Grant Counterpart Fund are constructed, the limit may have to be looked at again, because there is not much point in having new laboratories equipped with apparatus for research without having adequate staff to ensure their full utilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the possibility of grants being given to private firms for the undertaking of specific researches.  I do not think that is the best method of extending the scope of the institute's activities. I have suggested to the institute that they should endeavour to make arrangements with private firms having research laboratories or research institutes in other countries for the undertaking, on behalf of the institute, of researches which the institute is not at present equipped to do.  Up to the present, the institute has had, on occasion, to tell industrial firms which wanted particular investigations carried out that they could not do <Col N="808" /> them because they had not got the equipment for the purpose.  I think they could make an arrangement under which they would never have to give that reply and under which they could accept a contract to carry out an investigation, even though they had to farm out the investigation to some other body acting as their agent.  I understand the Committee on Industrial Research are considering the practicability of an arrangement of that kind.</P>
    <P>It should be appreciated, however, that a very large part of the institute's utility is the technical library which they have in Glasnevin House and the sources of information which are open to them from their contacts with research bodies in other countries, and many queries which industrial firms might wish to have answered could perhaps be answered in a very short time by reference to the material in the library or by addressing an inquiry to some body somewhere in the world which has already carried out an investigation of that subject.  It is only where a specific problem of our own requires experimentation that the institute carries out or needs to carry out research activity of its own.</P>
    <P>Certain occasions arose which will illustrate my point.  When the question of the utilisation of concrete pipes for land drainage purposes was causing difficulty, the institute carried out an investigation on the type of soils in which concrete pipes might be used and those in which clay pipes would have to be used, and, on the basis of these inquiries, the use of concrete or clay pipes for land drainage purposes is determined.  A group of Irish textile manufacturers arranged for the institute to carry out experimentation into a better method of bleaching textile materials which led to improved processes in Irish factories. I have already mentioned the machine which was publicised in the evening paper for the cleaning of carrageen moss.  In connection with the new industry of manufacturing seaweed meal, it was necessary to determine the reproduction rate of the weed so that farming processes would not destroy the future possibilities of the industry, and the institute carried out <Col N="809" /> an investigation which now determines the rate at which the seaweed is gathered in the areas where the industry is operating.</P>
    <P>The institute is, of course, not limited to the maximum of £35,000 fixed in the Bill for research work of that kind.  Where special investigations are necessary, investigations which involve the institute in the purchase of equipment for the purposes of the investigation or the recruitment of staff, special grants can be given under the provisions of the original Act.  Deputy Collins suggested that there should be no limit in the Bill, but it is our practice when enacting legislation of this kind, to put financial limits into these measures. There is possibly even a constitutional reason for it.  I do not want it to be assumed that in fixing a limit of £35,000 now we are determining that that is the maximum extent to which the work of the institute can ever expand in the future.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps make it clear also that the purpose of the institute so far as industry is concerned is to carry out scientific research on behalf of industry. It is not to undertake technical assistance projects as that term is ordinarily understood.  There is a technical assistance Vote.  There is money available under which aid can be given to groups of firms manufacturing goods to improve the efficiency of their operations, but improvement of the efficiency of the operations of any industry need not involve any scientific investigation at all. It could be a matter of the placing of machinery, the utilisation of labour, the efficiency of the tools employed and matters of that kind.  The work of the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards so far as that aspect of industrial improvement is concerned is confined to carrying out scientific investigations, and it does those investigations either at the request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he wants some particular possibility explored or on behalf of individual firms or groups of firms who have run into scientific difficulties.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of the standard specification and the <Col N="810" /> standard mark.  There is, I think, some misunderstanding about the function of the standard specification.  A standard specification is designed to enable people to protect themselves.  It does not set up a minimum standard of quality enforceable in any way. Nobody has to produce goods to the standard specification.  It does not affect the business of exports at all.  If there was a desire to prevent the export of goods below a predetermined standard special legislation for that purpose would have to be enacted.  It cannot be done on this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Noel Browne inquired about standards for medicines, foods and drink in relation to which the Minister for Health or the Minister for Agriculture has power to fix minimum standards and enforce those minimum standards to the extent of prosecuting anybody who sells goods below those standards or preventing them from engaging in their manufacture at all. When I resumed office as Minister for Industry and Commerce there was a rather humorous race proceeding between, I think, the Department of Health and the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards as to which would get out first with a standard specification for ice cream.  I got the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards out of that race, because the purpose of the specification to be produced by the Department of Health was to ensure that nobody would produce ice cream below their standard whereas the purpose of the standard specification to be produced by the institute would be merely to set up standards to which people could conform if they wished to and by conforming to which they could get increased trade if the public understood the significance of the standard.</P>
    <P>I have said that the purpose of the standard specification is to help people to help themselves.  If Deputies will look over the list of standard specifications already made they will find that the great majority relate to industrial materials&mdash;to cement, to roofing tiles or roofing slates, to a variety of different kinds of paints, to electric plugs and sockets, to building blocks, plaster board, cast-iron goods and so forth.  All these standard specifications are <Col N="811" /> designed to facilitate people in trade. If I am entering into a contract with somebody to build a house for me or to supply goods for which there is a standard specification I can put in that contract an obligation upon the other party to supply goods to the standard specification, and that releases me from the difficulty of determining for myself the standard of quality to which I want the goods to conform.</P>
    <P>Up to the present only a comparatively small number of standard specifications has been made for consumer goods, the kind of goods you can purchase in a shop.  They have been made for woollen blankets, cotton sheets, farmers' leather boots and things of that kind.  When Deputy Dr. Browne suggests that we should advertise in order to inform the public of the importance of the standard mark as a protection to them I think the answer is that we have not yet got enough standard specifications for consumer goods of ordinary public interest to justify a campaign of that kind.  I have been pressing upon manufacturers who are producing goods of that kind to standard specification and using the mark to advertise that they are using the mark on their goods, and a number of them have done so.  They are beginning to find that it is a selling point for their products to let it be known to the public that they have been licensed to attach the standard mark to the particular product they are producing. The purpose of the standard mark however, as I have said, is to enable the public to protect themselves, not to force manufacturers to produce goods of any particular quality or much less to force up the general level of quality of goods produced. Eventually it should have that result, but ordinarily the aim of a standard specification is to secure that the goods are of good quality having regard to their character.  We have a standard specification for woollen blankets.  There is no reason why we should not have one for cotton blankets and another for a mixture blanket, of a mixture of a cotton and wool.  Nobody can describe a cotton blanket as a woollen blanket or a mixture <Col N="812" /> blanket as a woollen blanket.  But so long as the article is what it is described to be and is produced in accordance with the conditions laid down in the standard specification then the public will know what they are getting.</P>
    <P>We made standard specifications for certain types of doors&mdash;flush doors and panel doors; and now I understand they are producing a standard specification for a cheaper type of door, what is called a straw-packed door. The aim is not to ensure that only the dearest door, the most expensive type of door, will be used, but that anybody buying a door will know if the standard mark is on it, that it conforms with the specification for that kind of door; and, of course, the aim of the committee preparing these specifications is to ensure that a reasonably good standard of quality is insisted upon on all occasions.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to build up public realisation of the importance of the standard mark over a period of time. I am hoping to start that first of all by utilising the enormous buying power of Government Departments and State-sponsored bodies.  When we came to consider the matter in consultation with the Department of Local Government and other Government Departments that have control over the purchase of a large variety of goods we came up against certain practical difficulties in making it a condition that only goods bearing the standard mark should be supplied.  Therefore, for this experimental period we arranged that those Departments would require those submitting tenders for the supply of those goods to state whether the goods they would supply would or would not bear the standard mark.  We hope from that to get information which will enable us to extend the process of securing the use of the standard mark by manufacturers in the future.  The same applies to purchases by State-sponsored bodies.  With them that process has not been started, and there may be some difficulty, but we hope to get their co-operation in the matter.</P>
    <P>So far as manufacturers are concerned it is now standard practice in <Col N="813" /> the Department of Industry and Commerce if any manufacturer or group of manufacturers comes in looking for a tariff alteration or some other concession or Government help in any form to ask them if there is a standard specification of the goods they produce and if they are producing goods to that specification and using the mark to show it.  It has been made clear to them that a decision on whatever application they make will be very greatly influenced by the answer given to that question.  If the manufacturers are producing goods to the standard specification, provided there is a standard specification for these goods, then they should take the further step of using the standard mark in relation to it.  It is quite true that by applying for a licence to use a standard mark and attaching that mark to the goods they are incurring legal liabilities because, if they use the mark in connection with goods which are not of standard specified quality, they are liable to prosecution and, in certain circumstances, to imprisonment.  It is the knowledge that these penalties attach to the use of the standard mark that gives the mark its value because it helps the public to understand that no manufacturer will take the risk of advertising that his goods bear a standard mark unless he is quite certain the quality is up to standard specification quality because of the severity of the penalties prescribed in the Act.</P>
    <P>There may be necessity for taking power at some stage to protect the quality of goods going into the export trade.  I had in fact contemplated some years ago enacting legislation for that purpose.  Just at the end of the war, when trade was dead anyway, I thought it was a good time to get that legislation into operation so that the growth of post-war trade would take place within the limits fixed by that new legislation.  That proved to be extraordinarily difficult and the number of exceptions that would have to be made rendered it of very doubtful value.  Points arose in connection with the discussion we had here some time ago: a manufacturer of pottery produces in the process of turning out the pottery a number of slightly defective <Col N="814" /> articles which are called &ldquo;seconds&rdquo;&mdash; a cup with the pattern crooked, a handle not quite in the right place&mdash; and the one aim of the manufacturer of that pottery is to get all the seconds disposed of outside his normal market, because, within that market, they can damage his normal trade.  That is why most of the Irish pottery seconds are sent to England and some of the English pottery seconds come in here.</P>
    <P>In any event it was only in a limited range of products that it seemed to me the necessity for restrictions might arise.  I felt in the long run that it was better to try to get the result rather by a process of certifying the quality of the exports than by prohibiting exports of inferior quality.  At that time we were considering, in relation to the whiskey to which Deputy Byrne referred, the possibility of affixing some Government seal on the bottle certifying the length of time it had been kept in bond here under Government supervision and, consequently, the quality, although I suppose individual tastes differ and individual judgments on the quality of any particular bottle of whiskey would be liable to differ also.</P>
    <P>However, this Bill is not for that purpose.  I want to make that clear. The standard specifications under this Bill are designed to be operated by any manufacturer who wants to give a guarantee as to the quality of his products; he can adopt the standard specification and apply for a licence to attach the standard mark to them. Anybody who wants to protect himself in business can avail of the standard specification for that purpose.  In the course of time I hope to get here, as they have got in other countries, a widespread public acceptance of the significance of the standard mark so that in the ordinary course of trade nobody will be able to sell a product without having that particular mark attached to it.</P>
    <P>I was very much impressed when drafting the original Act by a conversation I had with the Director of Industrial Research and Standards in New Zealand.  There they have been working on this problem for a long time and they have got, it seemed to <Col N="815" /> me, a very considerable social advantage from the work they have done, the public understanding of the significance of the work and the public's co-operation in the work.  It is my hope that in the course of time we will be able to do that here.  I admit we have been turning out standard specifications at too slow a rate.  The work of our institute does not compare at all with the work of corresponding institutes in other countries.  That is partly due to the fact that here they were starting in on what was a new field of activity and partly to the fact that their resources were limited.  Now they are getting into their stride and the process of getting consultations and agreements in the preparation of standards has become more or less formalised.  Now that they are getting more money also, I hope we will be able to produce these specifications at a much greater rate.  The institute think that they can turn them out at twice the present rate.  Even that I regard as merely the minimum target.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, there are no less than 60 commodities in respect of which I have formally requested the institute to prepare standard specifications upon which they have not been able to start work.  They are working on about 20 additional commodities at the present time.  The institute have not yet been able to do as much in the way of testing the quality of commodities as I would like.  I am hoping as a result of the increased resources available now that they will be able to develop their organisation so as to do much more work in the testing of the quality of goods on sale than has been possible up to the present.</P>
    <P>I think there is considerable public value in the work done by certain organisations in America which just take commodities used in ordinary trade and on sale in the shops in the ordinary way, test these and publish an analysis.  It does nothing more than that and periodically it lets the people know exactly what they are paying their money for; in some cases they have been able to expose what were palpable frauds upon the public. Testing of that kind is permissible <Col N="816" /> under the Act and the institute is protected against any legal consequences of publishing analyses detrimental to some commercial interests, and is one part of the institute's work. I hope they will be able to expand in that field.  It will be necessary for them to have that apparatus for testing the quality of goods in full operation when the number of standard specifications increases and when the use of the standard mark extends because there is an obligation on the institute to ensure that in every case where a standard mark is used the quality of goods to which the mark is attached is always and consistently in conformity with the standard specification.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any other point to which I need refer at this stage.  I would like to pay a tribute to the council of the institute.  A number of people who are very prominent in many walks of life and who are obviously very busy men, have agreed to act upon the council of the institute and they give through that council useful advice to the executive committees and useful guidance in the development of the institute's activities.  Originally I had contemplated that the council of the institute would, at its annual meeting, become something in the nature of a scientific convention at which the work of the institute would be discussed at a very high level and at which people prominent in academic or industrial circles would read papers directing public attention to investigations that might usefully be undertaken, or reporting the general condition of scientific inquiry in any particular field.  Up to the present these council meetings have been held and completed in a single day.  I appreciate that most of these people would find it difficult to give more time to the annual meeting of the council, but I hope in time that my original idea will also be fulfilled and that the institute, through its council, will become a general centre of scientific activity which will not be confined to the laboratories of the institute itself. I know that many members of the council and the officers of the institute share that hope with me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> Now that the increased funds are available to the institute I hope that they will be able to move in that direction. Up to the present, they have not spent very much money on the annual meeting of the council but they will be able to spend a little more in future. I hope they will want to spend it if it makes the council develop in the way I have suggested.</P>

      <P>Last night I moved the deletion of sub-section (3) of Section 103, lines 28 to 38, and I did so for reasons which I then briefly explained.  It is important that in discussing this matter we should realise that the Minister himself has put down for consideration an amendment to that particular sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 53, Section 103 (3) (a), line 32, to insert "or during a period during which reservists are called out on permanent service under Section 88," after "force."</P>
      <P>In other words, while sub-section (3) authorises the Minister by regulation to prohibit officers of the Reserve Defence Forces and reservists when called out on permanent service from participating in specified political activities, he also wants the sub-secton to be extended to enable him to prohibit those officers and soldiers from participating in specified political activities in the period during which reservists are called out on permanent service under Section 88 of the Bill, which is the section which has been discussed and in which there has been an amendment made during the progress of the Bill through the House at this stage, so that in addition to what is in this sub-section the Minister proposes to extend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand what the Minister <Col N="819" /> had in mind when he considered putting in this particular provision.  I think the Minister had in mind something in the nature of what one ordinarily calls politics in this country. For some reason or other, politics has received a very debased connotation over a period of a century or so.  Politics has many meanings, its primary and proper meaning being the science of government, and its debased meaning that it is engaging in activities of an undesirable nature.  I fear that the drafter of that particular amendment had in mind, from his isolation, the second meaning of the word, because if he had in mind the higher description of politics as being the science of government, I do not think he would have considered the restriction or prohibition laid down here.  It is time that we should get away from the debased conception of politics, and it is particularly desirable that we in this House should endeavour to give to politics in our own interest, if not in the national interest, the higher sense and the higher meaning.</P>

      <P>I always take the line that in anything we do we all take the line that anything each of us did was in the national interest.  That is why I find some difficulty, on reflection, as to what is involved in this particular amendment.  It is a pity that we could not have from the Minister in the section some idea as to what he himself considered might be involved in &ldquo;specified political activities&rdquo;.  Let us get down to a realistic consideration of what is involved.  A person who is an officer of the Reserve Defence Forces may belong to a political Party, as he is perfectly entitled to.  He may belong to one of the political Parties that are recognised in the House as being part of the set-up of the Dáil, or he may be a member of any organisation which is political but, nevertheless, is not represented here in the Dáil or in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>He may be an Independent and he may have very wise <Col N="820" /> views on everything.  What can the Minister do under this section?  I stated last night that to participate in political activities is, I believe, a sign of very high citizenship.  It has been laid down by very high authorities that it is the duty of citizens in democracies to take an active part in politics and thereby help to preserve democracy.  That has been laid down by the very highest authority and would be acceptable to the people, particularly of this country. If participation in politics implies a very high standard of citizenship, what right would the Minister have to say that a particular person should not par ticipate in specific political activities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is what is involved here.  I accept that if the present Minister were making regulations in regard to that, he would take into account all relevant considerations and he would endeavour to come to a very reasonable decision in regard to it.  I am perfectly certain his predecessor would take the same line but where we are enacting permanent legislation, a Bill, not for to-day or to-morrow, a Bill for a long time in the future, a Bill that may be administered by very many different types of Ministers, what guarantee have we that if we allow this very wide prohibition to the Minister, it will not be abused?  I think it is a reasonable thing for a Parliament in a democratic country to secure all the safeguards it can against abuses of power by some person in the future.  I do not think it is wise to consider legislation on the basis of the particular Minister who happens to be in power at the moment. I think the Minister would agree that it is reasonable to consider what Ministers may do in the future, although the Minister has always held out, particularly in regard to decisions on this Bill, the idea that we must consider legislation as reasonable persons on the basis that the Acts will be always administered by reasonable people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think myself that to adopt that line is to fly in the face of all history and of all experience.  If we were to take that line in regard to every Act we <Col N="821" /> pass, I think the Acts would be very short and there would be no restrictive provisions of any kind in them.  We would leave it all to the good nature and the good sense of Ministers administering the Acts to do the wise thing on all occasions.  I think that one would have to go to Utopia or into some of the countries visualised by Swift to find a society in which people would have that exceptionally high standard of conduct in their rulers and in their Ministers of State.  That is why I say that I feel that this particular clause is an unwise provision, that it is rather unnecessarily slovenly, if I might put it that way, in its drafting.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say: &ldquo;Well what happens if persons are called out for a period of permanent service?&rdquo; I want the House to realise the position because I can see from the observation that Deputy Allen made a few moments ago that there is a conception that permanent service is service for a long period.  &ldquo;Permanent service&rdquo; has a particular specific meaning within this Act and it is interpreted. Permanent service for the purpose of the Act might mean service for no longer than one week.  That is the difficulty that might arise in the conception of that provision, particularly amongst persons who would not be aware of the specific meaning of permanent service as laid down in this Act.  One may say: &ldquo;If the Minister cannot stop members of the Reserve Defence Force from being members of political organisations, then it is right that he should prohibit them engaging in political activities when they are on permanent service.&rdquo; Permanent service might be only for a week or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strange that in regard to permanent Defence Forces all that is laid down in the Act is that a soldier &ldquo;shall not join, or be a member of, or subscribe to any political organisation or society, or any secret society whatsoever.&rdquo; That is all that is laid down in the Act in regard to the Regular Army.  But as Deputy Allen knows and as the House knows there are such things as barrack standing orders which are covered in this Act and unit standing orders which are laid down under the very authority of this Act.  There are certain things that they do not permit within the walls of barracks and one of the things is a political meeting. That is very clearly laid down. Obviously you can have anything that you are not prevented from having. For instance there is a standing order that you cannot play poker in a barrack-room&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or indulge in gambling or anything like that.  One must approach the problem on the basis, first and foremost, that a soldier is a citizen whether Regular Army or reservist: that he is entitled to have any political views he likes and to express them: that he is entitled to attend political meetings: that he is entitled to have letters addressed to him by candidates in a general election and in fact they are delivered free to him by the Army authorities: and he is entitled to vote and gets all the assistance in the world in having his vote recorded enclosed and sent under the seal of secrecy to the returning <Col N="823" /> officer.  One can very readily by the misuse or misunderstanding of the word "political" get a very wrong conception of what is aimed at here in this section.  We have got to remember this&mdash;that the regular soldier has a right to hold any political views he likes, to express them, to attend any political meeting he likes and there is the danger that under this section a regulation might be made which would go much further in regard to the reservist who may be only up for a couple of days than the Minister could lawfully prescribe in regard to members of the Regular Forces.</P>
      <P>The phrase "specified political activities&rdquo; suggests that the Minister has made up his mind already that there are certain political activities on the part of reservists that he thinks it desirable to prohibit by regulation. If that is so, I think the House should be told by the Minister what those "specified political activities" are. For instance, would the Minister prohibit by regulation a reservist from voting in a general election? Would the Minister by regulation prohibit reservists from receiving, during the course of a general election, Party literature?</P>
      <P>If the Minister feels that he could not prohibit a reservist from attending a political meeting, from voting in elections, from receiving Party literature, from expressing political views, what are the special activities that the Minister feels that he should prohibit by regulation?  If he has made up his mind on this question after he has had experience of having the Reserve up on permanent service for a long period&mdash;if he has made up his mind as to the political activities that he thinks should be prohibited&mdash;why does he not specify them in the section rather than leave them at large as he has done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the House should have it on record from the Minister what the Minister has in mind in regard to these specified political activities.  I know that the present Minister, if the matter were to be decided by him during the period that he is Minister for Defence, would hardly issue a regulation <Col N="824" /> that did not apply to all political Parties irrespective of what Party was concerned.  But is it sufficient safeguard in this section that "specified political activities" could not relate particularly to one political organisation rather than another?  I take it that the wording here does not have in mind &mdash; I certainly could not read it into the section &mdash; the prohibition of reservist or a Reserve officer from belonging to a political Party.  If a member, no matter how active he may be in any political Party, joins the Reserve or becomes a Reserve officer, and is called out on permanent service or in circumstances in which the State is in danger, would the Minister in those circumstances oblige, or did he have in mind the issue of a regulation that would oblige, that particular Reserve officer or reservist to resign his membership of a political organisation?  If he were a prominent member of a political organisation would he be entitled to retain his membership of the political organisation or would the regulations he has in mind oblige him to discontinue his membership during the period?  Those are the questions I want to put to the Minister on that section.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister in this section did not make it absolutely specific what he wanted to do.  For instance, when he deals with the Regular Forces he says very clearly: you cannot be a member of, or subscribe to, a political organisation or society.  That is clear.  You cannot join, be a member of or subscribe to any political organisation or society or any secret society whatsoever. Would he apply the very same restrictions to a reservist or a Reserve officer on permanent service? Would his regulations prohibit him from joining, becoming a member of, or subscribing to a political organisation during the period that he is a member?  I think the House would be anxious for the Minister to clarify that particular matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>This matter was discussed in the Special Committee and, as a result, I think the amendment which the Minister brings in now goes a little further than the original section went.  If the <Col N="825" /> Minister is able to indicate in a broad, general way what he has in mind, then it will be helpful to the House and we will have some idea of what may be involved in the prohibition that is laid down here, although I know, and the House knows, that anything the Minister may say here in support of the section cannot be held to bind his successor.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious to hear what the Minister has in mind in regard to the section, what he means by specified political activities.  I am particularly anxious to know whether by political he means active Party politics rather than politics in the higher sense that I mentioned as the science of Government.  I think I have said sufficient to indicate the doubts I have in regard to this and I am very anxious that the Minister should clarify these doubts when he replies to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has a long history.  I do not suppose that we should go into it now but I think that, on examination, this whole section could practically be done without at the present time.  I did not like it when I had certain responsibility for it but, as it had a certain tradition for the permanent members of the Force, I felt that the Dáil, and not I, should move it, because it was the Dáil put it in at the time it was inserted in the first Army Act.  The Government of the day accepted that amendment for very specific reasons.</P>
      <P>Later on it was possible for a Reserve officer to be a Deputy of this House, to even serve and be a Deputy for the month's training when he was called up during the year.  We find that the prohibition against being a Deputy of the House arose during the last emergency.  It was only during the last emergency &mdash; between the years 1939 and 1946 &mdash; that a regulation was made prohibiting Deputies from being members of the Defence Forces, that is, the Reserve, Second and Third Line of Defence, but he could be a member of the auxiliary police force established under the emergency regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the long run, I do not think it served any useful purpose.  If there is <Col N="826" /> an emergency of such a nature that the defence of the country is being undertaken on a broad basis by both Government and people, I think it is no harm at all that the Parliament would be graced with the uniforms of the State.  When an army is in the field and whenever it is able to keep a remnant of the Army in the field or a well-organised company, the sovereignty of the State remains in that company until it is quashed by an enemy or an invader.  It would not be at all unreasonable to have a member of the House, even in uniform, out defending the country.</P>
    <P>This section has a long history.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider the whole question of having it at all.  It dealt with a specific situation.  It was case legislation instead of a principle.  The exclusion of Deputies from being members of the F.C.A. or the L.D.F. was, I think, a mistake.  However, the country was defended without us at the time and the necessity did not arise. When it comes to making regulations to deal with the Reserve Forces who are called out on permanent service, permanent service can be, as Deputy Cowan rightly says, for 24 hours.  As a matter of fact, it is rather a peculiar situation that if a reservist is in a district or a village and if the Civic Guards want help they can call him out without the Minister doing it at all in case of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>It would be a nice how-do-you-do if the reservist had to say "I am a member of a Fianna Fáil or a Fine Gael club and I have to resign first before I can go out.&rdquo; That would be very disturbing.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say whether he feels he should retain the section.  If he feels he should not I think the argument can stop and he should consider dropping it altogether. There is no necessity to-day for subsections (1) or (2) because the good sense of the people in the Army should see to it that they would not be members of any political Party while they were serving in the Forces.  Then, when they are on reserve, I think their rights as citizens entitle them to be <Col N="827" /> members of any political organisation if they so desire.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that the restrictions which a Minister or a commanding officer wish to place on them would be put upon their conduct within the barracks.  The camp standing orders would prohibit any unseemly conduct that might arise and anything that might disturb the good order of the barracks.  Under other sections they will have ample power to meet such incidents.  However, I would like to hear what the Minister has to say.  As I said, I did not like the section while I had responsibility and I do not like it even now.</P>

      <P>This section will not prevent any member of the Forces or any member of the Reserve, who wishes to do so, from participating in a study of the science of government.

      <P>In my opinion he would be performing a civic duty if he were to do that.  But Deputy Cowan, in the course of his remarks, surprised me somewhat because all the questions he put were those which he asked during the passage of the Bill through the Special Committee.  When he began his speech he said he put these queries for the purpose of having the matter clarified.  I made a long reply in which I thought I had clarified the situation fairly fully and in the course of my remarks the Deputy interjected: &ldquo;I merely wanted the Minister to clarify the position.&rdquo; Naturally I assumed from that that the Deputy was reasonably satisfied with the situation as he found it then.  There can be little doubt that the difference between Deputy Cowan and myself &mdash; he referred to this himself &mdash; is that the Deputy is not anxious to trust anyone and I am anxious to trust everyone.</P>

      <P>The only thing that this section does &mdash; and Deputy Cowan and Deputy General MacEoin know this as well as I do &mdash; is to ask that when a man is called out on permanent service he leaves politics behind him. Deputy Cowan is anxious to know what politics means in this connection. The only answer I can give to him is on the lines of his own impression. Politics, as it is generally known to the man in the street, is not the study of the science of government.  It is something more than that.  It is a terribly keen, fanatical, active interest in one political policy as against another and it is the desire of ensuring that, as far as it lies within the power of the individual who believes in that policy, that policy is successful.  I do not think that any Deputy wants to see that type of argument taking place in the Army.  We do not want to see a captain in the Army expressing one viewpoint, some of his lieutenants expressing another viewpoint and some more of them expressing still another viewpoint.  That would only lead to complete and utter disruption and I am certain no Deputy wants to see that sort of thing taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the individual can be the most active member of his political organisation and he does not have to resign from it when he is called up.  If he is a member of the Reserve he merely tells his political organisation: <Col N="829" />&ldquo;I have been called up.  You will have to have me replaced by somebody else.  I will not be able to help you now until I am demobbed.&rdquo; That is all there is to it.  There is no question whatever of asking him to resign from his position.  If he happens to be the secretary, the chief mobiliser or organiser &mdash; whatever he is called &mdash; of the political organisation, it does not make the slightest difference; he just sheds that title for the time being and if he is an officer in the Army he assumes another title.  If he is an officer on permanent service all we ask him to do is his duty in accordance with military tradition.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether we should allow politics, wrangling and all that would be likely to follow the free discussion of politics as we know it&mdash; apart from the study of the science of government which is what they tell us politics is &mdash; the experience which we had during the emergency should be the best guide.  We had then in the Army men of different political viewpoints, some of them as far apart as the poles; yet they stood there side by side ready to carry out any duty they were asked to perform.  I am certain that if the necessity had arisen they would have been prepared to stand shoulder to shoulder and fall together. That was because they shed their political viewpoints when they took the rifle.</P>
    <P>I think that, from the very valuable experience which we gained in that particular period, we should leave matters as they are.  Again, with regard to this particular section, I feel that no matter who occupies this position, he will adopt the common-sense attitude and that he will not delve into questions of how best he can inflict some particular penalty on these people to prevent them from doing this thing, that thing or the other thing. As somebody said here this evening, if they want to do these things, regulations will not stop them.  The best thing to do is to provide, as far as is humanly possible, that these things will not happen.  That is all we are doing in the Act.  When a man is called up on permanent service &mdash; which, somebody suggested, might only be for 24 <Col N="830" /> hours: and, if it is, it will not make a whole lot of difference: in fact it will not, either, if it it is to be for a couple of years &mdash; the political organisation of which he is a member will not collapse as a result of his being there.  So, the common sense of the whole matter is merely that, when the reservist is called out on permanent service, he becomes a soldier and sheds his political rank, still holding his political viewpoint as strongly as before.  As Deputy Cowan himself said, every possible help and aid that the Army themselves can give in guiding a man in respect to making his political decisions are available to him &mdash; which is a still further proof that this will not do any injustice to any individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had an interesting discussion on this matter. However, there is one point which I should just like to clarify, in the beginning. The Minister, in speaking, gave the impression that, within the Army, there are no political discussions or debates.  I should not like that impression to go abroad.  I can say with practical experience that I have never known anywhere in which there have been such violent political arguments as in the officers' mess and in the barrack rooms.  I interjected that it was in the Army that I learned, in so far as I know it, the science of government because, in all the years that I was there, we discussed politics in a very objective way.  People had their violent likes and dislikes in respect of individual leaders and individual Parties and they expressed those likes and dislikes with the force that only soldiers could.  I think that that is a wonderful thing to know.  I think it is only right and that it is only the practice of a civilised country.  Only the amadáns who are not disciplined, and who do not know the higher approaches, beat up one another about political views.  I think the same freedom should exist in the Army as exists in this House.  We discuss politics here rather violently from time to time, but if the country were in a state of emergency, everybody knows that no matter how violent one's political likes or dislikes might be we would all stand shoulder to shoulder in the national <Col N="831" /> interest.  I think it is wrong to think that the very same high standards of conduct do not apply in the Army as apply in this House and throughout the country generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Reserve can be, might be, 100,000 of our very best citizens.  I think we will always desire to see the situation in which 100,000 of our young men, say, between 20 and 30 years would be members of the Reserve.  It would be very wrong if anyone had the view or the conception that those people should be compelled to leave their political organisations or to disengage from what, from the national interest, would be harmless political activity.  Even to-day, in every barrack-room of the Army, even at this minute in the canteens and messes of the Army, they are probably discussing the Defence Forces Bill &mdash; perhaps on a higher level than we are discussing it here, and with much more power and force.  They have their political views and they express them strongly. They have the honour of their country, of their unit, of their brigade or of their command at heart.  Nobody bothers, when they are on duty, on the march or preparing for action, what the political views of his comrade may be.  It is a remarkable thing that it is in the retired soldiers that one finds such a very objective approach to problems of politics.  I think Deputy General MacEoin did express his high conception of this particular merit of the Army.  We know the football team. The members of the football team can have the most violent political differences but when they go out to play a match they go out to win.  It is not just a question of passing the ball to the Fine Gael member or the Fianna Fáil member or the Labour member or any other particular member of the team: they play as a team and in the team's interests &mdash; and the Army plays as a team in the country's interests, just as we in this Dáil, with our very widespread differences, do our best in the national interest.  We have heard talk about the Captain holding one view, the Lieutenant another view and the Second Lieutenant another view again.  That is commonplace every day <Col N="832" /> in the Army and particularly at election times.</P>

      <P>Yes, the ballot papers are interesting to examine when they are received.  The Minister has agreed with the views which Deputy General MacEoin and I have expressed in regard to the different conceptions we have about politics.  It is because I am afraid that we would bring into legislation the old and the bad meaning of politics that I do not agree with the clause that is here in the Minister's section.  Nobody knows better than the Minister that, in the old days, to be national was to be political and that when you wanted a hall for a meeting for a national purpose from certain people who controlled the hall you were told that politics would not be permitted &mdash; and it is that line of reasoning right through.  It was political to be national and against the invading authority.  Politics were taboo and debarred.  I am afraid that it is that particular complaint of politics that is behind this particular phrase.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Adjournment Debate &mdash; Price of Malting Barley.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he would state whether, in view of the reduction in the price of malting barley from 84/- per barrel to 63/9 per barrel, which represents 1d. per pint of stout the consumers of stout and <Col N="833" /> porter may expect to receive the benefit of this reduction.  The Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am informed that the price paid for malting barley of the 1953 crop was 66/9 per barrel delivered. The price of barley is only one of the factors concerned and there is no prospect of a reduction in the price of intoxicating liquor by reason only of the reduction in the price of barley.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We farmers have been accustomed for a long time to be told by all Governments to use up-to-date methods; to till the land more efficiently, to increase production and to reduce the cost of production so as to reduce prices.  If we succeed in reducing the cost of production, we expect that that reduction will be passed on to the consumer. The history of this barley question goes back a considerable number of years.  I do not intend to go back very far in reviewing it but I would say that in 1950-51, owing to the fact that the representatives of barley growers put a clause in their agreement binding the brewers to pay them 2/6 per barrel over the average price paid for malting barley in Britain, we got a pretty considerable increase.  In 1950 the price of barley went up from 57/6 to 84/-, being an increase of 26/6 per barrel.  In December, 1951, the brewers went to the Advisory Body, which they were entitled to do, and got permission to increase the price of stout by 1d. per pint to pay them for the increase in the price of barley.</P>
      <P>Changes have taken place since then. The price of barley fell gradually.  It fell to 70/-, from that, not to 66/9, but to 55/6, and for the coming year it is down to 62/6, on the same basis as the 84/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking an average of 1,000,000 barrels of barley, which is the amount bought for malting purposes in this country, the brewers received, after getting their price on the basis of 84/-, £700,000.  In the year before last, on the price paid to farmers, they got £925,000 more and in the coming year they will get £1,775,000 extra.  That represents over £2,500,000 which in <Col N="834" /> my opinion should be passed on to the consumer.  That is only just.  There is no use in the producer reducing the cost of production if that reduction is not passed on to the consumer.  There is no use in our giving a present to the manufacturer of a couple of million pounds.</P>
    <P>In 1952 the profits of one brewer were £5,142,000.  In 1953 that profit went up to £5,681,000&mdash;an increase of close on £500,000.  Should that £500,000 go back to the man who drinks the pint or should it not?  I consider that we are entitled to demand that it should.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should get the same prices control gentlemen who gave the brewers the penny to take it back again and let that penny be passed on to the consumer.  We would probably gain from that reduction because there would be an increased market for barley.  It is evident that in the coming year there will be an increase in demand of 15 to 18 per cent.  Farmers have received some pretty hard knocks from those gentlemen, the users of malting and distilling barley in this country.  We had nobody to help us.  In the case of distillers, the barley that they buy this year will not be sold for at least seven years, in the form of seven-year-old whiskey.  Last year those gentlemen, out of what I call vindictiveness, reduced the contract acreage by close on 50 per cent.  That was in respect of barley that they would not be selling for seven or eight years.  That is the sort of treatment farmers receive from big business in this country.  I suggest to the Minister that the case should be put before the Prices Advisory Body. They are the people to judge on the figures I have given here.  The figures show that in 1952 the reduction in the price of barley meant that the growers and maltsters got £700,000 extra which was not passed on to the consumer; that last year they had £925,000 extra which was not passed on to the consumer either.  Those two alone, put together &mdash; we cannot count what they are going to get this year&mdash;come to £1,500,000.  One cwt. of barley produces a standard barrel of beer, which is 36 gallons.  On the agreement made <Col N="835" /> this year for 52/6 as compared with 84/- there is just a clear 1d. a pint.  I suggest that should be passed on. They passed on nothing for the past two years.  They have got two years' profit.  Let them give it to the consumer of beer and relieve the burden. If we farmers see that the State is doing its duty in passing on to the consumer any reduction we can give in the cost of raw materials, it will encourage farmers to produce more on those grounds.</P>
    <P>That is the case.  It is with reluctance I come in to raise anything on an Adjournment debate, but this case is so clear that it deserves the Minister's attention.  On the advice of his Prices Advisory Body, he allowed these people to increase the price of beer, but now when the price of barley on which they made their case, is reduced, the price of beer should be reduced also.  If we find, on the other hand, that every reduction we succeed in giving on the price of the raw materials is not going to be passed on but is going to be used in some other manner, we farmers will know where we stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to say very much about this, because any information I have on the production cost of beer or on the way it is influenced by the price of barley, has been given to me in my official capacity in confidence and I am not at liberty to disclose it.  When the brewers applied for an increase in the price of beer in 1951, I decided that the Prices Advisory Body should be asked to hold a public inquiry into the application. The Prices Advisory Body declined to do so, for good reasons, including the reasons why I am not at liberty to discuss the matter in any detail here.  I may say, however, that, from the information available to me, the conclusions reached by Deputy Corry as to the effect of variations in the price of barley upon manufacturing costs of beer are completely inaccurate.  It is well known that other costs are involved. Materials other than barley are used in the production of beer. <Col N="836" /> There are manufacturing costs, which vary from time to time, as do also distribution costs, and all these have to be taken into account in determining what a reasonable price is.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry quoted here profit figures for Messrs.  Guinness.  I do not know whether he himself thinks, or whether he merely wants the Dáil to believe, that the figures he quoted represent the profits made by Messrs. Guinness by the sale of beer in this country.  They do not.  The figures he quoted represent the profits earned by Messrs.  Guinness in trade all over the world, including their trade in Britain, America and everywhere else.  They give no indication whatever of the results of their activities in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another factor, and it is an important one.  Even though, upon the basis of published profits, it might conceivably be possible for that firm to reduce the price of beer, it is certain that if they did so every other brewery in the country would close down.  It would not be possible to have the price of one class of beer reduced and the prices of other beers maintained at their present level.  They would not be sold.  Everyone knows that the position of other breweries is quite precarious &mdash; so precarious that the Government in 1952 had to make special tax concessions to keep them in existence. I do not know if Deputy Corry would regard it as in the interest of Irish farmers that all other sources of supply of beer, and consequently those other outlets for barley, should be eliminated, but that would be the result of altering the present price. These other breweries are small in relation to Messrs.  Guinness, but nevertheless they are important industries in various parts of the country.  There are two breweries in Cork, of which Deputy Corry is aware, there is an important brewery in Kilkenny and another in Drogheda, and several smaller ones throughout the country. The Government decided it was good policy that these should be kept in existence, to the extent even of granting tax concessions for the purpose.  It would be foolish now to force a reduction in the price of beer &mdash; which an <Col N="837" /> alteration in cost would not justify &mdash; if the only effect we got were to close down every brewery in the country except one.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be quite certain of this, that when there are reductions in total manufacturing and distribution costs which would justify a reduction in the price of beer, that reduction <Col N="838" /> will be effected.  The information available to me satisfies me completely that these reductions have not yet taken place.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.50 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 24th February, 1954.</P>
