      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of the fundamental provisions of the Constitution, he will consider the introduction of proposals for legislation specifically repealing the statutory or other law under which citizens of this State arrested in Ireland are transferred in custody to Great Britain; if he will state whether such transfers have included children; and, if so, what steps are taken to safeguard such children during their journey to Great Britain and their stay abroad.</P>

      <P>The reciprocal enforcement of warrants as between this country and Britain is regulated by statutory provisions which have the force of law in both countries and have been specifically held by the Irish courts not to be inconsistent with the Constitution.  Whether some other arrangement might not be better is, of course, a matter of opinion, but I think we should be very slow to upset an arrangement which has stood the test of time and has given so little cause for complaint over so long a period.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last part of the question, I know of only two cases in which children or young persons were involved and in each case the persons concerned were treated with the greatest possible consideration by the police and judicial authorities in Britain where, as is well known, there are excellent arrangements for safeguarding the interests of juvenile offenders at all stages from arrest onwards.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the price payable to producers for eggs has fallen to 1/6 per dozen as a result of which farmers in many parts of the country have been forced to dispose of laying hens with resultant injury to the entire poultry industry; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that the egg markets have improved and that producers are now obtaining up to 2/- per dozen for eggs and more in some districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that during the month <Col N="1290" /> of January when egg prices were very low there was a tendency amongst poultry keepers to dispose of hens. This however could be all to the good if those hens were old and uneconomic.</P>
    <P>As the egg market is free the price to producers, now that eggs are available for export, will be determined by the prices made in Great Britain.  In order to obtain the best possible prices there it is essential that we market only the highest quality eggs and, furthermore, that producers must make every endeavour to reduce their costs of production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that what I said here yesterday, together with what has been said by Deputies MacEoin, de Valera and Colley should be enough to convince any reasonable person of the necessity for this particular section in the Bill. Before dealing with some of the points in regard to the individual paragraphs I would like to make it absolutely clear that there is no question of this section, or indeed any other section in the Bill, being forced on the Army against its will.  Since the discussions which took place at the Special Committee this Bill has been re-examined by the appropriate military authorities&mdash;the highest officers who could be procured <Col N="1299" /> to examine it&mdash;as well as the legal authorities, and all these responsible officers of long experience, men who have had years of experience in handling matters of discipline and so on, are satisfied that the action which it is proposed to take in regard to the insertion of this section in the Bill is necessary from the viewpoint of the military authorities and that there should be some provision for dealing with matters of this kind in the future.</P>
      <P>As to the individual provisions in the section.  I do not think that anyone studying these sections&mdash;now I am talking about the ordinary man in the street&mdash;would have any great difficulty in interpreting to his own satisfaction the meaning of these sections, nor do I think that he would have any great difficulty in giving meanings to the words that Deputy Cowan picked out specially to ridicule&mdash;because I think that is the only word that would meet the particular case.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I can say that I have the viewpoint of the man in the street on the meaning of these particular words.  I do not think that any Deputy would have any difficulty, for instance, in interpreting the words &ldquo;utmost exertion&rdquo;.  If two persons are pulling a cart it is very easy for the ordinary man looking at these people to know that one of them is what is commonly known as &ldquo;swinging the lead&rdquo; while the other man is pulling his weight.  I think that is as good an illustration of the meaning of &ldquo;using his utmost exertion&rdquo; as anyone could desire.  It means using the greatest possible effort in relation to the particular circumstances at the time.  That is, as I understand it, the literal meaning of the expression.  The meaning which I have given is I suggest the meaning that would occur to the mind of any ordinary person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan also dwelt for a considerable time on paragraph (b) of the section.  I think the word he fastened on there was &ldquo;courageously&rdquo;.  He wanted to know who would be the judge of what was courageous and he gave us a dissertation on courage, cowardice, and so on.  I think myself <Col N="1300" /> that an officer or brother officers in the field would very quickly sense what was cowardice as against what was courage.  We have all had the experience of being present at football matches and of seeing one player being outstandingly courageous in respect to his tackling, going up for the ball, getting out of the ruck, and so forth, whereas we may see others who are not so anxious or who are drawing back. These are the ordinary things of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the people who get the international medals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the simplest explanation of what courage means. Courage, I suppose, connotes ability to endure hardships as well as to carry out courageous acts.  One does not have to, as Deputy Cowan suggested, run in front, waving a sword to instil into the minds of onlookers that that is a courageous action.  That is not necessarily a courageous action; it may be a publicity stunt.  You can apply many descriptions to it but it is not necessarily a courageous action. The man who keeps his head, who keeps cool and who is in general an inspiration to the troops he is leading, can instil courage into the troops as well as being courageous himself without any of the show business that the man waving the sword would find it necessary to indulge in.  The point is that, after that long dissertation on courage, the Deputy knew very well although he spoke for 20 minutes on that section, that I was deleting it, deleting it to meet the views put up by the Special Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan was also very anxious to know what was the meaning of &ldquo;known friend.&rdquo;  He seemed to think that there would be considerable difficulty in interpreting the term &ldquo;known friend&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, if one were required to go to the assistance of a &ldquo;known friend,&rdquo; how was one to know who was a &ldquo;known friend.&rdquo;  The only explanation I can give of that is that generally in the Army a friend is known as a person who is friendly-disposed and the use of the word &ldquo;friend&rdquo; is common in Army parlance.  A sentry will shout: &ldquo;Halt, who goes there?&rdquo;  If you are <Col N="1301" /> wise enough, you will say: &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; meaning that you are not against him. He will probably then ask you &ldquo;Advance, friend, to be recognised&rdquo; and if he is satisfied that you are a friend all will be well and you can pass on your way.  My interpretation of the term &ldquo;known friend&rdquo; is a person who is on your side and who is not against you.  He may be a member of your own Army in an isolated position, fighting under great difficulties and the Bill suggests that it will be the duty of an officer to go to the aid of a known friend.  It might be possible that even civilians fighting or doing their utmost to give their aid to the Army would be known as friends, and it might be desirable for the Army to give relief to these known friends.  These are the only explanations which I can give in relation to the simple words that have been picked out, examined, parsed and their meanings sought.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan also selected another word.  He described it as a word with a lyrical meaning or as a lyrical word. That is the word &ldquo;forsake&rdquo;.  There, again, we know what meaning the ordinary man in the street would put on &ldquo;forsake&rdquo; and Deputy Cowan knows it as well as anybody else.  The dictionary meaning of the word is as good as any; it is &ldquo;to leave entirely&rdquo;, &ldquo;to abandon,&rdquo;&ldquo;to withdraw from.&rdquo; Perhaps as good as any meaning would be &ldquo;to desert&rdquo; but the fact is that it is an all-embracing word.  To &ldquo;forsake&rdquo; is to &ldquo;abandon&rdquo;, to &ldquo;leave entirely&rdquo; or to &ldquo;withdraw from&rdquo;.  In other words, its simple meaning is to desert.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan also referred, I thought somewhat belittlingly, to the paragraph dealing with aircraft.  We know that Deputy Cowan has a great regard for the regulations which govern the British armed forces.  He believes that these are the sanest regulations that he has come across but he has very little use for the Canadian regulations which we are following to a certain extent in this Bill.  We are using them because we believe they suit us down to the ground.  In fact, we are a very much younger nation from the point of view of being free <Col N="1302" /> and independent than the Canadians, but they, too, are building up and, as I said before, they provide as good an example to follow as any other.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy Cowan is aware of this fact&mdash;that the British have an Air Force Act and in that Act &mdash;I think it is Section 4, paragraph (10)&mdash;he will find this quotation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every person subject to this Act who commits any of the following offences, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(10)  when ordered by his superior officer or otherwise under orders to carry out any warlike operation in the air, treacherously or shamefully&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>now I could imagine Deputy Cowan parsing these two words and getting quite a kick out of it for some time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;fails to use his utmost exertion to carry such orders into effect,</P>
    <P>shall on conviction by court-martial be liable to suffer death or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that it will come somewhat as a surprise to Deputy Cowan to find that there is at least one section of a British regulation covering their armed forces which makes use of the words &ldquo;utmost exertion&rdquo; and also uses the words &ldquo;treacherously or shamefully&rdquo;. I think it would be as difficult to say whether something done in the air was &ldquo;treacherous&rdquo; or whether it was &ldquo;shameful&rdquo; as it would be to say whether a man was using his &ldquo;utmost exertion&rdquo;.  It is merely playing with words.  Witnesses of the incidents would, I think, be the best judges as to whether a thing was &ldquo;shameful&rdquo; or &ldquo;treacherous,&rdquo; whether it was courageous or cowardly.  These are the things we will have to rely on, and I want to impress on Deputy Cowan that it is not some civil servant who will be in the field spying on the officers who are in action.  It will be one of his own officers who will report on the fact that the act was cowardly or otherwise within the meaning of the section which we are inserting.  The charge on which the men would be tried would be based on that.  He <Col N="1303" /> would be tried by a court of his own colleagues, officers, one of whom at least would be not lower in rank to himself, together with four others. There would be a judge advocate there to ensure that justice would be done and at the end of all that, if he was sentenced to death, and the possibility is not always there that he will be sentenced to death&mdash;it is to my mind a very remote possibility&mdash;but if the supreme penalty should be inflicted as a result of the court-martial, the sentence has to be confirmed by somebody else.  There is a confirming authority, but I think in respect of the death sentence the Deputy will find in a later section of the Act that the sentence will have to be approved by the Government and that means that 11 or 12 or more men will sit down and after very serious contemplation and consideration decide whether that sentence should be carried out or not.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also discussed the question of State ships and he seemed to think that because our ships were small ships they could in certain circumstances find themselves in a battle position and as a result of finding themselves in that battle position that some of these acts could be committed by the officers in charge.  All I say to that is that I think it is good foresight to include a section dealing with the naval service, which, as the Deputy knows full well, is part of the Defence Forces as much as any other unit of the Army.  If we had no ships at all, if we did not have a single vessel that could be described in any sense as a naval vessel I still think it would be good foresight to endeavour as far as possible to ensure that, should we at any future time get vessels, we would have that clause there to deal with personnel in charge of those vessels.</P>
    <P>To show that Deputy Cowan is not keeping up with current events and that it is only a passing interest I will refer to what he said about&mdash;I think he mentioned the Zulus and Omdurman and some other places&mdash;and suggested that this type of battle does not happen any more.  I think he must have been thinking in terms of atomic <Col N="1304" /> warfare rather than the type of warfare that existed in the past in these particular places.  It is a peculiar thing, but the very latest war that has taken place on this earth was a war in which hand-to-hand fighting was the order of the day and in which men struggled against each other for a gain of 50 or perhaps 100 yards.  They fought with dagger-like weapons and with butts of rifles, as well as with all these other high-powered weapons. The fact remains that that was the position in the last war.  I believe that it is a position that will obtain as long as war endures and as long as civilisation is foolish enough to fight wars.  It will always be necessary for the infantry to consolidate positions that are won perhaps by means of long-distance weapons or as a result of the use of long-distance planes or even the atomic weapon.  When we get down to the common sense of the whole thing you will find that the old foot-slogger will be there at the finish.  I only mention that to point out that in at least one of his references Deputy Cowan was not quite correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped there might be somebody else interested in this matter of the execution of citizens of the country.  I took it that in a matter such as this question of executing people for offences that are not known to the criminal law of this country we might have some Deputies in the House other than the Minister, General MacEoin, Deputy McQuillan, Major de Valera, Deputy Colley and myself to take part in the discussion.</P>
      <P>But, apparently, the matter of the life or death of our commanders is of very little concern to the House, and so what I term &ldquo;this murderous section,&rdquo; because that is what it is, is going to be passed without any objection from anybody who knows anything about the principles of law under the civil, military or criminal code.  I feel, looking at the whole problem, that as a House we are deteriorating from the point of view of our responsibilities to the people who sent us here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> Here we have a section which says that on a matter of opinion, individuals can be sent to their death, and nobody gives a damn in this House whether they are sent to their deaths or not.  I am very worried about the matter.  I asked the Minister specifically to give to the House some indications of the considerations that would apply, or of the evidence that might be adduced, for the purpose of having a man shot, an officer, a commanding officer, in whom confidence had been reposed.  I asked for some examples, and I have got not one example of the circumstances in which a man might be sentenced to death.</P>
    <P>We had the contribution from Deputy MacEoin, who said: &ldquo;Look at the section; are these things offences?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I am not worried about the punishment,&rdquo; but &ldquo;look at the section; are these things offences,&rdquo; and if they are offences, in a period of active service, well, perhaps, death is the right thing. Deputy Vivion de Valera, who has taken a very sound line on all this matter of the Defence Forces Bill, said: &ldquo;Well, we must look at it that this is a question of active service.&rdquo; Deputy Colley says: &ldquo;When I listened to this argument I thought I was listening to an argument about the legal meaning of words and we forget it is active service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister had certain criticisms of my approach to the section but no defence of the section, because, in my submission, there is no defence to this section, and so there is nobody in this House who could defend this section. Deputy McQuillan has taken the line that, very well, it may be in the Canadian Act.  But the Canadians, because of their Constitution, because of the different races that occupy their country and because they have compulsory service in it, may find that it is necessary to have a section such as this, but it does not apply to us because of our history and our traditions. I will come to that later.  The Minister says that the Army authorities are quite satisfied.  I will come to that aspect afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

      <P>Everything that is in the 1923 Act is reinstated in Section 124 of this Bill, but Section 123 of this Bill, which we are discussing, is something new, something that struck the imagination of somebody in the Department of Defence.  They read the Canadian Act as being a good thing to bring in here, a nice thing to bring in here, something that is contrary to our conception of law entirely.  Section 123 of the Bill refers to every officer.  It does not specifically segregate commanders from any other officer.  The 1923 Act applies to every officer.  In fact, I am not sure if it does not apply to every person subject to military law.  In fact, Section 32 of that Act does apply to every person subject to military law whether an officer, a soldier, corporal or sergeant-major. If he behaves in a treacherous manner on active service, he can be sentenced to death.  That is what is in the 1923 Act.  The whole of those provisions are reinstated in Section 124 of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the question was put forward.  I want Deputy O'Donnell to read paragraph (a) of Section 123:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;. . who, when under orders to carry out an operation of war or on coming into contact with an enemy that it is his duty to engage, does not use his utmost exertion to bring the officers and men under his command ... into action.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am making is that there is no allegation of a specific offence there.  The matter is left to the opinion of certain officers and it is they who will decide as to whether or not the individual concerned used his utmost exertion.  I am very keen to have Deputy O'Donnell's opinion on this section because he is a lawyer.  The first one is not in the 1932 Act to which the Minister referred; neither is it in the Air Force Act, which I will deal with later, where there are the qualifying words &ldquo;treacherously or shamefully&rdquo; which, from the point of view of the lawyer, ensure that there are certain mental attributes necessary to establish a particular charge.  Under the 1932 Act the offence is one of <Col N="1308" /> endeavouring to persuade, induce or compel a person to commit an offence. Now we all know what that means. The offence of unjustifiably surrendering, yielding or abandoning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the same thing.  On the matter of whether it is justifiable or not, the Minister agreed in subsequent sub-sections to the request of the Special Committee to put in the word &ldquo;unjustifiably&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;improperly&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;unjustifiably&rdquo; does not come into this section. Under this section the whole point is: did he or did he not use his utmost exertion?  I would like Deputy O'Donnell to answer this question: if Deputy O'Donnell was defending a man on that charge, what defence would he offer?  What would be his basis of assessment of the phrase &ldquo;his utmost exertion&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>That is so, but I was diverted into this line by the question put to me by Deputy O'Donnell and I am very anxious that he should understand the view I hold in relation to this particular section. The Minister, in reply, has dealt with the meaning of &ldquo;utmost exertion&rdquo;. He referred to the two men pulling the cart; he also referred to the individual who is swinging the lead.  That was his answer on the basis of someone not using his utmost exertion.  As Deputy O'Donnell will agree, this constitutes a very serious charge against an individual.</P>

      <P>The result may be doubtful, but the constituents of the offence are not doubtful.  Everybody knows what the constituents of murder are.  The constituents of treason are laid down.  The constituents of housebreaking are laid down.  It is not left to the court to decide what housebreaking is, what treason is or-what murder is.  The constituents of all these are laid down by statute.  Here we do not say what using his utmost exertion constitutes.  We leave the term absolutely wide.  We leave it to the court to decide the law; to decide if the person charged has broken that law as the court understands it; and, thirdly, to decide whether or not he shall be sentenced to death.  That is my difficulty in regard to this matter and the Minister has not answered it.</P>

The Minister said&mdash;I took a note of it&mdash; when ordered by his superior officer to carry out any air operation.  The important thing is that the two words &ldquo;treacherously&rdquo; or &ldquo;shamefully&rdquo; are embodied in that particular instance; treacherously or shamefully fails to use his utmost exertion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall come to that.  At present I am answering the Minister's criticism and the Minister's question, that in the British Air Force Act they have a section which is similar in which they use the two words that are in this, &ldquo;utmost exertion&rdquo;, but in the British Air Force Act &ldquo;utmost exertion&rdquo; is coupled with the two words &ldquo;treacherously or shamefully.&rdquo; From the ordinary interpretation of that, a person who does a thing treacherously does it with very evil intent and, if he does it shamefully, there is the same evil intent.  I classify this offence as becoming one of the criminal laws of this country, because anything that involves a man in losing his life is certainly a criminal law and a criminal punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy refer to the words &ldquo;duty to engage&rdquo;? If he does not do his duty, he has done something shameful or treacherous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the <Col N="1312" /> point.  The point is that he does carry out his duty of engaging the enemy, but the allegation is that he does not do it to his utmost exertion.  It does not say that he refuses to do it or neglects to do it, as the Minister suggests in his amendment, but that he does not do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>But if he is ordered to go into action and does not do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is ordered to go into action and does not do it, he refuses to obey an order.  This section says when ordered</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to carry out an operation of war or on coming into contact with an enemy that it is his duty to engage does not use his utmost exertion to bring the officers and men under his command ... into action.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the allegation.  It does not say that he does not go into action, but that he does not use his utmost exertion to bring his command, as it were, into action.  If that is done treacherously and if it is done shamefully, then I can see the ground for charging the man; I can see the evidence that may be produced against him and I can see the defence open to him, that his action, whatever it was, was neither shameful nor treacherous. That is why I say that if the words &ldquo;shameful or treacherous&rdquo; were in this section we would know where we stood and the particular officer would have a defence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but what I want Deputy O'Donnell to understand is that when we have an offence of that kind, where it is a simple matter of deciding did he use his utmost exertion or did he not, the officers comprising the court have, first and foremost, to make the law.  They have to say that it would be proper for a commanding officer to do certain things in this particular eventuality; they have to set up what the standard of the law is.  The next thing they have to do is to say: &ldquo;This man did not do that, therefore he is guilty of an <Col N="1313" /> offence against the law that we laid down&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell knows that when he goes into any court he does not go into the district justice to determine the law.  The law is there binding the district justice and the law is there binding a judge of the Central Criminal Court and binding the jury, and the jury have to find the facts which, if proved, mean that the person is guilty of a particular offence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section which has no other purpose than to provide scapegoats for something that goes wrong.  In other words, if something goes wrong in a military action, this section enables a scapegoat to be found, a scapegoat to be taken into custody, a scapegoat to be tried and a scapegoat to be executed.  That is all this section does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The very fact that I can come to that view of what the section means shows the danger of this section, because it is entirely at large. I have asked the Minister to say, but he has not done it, what would be the circumstances in which a particular commander might be charged under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give an instance which has just occurred to me.  Supposing there is a commander&mdash;and any man in charge of troops is a commander, even though he is described as an officer&mdash;who is in contact with an enemy, a position could arise where such an officer will be ordered to attack <Col N="1314" /> an enemy position.  He may be in a very safe position when he gets the order and he may, through some subterfuge, delay and continue to delay in carrying out the order until such time as the enemy has perhaps got into a position which it would be impossible to get him out of, and the result of the failure of that officer to carry out that order instantly might be the cause, not only of losing a valuable position, but of losing the lives of perhaps 100 soldiers.  That is an instance of where a man would not be doing his utmost endeavour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>He might only attack with his advance guard instead of bringing up his main body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to argue with Deputy Cowan, because he thinks he is always right, because neither I nor anybody else can convince him that an argument put forward is a good one.  The instance I have cited is only one of numerous instances of that type that could occur where an officer would deliberately delay carrying out an instruction because of the danger he saw in carrying it out, whereas his superior might believe that, if the position were stormed, even with loss of life, the day might be saved.  The delay of that officer would be a case in which he did not use his utmost endeavour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not blame me for a natural human characteristic, that I always try to be right.  I do not mean to say that I am always right, but I think it applies to all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  When one assumes the position that one is right, naturally one has to assume that everybody else is wrong, but I do not think that is a ground of criticism. What I want the Minister to understand is this, that the argument he advances is sound in so far as it goes if there were no provision made in the Act for the case that the Minister and Deputy O'Donnell have just cited. But if they will look at sub-section (i) <Col N="1315" /> of Section 124 they will see that every person, whether an officer or not, who, when ordered to carry out an operation of war, fails to use his utmost exertion to carry the orders into effect may be court-martialled and can be sentenced to death.  I am not opposing common sense or reason in regard to that, but when I see the very example the Minister has given provided specifically for in Section 124, and mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell&mdash;that he is ordered to carry out an operation of war and fails to use his utmost exertion to carry his orders into effect&mdash;when I see that provided for very clearly and distinctly, I come back to asking what is the necessity for Section 123 (a).</P>

It was mentioned here last night that they fought wars every year in that period and they never had to introduce a section like Section 123 nor did they see the necessity for such a section. Anybody who knows and studies their constitution and their parliament knows that their parliament would not pass into law a section such as Section 123.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister has referred to the Air Force Act.  I want to refer Deputy O'Donnell to Section 124 (i) which is exactly the same as the Air Force Act&mdash;&ldquo;who when ordered to carry out an operation of war fails to use his utmost exertion to carry the orders into effect.&rdquo;  The Air Force Act which the Minister read said: &ldquo;When ordered by his superior officer.&rdquo;  I think that the Minister might read the full section again.  It refers probably to every person subject to air force law or every officer.  I do not know. I would just like to get the remainder of it.  I again apologise for my bad handwriting.  It says: &ldquo;When ordered by his superior officer to carry out any air&rdquo; and there is a word after that which might be &ldquo;any airlike operation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It says: &ldquo;Every person subject to this Act who is guilty of any of the following offences&rdquo;; then it says in sub-section (10) &ldquo;when ordered by his superior officer or otherwise under orders to carry out any warlike operation in the air, treacherously or shamefully fails to use his utmost exertions to carry such orders into effect&rdquo; shall on conviction and so on be liable to sentence of death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. Deputy O'Donnell will see that that section and Section 124 (i) are similar in effect, because, as the Minister says, the Air Act says that every person subject to military law who is ordered by his superior officer to carry out any warlike operation in the air&mdash;because, obviously, that is where they generally operate&mdash;who treacherously or shamefully fails to use his utmost exertion to carry out the orders of his superior officer may be sentenced to death.  Under Section 124, it says that every person subject to military law who, when ordered to carry out an operation of war, fails to use his utmost exertion to carry the orders into effect may be sentenced to death.  That is drafted exactly as it is in the Air Force Act, exactly as it is in the British Act dealing with airmen, <Col N="1317" /> and if that is so, why, then, should we bring in this Section 123, which applies only to commanders?  Because, whether he is a commander or is not, if he is given an order to carry out an operation of war and he fails to use his utmost exertion to carry the order into effect, then he is guilty of an offence for which he may be sentenced to death.  That being so, why, then, the necessity for Section 123 (a) which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;who when under orders to carry out an operation of war or on coming into contact with an enemy that it is his duty to engage, does not use his utmost exertion to bring the officers and men under his command or his ship, aircraft or other <i>matériel</i> into action&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I will insert the words which, in my view, do not alter the section.  The Minister's amendment is to insert &ldquo;negligently or through other default.&rdquo;  In other words, under the Minister's amendment it would read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;who, when under orders to carry out an operation of war or on coming into contact with an enemy that it is his duty to engage, does&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister will admit that on the Special Committee when this matter was discussed I was as entirely opposed to that section as I am now.  It was discussed upside down, and perhaps as a result of that the Minister decided to water down the section a bit by putting in the words &ldquo;negligently or through other default.&rdquo;  I want the section to be looked at from that point of view&mdash; that a person does not engage the enemy because of some negligence or default.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There are two parts to the section.  &ldquo;When under orders to carry out an operation of war&rdquo; is one part.  He is under orders to carry out an operation of war.  In other words, if his troops were to occupy Buncrana or some other part of the County Donegal and that he is under orders to do that, and through negligence or some other cause he does not use his utmost exertion to bring the officers under his command into action, he would be deemed guilty of an offence.  Again, the Minister will probably see on reading the section that way that there is something wrong there, because to carry out an operation of war it is not necessary to bring the troops of the command into action. I think that would be accepted, that you can carry out an operation of war without bringing your troops into action.  That is the first part.  The second part is that to which Deputy O'Donnell referred, that in going to meet an enemy that it is his duty to engage, he has not used his utmost exertion to bring the officers and men under his command into action.  As Deputy McQuillan said last night, that section may be of use or value in Canada but we have had nothing established up to the moment here to show any necessity for it and the only one example I have been able to get the Minister to give me was the one he just gave recently.  Section 124 (i) refers to the point he has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me again refer to the point that I was making at the beginning when Deputy O'Donnell asked his question <Col N="1319" />&mdash;that the whole thing is left entirely to be decided by a court-martial and that, having decided it, they can then decide whether the particular person is to be sentenced to death or not.  I make the point that this section has only one value, that it enables scapegoats to be found for a particular thing and that it enables the scapegoats to be executed.  There is no use in saying to me or to anybody else: &ldquo;Oh, these are his comrades.&rdquo;  I know that as far as the Army in Ireland is concerned there is, and has been for some time, a very high spirit of comradeship. I should always like to believe that that high spirit will continue but I have seen army officers in other countries in recent days taking particular decisions in regard to their comrades.  I have seen army officers taking action in regard to their comrades not so many years ago on the continent of Europe.  I have read of army officers carrying poisoned tablets with them and revolvers and handing them to their comrades telling them to do away with themselves.  That was only a couple of years ago.  A number of distinguished military officers were butchered by their comrades in that fashion.  It is no safeguard for me or for any officer in the Army that he is going to be tried by his comrades because unfortunately history proves that some of the worst things that can be done to military officers are done by their own comrades.  It is no defence or can be no justification to this section to say that you are going to have a particular individual tried by his peers.  I want to make sure that whatever goes into this Bill which will enable a man's life to be taken away will be placed in the Bill only when the offence for which he may lose his life is made clear and specific.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the House that under the criminal law of this country the general rule is that intent to do wrong is a necessary condition of liability.  That is fundamental; it is a necessary condition of liability that an accused person must have intent to do wrong.  That is why the British, with their conception of fair play and justice, in their Army Act put in the <Col N="1320" /> two words &ldquo;treacherously or shamefully&rdquo; so that it would be clearly established that if the person committed the offence he did it deliberately and with the intent to do wrong.  In these circumstances they said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If a court-martial finds that he had that intent, the intent to do wrong or to act treacherously or shamefully, then let him be sentenced to death if the court finds that he should be sentenced to death.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no such provision or safeguard in this section.  There is no law of that kind being laid down here. The officers of the court-martial are being given <i>carte blanche</i> to take a man's life away simply because they may be of the opinion that he did not do the right thing on a particular occasion.  As I said, it may be discovered afterwards that what was considered to be wrong when he did it was in fact right.  That is my objection to the section and to the insertion of the words &ldquo;negligently or through other default&rdquo;.  That does not bring about the condition of liability that should exist if a man's life is to be taken away.</P>
    <P>I was amazed last night when Deputy General MacEoin dealt with this section because generally speaking Deputy General MacEoin on matters of this kind takes a very sound and constructive view.  He asked the question: &ldquo;Do these sections show that an offence has been committed?  If they show that an offence has been committed the punishment does not matter.&rdquo;  That was his viewpoint.  He put up the point, too, that these were court-martial officers, that the accused was being tried by his peers and that there was no danger.  I think there is what you might term a revulsion in this country at the moment against capital punishment.  The ordinary person is against corporal punishment whether it is a civilian or a soldier that is involved.  I think the House will agree that the very fact that a man is commissioned in the forces of the State should not entitle anyone to take away that person's life more easily or more quickly than his life <Col N="1321" /> could be taken away by the civil authorities.  Only recently we had an example in the courts of this country where a person charged with the offence of murder was acquitted unanimously by the jury that tried the case. That, to me, shows that there is among the ordinary citizens of the country a revulsion against capital punishment.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan took the same line on the section that I took.  His experience of the Defence Forces shows there is no necessity for this section, and that a section enabling a man's life to be taken should only be inserted in an Act of Parliament for the very gravest of reasons.  If those grave reasons are there and if they are explained to Parliament, Parliament will, if it thinks the situation demands it, give the Minister and the Government the power that they ask for in regard to executions.  But where we propose to do as we are doing here, extending the law relating to capital punishment and enabling a man's life to be taken more easily than it can be taken at the moment, I think it is the duty of the Minister to explain the gravity of the situation and the necessity for the adoption of such a course as is here proposed in this section.</P>
    <P>The House knows that the Minister has said: &ldquo;We have followed the Canadian Act in this because we think it improves our Act.&rdquo;  That is the Minister's explanation&mdash;that it improves our Act&mdash;and he says that military authorities have examined this and while he does not say they approve of it, he says they have taken no objection to it.  I beg leave of the House to take the view that, in a serious and grave matter such as this is, it is not sufficient explanation for the House nor sufficient justification, when it can be established, as I have established in dealing with the particular point the Minister made, that there is ample authority in the Act to deal with the particular type of insubordination that he mentioned in his example.  Human life is something that ought to be protected and respected and it is our duty as a Parliament to see when we consider the situation is grave enough and serious enough that a man's life may be in jeopardy that that man's <Col N="1322" /> life can only be put into jeopardy if he is guilty of a specific offence of a treacherous or shameful kind such as they mention in the British Air Force Act and each and every one of us should use his utmost endeavour to ensure that a sub-section such as this is not passed into law which gives <i>ad lib.</i> to military courts-martial power to sentence one of their comrades to death.</P>
    <P>As I have hinted, in view of our experience in the last 25 years of the activities of military leaders and military officers in various countries it is vitally essential and important that they should not have the power of life or death over their own comrades or others unless in the very gravest circumstances and unless the offences which can bring about the death penalty are clear and specific and give no reason for doubt whatsoever.  I think that where we are dealing with a military Act such as this is and which, as General MacEoin said, is to be a permanent Act, and which may govern the Defence Forces of this State for many years, we should be very slow to extend powers of life and death and give those powers to persons who may in fact abuse them unless we have the strictest control over what they do.</P>
    <P>The Minister says there is a protection in that a sentence of death may not be carried out unless that sentence is confirmed by the Government.  In other words, if a person is sentenced to death by a military court-martial, that sentence must be confirmed by the Government.  That is what the Minister says and he adds that in those circumstances a Government consisting of 12 or more people would hardly carry out the sentence or allow the sentence to be carried out unless it was just that it should be done.  I would like the Minister to consider that.  I would like the House to consider that, and I would like the Minister and the House to consider if there have been in the history of this State circumstances in which military officers did in fact carry out executions and did insist that the Government would approve of the decision that they had come to to execute particular citizens.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> That is a part of our history that we must not close our eyes to.  Has it happened in the past that the Government have been compelled by threats to submit to the decision of military officers to carry out executions?  If that has happened in the past, can it happen in the future, and if it has happened in the past is it not our duty as a House to make sure that such a thing as that will not occur or happen in the future?  On a matter such as this, all that I can do as a Deputy of this House is to oppose it by all the means that are in my power, to oppose the giving of powers to military authorities, to our courts or to anybody else to execute persons unless the charges against those persons are clear and specific, and involve, on the part of the accused person, a definite intent to do wrong.  If a person does something and has not a criminal intent to do wrong, then I say that the power to execute that person should not be exercised and that it should not be permitted by this House to be exercised by anybody.</P>
    <P>I would be long sorry if it should be the view of this House that, because a person wears the uniform of his country, he can be sentenced to death much more easily and much more readily than the person who does not honour the State by serving it in uniform.  I have referred to the Minister's reply in which he simply says, in answer to my extensive examination, that there is no difficulty in interpreting what is in the section.  I say that I have difficulty in interpreting what is in the section, and that I personally do not know what this section means.  If I were asked by an accused person to advise him as to whether he was guilty of an offence under that section or not, I would have to tell him bluntly that I could not advise him, that it was entirely a matter for the five officers who tried him: that under the section they had the right to make the law and the right to interpret the law and that they had the right, having so made it, to sentence him to death.</P>
    <P>I say that we should not be in that position.  I say that there is great <Col N="1324" /> difficulty in interpreting that section. I asked the Minister to give an explanation of what the section meant. The Minister took two words out of the section, &ldquo;utmost exertion.&rdquo;  He said that he found in the British Air Force Act the words &ldquo;utmost exertion&rdquo;, and, therefore, there is no trouble as to what they mean.  But, as I have pointed out, in the Air Force Act they use the words &ldquo;treacherously and shamefully&rdquo;, in addition to the words &ldquo;not using his utmost exertion&rdquo;, so that there is no comparison between the two sections.</P>
    <P>The Minister has left the House in doubt as to what this means.  He says that there is no difficulty in giving a meaning to the words that are in the section, and that I have only adopted an attitude of ridicule for the section in my examination of it in this House. I want to admit frankly that I was so horrified by that section, I was so appalled by it, I made up my mind that, as far as I could, I would endeavour to have that section deleted from the Act.  I did adopt the two lines.  I examined it critically from the point of view of its meaning and interpretation, and I did throw as much ridicule as I could on the section. The Minister is perfectly right when he says that I ridiculed it.  I did, and I did it deliberately.  I think it is right that it should be ridiculed and held up to the ridicule of this House and of the country, because it is a section that is so completely contrary to our concepts of the fundamental principles of law that it ought not to be introduced into this or any other Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that, as far as he is concerned, he takes the point of view of the man in the street.  I submit, with respect, that where we are dealing with a section of this importance which concerns the lives of very many of our leading military officers, we cannot take the point of view of the man in the street, that the point of view of the man in the street is not a point of view that determines the meaning of a section which involves either life or death.</P>

      <P>I know, but the man in the street is not capable of interpreting a section such as this.  When I say that I mean no disrespect for the man in the street whose training in the interpretation of statutes would not enable him to know what a particular statute means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but the man in the street unfortunately is not the person whose duty it is to interpret the meaning of words in a statute.  Very often, as the Minister knows, some of our judges misinterpret the meaning of words in a statute, and it takes the Supreme Court of the country to decide what is the precise meaning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is an interesting point.  In the criminal law and in the civil law in certain cases the function of decision is left to the jury.  In a criminal case the 12 members of the jury must be unanimous.  In a civil case nine out of 12 will suffice. In relation to the respective functions as between judge and jury, the jury find the facts; the judge interprets the law.  The judge tells the jury what the law is and leaves it to the jury to say whether on the facts a particular person did or did not do certain things. The interpretation of the law is never left to the jury.  It is a matter for the judge and the jury is bound by law to accept the judge's interpretation of the law.  I think it will be agreed by everybody that that is perfectly reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a very interesting case.  The Minister has said that he takes the point of view of the man in the street as to what the meaning of these words &ldquo;utmost exertion&rdquo; is.  The peculiar thing is that in a court-martial, which is distinct from a trial by judge and jury, the five officers who comprise that court-martial are the judges of the law and the facts. The Minister has mentioned the judge-advocate. He has a specific function in a general court-martial.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>And I was replying to the point made by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he takes the view of the man in the street and I have pointed out that, as far as the ordinary criminal law is concerned, the legal meaning of words must be found by the judge.  In a court-martial the members of the court-martial are the judges both of the law and the facts.  The judge-advocate has particular functions but he has no say in the decision, good, bad or indifferent. There is that difference.  Where one is passing a Bill to be operated subsequently by a military court there should be no doubt whatsoever as to meaning of words because that Bill, if it passes into law, will subsequently have to be interpreted by people who have no knowledge of legal niceties or legal interpretation.  In the interpretation of statutes the man in the street's point of view may not be, and very often is not, the correct legal point of view.  The Bill will be interpreted by officers who will have no knowledge of law and for that reason there should be no doubt as to what words mean.  This section should only be passed by the House if it is absolutely precise and leaves no ground for doubt or indecision as to its meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will become part of the <Col N="1327" /> major criminal law of the State.  It will affect men's lives.  In criminal law intent to do wrong is a necessary condition of liability.  There is nothing in this section to show intent. The words in the British Air Force Act &ldquo;treacherously or shamefully&rdquo; do enable intent to be established.  The words proposed to be inserted by the Minister here, &ldquo;negligently or through other default,&rdquo; do not bring about that necessary condition of liability.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister proposes to delete sub-section (b) because that sub-section could give rise to impossible situations and difficulties.  I am only sorry the Minister has not taken the courageous step of deleting the entire section.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to sub-section (c) and I regret that the House has not had the benefit of examples of cases where an officer&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;who, when capable of making a successful defence, surrenders his ship, aircraft, vehicle, defence establishment, <i>matériel</i> or unit to the enemy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I referred last night to the old rule of war where, when a defence was made by a garrison and that garrison was subsequently overcome by the enemy, it was the right of the enemy commander to put the garrison to the sword if he was satisfied they had made an unnecessary defence; in other words, if he was of the opinion that they defended stubbornly when they had no hope and, by doing so, brought about the unnecessary deaths of the attackers.  I would have liked to have had the Minister's view as to what constitutes a successful defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>What does capable of making a successful defence mean? During the last world war many of us were interested in Tobruk.  One day it was defended; the next day it surrendered. The next day it was defended by another force; and the day after that it surrendered again. So far nobody has been brought before a court-martial and charged with surrendering <Col N="1328" /> that particular defence establishment at a time when it was capable of making a successful defence. It would have been interesting from the historical point of view if the Minister had given the House examples of such charges, of the evidence adduced to support the charges, the evidence adduced against the charges and the ultimate decision. I am sure the Minister would have available to him in the military library particulars of charges such as this, and the results of those charges.  I said earlier that I look on this section as a section which can be used for the purpose of making scapegoats.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that this sub-section (c) is a typical section that could be used either by the military authorities or by the Government for the purpose of finding a scapegoat, some person on whom they could place the blame for some particular ill happening. I was anxious that the House should have the help of the Minister in reciting from historical records whether it was necessary or not to impose such a penalty as is provided for in this section.  As the Minister said, the operative word is the word &ldquo;capable&rdquo;.  As to whether a particular commanding officer is capable of making a successful defence or not, that rests on the decision of the court-martial that tries him.  I made the general point that in producing this section the draftsmen were completely out of line with military development and with modern military means of communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, at no stage during the last world war was any one of the Governments which took part in the war out of touch with even the smallest <Col N="1329" /> garrison in the various parts of the world.  The time has long passed, because of modern means of communication, when the responsibility as to whether he will surrender or not is left to the decision of the commander on the spot.  The commander on the spot in all cases keeps in touch with his superior authority by radio or some other method of communication and, generally speaking, the commanding authority is in a position to decide whether there should or should not be a surrender.</P>
    <P>Even in the case of Stalingrad, where the German general did, in fact, surrender, he was urged up to the last moment by his own superior authority not to surrender.  He has not been brought to trial in regard to that; circumstances, perhaps, have made that impossible.  But the fact is that, if it were possible to have court-martialled him in the period before the war ended, he would very likely have been sentenced to death and very likely have been executed, whilst history since would have justified his action in surrendering.</P>
    <P>The main point I want to make is that we are here creating a situation which may involve the life of an innocent man and we are doing it almost cheerfully in this House.  As it happens, only Deputy McQuillan and myself have opposed this section.  Our opposition to it has resulted in certain alterations which the Minister proposes, but I feel that with a proper sense of responsibility this House would not agree to the insertion in the statute law of the country of a provision such as this.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to deal with this, as the Minister said yesterday, to make the section look ridiculous. That is one of the ways of dealing with a section such as this.  But I have also endeavoured to deal with it in as serious a way as I could, and for the purpose of showing how dangerous a provision such as this is, how unjust and unfair it may be, and I think it will be very little use to the particular commander who is executed that Army officers who study the history of the time subsequently discover that he <Col N="1330" /> was right and that the people who sentenced him to death and executed him were wrong.  That is the trouble in regard to the whole section, that it is not in regard to overt acts, in which there is a deliberate intent to do wrong.  Offences are created here which depend entirely on the mind and view of the court-martial as to whether they are in fact offences or not and whether they bring about the death penalty.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Deputy MacEoin make the point that the penalty provided here is death or any lesser punishment awardable by a court-martial. Deputy MacEoin, who must have intended to be facetious, said that he could be sentenced to death or to a fine of 2/6.  I should hope that this section would be dealt with and considered on an entirely different basis from that.  If a court-martial finds that an officer when capable of making a successful defence surrendered his defence establishment to the enemy, is it not obvious that that man will be sentenced to death by the court-martial?  Can anyone imagine that a court-martial could impose a penalty less than the maximum penalty if they found the charge proved?</P>

      <P>Well, Sir, Deputy General MacEoin made a point and I am replying to it, that under the powers granted in this section a court-martial could sentence to death or they could fine the officer concerned 2/6.  I would not like that to go on the records of this House without having that point of view corrected.  There is no possibility that a court-martial of five officers who find an officer guilty of surrendering his defence establishment when capable of making a successful defence will fine him 2/6, and that point of view was expressed here last night and is on the records of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to deal in that facetious way with a section of the seriousness <Col N="1331" /> and gravity of this section, then I think we have taken complete leave of our senses; and I want it to be very clear that, as far as this House is concerned, if they take the decision to incorporate this section in the military code they do not want anyone to be under the impression that it is a section of such ridiculousness that it may involve an officer accused in a pecuniary penalty of 2/6.  The section provides for death, and it is no use the Minister or anybody else saying that that may be death or any lesser punishment, because, I submit, and I think it would and must be the view of the House as expressed by the persons who took part in the debate, that where on what is described as active service a person is guilty of the particular offences that are laid down here it ought to be clear that where the section gives the power to impose the penalty of death that penalty will be imposed.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the points which the Minister has made in his statement. I am not going to trouble with sub-section (e), because the Minister has not dealt with it specifically.  That is the section which says: &ldquo;Who fails to pursue the enemy or to consolidate a position gained.&rdquo;  All I would like to do in regard to that is to direct the attention of the House to Section 124 which, in my view, gives the Army and the Government, and, in the event of an emergency, gives the State all the powers that it needs to deal with any cases of cowardice, treachery, refusal to obey orders or anything, in fact, that endangers the Defence Forces or the State.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to sub-section (f), which says: &ldquo;Who improperly fails to relieve or assist a known friend to the utmost of his power.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to the Minister.  The Minister said that the use of the word &ldquo;friend&rdquo; creates no difficulty whatsoever in the section and that a friend in army parlance&mdash; and that is the word the Minister used &mdash;was a person who is not against him. I hope I am quoting the Minister correctly.  He describes a friend as a person who is on your side, a man fighting under great difficulties, and that in these circumstances it is the duty of the commander to go to the assistance of that particular known friend.  In opening on my amendment to delete this particular section I subjected sub-section (f) to a rather detailed examination and I was critical of the language in it and particularly anxious to ascertain the Minister's interpretation of what &ldquo;a known friend&rdquo; is.  I think that where a section such as this imposes the gravest penalty known to our law for a breach of a sub-section such as this it is only right that not only the House and the country but every person in the Army now or in the future should be clear as to the meaning of &ldquo;known friend&rdquo;. As I say, the Minister has described that as a person who is not against him, a person on his side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit with respect that the Minister's interpretation of that particular section in no way assists the House in understanding what is the meaning of that particular sub-section. In this Bill we have many pages at the beginning devoted to definitions. I have looked over these definitions. They are contained in Section 2 of the Bill and they cover pages 13, 14, 15 and a considerable part of page 16. There are four pages of interpretations but I have been unable to find in the interpretations any interpretation of this phrase &ldquo;known friend&rdquo;.  I think if the House would look at the pages I have referred to Deputies will see that every conceivable difficulty is interpreted in that particular section but the words &ldquo;known friend&rdquo; are not interpreted and they have no meaning or can have no meaning so far as this House is concerned unless <Col N="1333" /> some precise interpretation is given to them.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had said to me that he realised that there was a gap or a hiatus in regard to the meaning of this particular phrase in the definition section of the Bill and that he would endeavour to put that right, or that he gave me what he considered to be a precise definition of the words &ldquo;known friend&rdquo;, then I would have no difficulty in appreciating the meaning of the section and dealing with it accordingly, but I think the House must agree that we cannot pass into law a punitive section of this kind in which the phrase &ldquo;known friend&rdquo; exists and which I submit has not been in any way improved by the interpretation the Minister has placed upon it.  That is my difficulty in regard to this particular phrase.  If I am to accept what the Minister says, how far does it bring one in an interpretation of the phrase: &ldquo;who fails to relieve or assist a known friend&rdquo;?  The main problem, as I say, is concerned with the phrase &ldquo;known friend&rdquo;.  If I knew what these words meant, then I could deal with the other words &ldquo;relieve or assist&rdquo; which are of vital importance to the sub-section.  I asked the Minister the question: did &ldquo;known friend&rdquo; mean a comrade officer, did it mean a comrade soldier, did it mean a unit or was it confined entirely to the military personnel?  Did it include civilians or was it limited to persons who were in fact actively assisting in the operation in which the commander concerned was engaged. That is my difficulty in regard to the section.  I have asked for help, I have asked for assistance and the Minister has not been able to say anything more to me than that it means, in army parlance, a person who is not against the commander.</P>
    <P>I think it well that one should in examining this particular section look at the opening words of the section because incorporating the two opening words of this section and this sub-section the provision reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every officer subject to military law and in command of a State ship, service aircraft, defence establishment, <Col N="1334" /> unit or other element of the Defence Forces,</P>
    <P>(f) who improperly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to insert there the word &ldquo;unjustifiably&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;fails to relieve or assist a known friend to the utmost of his power, is guilty of an offence against military law and shall on conviction by court-martial be liable to suffer death or any less punishment awardable by a court-martial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now it will be noticed that in sub-section (a) the offence is limited to a person who is under orders to carry out an operation of war or who comes into contact with an enemy that it is his duty to engage.  Again, paragraph (c) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;who when capable of making a successful defence surrenders... to the enemy&rdquo;</P>
    <P>while paragraph (d) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;who, being in action, unjustifiably withdraws from the action&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>and (e) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;who unjustifiably fails to pursue an enemy or to consolidate a position gained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In all these sub-sections, it is clear that they cover a period of active service, in fact more than active service, as they refer to an engagement with the enemy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I am pointing out&mdash;and it is the first time I have touched on the matter&mdash;that sub-sections (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), deal with an officer in command of troops in an active engagement with the <Col N="1335" /> enemy whereas paragraph (f), with which I am dealing, has no connection, good, bad or indifferent, with the enemy.  With respect, that is the first time I have touched on this particular topic in regard to that sub-section.  In every one of the previous sub-sections, it is clear that the offence is committed when the commander is in actual touch with the enemy.  In sub-section (f) it simply says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every officer in command of a ship,&rdquo; etc., &ldquo;who unjustifiably fails to relieve or assist a known friend to the utmost of his power is guilty of an offence against military law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It may be said in reply to that that the title on the side of the section heads it: &ldquo;Capital offences by commanders when in action.&rdquo;  But I submit that that is insufficient as a matter of interpretation of this particular phrase which does not allege that the offence is committed when the troops are in action.  Similarly, in regard to the last sub-section where the wording is that he &ldquo;forsakes his station&rdquo;.  The Minister has dealt with that phrase. I am just anxious to deal with the Minister's interpretation of that.  The Minister says&mdash;I have to interpret from recollection what he said in regard to that because I just cannot find the note that I took down in regard to it&mdash;but he used language that would indicate that in his opinion &ldquo;to forsake&rdquo; meant &ldquo;to abandon&rdquo; or &ldquo;to leave unjustifiably&rdquo; or &ldquo;to leave entirely&rdquo; from a particular place.  I submit that that is not going to help us in the interpretation of that particular section; that the same difficulty arises in regard to it as I have raised in regard to (f); and that the very fact that a person leaves a particular place, if we are to assume that this section refers entirely and only to active service, does not mean that he &ldquo;abandons&rdquo; it, that he &ldquo;leaves it entirely&rdquo;, or that he leaves it without just cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have dealt with the points that have been made by the speakers who have dealt with this section.  I am sorry that the House did not have the benefit of the contributions of other members who would be interested <Col N="1336" /> if there was a matter before the House in regard to the treatment of horses or cats or in regard to the treatment of animals.  We would have many contributions in regard to these from many sides of the House but where it is a matter of the lives of military officers that is left entirely to the Minister and a few Deputies who spoke and it is assumed by the House&mdash;and I think that should be on record&mdash;that there is no necessity to bother themselves about that provision and that any Deputy who worries himself about it is just wasting his own time.  I am sorry that should be the view of the House in regard to a serious matter such as this, a matter which in the future may involve the lives of commanding officers of particular units of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that it is foresight to include a section such as this in the Bill.  I wonder if it is.  That is one of my difficulties in regard to it.  I think it is not good foresight.  I think it is unwise.  I think it is detrimental to the best interests of the Defence Forces.  I think it is contrary to our conception of law.  I think it is contrary to our conception of human rights that such a provision should be there, and I wonder if it is strictly in accordance with the provisions of the agreement or convention on human rights which we, as a nation with other nations, signed recently.  I admit I have not had time to examine that point, but I just wonder if a section such as this which is so much opposed to the fundamental law not only of this country but of all countries that exist under what is known as the British system of law, does not infringe too much in regard to human rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that my conception of modern warfare does not take into account the type of war or fighting that we had in Korea, in the last few years, when you had the troops fighting hand-to-hand and when you had, as he says, very stubborn battles of the old style in which everything from knives and forks to bayonets were used from time to time.  I do not like to take Korea as an example because there are factors in connection with the Korean war that I think would not-exist <Col N="1337" /> in any other fight in which we would be engaged or which would take place in any part of Europe as we know it.  I think the Minister is as well aware as I am of the considerations that apply in Korea and which brought about the sort of fighting that they had in Korea in recent times, just as there are particular factors that govern the type of fighting that one gets in Kenya to-day.  I think that, from our point of view as a Defence Force, we have to consider a different type of warfare in the future, and that the views expressed by Deputy MacEoin as to the type of warfare in which we are likely to be involved do not take account of modern developments, not only in other defence forces but in our own Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>These are my contributions to this section.  I felt it was necessary to examine it in detail and to get all the information I could from the Minister in regard to every sub-section and in regard to every word related to it. It seems to me clear that, even the Minister himself, although he has a broad general view of how the section may be operated and takes, as he always does, the charitable approach that it will be used by the angels for angels, has, nevertheless, been unable to establish on the records of this House that there is any necessity for this particular section.</P>
    <P>I regret that it is, apparently, going to be passed into law.  I only hope that, when it reaches the other House, the volume of opinion there in regard to fundamental factors, such as these, may bring about a change of mind on the part of the Minister, and that this section which is unnecessary, which is retrograde and which holds the Army and Army officers in a very poor light, will be there deleted from the Bill.  I only want to say this in conclusion, that, in the years in which the Army has been established, if we had had any samples of treacherous conduct, of cowardice or of the heinous conduct which this section is intended to deal with, there might be some grounds for introducing it; but we have had no examples of the types that I have referred to.  The Minister, <Col N="1338" /> the country and this Parliament have had nothing but the most excellent services from all ranks in the Army, whether members of the Regular Forces or members of the Reserve, and no officer in the Army felt that it was necessary to have powers such as are in this section to force him to do his duty.</P>
    <P>Certainly, as far as I am concerned, I was rather disturbed by the view expressed by Deputy MacEoin that there were occasions in our recent history in which incidents occurred which necessitated a section such as this is to deal with them.  I was rather disturbed by the view that he expressed, that the very fact of having a section such as this would ensure that officers in the future did their duty to the country.  I would like it to be on record, as far as I am concerned, that I do not believe that. I do not believe that the Irish character or the Irish temperament or our Irish characteristics necessitated a loaded whip such as this section is to force or compel our Irish officers to do their duty.  I think the section is an insult to the Army; I think it is an insult to Army officers and I have done everything in my power to oppose it.  I can only hope that, before the Bill is finally law, this particular section will be deleted from it.</P>

    <P>This amendment is the first of six which I have made to this section following discussion with the authorities concerned of the various points raised in the Special Committee.  The amendment modifies paragraph (a) of the section to the extent of providing that it shall be an offence negligently or through other default not to endeavour to carry out orders to go into action <Col N="1339" /> when ordered.  It thus becomes necessary to prove negligence or other default when bringing a charge under the paragraph and grounds for a defence are also thereby provided.

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Grants for Reconstruction of Dwellings &mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That, in view of the steep increase in the costs of labour and building materials, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that measures should be taken at once to increase the amount of the grants at present available for the reconstruction of dwellings.&mdash; (Deputies Finan and Beirne.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perhaps rather pleasant to change over from the grim subject of death in its most grim form to the subject of life in its most pleasant form, if you like, that is in the form in which it is lived by the most important section of our community, the people in the rural areas, particularly the smaller farmers.  Last night we were discussing this question of grants for the reconstruction of dwelling-houses and, while the motion demands an increase in those grants, I was suggesting that the case made by Deputy Finan was not so much for an increase in the grants as for a reform in administration that would ensure that the people would get the State grant and the supplementary grant to which they believe they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Finan made the case that in a great many instances the inspectors, in estimating the cost of the proposed work, rather underestimated the full cost and as a result the applicant for a grant, while hoping to be recouped to the extent of two-thirds of his expenditure, is not actually so recouped.  Therefore it would seem that the demand put forward by Deputy Finan was not exactly that which is implied in the motion but rather that there should be a revision in the methods of inspectors in making out their estimate of costs.  On that point I am in considerable agreement with Deputy Finan because I have known quite a number of cases in which there had been what appeared to me a complete understatement of the cost of the proposed work.  I have <Col N="1345" /> known cases in which the applicants have been able to prove to my satisfaction any way that they incurred expenditure of over £200, while in actual fact the estimate of the inspector was in or about £120.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which might be reinvestigated and examined.  It might be suggested to the inspectors that they should be a little more realistic in making their estimates.  Nobody would suggest that they should overestimate the cost as that would be an injustice and would be a violation of the law as it stands.  But what is required is an absolutely accurate and fair estimate.</P>
    <P>There are a number of cases in which a person setting out to carry out reconstruction work on his dwelling-house may decide that he is going to do a certain amount of work.  The inspector who estimates the work makes out an estimate which appears at the time to be reasonable enough.  But it may happen that, in the course of carrying out the work, the applicant may find he is compelled to do other work which he did not originally anticipate would be necessary, and thereby his costs might be substantially increased.  In a case like that, it should be quite justifiable for the inspector to come back and revise his original estimate and, if necessary, increase it.</P>
    <P>That is the first request which I should like to make, because when there is underestimation it means that the person does not get the full State grant to which he is entitled.  It may also mean that he is completely debarred from securing the supplementary grant to which he would be entitled.  It has been pointed out that the supplementary grant cannot be paid unless it is proved that the applicant has incurred expenditure himself to the extent of one-third of the cost.  Therefore the supplementary grant cannot be paid if from the inspector's estimate it appears that the applicant has not contributed one-third of the cost.  I should like this matter to be reinvestigated. It is not so much a question of giving an increased grant as of revising the administration of the existing law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> There are other matters about which Deputies of all Parties receive complaints. One is in regard to the vexed question of the second grant.  The second grant is available at the expiry of 15 years from the date on which the first grant was paid, and in many cases there is some doubt, perhaps, in the mind of the applicant as to when he actually received the first grant.  In some cases, the applicant, believing he is entitled to the second grant, undertakes the reconstruction work in anticipation, perhaps, of inspection and the grant being awarded, and finds he is completely debarred.  There is a good deal of heart-burning over that kind of decision.  There is also, of course, the other type of circumstance in which a second grant is paid, and that is in the case of a thatched dwelling-house. A second grant to reroof that dwelling-house may be paid within a period of ten years.</P>
    <P>Then again there are sometimes disputes as to whether the house actually was thatched or not.  You have the case perhaps of a house that was originally thatched and which was covered with galvanised iron over the thatch and it would take the Supreme Court to decide whether it is actually a thatched house or a galvanised roof.  You have disputes in these matters, and over and above all that you have frequent complaints of delays in regard to inspection.  It will be admitted that the inspectors do their duties conscientiously and well, but perhaps in some cases they have large areas to attend to and in other cases some circumstance may arise such as illness of the inspector which may cause delay.  All Deputies have those delays brought to their notice.  I suppose it is only natural that people with rather limited means, when they incur expenditure in connection with reconstruction of their houses, are very anxious to get the grant at the earliest possible date, and there is always a good deal of impatience if there is any delay in regard to inspection and final certification.</P>
    <P>Delays in regard to inspection also give rise to another form of dispute and complaint.  That is where an applicant has applied for a reconstruction <Col N="1347" /> grant; inspection, of course, is necessary before the work can be undertaken but if the house is in a very bad state of repair the occupant may decide that he has to start the work in order to have some living accommodation perhaps before the winter sets in.  Very often it may happen that the house shows signs of rapid deterioration and the applicant may feel he cannot wait.  Then if there is delay in regard to inspection he may think he is justified in going ahead with the work, and he may find that he has debarred himself from securing a grant as the inspector may claim that the work was undertaken before instructions were given for it.  Those are all cases of complaint and sometimes of bitterness on the part of the people concerned.  I think every Deputy would be anxious to see them removed as far as possible, and therefore this motion has served a useful purpose in enabling Deputies to ventilate those grievances and in bringing to the notice of the Department the fact that they feel that those complaints should not be allowed to occur.  I feel very strongly that in the case of the second grant which becomes payable after ten years there should not be too much quibbling if the person entitled to the grant does not wait the full ten years before starting the work.  After all it does not make very much difference to the State whether he has carried out the work in nine years in the case of a thatched roof, because it might happen that he might have no roof at the end of ten years.  It does not matter very much if the person carries out the work, where he is qualified for payment in ten years, some time before the expiry of that period. Those are cases in regard to which the Department should take a lenient view.  The essential fact is that Dáil Éireann by legislation has provided that a person who reconstructs his dwelling-house in accordance with the law shall secure a grant of two-thirds of the cost up to a maximum of £120, and if a good job of work is done in regard to reconstruction we should not hesitate in paying that grant without <Col N="1348" /> quibbling about dates or little matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that relatively speaking these grants are fairly generous. They are more generous than the grants given for the building of a new house.  An applicant for reconstruction of a house, if he gets what he is entitled to and what this House intended that he should get, will get two-thirds of the cost, but in the case of a new house he can hardly expect to get more than one-third.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Madden made a rather strong case in regard to a person who was refused a reconstruction grant on account of his house being in too bad a condition for reconstruction. The inspector advised him to build a new house.  I think that was on the whole sound advice, but, as Deputy Madden pointed out, that particular person might not have been in a financial position to undertake the building of a new house.  In this matter I do not know what the attitude of Deputy Madden's county council is, but most county councils are prepared to take a lenient view and to provide a county council cottage in the case of persons of low valuation who are in poor circumstances. The governing factor in this as in all other matters is the Christian standard of ensuring that a family will not be left without a home, and if a person has a very small farm and is in poor circumstances there should be no hesitation on the part of a county council in providing a cottage for that person just the same as they would provide it for an agricultural labourer. I know to my own knowledge that the county councils with which I am familiar in Carlow and Wicklow have provided cottages in such cases.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see the purpose of this motion is to bring these matters before the attention of the Department to see that as far as possible the grievances which have have been ventilated will be removed, and in so doing the motion has served a useful purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago the reconstruction grants which were available were ample, or at least near <Col N="1349" /> ample, to meet the cost of reconstruction, but we must admit that since that time the cost of building materials has gone up, making it more difficult for the person who engages in reconstruction of a dwelling-house to carry out the work unless he has a reasonable sum of money that he can afford to spare to add to the grant.  It is really to bring that set of circumstances to the notice of the Government, and particularly of the Minister for Local Government, that this motion has been taken.  Quite a lot of people would like to build new houses but they cannot do that, one of the principal reasons being want of the necessary cash to bridge the gap between the grant and the total cost of the house.  There are quite a number of houses throughout the country that are fairly substantial but, nevertheless, when we take the march of time and the general improvement of housing all over the country into account, we must admit that they are not what we should like to see them and I am sure they are not what the owners would like to have.  They may have thatched roofs and perhaps they are not too modern inside; they may have small windows and the doors may be faulty and small too.  In cases like that, it does seem a pity that a house in which the main structure is fairly sound could not be reconstructed and so provide the owner with a comfortable sound dwelling for a generation or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking on the question of the erection of new houses, many people are debarred from undertaking such work for the reason I have mentioned &mdash;that they have not money enough to bridge the gap between the cost and the grant in the case of new houses. The same remarks apply to the reconstruction of houses.  Many houses all over the country could be reconstructed and the State would be spared a considerable amount of expenditure on grants for new houses, if the reconstruction grants were a little bit more generous.  I think it was the proposer of the motion, Deputy Finan, who said last night that while people are housed in bad houses or in unhealthy or insanitary houses, a good deal of the effort to improve the general health <Col N="1350" /> standard of the people is wasted.  That is perfectly true.  It is quite obvious that we have no business spending money on health services, if we are going to leave untouched the sources from which ill-health springs.</P>
    <P>I think the time has arrived when we should look into the whole question of housing generally.  While the motion advocates legislation, I would not ask the Minister for Local Government to introduce separate legislation to deal with the reconstruction of houses.  I feel that the proper course is that such legislation should be embodied in general housing legislation, such as has been the custom in the past.  In that respect, may I say that there are certain delays&mdash;I do not know who is responsible&mdash;which take place in the inspection of houses and which have a very deterrent effect on people likely to engage in the erection of houses?</P>
    <P>I raised that question with the Minister for Local Government yesterday.  I do not want to say that it is the fault of the appointed officers, because I have a suspicion that there is some other source behind the scenes which delays the hand of the appointed officer in some way that I do not understand, but whatever causes the delay in the first inspection should be looked into and set right.  I have known cases of delay lasting seven months.  I would not mind one delay, because any official, no matter who he is, may not be able to be up to the mark all the time; but when a number of delays occur in one area, let it be an urban area or a small rural area, I have a strong suspicion that there is some hidden influence at work which is the cause of the delay.  The reason I mention it is that it is likely to have a bad effect on people who are contemplating the reconstruction of old houses or building new ones.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions for obtaining a reconstruction grant under present legislation is that a second reconstruction grant is not payable or will not be made available by the Minister within a period of 15 years.  Any person who got a grant to reconstruct his house or portion of his house cannot obtain a second grant until a period of 15 years has expired.  I wish to make <Col N="1351" /> a suggestion and I hope it will be examined for what it is worth, because I think there is a good deal in it&mdash;that the period within which a second grant will not be payable should be left to the discretion of the Minister or to some official of his. Take the case, say, of a small house reconstructed five years ago, in which there were two old people.  In the meantime, a son or daughter of the old couple married, and there are now a number of children in the house, thereby causing overcrowding.  In that particular instance, no matter what the Act says, the Minister should have discretion to give a grant if he is satisfied that it is not an attempt on the part of the person obtaining the grant to make a trade of obtaining grants from the Government all the time for the same job.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am not making myself quite clear.  Let us take the case of X, whose house was reconstructed seven or eight years ago.  In the meantime, his son has married in the place. While the house may have been quite adequate to accommodate three persons five or six years ago, there are now five or six children in the house, along with the father and mother and the father's father and mother.  That house is obviously completely overcrowded, yet this young man cannot obtain a reconstruction grant.  I say that in a case like that some discretion should be left to the Minister. I think that in the new Housing Bill providing for the renewal of the Act, which expires on the 31st March next, the whole question should be dealt with.  I can quite fully understand and sympathise with the need for having some period specified in the Act to prevent wholesale advantage being taken of Government grants for reconstruction purposes, but I think that in cases such as I have mentioned a discreation should be left to the Minister to make grants available where he is satisfied that there is overcrowding to the detriment of the health of the inhabitants of the house and where the owner of the house has not the necessary cash to carry out reconstruction himself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> There is another aspect of this matter which affects reconstruction as well as new houses.  That is the matter I raised with the Minister yesterday, the question of the power of local authorities to deduct what I described as exorbitant legal fees from persons seeking loans either for new houses or for reconstructing houses.  I quoted four instances in the question and the Minister in his reply told me that he has no function in the matter, that it is governed by the old procedure when the local authorities, say the county council or the urban council as the case may be, fixed the legal fees or had an agreement with the legal adviser about the fee to be charged.  In three of the cases which I quoted to the Minister, there was a fee of £56 deducted from a loan of £1,600.  That was bad enough but in another case there was a fee of £52.4 deducted from a loan of £1,000 to a working man.  While it might be true that, as the law stands at present, the Minister has no authority to deal with such cases, I think that where a racket&mdash;and I can describe it as nothing but a nasty racket&mdash;has grown up, the Minister should take power to stamp it out and not alone that but to deal out punishment to those who are engaged in it.  If I might be allowed to give instances, the man who got a loan of £1,000 from the local authority had £52 of that loan stopped.  Although he never got that £52, he will be paying it back for the next 30 or 35 years. He never got a cent of it but he will have to pay the whole £52 with interest.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who say that professional people should not get a decent fee that would be ample for their labour and sufficient to keep up their offices.  I do not believe in that, but surely there is something wrong when in one town in my constituency fees totalling almost £220 were extracted from four borrowers of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act. Fifty-six pounds was deducted in each case of a £1,600 loan and £52 by the same authority in the case of the £1,000 loan.  You might imagine that the fee &mdash;exorbitant as it was&mdash;should be about £30 in the case of the £1,000 loan, but that was not so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> I want to advise the Minister that if he proposes to take action to stop that kind of ramp or racket he will have this Party and every decent Deputy in the House behind him.  It is nothing less than plundering and robbing the ordinary working man in nearly all cases without justification.</P>
    <P>Another point that I want to bring to the Minister's notice is a question which we have raised very often concerning people seeking grants principally for water and sanitary accommodation in their houses&mdash;the usual £50 grant.  You have some people just within the outskirts of an urban area where water may be laid on but sewerage is not available.  In some cases you have sewerage available but no water and these people are debarred from getting grants by the wording of Section 7 of the 1952 Act where it says &ldquo;where piped water or sewerage is available&rdquo;.  I would urge that the Minister should make grants available to such persons&mdash;that is the £50 water and sanitation grant.  I think that that section is pretty hard because in urban areas or on the outskirts of urban areas which are not built-up and have not the advantage of both piped water and sewerage&mdash; though they may have one&mdash;the people cannot get a grant.  I think in a case like that, where the town clerk or the county manager is prepared to certify in writing to the Department, let us say where water for example or sewerage is not available, that sewerage or water is not or will not be available in that area, I think a grant ought to be given.  I know the dividing line must be drawn somewhere but it certainly seems very hard luck on those people to see their neighbours in the town having no trouble where water or sewerage is concerned, while they themselves have no water or sewerage available.  They are in a kind of no man's land just because the sewerage or the water pipe did not pass by their door or run down their road.  I think that the section could be usefully amended by saying that where one or the other is not available the Minister should be able to give a grant.  After all, the amount would be very small.  We <Col N="1354" /> should not forget that a person undergoing that expense has only the advantage that he might be saved a sum of £10 or £15 for the erection of a concrete tank to hold the water.  That is all he is saved by the fact that water is laid on in that particular area.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion to the House because, if we examine the cost of building materials, we can see that since 1947 they have more than doubled, and if we were sincere in giving a grant of a particular size, then&mdash;while I must admit that the grants were improved since&mdash;they have not kept pace with the increase in the price of building materials.  That is the reason we have put down this motion. Very satisfactory strides have been made in housing since we got our freedom here in 1921.  Whether the various Governments can claim credit for it or not, the country as a whole must present a very pleasing sight to anybody who was not here since 1921 or 1922.  They must admit that the whole country has been rebuilt.  Nevertheless, there are some areas, in fact in all areas, there are individual houses where, through no fault of the people themselves who cannot improve the houses, these houses are in bad repair, and I think we should come to the people's rescue and put a decent finish to what is otherwise a very excellent job of which we should all be proud, no matter what our political opinions may be.  I think we are all proud&mdash;or we ought to be&mdash;of the strides made in housing under all three Governments that have been in office, and I do not think we should deny the little that this motion asks to put a finish on a very good job.  This is not a vote-catching motion or anything like that: it just seeks to come to the rescue of a small number scattered thinly throughout the country who have not the necessary capital to do the work themselves. All we are asking is that the Government should come to their rescue and give them fairly decent houses in which to live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with all the other Deputies in asking the Minister to increase these grants because my experience is that there is a number of people who want to do <Col N="1355" /> reconstruction jobs and when they get the estimates they find they cannot carry on with the work.  An increase in the grant will result in a great deal more reconstruction being done.</P>
      <P>I would also like to raise the matter of delay.  I find there is enormous delay from the time a person arranges for a grant, in many cases, until the inspector comes.  In some cases it is three or four months, and in fact in every case an applicant would be very lucky if the inspector came within three months of the application going in.  I would ask the Minister would he try and speed up the visits of the inspectors.</P>
      <P>I would also like the Minister to raise the valuation from £50 to, say, £70 or £80.  Many people have a valuation of £50 1s., £50 2s. or £52 or £53 and are debarred from getting grants.  I think the time has come when the Minister can raise the valuation because many of the houses of £50 valuation have been dealt with and the valuation should be raised to at least £80, I would say.  Many farmers in these classes of houses have bad accommodation&mdash;in fact it is the biggest gap you will find in the country.  You will find that the bad houses in the country are owned by farmers with a valuation of from £50 to £70 or £80.  I would ask the Minister to look into that and raise the valuation to something higher than it is and it will cover most of the houses that are now in a bad way. These are all the matters I would like to put before the Minister and I join with the other Deputies in asking the Minister to raise the grants because the time has come when people cannot carry out the work when they get an estimate because of the high cost of building material.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few remarks to make in connection with this motion.  The time is nearly out and I presume there may be other speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion was put down in all sincerity and was prompted by the fact that money values have deteriorated <Col N="1356" /> so very much in this country in the last 100 years that housing grants particularly for reconstruction are entirely inadequate in these times. The popular grant in my part of the country and in the West of Ireland generally is the £80 grant.  That is the grant which is used for the reconstruction or improvement of houses where there are three apartments.  After that you have the other grants&mdash;the £100 grant which applies where there are four rooms, the £120 grant which applies where there are five rooms in the house.  I would suggest to the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary who is representing him that those amounts should be altered and stepped up considerably and that the difference in the grants between the three-roomed and four-roomed and five-roomed houses should also be stepped up.  The difference at present is £20 between the £80 and the £100 grant, and of £40 between the £80 and the £120 grant.  I suggest that the £20 be stepped up to at least £25 to meet the cost of the extra work done where a room is added.</P>
    <P>The value of money has depreciated very much since housing grants were introduced 20 or more years ago.  The reconstruction grant at that time was £40.  I know quite well that the different Governments we have had have made serious and determined efforts to improve housing conditions in the country.  So far as the towns are concerned, there has been a great deal done.  As far as the rural areas are concerned, even though some progress has been made, there still remains a lot of work to be done.  The houses that require reconstruction in the country cannot be seen by those who motor along our main roads.  The reason is that they are situated in the backward places.  In my own constituency, I know at least ten or 12 townlands in which there are 20 or 30 houses situate in very backward places which are in a deplorably bad condition and urgently in need of reconstruction. These townlands are thickly populated. The valuations of those living there are something less than £10.  An £80 grant would be of no use to those people and, of course, it would be quite impossible for them to build a <Col N="1357" /> new house.  They have been hoping for years that some form of relief would be made available to enable them to reconstruct their houses.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister, when bringing forward his new Housing (Amendment) Bill to bear in mind the conditions under which the people I refer to are living.  I felt disappointed that he did not give any hope of his intention to implement this motion through the legislation that is to be passed shortly.  There is an urgent need to step up the grants for the reconstruction of houses such as the motion deals with.</P>
    <P>This debate has covered a rather wider field than I had expected.  It has covered not only the reconstruction of houses but the erection of new ones.  On the general question of housing, there is quite a lot I would have to say if I were permitted to do so.  I did deal with some aspects of it on the Minister's Estimate.  For example, I cannot see for the life of me what useful function public utility societies serve in connection with the provision of new houses.  As far as I can see, there is a £10 note missing somewhere.  It appears to go astray. An applicant pays £10 when he joins one of these societies and is supposed to get some benefit for it.  So far as I can see, the unfortunate fellow never sees the £10 again.  He does not get any benefit for it.  In my opinion, these societies should be scrapped.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have complained about inspections and of delays in the payment of grants.  It was said that the inspectors were too exacting. Perhaps I could make some complaints too in that direction, but I do not want to exaggerate.  The inspectors that we have in the County Roscommon are most efficient, capable and courteous. They are hard-working officials.  The senior official has an immense amount of work to do.  He has to cover the Counties of Roscommon, Longford and Westmeath.  In my opinion, it would be a physical impossibility for one man to cover such a wide area.  He has done quite a lot of creditable things that one could not really expect from an official who is responsible for three counties.  The work, naturally, got into arrears, and I understand he has <Col N="1358" /> now the help of two assistants.  I think the fact that we have arrears there is due to understaffing.  There is a time lag in my area in regard to inspections and the payment of grants. The Minister should, if necessary, augment the staff so that there will be greater expedition in the execution of the work.</P>
    <P>There are also complaints to the effect that the inspectors are too exacting, and that in many cases they underestimate the cost of reconstruction.  It is on their estimates that the county council grants are given.  I have before me an estimate which sets out the various items of work to be done in the reconstruction of a house.  I take it that the figures dealing with the various items represent the actual cost of the materials required from the builders' providers, and what the applicant has to pay for them.  I cannot find any figures in the estimate relating to tradesmen's wages, the wages of skilled labourers or the cost, for example, of removing the thatched roof.  There is nothing in this estimate about the cost of labour.  It may be that it is embodied in the itemised figures.  So far as the inspectors are concerned, they are in my opinion giving as much satisfaction as can be expected from human beings.  If there have been delays, I believe these are due to understaffing.  In my opinion, the inspectors are doing a good job of work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan, when speaking last night, referred to the fact that, if an applicant is refused a reconstruction grant, the local county council could come to his rescue by building a house for him on his own land, and charging him a weekly rent for it.  The point about that is that if a man gets a house built on his own land in these circumstances he will be subject to a rent of 7/6 or 10/- a week, and the house will never become his property. That house will remain the property of the county council.  There is a lot in that.  A man likes to own his house and not merely be the tenant of the county council or any other body.  In addition, the rents are excessive even though they are not up to the economic level.  They are based on this differential <Col N="1359" /> system and the local authorities are giving them to the tenants as cheaply as they possibly can.  Remember, 10/- per week represents £26 per year.  I know reasonably big farmers who are not paying that rent for 30 acres of land.</P>
    <P>I have never advised a man looking for a new house to impose on himself a burden of £26 per year for a cottage. Nearly every person up to a certain valuation qualifies for a county council grant.  The grants vary with the valuation. They vary according to the estimated cost, the number of rooms and so on.  In some cases the applicant gets 100 per cent. of the grant; in other cases he gets only 33? per cent. There is a ceiling of £35, above which no county council grant can be given. Now I have never regarded valuation as the proper basis for computing the general circumstances, the prosperity or wealth of a man.  Perhaps it is the fairest basis one can find but there are exceptional cases where men with a valuation of £35 with big families are more in need of assistance than men with smaller valuations.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to step up the figure to £40.  He will be doing a good day's work if he does that.  I do not believe housing should be wholly and solely the responsibility of local authorities.  Housing should be a national responsibility and the cost of it should be met by the central Government.  In the same way grants towards housing should be met by the central Government.  The rates are increasing every day.  The Government has a happy knack of passing the buck, or passing the bill, on to the local authorities. The supplementary grant which the county council gives has to be raised by borrowing and the moneys borrowed have subsequently to be met out of the rates.  Local authorities should be relieved of all responsibility for housing because the rates are becoming an intolerable burden.</P>
    <P>This matter has been neglected over the years.  The purchasing power of money has decreased; £80 to-day will not purchase what £40 purchased 20 years ago.  Having listened to the <Col N="1360" /> Minister last night I felt somewhat despondent.  I hope he has learned something as a result of this debate and I hope it will give him a line to follow in the future.  He will have the backing of the House if he decides to give some increase in the grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in full agreement with this motion.  Those of us who live in the country recognise how hard it is for the small farmer with a £5, £6 or £10 valuation to undertake the construction or erection of a new home.  A new house to-day costs anything from £900 to £1,000.  Notwithstanding the fact that there is a somewhat reasonable grant forthcoming there are a number of people who are unable to undertake the responsibility of building a new house because they cannot fill the gap between the grant and the actual cost of the house.</P>
      <P>There are in the rural areas many decent thatched cottages and many decent slated houses which were built 40 or 50 years ago under the Congested Districts Board.  They have deteriorated over the years and are now in dire need of repair and reconstruction. Many of these homes could be brought up to a reasonable standard of decency and that is why we ask the Minister to consider increasing the grant.</P>
      <P>Housing is a very important factor from the point of view of health. To-day we are spending a considerable percentage of our income on health services.  We boast about the erection of sanatoria.  It would be better if we boasted about the number of houses we have reconstructed and the number we have erected.  The need for sanatoria and other institutions arises out of the fact that our people are badly housed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We inherited appalling conditions when we took over the responsibility of Government.  We have now reached the stage when we can no longer leave the baby in the hands of the then occupying power because we have been sufficiently long in native administration to have wiped out these evils, particularly in the field of housing. In County Mayo, County Galway and elsewhere there are hundreds of <Col N="1361" /> houses unfit for human habitation.  It is in these homes one will find the largest families, 12 and 13 living in two rooms and a kitchen.  We hear a good deal nowadays about morality and so on but we are prepared to turn a blind eye to a great extent to the conditions under which our people live.</P>
    <P>I agree that over the years we have made considerable progress but we have not made the progress we should have made from the point of view of housing and from the point of view of dealing with the problem expeditiously and efficiently.  Nothing will keep our people on the land or induce our young men and women to settle on the land more than decent housing.  I have stated on many occasions since I entered this House that the one way to encourage people to remain on the land was by the provision of decent accommodation, designed on modern lines, having all the amenities essential so as to make it comfortable for the housewife to discharge her domestic duties.  When a young girl of 18 or 19 goes into a city or town and compares the amenities there with the amenities and surroundings which she was accustomed to you can hardly expect her to go back to these primitive conditions which she has left.  I would be the last one to expect her to return to such a primitive system of living as exists in many parts of the rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is with that in mind that I am wholeheartedly behind this motion.  I believe that almost every Deputy has the same feeling and is anxious that the Minister should step up the grants considerably with a view to meeting this situation.  We are at a stage in the history of the world when, if we are to keep in line with the development and progress of other countries, we will have to step a little quicker than we are accustomed to.  We are at a stage when we must provide suitable accommodation from the hygienic point of view.  Proper sanitary accommodation and a bathroom are just as essential in rural areas as in the centre of this city, no matter how far the house may be from the main public road, <Col N="1362" /> whether it be on the top of a mountain or down in a valley.</P>
    <P>I have stated that on many occasions, and I feel proud that in the past few years the Government have realised the necessity for these amenities and made provision so as to encourage farmers to instal them in new dwelling-houses and also in houses which are reconstructed.  But the amount given towards encouraging the installation of these amenities is not sufficient when related to the cost.  A sum of £50 would not buy a decent bath, without taking into consideration payment for the plumber and the other necessary essentials.  Some of the baths provided for county council houses are so small that they are hardly large enough for a baby, not to speak of an adult.  I should like the Minister to realise that it is essential that he should provide a considerable increase in the amount given at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beirne mentioned about inspection. I agree that the inspectors are very good men and are doing their best and that you cannot expect the impossible from them.  I must say, however, that the delays which occur are deplorable.  When an applicant sends in his form of application to the Custom House, he has to wait from six to 12 months before the gentleman who is supposed to carry out the inspection and to give instructions as to what the applicant is to do and is not to do comes along.  That is well known in my county.  I have had to bring that to the notice of the Department of Local Government time and time again and, I must say, without any success.  It goes on and on just like a stream flowing down a hillside.  Then the applicants have to wait a considerable time for the money when the house is completed.  Representatior after representation has to be made in order to get the few pounds these people are waiting for.</P>
    <P>When a man undertakes the reconstruction of a house, the inspector should be able to come to a decisior as to the genuineness or otherwise of the applicant.  Many people in rural Ireland to-day have not a bob with which to undertake the reconstruction of a house.  They are wholly dependent <Col N="1363" /> on the grant.  If some money was provided in the early stages of reconstruction it would enable such a person to undertake reconstruction and to set about going to the builders' providers to get the essential materials. Hundreds of such people have no money to undertake the erection of a new house or the reconstruction of an existing one.  People may talk about getting a loan.  To me that is all a cod, because you would have to get half the countryside to go security for you to get a loan.  The only man who can get a loan is a man with a considerable sum of money or one who is well known to those who lend the money so that they can be sure of getting it back.  If you go to a bank or to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, it is very difficult to get a loan.  If you go to a hire purchase company and undertake to pay anything from 10 to 12 per cent. interest you may get it, but that is the only hope there is at present of getting a loan.  A person who is anxious to renovate his home or to build a new house cannot secure a loan unless he has a number of guarantors and can offer some security himself.</P>
    <P>I therefore ask the Minister to think carefully before he introduces his new Housing Bill to see what can be done to make a change in relation to the amount paid.  Deputy Beirne mentioned grants of £80, £100 and £120.  Very few people who undertake this work get a grant of £120.  I have not come across one yet.  I know dozens of people who have reconstructed their dwelling-houses but I have not come across one yet who has qualified for a grant of £120.  The grants are generally for £60, £80 and £100.  In my opinion, the inspectors, perhaps through no fault of their own, underestimate the cost of reconstruction. When you take the cost of labour and materials into consideration, if a person undertakes the reconstruction of a thatched dwelling-house, puts a new roof on it and provides new windows, floors and doors, I do not think that a sum of £250 is a fair estimate for that.  I ask the Minister to instruct the inspectors to <Col N="1364" /> be more careful.  If they err at all, they should err on the liberal side so far as the applicant is concerned.</P>
    <P>I think also that the number of inspectors should be increased by 50 per cent.  You cannot expect one man to be able to cover counties like Mayo and Galway, two of the largest counties in the country.  No man, no matter how desirous he is of doing so, can do that work, and in asking him to cover such large areas you are asking him to do the impossible.  For that reason, I would expect that the number of inspectors would be increased considerably.  As Deputy Beirne said, if we could go outside the scope of this motion in relation to housing, we could say a lot more, but we will have to reserve that for a few weeks.  I would recommend the motion to the House and I hope that the Minister will accept it.  I think it is a motion that every Deputy from rural areas is in full agreement with.  Their views, I think, should be the same as we have expressed here, and our experience must be their experience.  For that reason, it cannot be described as a motion with any motive other than for the betterment of those who are in dire need of a decent, comfortable home to live in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that, thanks to the lenience of the Chair, the debate has covered a far wider field than I anticipated.  However, as some Deputies have said, I think the debate will prove useful.  Perhaps I was more or less responsible for the digression myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan has suggested that I did not make any argument in favour of my motion, but it will be agreed that neither the Minister nor any Deputy put up any argument to suggest that the grants at present being provided for reconstruction of houses are adequate.  Nobody made the slightest attempt to justify the present level of the grant, and I take it that that is acceptance that the grant already available is inadequate.  I do not think it is necessary to go to any distance to prove that, because £80 or £100 or £120 can purchase so little building material to-day that without <Col N="1365" /> any monetary compensation for labour it would be entirely inadequate to perform anything like a decent reconstruction job.  I think that the Minister side-tracked that.  It was so obvious that he did not make any attempt to deny it.  Everybody knows that labour costs and the costs of material in regard to houses have reached an exorbitant level.  Skilled labour is scarce and becoming scarcer in the rural areas because there has been a tendency in recent years for skilled tradesmen to emigrate and those who remain are in a position to dictate their own price.  Notwithstanding anything that has been said, I am convinced that the grants being made available for new houses will not solve the housing problem for many people who are in most need of improved housing accommodation.  They could not even consider it.  I am equally convinced that the reconstruction grants at present being made available will not tempt many people living in very sordid dwellings to attempt to reconstruct them.  That is the reason why I am advocating increased grants.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I had hoped that the Minister's anxiety to enter into the debate at an early stage showed that he was going to tell the House that he had anticipated this motion and proposed to meet it in the new Housing Bill.  I was sadly disillusioned as he went on, but I would say to him now that it is not yet too late to insert in his new Housing Bill a section which would cover this motion.  I take it that the fact that he did not put up any argument to show that these grants were adequate is in itself an acceptance of the view that an increase is desirable.  I do believe that coming from a rural area similar to the one I come from he must see every day of his life in his constituency many houses which need repair, and he must be aware that the circumstances of their residents are not likely to enable them to build new houses.  He must also admit that from the condition of those <Col N="1366" /> houses the grants which his Department makes available are insufficient to put them into a proper condition.  I do think that if the Minister comes into this House with a Bill which purports among other things to provide substantial increases in reconstruction grants he will get the full approval of the House for it.  He may have to fight a colleague or a Department to get it through, but if it is left to this House to give him that permission I believe he will get it unanimously, because nobody in any walk of life would begrudge giving assistance to people who are living in the conditions in which I have seen some of them in my own constituency and in other constituencies too.</P>
    <P>People have discussed this with me. They have asked me &ldquo;what are we going to do about houses?&rdquo;  You tell them about the housing grants, about the loans, or the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  But they cannot attempt it.  You then tell them about the reconstruction grants, which I admit for many are very generous but for others are useless.  They are left in the dilemma that there is no hope for them.  I appeal, therefore, to the Minister, now that he is in the House, to give careful and sympathetic consideration to this suggestion and that when he brings in his Housing Bill in two or three weeks' time we will find included in it provision for substantial increases for the reconstruction of these houses.  I had hoped, as I said, when he intervened in the debate last night at the early stage in which he did he was going to tell us he had more or less anticipated me.  I had hoped that I would be in a position then to withdraw my motion with the permission of the House.  I very much regret that that is not possible.</P>

      <P>In regard to this amendment No. 92, its purpose is to delete the word &ldquo;death&rdquo; from Section 124 and substitute &ldquo;penal servitude&rdquo;. In the previous Section 123, the House has decided that the section as amended should stand and that the punishment for an offence under that section should be death.  Section 124 is a somewhat different section to Section 123 in that it provides for a capital offence by any person in relation to the enemy and it provides that a person found guilty of one of the offences set out there will be liable to suffer death or any less punishment awardable by a court-martial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be brief in my submission in respect of this particular section because I think on the discussion on the previous section I did put forward as strongly as I could my own view in regard to the operation of capital punishment in regard to military offences.  I want to say that since the State was established I am not aware of any case in which the sentence of death has been imposed on any officer or soldier of the State and consequently we are inclined to take the view that there is nothing to be worried about in regard to a section such as this.  In general, I feel that where a person in this State is guilty of any offence that involves a sentence of death he should be tried not by court-martial but by a jury.  If we ever reach the position in this country that the civil laws will not operate and where only military laws will operate I think we will be in a pretty sorry state indeed.  I feel myself that in a <Col N="1370" /> state of emergency, if an ordinary person who is not subject to military law commits the offence of murder he cannot be dealt with by court-martial under the provisions of this Act and therefore he cannot be sentenced to death by court-martial as he is still subject to the jurisdiction of the civil courts and still entitled to be tried by a jury of 12 of his fellow citizens. Similarly, if an officer or soldier is charged with an offence that may result in his being sentenced to death I feel that he should not be tried by court-martial but like the person charged with the offence of murder he should be charged before a jury and before he is sentenced to death there should be the ordinary requirements of the law that the jury trying his offence should be unanimous.</P>
    <P>I know the same point will be made in regard to this section and to the other sections as was made in regard to the previous section, that he will be tried by his peers.  There is at least this difference between this and the previous section: that any person subject to military law, whether a reservist or an officer, a non-commissioned officer or a soldier of the permanent forces, is liable to be tried by court-martial which will consist entirely of military officers, and that court-martial can, if four out of five decide to convict, sentence him to death.  I do understand what the Minister said on the previous section and which is the law, that if a person is sentenced to death by court-martial that sentence cannot be operated until it is confirmed by the confirming authority.  In other words, there is that machinery for consideration of the sentence by the confirming authority which studies the evidence.</P>
    <P>But the great objection I have to the sentence of death by a military or any tribunal of that kind, such as a court-martial, is that the same rights are not available for the soldier as would be available for the ordinary citizen if he was charged with a grave offence and that, in those circumstances, it would be much better if the power to sentence to death was not enforceable by military court-martial.  I want to substitute for the provision of death <Col N="1371" /> the provision of penal servitude, because it is notorious in regard to military courts-martial in times of war or stress that they are inclined to act precipitately and to take a point of view in regard to an accused person that would not be taken if the matter were examined in the cold light of peace.  For that reason, I am anxious that the supreme penalty of death, if it is to be enforced, should only be enforced in accordance with ordinary law where the person concerned would be tried by a judge and a jury, and where such rights as exist in this State in regard to State assistance for his defence would be made available. If a court-martial, in the heat of an emergency or war situation, sentences a man to death and that sentence is executed, subsequently, when more information is available, it may be found that the conviction was wrong and that the sentence was wrong but then it would be too late to undo it.</P>
    <P>My view, in regard to it, is that if a sentence of penal servitude is imposed, which can be penal servitude for life, and if it is found subsequently that there has been an error, it is easy to release the particular person from custody, whereas if it is discovered that a person was shot, and was shot unjustly, or on evidence that subsequently transpired not to be sound evidence, he cannot be brought back to life.  For that reason I move that the punishment of death, where the offence is as set out in Section 124 and in the other sections which have been mentioned by the Ceann Comhairle, should be replaced by penal servitude.</P>

      <P>I find it hard, indeed, to understand the attitude behind these amendments.  First of all, I should like to reiterate what was said on the previous section.  We have to realise that this relates only to active service, and relations with an enemy, and to a situation where your normal, peaceful and peace-time procedures have no application because they simply cannot be applied.  The perturbation of war has made the application of ordinary peace-time standards impossible.  You are up against <Col N="1372" /> the brutal realities of war.  I have heard Deputy Cowan, in the course of the long debate on this Bill, put in a number of times the argument of invoking our own experience here.  That is no argument, because in fact we have not had, thanks be to God, in this country, experience to the full of what active service conditions mean, particularly active service conditions where the theatre of operations is immediately present.  Incidentally, these provisions only apply in the theatre of operations, if one reads the sections carefully, in the face of the enemy, and in contact with the enemy.</P>
      <P>There is no use talking about our past experience here.  It is not comparable to full-scale active service or full-scale action.  Let us soberly realise that we have not had experience of what I may call real wholesale war in this country, and all that that means, since the Williamite wars, generally speaking, and in local areas since 1798. You certainly had that situation in 1798, but not, I think, since that date have we really had all out active service conditions here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What really is involved here?  It is necessary, unfortunately, for the maintenance of discipline and morale to have these sanctions.  Deputy Cowan suggests penal servitude, and in his argument he seems to suggest civilian trials.  Let us look at it realistically. What possibility would there be of calling juries and of carrying out the whole paraphernalia of a civil trial under active service conditions in face of the enemy?  What chance would you have of doing that?  Let us be realists about this.  I know that Deputy Cowan has had military experience and that he can talk as a soldier.  I know that he is not unaware of these factors.  If I heard some of his arguments coming from somebody else I would be inclined to say that he was talking as an academic lawyer without any appreciation of the facts at all.  I can, however, see what has activated Deputy Cowan in moving his amendment, and in a certain sense, I sympathise with his aim.  The only proper answer to make, I think, is that here you have a brutal situation.  You are faced with <Col N="1373" /> all the realities of what it involves, and there is no choice of procedures. So much so is that the fact, that, in the immediate theatres of operation, where the operations were actually being conducted, it would probably be necessary that all, even non-combatant and non-military personnel would be treated alike and would be subject to the same restrictions.</P>
    <P>It would be a very nice legal nicety indeed in that situation to separate what you might call civil responsibility from responsibility touching on military matters.  Take a crime that always has carried the death sentence under the military code, the crime of rape.  If that is committed by a civilian, or if there is looting in the course of operations, you might argue that was a question of civilian responsibility, but it is not completely clear from having its military aspects for the very simple reason that if a civilian, any more than a soldier, indulges in that type of crime, he is a rotten apple and a source of demoralisation. He is, so to speak, the spark that sets the mob off in the wrong direction, and perhaps demoralises the whole corps in the area. It is necessary, because of that, to introduce into military law capital punishment for soldiers.  One can see that there is a very arguable case as to why a civilian, a non-combatant, committing the same crimes in the same circumstances, would not be amenable to military law, and to the same punishment because of their repercussions on the forces, and on all the other things that are involved.</P>
    <P>The brutal fact, again, is that where the animal passions are let loose, the weakness of fear and of self-preservation&mdash;where all these factors are likely to have free play in a situation where the normal restraints are not present, but where there is a coercive psychological influence in the other direction, the experience of the past in all armies and of all peoples who have had experience of active service, is that it is necessary to have this very severe punishment in order to safeguard the army and the community as well as to safeguard and <Col N="1374" /> maintain discipline and the troops on their mission.  That has not only been the experience of this country but it has been the universal experience in war.  Take any war you wish.  Perhaps the 1918 war is the classic example where, again and again, unfortunate men were executed because they forsook their posts under devastatingly trying conditions in the front line trenches.  Much has been written on that; many a soldier coming back from that war has written about it, and written about it in very scathing terms. But when one studies the subject one is forced to the conclusion that had it not been for these sanctions, whole sections of the defence would have been abandoned and it was, therefore, unfortunately a necessary military provision for holding one's positions.</P>
    <P>The sentence of death for cowardice has been there for a very long time, and there because it was a necessity. Let me not be the one to decry the natural bravery and honour of Irishmen, and the name of our men in all generations of our history.  I am speaking now in the presence of men on the front benches here who are in themselves a living testimony of that. On the other hand, we must be realists.  We are dealing with human nature.  We are dealing with the average man.  Any responsible staff, civil or military, advising a Minister would have to advise him to bring in such a provision as this and any serious-minded Minister would have to implement it.  Not only has that been necessary in the past, not only has it been necessary to have the capital sentence for these specific offences which may briefly be summed up as &ldquo;failure in the face of the enemy&rdquo; but it has been necessary to apply the same severe punishment to such things as looting, rape and other forms of indiscipline; and the real crux is not so much the indiscipline as the demoralisation which may spread if that indiscipline is not immediately checked.</P>
    <P>Let us take Deputy Cowan's proposal of penal servitude instead of death.  On humanitarian grounds we would all like to see such a provision. <Col N="1375" /> Let us consider for a moment the section to which it applies. Supposing one substituted penal servitude for a person who commits a number of these offences, for a person who fails to carry out an operation of war because he retires, refuses to fight or abandons his station &mdash;in other words, the man who runs away because he wants to get out; and very probably the man who will do that will only do it under the pressure of the instinct for self-preservation&mdash; what then will be the position?  The whole object in committing that offence was to get away.  If you substitute penal servitude you copperfasten it and give the offender exactly what he wants by locking him up. One would want pretty big prisons before one finished with an army on active service conditions if one started that kind of game.  One might as well not have the section at all if one were to incorporate in it a provision of that kind.</P>
    <P>Consider the position of the front line.  If this unfortunate who under dire distress very naturally and understandably seeks to preserve himself&mdash; I refrain from using the word fear because there is a certain ignominy attached to it; the fear that drags people back in face of danger is a very natural one; in some cases it is almost uncontrollable&mdash;the individual who retires from that position and subsequently finds himself safely locked up in prison will not worry about the years ahead because he has solved his immediate problem. Indeed, I think such a provision would be a temptation to him to run away. I am rather surprised at Deputy Cowan's insistence on this.  I sympathise with him and, as far as peace time is concerned, I would be with him all the way in his insistence on formality and the preservation of the rights of the accused and so on. That simply cannot be minimised and he has done a service in emphasising these points.</P>
    <P>In relation to active service, however, while I go so far with him as to say that every precaution should be taken to ensure justice and fair play, <Col N="1376" /> one has a very different set of circumstances to deal with as compared with peace time.  To legislate otherwise than is proposed here would be tantamount to introducing a very serious weakness into our defence framework.  One must remember that so long as the chance of war exists, and so long as human nature remains as it is, we must have regard to the fact that a military organisation is something apart. Because of that, there must always be a certain element of coercion and a certain element of compulsion.  The interests of the force <i>qua</i> force must always take a rather more important place than the interests of the individual, to a far greater extent than the interests of the community are relative to the interests of the individual in the ordinary state.</P>
    <P>These are the facts that must be faced if we contemplate having an army at all, and it is these unfortunate facts that we must contemplate in introducing this Bill.  These provisions are necessary if our Defence Forces should ever be called upon to fulfil their rôle.  We sincerely hope that necessity will never arise.  Let us, by all means, adopt the view that Deputy Cowan advocates in relation to peace-time provisions and the interim period; but when it comes to active service, let us not stultify the situation by introducing impossible concepts, perhaps ideally desirable in a Utopian situation but incapable of realisation.  Let us not introduce such concepts, because they are a potential danger.  Their introduction will, at best, work out a nullity.  If we adopt a realistic approach we will provide the proper safeguards in the direction the Deputy wants.  If we provide impossible safeguards, or if we provide no safeguards, then, in actual fact, we are leaving the position at the mercy of the coercive and horrible circumstances of war without any regulations or protection whatsoever. While I agree with much that the Deputy has said, especially in Committee, on various parts of this Bill, on this particular issue I have to differ from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have said all I have to say on Section 123 when we dealt with this whole subject.  I would be only doing what Deputy Cowan was <Col N="1377" /> doing, that is, repeating myself, if I were to continue.  But, once again, I want to impress on Deputy Cowan and on the House that Section 225 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A sentence of death passed by a court-martial and confirmed shall not be carried out unless and until the execution of the sentence has been approved by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that one of the most solemn occasions on which a Government can meet is when they have to discuss the question of a death sentence.  In these cases, the crime is the horrible one of wilful murder.  Yet I can assure the Deputy and the House that on occasions such as that the fullest possible consideration is given to every possible aspect of the crime before a decision is come to.  I can well understand that here, where the wilful committal of brutal murder is not concerned, the Government dealing with a matter of this kind would deal with it in the most sympathetic possible way.  That, I think, should remove any fear which Deputy Cowan, or any other Deputies who think like him might have.  I cannot go very much further without repeating myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point of view of Deputy Major de Valera and the Minister in regard to this matter, and I can fully understand it.  But the fact that a person has been a soldier does not really enter into the matter at all.  To me, anyway, this question of life and death is a very important thing.  In many civilised countries all over the world, and in some countries which, perhaps, in this country we might not call civilised, they do not impose, and are not in favour of, the death penalty.  Of course, the taking away of human life is always a very serious matter.  To-day, when certain Governments and Parliaments are considering this whole question of whether or not there should be a sentence of death at all, it would be a very bad thing if we in Parliament did <Col N="1378" /> not even consider the problem and just pass as a matter of course, the fact that, for the numerous offences set out in this Bill, you can sentence a person to death.</P>
      <P>I must accept the criticism that I am actuated by humanitarian motives.  I never like to see anyone executed.  I think that every person, no matter how grievous his crime or offence is, should get an opportunity of atoning for it in this life.  I am a great believer in what is known as the quality of mercy.  I am one of those who think that the taking away of human life is the gravest thing that can be done.  I do not see that this section is made any more effective by providing the sentence of death for the offences than it would be if there were a sentence of penal servitude.  It is right to say, of course, that this section is limited, not to active service, but to offences in relation to the enemy.  It goes some what further than the ordinary active service.  It does involve some relationship with the enemy.</P>
      <P>There is a provision which we will come to later in relation to prisoners of war.  There is mutiny with violence, not on active service, but in peace time, and mutiny with violence may result in death as well.  Deputy de Valera mentioned the question of rape but, strange to say, although that is a grievous offence, a person guilty of it cannot be condemned to death, as I understand it, because that is one of the offences in the ordinary law of the country for which the death penalty does not now exist.  In actual fact for that particular offence the sentence of death may not be imposed.</P>
      <P>There are my views in regard to the sentence of death.  I do not want to repeat what I said on the other sections.  I understand the Minister's point of view and I understand very fully the contribution which Deputy Major de Valera made but, nevertheless, I think it is a sign of greater civilisation when you can do away with this idea of the death penalty.  There is something uncivilised about this idea of taking upon oneself the right to execute a fellow human being.  It is because I have that view that I have put down this amendment.</P>

I hope that the efforts of world statesmen to-day will result in the elimination of wars at least in our part of the world, and if they do then we would not be worried very much in regard to the operation of this particular section.</P>

I think that in a case of this kind it is no harm that the matter of death sentence or penal servitude should be discussed when the Bill is going through the House, and on general humanitarian lines I would like to put on record that I do not think that the imposition of the death sentence makes the section any more effective than the penalty of penal servitude which at least leaves a man his life.</P>

I felt at the time, and I think there was general agreement with the view I had, that to put in a section like that would have the effect of completely nullifying the whole procedure under the redress of grievances section, and that when a soldier or an officer makes a complaint to the Minister or to his commanding officer that complaint should not be subject to an examination that would result in the individual being court-martialled, because in making his complaint he had made some false statement affecting an officer or soldier.  The Minister, having agreed to delete the words which he proposes to delete under amendment No. 100, in paragraphs (a) and (b), I think has improved the section and has removed fears that we held that a very important section affecting the rights of soldiers could be used to the detriment of the soldier and the officer.  In that case the whole machinery for dealing with grievances would have been nullified.  I am very pleased the Minister has brought forward the amendment.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Every person subject to military law who, being in command of a State ship or service aircraft, takes or receives on board, or allows to be carried, goods or merchandise that <Col N="1384" /> he is not authorised to take or receive on board is guilty of an offence against military law and shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment or any less punishment awardable by a court-martial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Instead of the words &ldquo;not authorised&rdquo; I want to substitute &ldquo;forbidden by orders or by law&rdquo; so that the sub-section would now read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every person subject to military law who, being in command of a State ship... allows to be carried, goods or merchandise that he is forbidden by orders or by law to take or receive on board shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, it is approaching the section in a different way from what is already there.  It is putting the onus on his superior authorities, on the law, to say what he may or may not take on board.  I think there is an important distinction here because if an officer in any ship happens to be at a port in France, Spain, Britain, Holland or somewhere else and takes some article on board that he is not specifically authorised to take on board, he commits an offence and I do not think that is right.  I think that the offence should be taking on board something that he is specifically prohibited by regulations or by law from taking on board.  If he disobeys regulations or the law of the country, let him face the music for that, but I think it is unfair to leave the section in such a way that if he takes something on board that he is neither prohibited nor permitted by law from taking, but simply takes on board something without being authorised to do so, he can be held to be guilty of an offence.  I think the Minister should accept the amendment because, from the ordinary point of view of justice and fair dealing, it would improve the provisions of the section.</P>

      <P>I can say that in the first flush of my examination of the wording proposed in the amendment, I, too, felt that it would be possible to use a word like &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;not authorised&rdquo;, but I had the <Col N="1385" /> matter examined by the legal authorities concerned and their view was that the use of the word &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; would necessitate listing the articles which a captain would be forbidden to take on board.  No matter how we would like to look at it, the fact is there, that so long as men visit foreign ports and move around the world, they will always endeavour to bring something home that is probably dutiable or forbidden in some way.  In their efforts to bring these things in, they not only break the regulations but get themselves into serious difficulties.  I do not know that the use of the word &ldquo;authorised&rdquo; is going to prevent that. I have my own views about it, but when I am assured that the use of the word &ldquo;authorised&rdquo; is necessary in regard to this section, I can only assume that that advice that has been given to me is the result of very careful examination by the authorities concerned. I remember that, at the Special Committee, Deputy Cowan suggested that a man taking a box of matches on board would be liable to be charged with an offence under this section.  Now, common sense teaches every one of us that that is the last thing in the world that anyone would interfere with or would suggest that it was in the nature of smuggling.  There are quite a number of articles that individuals might be anxious to bring home as presents which would not be interfered with, but there again, as Deputy Cowan knows, my attitude in dealing with a matter of that kind might not be the attitude of the customs officials.  I cannot accept this amendment in view of the very fact that I had it examined by people competent to express an opinion on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing we take that, you have two choices.  One of them has already been mentioned by the Minister.  You would have to prepare a positive list of prohibitions.  I <Col N="1386" /> do not think it needs any argument to show the impossibility of that situation. You would prohibit perfumes, nylons, whiskey or anything you liked from the smuggling point of view. You might prescribe other things from another point of view, but, having gone about and probably having employed a large number of officers in the Department, racking their brains to see what should be prohibited or prescribed, you would not have got very far before you got a case that would not be covered, because something which it should be really an offence to import, had not been included in the list formulated.  Any one of us who has had anything to do with the courts knows what happens in cases like that.  In fact, the Deputy, like myself, has been confronted with such lists before and has been able to get through them.</P>
      <P>I think we must accept what the Minister says, that that particular approach is ruled out.  There is another method, in fairness to Deputy Cowan. You could do it this way.  You could use Deputy Cowan's words and say: &ldquo;every person in command of a State ship or service aircraft shall not take anything on board except&rdquo;&mdash;and then proceed to define what he could take on board.  That decision like the other sounds very reasonable, but analyse that too and you will find that probably you ban him from taking aboard some very necessary article which is required either for service or something like that.  You have the smuggling case which the Minister seemed to be thinking of, and I can think of such things as safety in aircraft.  Take a box of matches.  You might feel you want to ban them from the point of view of safety in certain cases in aircraft. There was a time when that was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That simple case will immediately show you the difficulty you are in because you might want to ban matches from aircraft and it would be ridiculous to ban taking matches aboard an ordinary vessel at sea. When you look into the implications involved I think the Deputy should be able to agree that there does not seem to be any way out of it except by using <Col N="1387" /> this word &ldquo;authorise&rdquo;, the point being this: that the man going aboard or, as this section has it, &ldquo;any person subject to military law who takes or receives on board any article&rdquo;, is supposed only to take on board with him what is reasonably required or what is allowed to be taken on board.  That is what is meant by authorised.  Clearly he will not be authorised to take aboard a large number of other things, whether from the smuggling point of view, safety point of view or any other point of view which he might be forbidden to take aboard, such as spirits, for instance, from a medicinal point of view.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that we want to have something like that and the only simple way I can see out of it is to use the word &ldquo;authorise&rdquo;, and he is clearly and explicitly authorised to take aboard all he needs for his service. He would be implicitly authorised to take aboard such things as he might reasonably take aboard for his comfort, and he would clearly be authorised to take aboard a large number of other things which would be very difficult to specify in detail, or rather, I should say, not so much in detail as exhaustively.  If you use the word &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; you are caught. You have either got to define and list the forbidden articles or you have to forbid him to take anything aboard and define the permitted articles. Either course is objectionable.  Like the Minister, you can argue on the dangers in this and there is always certain danger in provisions of this nature.  But&mdash;let us face it&mdash;our whole criminal law is full of that kind of danger, and more and more as time goes on it becomes apparent that one of the things we have to guard against is the tendency to have such width as may possibly be abused.  That is a hard fact.  The unfortunate thing about this is that I do not think anybody has been able to think of a better way of putting it and I certainly do not think the Deputy's suggestion would meet it, as we pointed out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <P>&ldquo;Authorise&rdquo; is a peculiar word, and I do not like it here.  The customs code in every country states what you are not to bring in and, without going to much trouble, there is a huge list there already and I can see no great difficulty in a regulation being issued that the law relating to customs must be observed by every officer, N.C.O. or man coming aboard any ship.  Then you might get down to other things that would not be dutiable and it is then only a question of what might endanger the ship.  A man might want to take aboard &ldquo;the eye of the little yellow god&rdquo; which might bring a curse on the ship or something like that, which would get him into trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The captain is in trouble anyway.  It is a very difficult question but the Minister has told us that he has had it examined by his legal advisers and that common sense will govern the operation of it.  I feel after taking everything into consideration it is very difficult to improve on that particular wording.  I think that in view of the Minister's opinion, we should pass the section and not make it more difficult, because I think that by putting in the phrase &ldquo;forbidden by orders or by law&rdquo; there could be many things still left out that were not listed by orders or by law and that could still get a commander into trouble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw the difficulty that was in this section when I read it and I want to say right away that I accept what the Minister says&mdash;that he has had this examined by the legal authorities.  But I am inclined to the view that the Army legal authorities examined it from the point of view of military law, from the point of view of the making of a charge against a commander now and again.  Certainly the wording that is there makes it easier for them to draft a charge against a commander than my wording, and I am not concerned with what legal officers think about it being easy to charge or not to charge; I am concerned about what offence we should create here and if a person brings on board something which he should not bring on board then he commits an offence.  But if he brings something on board, something about which there is no direction given and if he brings it on in good faith, under the section as it stands he can be charged and convicted for bringing on board or allowing to be brought on board an article that was not specifically authorised.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera has dealt with the two points.  Before anything can be brought on board, even the box of matches which the Minister mentioned, if that is brought on board without authorisation, an offence is created. That is why I think it is unfair to the commanders of ships that there should be a loose section like that which allows them to be charged if they themselves, or anybody else in the ship's company or in the crew of the aircraft, bring on board something that is not specifically authorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for example, an aircraft flying to Paris or a ship going to Amsterdam. The captain can bring nothing on board in Amsterdam, and no member of the crew can bring anything on board.  Similarly in Paris in regard to the aircraft, unless there is authority given, and apparently it cannot be given by the commander.  It must be given by somebody else.  Apparently, under this it would have to be given by the Minister or by some superior of the captain of the ship or the aircraft. If going to Paris they might have authority to take back some nice <Col N="1390" /> views of the beautiful buildings in that city or to bring back a fancy hat or a pipe from Amsterdam.  The difficulty is that once the commander allows anything to be brought in that is not specifically authorised, he can be charged.  That is why I am asking the Minister to meet the House by saying that he would agree to have this reexamined again before it is dealt with in the Seanad or during the time the Bill is there.</P>
    <P>I want to put in the phrase that the commander commits an offence if he brings anything in that he is forbidden by orders or by law to bring in.  It could be set out in very simple wording that no article, the import of which is prohibited by our customs, can be taken on board a vessel in Amsterdam or in Paris.  That is what Deputy MacEoin referred to.  That is where the order could bring the whole operation of the customs law into it.  There could also be a general regulation that nothing could be brought on board that would endanger the ship or the aircraft.  Similarly, there could be a clause in other provisions that there were certain specific articles which were not to be brought on board.  It would certainly be very unfair, if the commander of a ship was charged with an offence because he himself brought in, say, a bottle of some foreign liqueur.  I think that sailors all over the world avail of the opportunity of bringing in samples of special liqueurs or wines which are available at a cheap price in the countries they visit. The trouble under this section is that if these are brought in without specific authority the officer can be convicted and is liable to suffer imprisonment or any less punishment awarded by a court-martial.  I am always afraid of a section that is left in the stage of &ldquo;not authorised&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, then there is every reason to accept the amendment which I have proposed.  If it is a fact that the commander of a ship or of an aircraft is well aware of what he can take on board, then if he takes on board anything other than that he can commit an offence&mdash;as I say in my amendment if he takes on board something that is forbidden either by order or by law.  There may be some simple little things that a man takes a fancy to.  If he brings these in, he can be charged under that section without any difficulty because it can be said that he had no authority to bring in a small picture, a small engraving or something of that kind.  He is told that he was not authorised to bring these in, and that, therefore, it is an offence.</P>
      <P>At the Special Committee I mentioned a case that I appeared in at a court-martial.  The offence against the person charged was that he had consumed a bottle of stout in the course of a long drive from Tralee to Cork. It certainly came as a surprise to me, and to many other people, that he could be charged with, and convicted of, that offence because he was not authorised to take the bottle of stout on duty.  That is why I am afraid of this particular business of &ldquo;not authorised&rdquo;.  I would much prefer if the Minister would accept the wording that I have in my amendment or some other wording that would make the commander responsible if he disobeyed some rule, law, regulation or order.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 120:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 73, Section 167 (4), line 38 to delete &ldquo;not.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (4) of this section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (3) of this section shall not be construed as affecting the generality of sub-section (1) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to delete the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; so that the sub-section will read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (3) of this section shall be construed as affecting the generality of sub-section (1) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> Although it is a very simple amendment to delete the word &ldquo;not,&rdquo; it has certain important repercussions. Section 167 is the famous Section 68 of the old Act which is known by everybody who has ever had anything to do with the Defence Forces for the last 30 years or more.  I do not think anybody has ever gone through the Army without having brought before him the old Section 68 in one way or another.  That has always been a much abused section, abused from the point of view of denunciation and from the point of view of exercise, because in the Army when you could not &ldquo;get&rdquo; a man on anything else you always fell back on Section 68.</P>
    <P>The importance of the amendment makes it necessary briefly to look at the section.  Section 167 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every person subject to military law who commits any act, conduct, disorder or neglect to the prejudice of good order and discipline is guilty of an offence against military law and shall on conviction by court-martial, be liable....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) (a) says that a person shall not be charged under this section with an offence against military law. Then there is a saving clause which says that if he is so charged his trial will not be prejudiced thereby.  Sub-section (3) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this section the contravention (by act or omission) by any person of any of the provisions of this Act or any regulations, orders or instructions published for the general information and guidance of that portion of the Defence Forces to which that person belongs or to which he is attached, or any general, garrison, unit, station, standing or local orders, is an act, conduct, disorder, or neglect to the prejudice of good order and discipline....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the generality of what it is. The next paragraph says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An attempt to commit any offence which is, by virtue of any previous section contained in this Chapter, an offence against military law is, unless such attempt is in <Col N="1398" /> itself an offence against military law under that section, an act, conduct, disorder, or neglect to the prejudice of good order and discipline.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we come to the sub-section I am dealing with which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (3) of this section shall not be construed as affecting the generality of sub-section (1) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, sub-section (1) is in the widest possible terms.  The sub-section says that you are not to charge a man with an offence under this section if you can capture him somewhere else but, even if you do, there is no harm done and, if he is convicted, the conviction is valid.</P>
    <P>Then it sets out in sub-section (3) to interpret what an offence under this section is.  I would be satisfied with that because I see that you do limit the section at least to reasonable military offences.  But sub-section (4) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (3) of this section shall not be construed as affecting the generality of sub-section (1) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, there is no necessity for sub-section (3) at all or of any of sub-section (4).  I am proposing in this amendment to leave out the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; and to make it specific that sub-section (3) of the section shall affect the generality of sub-section (1). In other words, the generality of sub-section (1) shall be construed in accordance with the very wide interpretation given to it in sub-section (3).</P>
    <P>I am particularly keen on this because, as I say, it does not matter what we do here in creating offences against military law or anything else if we leave this Section 167 in the way it is.  Then a person who parts his hair on the wrong side can be guilty of some offence against military law if his commanding officer thinks that it in some way offends his aesthetic sense. I ask the Minister to agree to my amendment.  It is a very small amendment as it appears on the Order Paper, but it has very wide effects as far as the section is concerned.  I should like <Col N="1399" /> to hear the Minister's views in regard to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this at very great length in the Special Committee and as a result of the discussions which took place I have had this matter very carefully examined.  It does seem to an ordinary person a very simple matter to delete the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; in the sub-section, but the effect of deleting the word would be such that it would practically leave us disarmed, so to speak.  After careful examination, I do not think that it would be possible for me to accept the amendment. We argued all this out at the Special Committee.  We did not vote on it at that time, but I thought I had more or less satisfied the Deputy.  I undertook to have it examined.  That may perhaps be the reason why we did not divide on the matter, but having had it examined I am advised now that the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; is a very necessary addition to the sub-section.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to agree with Deputy Cowan that this is the best-known section of the Defence Forces Acts of 1923 and since.  It has been known as the commanding officers' sheet anchor to get the fellow that you could not get under anything else, because it is possible to charge an officer, an N.C.O. or a man with conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline in that he did do anything.  He could be charged and he would be put to the trouble of going through a trial and you could give him a hard time of it.  I do not know why we have it at all in a sense, because the offences are clearly enough laid down, but if we must have it I think it should be left with its full effect and we would know that we are setting out under this to give the commanding officer power that if an officer, an N.C.O. or a man serving under him becomes obnoxious he can give him the works somehow without just throwing him out by the back of the neck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember feeling that I had no redress at one particular time when I wanted to throw an officer out, and he deserved to be thrown out, and the legal officer in the place said: &ldquo;Do <Col N="1400" /> not throw him out that way.  We will throw him out under a charge that he was guilty of conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline in that he did&mdash;&rdquo; and he was thrown out. Instead of having to assault him by throwing him out physically he was thrown out through this process of law.  It is the commanding officer or general officers' sheet anchor.  It is something to use if the person becomes impossible to live with&mdash;and there is no army in the world that does not get a fellow like that in it at some stage, and there is no army in the world that has not to call upon that to get rid of him.  The only thing is that it ought to be used with discretion.  Mind you, to put it into a permanent Act, I am afraid of it.  I do not like it.  I am not going to say that I am a lawyer to decide that the amendment would make it more acceptable, but the Minister says that he has had it examined and it would practically nullify the section.  If that is so, I think we have to leave it there, but I would like the Minister to have it fully examined to see do we want this confounded section at all.  If it could be done without I think we should do without it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always, I must say, during my whole army career had a very serious prejudice against this particular section.  I hated the section, because whenever one was called upon in a judicial capacity to deal with soldiers one had this section trotted out day after day. It did not matter what the man was brought in for, he was brought in under Section 68.  It did not matter whether he broke barrack orders, standing orders, mess orders, brigade orders, orders relating to sentries&mdash;it did not matter what it was alleged he broke, he came in under Section 68.  I would not mind so very much about that, but you have the position of a young soldier perhaps full of beans, in the best of form, going out happy with the whole world, a smile on his face and his face beaming like the sun on a summer's morning; he meets a cranky, cantankerous sergeant with perhaps a liver or after a bad night, who certainly has the appearance of <Col N="1401" /> gloom on his face, and he is offended and annoyed when he sees this beaming young fellow passing him, and the next thing is that he has him up under Section 68 for passing him in an offensive way.</P>
      <P>That is the sort of conduct I have an objection to.  In so far as it could be brought for the breach of any military regulation I do not mind.  Deputy MacEoin has referred to some of the people that it is impossible to live with.  Of course he is perfectly right, but it is not so much a subordinate that it is impossible to live with&mdash;very often it is the superior who is impossible to live with, and it is in the superior ranks, whether it is a superior non-commissioned officer or in the superior officer ranks, that you get the bad livers and the bad stomachs.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputies allow me to intervene?  In the course of the debate in the Special Committee I was so concerned about this that even there I went to the trouble of finding out what were the types of charges that would be preferred against individuals under this particular section, and these are the type of crimes which I got.  They are not terribly serious but they are crimes nevertheless.  I find cases such as passing bad cheques, <Col N="1402" /> giving false names to the police, improperly obtaining money in return for a railway warrant, producing a medical certificate knowing it is not genuine, borrowing money from subordinates, wrongfully opening official letters, fighting in a public street, attempting to induce a military policeman to neglect his duty, knowingly making an application for an allowance in excess of entitlement, an officer drinking on duty with N.C.O.s and men, altering the date on a leave pass, reporting sick without undue cause.  These were the actual cases which I was given, and they are serious, every one of them, although they may appear to be humorous enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could imagine, of course, that the Army legal authorities would be asked for a record of that sort of thing and would go to their court-martial files and they would see where an officer or a soldier was charged with passing bad cheques.  Of course, in regard to the cheque issues, if an officer passes or gives a cheque which bounces he has not infrequently been charged with scandalous conduct unbecoming an officer, which is a very serious offence.  Giving false names to the police, wrongly opening letters&mdash; these would all be offences that would have been preferred against a soldier or an officer at courts-martial and in respect of which the records were available.  But there are those hundreds of other cases that the legal officers in the ordinary way would not know about that are dealt with in the unit every day.  Unless there is a fine it would not appear even in the unit orders, but they come up day after day.  Every conceivable thing that could be thought of has been used under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that it has been used for the purpose of creating a kind of what I would term minor tyranny in regard <Col N="1403" /> to soldiers.  It has been used to maintain very bad customs, and certainly it has been used to terrify young soldiers. Wrong conduct, which the Minister terms a serious matter, could be dealt with in other ways.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes disciplinary regulations.  There is a very wide code of disciplinary regulations issued by the Minister and in operation.  A breach of any one of these Defence Force regulations or general routine orders is always dealt with under Section 68 or Section 167 as we have it now.  A breach of barrack standing orders used to be brought under Section 141 of the old Act but all these things that the Minister says are wrongful could be included in orders made by the battalion, the barracks or the Minister in any of the disciplinary regulations that may be issued under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I see an old friend of mine at the very bottom&mdash;&ldquo;reporting sick without due cause&rdquo;.  I do not know how many cases of that type there have been but I do know certainly there was one case in which the soldier concerned decided that he would have his trial in the public gaze&mdash;in other words, that the Press would be invited to be present at his court-martial.  Members of the Press were present and they reported it fully.  The court-martial decided that he was guilty of the offence of reporting sick without due cause but, within a couple of days, the confirming authority decided that he was wrongfully convicted and he was released from his obligations under the conviction. I distinctly remember that.  Of course it is a very serious thing if a soldier reports sick to a doctor and the doctor instead of finding out he is in fact ill, decides that he should not have come at all and uses his disciplinary position to have the soldier punished under Section 168 rather than use his medical position to find whether, in fact, there is anything wrong with the soldier.  There have not been many of these charges recently; they are discountenanced now and I think doctors nowadays would be afraid to charge an offence such as that because there was a further example of a doctor in the Army doing that and it was discovered <Col N="1404" /> some weeks afterwards by X-ray examination in St. Bricin's Hospital that the man was in fact very seriously ill at the time he reported to the doctor yet he was charged under Section 168 with reporting sick without due cause.</P>
    <P>When a soldier joins the Army, this Bill gives the Minister and all his superior authorities the widest powers to make disciplinary regulations governing his conduct and character. If the section is passed in this form and the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; is left in sub-section (4), then the tyrannical system I have mentioned enabling any superior, from a corporal right up to a general, to have his own views as to how a person under him may behave, not in a military sense but perhaps in a civilian sense, will be continued.  As I say it has been exercised very continuously in the Army to the detriment of young soldiers, particularly of the junior ranks.  Now we have not reached the stage of freedom that they have in the American Army; we have not that here but I think it is desirable that our soldiers should have more freedom and liberty than they have and that the disciplinary restrictions are sufficient without enabling commanding officers and superiors to exercise the sort of control and power that this section enables them to exercise.  True, the fact of bringing a charge against a soldier does not necessarily mean that the soldier must be convicted of that charge but everybody in the Army gets into this peculiar groove, as to the effect of Section 168, that to be charged with an offence under it, is almost a certainty that you are going to be convicted of that offence.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to agree with what I have suggested here and leave it to the disciplinary provisions and regulations made by superior officers or by the Minister himself to govern matters in regard to discipline. If that were done, there would be more freedom for the soldier in his off-duty hours, in his barrack room, his mess, his dining hall, his canteen or anywhere else.  He is subject, as I say, very often to the bad liver or the upset stomach of his superior officer, while the superior officer has the powers that are given to him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps.  I have had so many instances that I just cannot remember some of the best examples of abuses of this section by the Army.  I think that if the suggested amendment were made, soldiers or officers, no matter what their rank, would be able to meet their superiors when they were doing their duty as man to man and as I think they are entitled to meet them.  They would be entitled to stand on their own feet, to assert their own individuality and not be reduced to the type of machine that has always to be standing to attention, saying &ldquo;sir&rdquo; and saluting.  I do not suppose we will ever reach&mdash;not for many years at any rate&mdash;the freedom of the American soldier.  An example of that has been given where a soldier went into his general and said: &ldquo;General, can I have the car to-night?&rdquo;  And the general said: &ldquo;Certainly, certainly.&rdquo; I think it was a British officer who was present and he said: &ldquo;Does that happen very often?&rdquo;  And the general replies: &ldquo;No, not so often.  They generally take the car without asking for it!&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We cannot have that conception of relationship between officer and soldier here.  We have the conception of the relationship that is always based on the fact that the superior is superior, that he is superior in everything whether he is on or off duty.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that section and delete that word &ldquo;not&rdquo;, and avoid the dangers and the troubles that have been mentioned.</P>

      <P>Section 168 deals with offences punishable by ordinary law and it makes those offences offences against military law.  Paragraph (e) of the section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;if he is convicted of any offence not before in this sub-section particularly specified, which when committed in the State is punishable by the law of the State, be liable, whether the offence is committed in the State or elsewhere either to suffer any punishment assigned for such offence by the law of the State or, if he is subject to military law as an officer, dismissal with ignominy from the Defence Forces or any less punishment awardable by a court-martial or, if he is subject to military law as a man, imprisonment or any less punishment awardable by a court-martial.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What I propose there is to delete the words &ldquo;whether the offence is committed in the State or elsewhere&rdquo;, so that the section would read that if he is convicted of any offence not before in this sub-section particularly specified which when committed in the State is punishable by the law of the State, he would be liable to suffer the punishments that are laid down there.

      <P>(IV) Admonishment</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net effect of this amendment is to create a new form of punishment which will be lesser than the punishment provided in the section.  The section provides that an authorised officer &mdash;for convenience we will call him a company commander &mdash; has powers under the section when he deals with a charge to dismiss it or to deal with it in other ways referred to in the section. He has powers in certain circumstances to impose a fine not exceeding £5, to impose severe reprimand, to impose reprimand, and I want to give him power also to impose admonishment which would be something less in the scale than reprimand.  A reprimand in military language is considered rather serious punishment.  I can <Col N="1408" /> visualise circumstances where the officers investigating the charge may wish to impose a very minor form of punishment not amounting to a reprimand, and if the Minister accepted admonishment it would be the least form of punishment that could be imposed by the investigating officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little surprised at the Deputy wanting to put this in as a punishment, because that is what its effect would be.  If we were to insert the word &ldquo;admonishment&rdquo;, as the Deputy suggests, we would simply be adding another form of punishment to those that already exist.  At the present time admonishment is administered in the case of certain types of incidents, and it merely counts as a warning.  It is not a punishment.  It can have no effect on an officer's advancement. If his name comes up for promotion the fact that he was admonished does not appear on his record. If it is put in now as a punishment, then it must appear on his record. Heretofore, I can say that, while I may have been informed that an officer was admonished, it did not mean anything serious, and in no way affected his chances of promotion.  I suggest to the Deputy that he ought not to insist on having the word &ldquo;admonishment&rdquo; added to the series of punishments mentioned in the section.</P>

      <P>The difference in viewpoint on this between the Minister and myself is not too large.  I want to correct something that I said when I was opening on this amendment.  I referred to the company commander who motors around.  This refers to an investigation by an authorised officer who, generally, would be an officer of senior rank and would be authorised by the Adjutant-General to investigate the charge against an officer.  He would have the right to impose a fine, to give a severe reprimand or a reprimand. I wanted to include this new punishment, if you can call it that, of admonishment.  In other words, if the <Col N="1409" /> authorised officer, having heard the man's story thought that he should not reprimand him he would just admonish him which is the official way of advising him.  What, in effect, the Minister says is that they have a little way amongst themselves which is not authorised by law whereby, when an officer does something, they just do not like to charge him.  They say that they admonish him and put a note to that effect on his file.  It is left there, and is an informal way of expressing their disapproval of something he has done. I am suggesting that if we put in the word &ldquo;admonishment&rdquo; in the section it will nullify the other form of admonishment which they are exercising at the moment in a friendly sort of fashion.  I will leave the matter at that.  I have, of course, expressed my views at this friendly way which they have in the Army of noting a thing down on a file and calling it an admonishment.  Apparently, there is no grave objection to it, and we can leave it there for the moment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 132:</P>
      <P>In page 77, Section 176 (3) (c), to delete all words after &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in line 42 down to and including &ldquo;section&rdquo; in line 45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is that, under the section, if the authorised officer investigating a case is of opinion that he should deal with it by means of a fine, or if his proposal involves a deduction from pay or if he wants to make an order under subparagraph (f) which again involves the payment of money, he will ask the officer concerned whether he wants to be dealt with by him or to be remanded for trial by court-martial.  I want to ensure that if an officer is charged with any offence before an authorised officer&mdash;for convenience, I will call him a commanding officer&mdash; and if the commanding officer thinks that the officer is guilty of the offence, then I think the officer should have the right to say that he wants to have the charge investigated by court-martial. The matter is very important because the commanding officer <Col N="1410" /> may say to himself: &ldquo;I am finding this fellow guilty, and I am going to give him a severe reprimand&rdquo;, and at the end of it the officer has no redress and no right of appeal.</P>
    <P>The officer charged may be of opinion that he is not guilty of the offence and may wish to have the charge tried by court-martial at which five officers will hear the evidence against him and before whom he can be represented legally and can make the defence that is open to him by calling witnesses.  I think that in those circumstances he should have the right to say that he would like to have the case tried by court-martial especially if the commanding officer thinks he is guilty of the offence.  If the section goes through as it stands, it is only when the commanding officer proposes to fine him a sum not exceeding £5 or to forfeit some of his pay or to make him pay some money under a subsequent paragraph, that the officer concerned has the right to apply for a court-martial. If the officer has the right to look for a court-martial where the commanding officer proposes to fine him £1, I say that he should have the right to ask for a court-martial in the case where the commanding officer proposes to give him a severe reprimand. If there is one thing which has a very bad effect it is a sense of grievance. If a commanding officer says: &ldquo;I will not fine you £1; I will give you a severe reprimand for this offence and that will be recorded on your personal file; I will not give you the right to go for a court-martial&rdquo; then the accused officer will labour under a grave sense of grievance.  Where an officer is charged with an offence he should, therefore, have the right to have that offence examined and dealt with by a court-martial if he thinks he is not guilty of the offence and can establish that to the satisfaction of a court-martial.  That is the effect of the amendment I propose here.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to imagine in what circumstances an officer who was merely reprimanded would be anxious to seek a court-martial. These punishments are graded gradually up or down, whichever way one looks at them, and I can hardly <Col N="1411" /> imagine where a senior officer examines a case carefully and decides that the act committed by the officer will be sufficiently punished by a reprimand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the officer concerned, who may be the type that dearly loves a legal argument, should be allowed the opportunity of insisting on a court-martial.  Even if the officer did insist on a court-martial&mdash; and I can hardly believe that there is such an individual&mdash;the State must be taken into consideration.  A court-martial is not a very simple thing.  It consists of five officers, one of whom must have the rank of colonel.  These would have to be taken away from their normal duties; a court would have to be formed and would have to sit for probably some hours; they might have to travel some distance to examine a case which might be quite trivial in its nature and could be dealt with on the spot by a reprimand. Remember, a reprimand is not a very serious thing.  Even a severe reprimand is not very serious.  Certain penalties are inflicted for certain types of indiscretions but reprimands are not regarded as being very serious. I do not believe they would operate against an officer who was in line for promotion.  However that may be, I cannot understand why the Deputy would suggest that we should open up all this machinery to deal with something that can be dealt with in a simple manner where an intelligent, common-sense, senior officer is satisfied after his own personal investigation that the case can be met by a reprimand, severe or otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the Minister's reasoning.  His argument is based on the fact that there might be a lot of trouble involved in assembling a court-martial, and that an officer who looks for a court-martial when he is merely going to be severely reprimanded is a peculiar type of individual whose mental outlook it is difficult to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The punishment is not the important thing.  The important thing is the conviction.  The fact that an officer is found guilty of disobeying an order, or commits some other offence, is the important thing where another officer is authorised to deal with the offence.  If the offending officer thinks he is not guilty, then it is only right that he should have the opportunity of having that case examined by a court-martial. That right is given to him in this section if the commanding officer proposes to fine him £1.  Before he can fine him £1 he must ask him: &ldquo;Do you wish me to deal with this summarily or do you wish to go for court-martial?&rdquo; If we give him the right to go to court-martial in relation to a fine of £1 why should he not have the right to go for court-martial where the punishment is a severe reprimand?  But it is not the punishment that is the important <Col N="1413" /> thing.  It is the fact of being convicted of an offence and having that conviction recorded against him; that may have the effect of delaying his promotion; it may have the effect of preventing his promotion altogether.  That is the issue.</P>
    <P>If the commanding officer proposes to fine him one shilling he must give him the option of having a trial by court-martial.  A fair commanding officer will do that.  An unfair commanding officer, and there can be unfair commanding officers, will deliberately set out to convict the officer and impose a punishment on him which will not entitle him to have his case tried by court-martial and will blacken his record deliberately for the purpose of doing damage.  It is to prevent that sort of thing that I propose this amendment.</P>
    <P>If the House looks at the section it will see that where a commanding officer proposes to deal with an ordinary soldier, and if the punishment involves so much as one shilling of his pay the commanding officer must give that soldier the right to say that he wants to have the offence tried by court-martial.  It is part of the ordinary machinery of the Army, that an allegation against an officer will be examined fairly and if the officer is not guilty of the offence he must be honourably acquitted.  I think it is very wrong and very improper to give an officer the right to destroy a fellow-officer's career by imposing on him a punishment for an offence of which his fellow-officer is not guilty, and of which a court-martial, if he was before it, would find him not guilty.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that for many years in the Army, right up to the Emergency when it was necessary to bring in these provisions in regard to authorised officers, the matter of punishment by commanding officers of officers was eliminated altogether.  An officer always had an opportunity of being tried by court-martial for an offence, and to be tried by court-martial does not mean to be convicted. To be tried by court-martial means that the case against an officer would be very fully gone into and <Col N="1414" /> examined and, if he is entitled to the benefit of any doubt, he will get that benefit from the court-martial.  If the court-martial acquits him, his record is clear, his personal file in the department is clear of any blot and his promotion is in no way retarded.  So that one way we cannot do it is that we cannot say that it may mean a little upset to convene a court-martial to try an officer to whom the commanding officer only proposes to award a severe reprimand.  An officer knows he is charged with an offence of which he is not guilty.  He knows that the commanding officer in finding him guilty is doing something unjust and unfair and he is entitled to have his case examined by a court-martial and determined in his favour.</P>
    <P>That is the issue that is here.  If the commanding officer proposes to fine him a shilling, if the decision of the commanding officer would involve one shilling of his pay, he should be entitled to have his case tried by court-martial. In these circumstances, the right should be given to him when he is before his commanding officer to ask for trial by court-martial, as proposed in this amendment.</P>
    <P>We have the very same provisions in civil law.  If a person comes before a justice charged with a particular offence, the justice asks him whether he wishes to be dealt with summarily or whether he wishes to have his case dealt with by a jury in the Criminal Court.  In every case in which a man knows he is innocent and is afraid that one single individual, the justice, might convict him on the evidence, he always asks for the right to appeal to a judge and 12 men of a jury knowing that before them he can establish his innocence.  If we give that right to any person charged in the Criminal Court we should give a similar right to an officer charged with an offence as to which a verdict of guilty may ruin his whole career.</P>
    <P>That is the point I am making to the Minister.  If the officer is denied that right he will suffer from a sense of grievance.  He will always feel that he was unjustly treated, that he was convicted of an offence of which he was not guilty, that he was deliberately denied the opportunity of having his <Col N="1415" /> case examined by a court-martial.  I have known grievances of that kind to operate on the minds of individual officers to such an extent that after a period their health broke down and they had to be invalided out of the Defence Forces.  The one thing that we cannot have in the Army is any sense of grievance, if we can avoid it. If it were proposed to fine an officer one shilling then I say we have the right to ask that his case should be examined by a court-martial.</P>

      <P>(4)  A court-martial shall not have jurisdiction to try any person subject to military law for an offence which is by virtue of paragraphs (a) (b) (c) or (d) of sub-section (1) of section 168 triable by court-martial unless a certificate is issued under the hand of the Attorney-General consenting to the trial of that person by court-martial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> It proposes to insert a new sub-section. Section 168 is the section which makes ordinary law offences such as treason, murder, manslaughter, rape, etc., offences that may be dealt with by court-martial, and this Section 190 deals with the jurisdiction of courts-martial; and sub-section (1) gives jurisdiction to try any person for an offence against military law committed by such person while subject to military law as an officer or man.  Then a local or limited court-martial, as it is called, shall not have jurisdiction to try any person for any offence against military law committed by such person while subject to military law as an officer, to try any person who is for the time being an officer, to try any person for the offence of treason or murder, or to award to any person any sentence greater than imprisonment.  A court-martial shall not have jurisdiction to try any person subject to military law for the offences I have mentioned&mdash; treason, murder, manslaughter, or rape &mdash;unless such offence was committed while he was on active service.  I wanted to put in the additional provision that it would not have jurisdiction to try any of those offences unless there was a certificate issued under the Attorney-General's hand consenting to the trial of that person by court-martial.</P>

      <P>I am not accepting that because first of all this only applies to active service conditions and it is quite reasonable to assume that if the conditions were of a very severe type it would not be possible in many circumstances to get the Attorney-General. That is a possibility.  But it would only be in circumstances of active service that any of these crimes would be tried by a court-martial.  In ordinary circumstances they would be tried by the civil court and the question would not arise.</P>

      <P>The only thing I feel about this is that by accepting Deputy Cowan's amendment you would prevent a person standing trial twice. The point I see in Deputy Cowan's amendment is that when the Attorney-General agrees to try him for these offences by court-martial, at least by <Col N="1421" /> inference if the court-martial acquits him or anything like that he is not put on his peril again&mdash;that it would prevent a second trial.  Even under active service conditions if a person subject to military law is tried for any of these offences, when that is over and he is acquitted or some punishment is ordered the civil arm can still step in again and the person is then put on his peril twice on the same facts.  It has been argued that you should only be put on your peril once on the same facts; and by Deputy Cowan's amendment, with the certificate of the Attorney-General being given that would more or less be a certificate that if he was tried by court-martial and the verdict given in the case, either favourable or convicting him, he would not then be put on trial again.  I think that is the only value of Deputy Cowan's amendment and I would like the Minister to consider it from that angle.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 147:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 85, to insert in Section 190 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  (a)  The Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice, may make regulations with regard to the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on courts-martial by Section 168 and may in particular by the regulations provide that the exercise of such jurisdiction shall depend on the consent of such civil authority as may be specified in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  A certificate under the hand of the officer convening a court-martial for the trial of a civil offence certifying that as respects such trial the consent referred to in paragraph (a)  of this sub-section has been <Col N="1422" /> obtained shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of that fact.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the decision to delete any provision for dual trials, it became necessary to provide some alternative method of ensuring that in the case of offences against the civil code the jurisdiction of the civil power will not be interfered with.  The proposed method is that set out in this amendment, namely, to provide that a court-martial will not have jurisdiction to deal with an offence against the civil code unless conditions set out in regulations are, where applicable, complied with.  It is envisaged that these regulations will provide that, for instance, where the offence is against the person or property of a civilian, the agreement of the local chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána will have to be obtained before the case is tried by court-martial.  Failure to comply with the regulations will make the trial an invalid one and will enable the civil authorities to proceed with the proper civil trial.  I think that Deputies will agree that this is a desirable provision and that they will accept it.  It was following discussions in the Special Committee that this amendment was drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 149:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>Section 192 as it stood provided for the hearing of proceedings of a court-martial <i>in camera.</i>  The section provided that whenever a court-martial was satisfied that it was expedient in the public interest to exclude any particular person or persons not immediately concerned in the proceedings from the place in which the court-martial was being held the court could exclude that person or persons from the court-martial. That was the original section to which strong exception was taken in the Special Committee.  The matter was considered by the Minister as a result of the discussions in committee and the Minister brought in the new section now proposed in the amendment. Sub-section (1) of that section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) of this section courts-martial shall be public and to the extent that accommodation permits the public shall be admitted to the trial&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" />&ldquo;Where the convening authority or the president of a court-martial considers that it is expedient in the interests of public safety, defence or public morals that the public should be excluded during the whole or any part of a trial, either of them may make an order to that effect and any such order shall be recorded in the proceedings of the court-martial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Witnesses, other than the prosecutor and the accused person, shall not be admitted to a trial except when under examination or by specific leave of the president of the court-martial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) goes on to recite:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On any deliberation amongst the members of a court-martial, no person shall be present except the members, the judge advocate and any officers under instruction and the court-martial may either retire or cause the place where they sit to be cleared of all other persons not entitled to be present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In regard to sub-sections (1), (3) and (4) of that section, no one can take any exception.  I am proposing in my amendment to delete sub-section (2), the sub-section which gives the convening authority or the president of the court-martial power to exclude the public.  In other words, I suggest that the court-martial should be open to the public.  It should be like any other court trial, open to the Press, and it should be open to the public in so far as the public can get in.  Up to the present, for the last 30 years, every court-martial in the Defence Forces was an open court.  It might be attended by any member of the public, by an officer or soldier who happened to be free from duty, unless he was a person who was a witness in the particular case.  There has been a feeling that a court-martial is a closed court and that nobody can get in to it.  Of course that is a mistake.</P>
    <P>I want to say that I appreciate very fully the efforts the Minister has made to meet the wishes of the Special Committee in regard to this particular section but I oppose sub-section (2) <Col N="1425" /> for the purpose of having this matter of public courts fully considered by the House.  This provision in regard to the &ldquo;interests of public safety&rdquo; or &ldquo;defence of public morals,&rdquo; is a very wide power given to the convening authority or the president.  The president may be of opinion that it is not in the interests of public safety that a court-martial dealing, say, with the theft of stores from a barrack, should be in public.  I feel that that power to declare a court closed in the interests of public safety is entirely too wide and that it may be exercised detrimentally to the public interest. Similarly, if the president thinks that a matter of defence is involved he may come to a like decision.  Of course if it is some matter of military equipment or military machinery being stolen or misappropriated, the president or the convening authority might think that it was not in the interests of defence that these matters should be investigated publicly.  Similarly, in regard to public morals, which has a very wide definition, the president of the court-martial or the convening authority may have views on public morals that would be rather narrow and, which if applied in regard to the closing of a court-martial against the public or against the Press, may not be in the public interest.  While I realise the difficulty of getting a sub-section <Col N="1426" /> such as this worded in such a way that all the objections to what I might term the closed court procedure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
