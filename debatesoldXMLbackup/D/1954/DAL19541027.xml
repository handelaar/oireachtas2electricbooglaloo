      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether the Government have considered the recommendations and suggestions of the Commission on Emigration and Other Population Problems; and, if so, whether he will state what, if any, decisions have been made thereon.</P>

      <P>The majority and minority reports of the commission, which were published in July last as soon as all the reports were available, are, in accordance with the normal practice, at present being examined by the various Departments concerned. Owing to the nature of the reports, their detailed examination will necessarily take some time, but there will be no avoidable delay either in the examination of the reports or in the subsequent consideration by the Government of the recommendations and suggestions which they contain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has seen a statement published in an English newspaper and reported to have been made by a person who was described as secretary of the &ldquo;Dublin Unemployed Men's Association&rdquo; to the effect that three members of the Government, viz., the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Social Welfare and Posts and Telegraphs, were present at a meeting at which a pact was signed with the above named association involving five commitments for the Government, namely (1) reduction of prices, (2) increase of relief pay, (3) abolition of waiting period for assistance, (4) full employment and (5) representation of the association on the Public Works Committee; and if he will state if this report is correct and, if so, whether the Government (a) authorised the Ministers named to enter into the alleged pact and (b) <Col N="3" /> intends to submit to the Dáil proposals to give effect to these undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I received notice of the Deputy's question, I have seen a statement, apparently that referred to by the Deputy, alleging that an agreement was made between a particular Party and an association concerning the matters specified in the question.  While, in fact, no commitments were entered into on behalf of the Government with the association referred to or any other body, the Government's declared policy includes the increase of employment, the reduction of the cost of living and the improvement of social welfare benefits. So far as action by the Dáil may be required for the purpose of giving effect to these policies, the necessary measures will be brought before the House at the proper time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the total quantity and value of Irish whiskey exports during the first nine months of 1953 and 1954, respectively, and if he will indicate the countries to which export was made and the value in each case.</P>

      <P>As has been indicated in previous replies to similar questions, it has not been found possible to devise means other than the imposition of rigid frontier controls or the taking of an annual census of population to obtain reliable estimates of annual emigration.  The Majority Report of the Commission on Emigration and Other Population Problems does not approve the adoption of either expedient and instead recommends that a census of population should be taken every five years.  This recommendation is at present under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years Tea Importers, Limited acquired stocks of tea which were bought at prices substantially below the prices which have prevailed in world markets during the present year.  The company also made forward contracts early this year for the purchase of the product of certain tea gardens at prices below the current world market prices.  As a result of these transactions, the retail prices of tea in this country have been kept at a level lower than similar prices elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The future purchases by Tea Importers, Limited this year must be made at world prices and these prices will be relatively higher as compared with past purchases.  I am examining the matter fully, and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement shortly.</P>

I have continued the factory in existence since then.  Recently, however, in the absence of alternative offers to use the factory for other purposes, it became necessary to implement the earlier decision.  I have, however, arranged, so as to avoid hardship for the workers concerned, that the factory will be reopened on the 15th <Col N="9" /> of next month and will provide employment for the workers concerned until after Christmas.  At the moment there is no hope of continuing to operate the factory on the old basis but I would be glad to consider any proposals which may bring the factory into proper use for some other purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was considered in all its aspects by the Prices Advisory Body which, no doubt, took into consideration the price level for pigs tendered at the factories and the prices which the consumer was asked to pay for the cured bacon.  It was by advertence to these factors that the prices were fixed by the Prices Advisory Body.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Angel Guardians National School, in the Mayfield area of Cork City, is seriously overcrowded. In order to provide additional accommodation two temporary wooden classrooms were erected at the school in recent years, but as the attendance has been increasing it has now been decided to erect a further temporary wooden classroom.  A grant towards the cost of this additional classroom has been sanctioned by my Department and the Commissioners of Public Works are arranging for the preparation of the plans and specification.  When these are ready they will be issued to the manager with the necessary instructions regarding the execution of the work.  The urgency of the need for relieving the congestion is appreciated and every effort is being made to have the new temporary classroom erected as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The ultimate solution is the provision of a new school and steps are being taken by the reverend manager to obtain a site for the building.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, in view of difficulties caused for farmers by delays in accepting deliveries of wheat for drying by Dublin millers, he will arrange for these millers to work on a 24-hour basis until these difficulties have passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The facilities for drying wheat by Dublin millers are at present in use for 24 hours a day for seven days a week.  The rate of acceptance of wheat from growers must be regulated in relation to the capacity of the driers to handle it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister if he has seen the reports in the papers about lorries of wheat standing over and waiting, the lorry drivers sleeping in the lorries at night?  If it is a fact that the facilities for drying are been utilised to the fullest in the mills, would he not induce the millers to provide storage, in order that the <Col N="25" /> wheat may be taken off the lorries and the men allowed to go home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may rest assured that I have not only seen reports in the newspapers but I have, twice daily, reports from the milling inspectors, who are watching this matter hourly.  I have weekly reports from every chief agricultural officer in the country.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, as a result of directions given from my Department, the millers are now permitting the use of, and availing of, every drying plant which is available in the country. Only two days ago I myself directed that the drying installation at Grange Farm should be brought into operation for the relief of the farmers who are struggling to get the crop saved and dried.  The Deputy may rest assured that every conceivable device is being operated to get grain dried, and, if he at any time can suggest any method to me which will expedite the procedure or help in any way, I shall welcome his advice and shall be very happy to give effect to it if it is calculated to relieve the situation in any degree.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister would he consider asking the Sugar Company have they drying plant&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we did; but unfortunately the Sugar Company required their drying capacity to deal with the sugar pulp from the incoming beet crop.  If the Deputy can get the Sugar Company or any branch of the Sugar Company to undertake wheat drying for farmers in any particular area, he may rest assured of my cordial collaboration in facilitating that in any way; but I am not prepared to direct the Sugar Company to disrupt the whole beet campaign.  They have their own technical advisers and I am perfectly certain that if it were possible for them to help at the moment they would do so.  I am not going to direct them to do something that they feel would disrupt the beet campaign; but if the Deputy has any better information on the subject and brings it to my attention, his advice will be most warmly welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not <Col N="26" /> know&mdash;his common sense should tell him&mdash;that the position of farmers with beet is that beet can wait?  The farmer has to wait until the wheat crop is saved.  Can the Sugar Company not withhold their campaign and assist in saving the wheat crop, which is perishable? I believe the position at the moment is that beet will not be available for the factories.  Could he not look into that?  The wheat could be saved.  The beet could wait and, as a matter of fact, I believe it will have to wait in many cases.  The Sugar Company has often before had practically to close down until the beet was available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to take any action regarding the resolution referred to for the following reasons:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Temporary postmen are engaged solely in a temporary capacity in seasonal or other pressure periods. Since they are not permanently required for such work the question of making them permanent does not arise.</P>
      <P>(2)  Auxiliary postmen are employed on part-time duties.  Their employment is, for all practical purposes, permanent during good health and behaviour. Because of the part-time nature of their employment they do not, however, come within the scope of the Superannuation Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> The question of bringing such part-time State employees within the scope of those Acts is one which the Minister for Finance would have to consider in relation to the State service as a whole.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he is aware that the people of Skibbereen town and district are dissatisfied with the reception from Radio Éireann; and, if so, if he will indicate what action he proposes to take to improve reception in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous complaints have been received about the quality of reception in Skibbereen and in West Cork generally.  A reduction in quality is undoubtedly felt in some areas and is due to two main causes. The first is that a medium wave station like Athlone does not give a first-class service beyond say 80 or 90 miles from the transmitter.  Secondly, under the plan of allocation on which European broadcasting stations are working a large number of stations have had to be fitted into an insufficient wavelength space.  The result is serious interference, particularly at night time.</P>
      <P>Because of the reception difficulties that have arisen here, and throughout Europe, mainly due to the causes I have mentioned, broadcasting technicians have been devoting attention to the possibility of making up for the shortage in medium frequencies by using very high frequencies.  Our engineers are examining this matter. The examination will have to be protracted, extending possibly over a year or two, and the capital cost of equipment and lines for very high frequency broadcasting, if this is considered to be feasible here, will be high.  In the meantime, I would like to repeat the advice given before to listeners in areas where reception is not clear because of distance from the transmitter to make sure to have good aerials and earths and that the sets themselves are in good working order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not given any instructions.  It is the ordinary duty of an investigation officer to check means periodically.  Where a person has been in receipt of unemployment assistance for a period of, say, two or three years without an investigation, the investigation officer is bound then to investigate the means to see whether there has been an increase or a decrease.  The figures which I have given to the Deputy are not unusual when you consider that last year there were four times the number of cases investigated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been explained here on several occasions by myself and my predecessors, it was necessary for planning purposes when the Arterial <Col N="39" /> Drainage Act, 1945, came into force to draw up a programme of work, but that was expressly regarded as provisional and subject to review as circumstances required.  There is no rigid &ldquo;priority list&rdquo; of the order in which catchment areas are to be dealt with under the Act.  I may say that the River Boyne catchment will be the next major catchment area to be surveyed. It is unlikely, however, having regard to present commitments, that the field survey can be commenced earlier than 1956.</P>

A scheme for the Nenagh River catchment, Counties Tipperary (N.R.) and Offaly, has been prepared and exhibited.</P>

      <P>The number of motor-cycles, motorscooters and motor-assisted pedal cycles under current licence in Dublin City and County in mid-August, 1954, was 7,214, as compared with 5,262 in mid-August, 1953.  There has been practically no increase in the number of the more powerful and speedy type of motor-cycle, the major increase occurring in the class comprising motor-scooters.  I am advised by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána that while the figures showing the number of motor-cycles involved in accidents in Dublin during the years 1951-53 and the first half of 1954, disclose an increase, they do not show any abnormal increase when it is borne in mind that there has been a considerable increase in the number of motor-vehicles, especially motor-cycles, licensed during the same period.  I have not under consideration at present the question of making regulations for controlling the speed of this class of vehicle.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As the Deputies are aware from looking at the Bill it is an extremely technical matter, and, therefore, we have endeavoured to make the Explanatory Memorandum which was <Col N="46" /> circulated with the text of the Bill as full as possible.  That memorandum sets out the origin of exchange control here and gives a fairly detailed picture of the way in which that control is administered. It indicates also the circumstances which necessitate the enactment of new legislation and outlines the provisions made in respect of this Bill.  I think, therefore, that the Deputies will have had an opportunity of acquainting themselves with the background to the Bill and it will, perhaps, hardly be necessary for me at this stage to go into its detailed provisions. I might, however, indicate a few of the more salient features of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Exchange control was operated here under the authority originally conferred by emergency powers legislation and more recently through the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, which was first enacted in 1946 and extended from year to year thereafter.  When the last such amending Bill was before the House a year ago, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated that the various Ministers were concerned to see that the services which were operated under it should be carried on in future as soon as possible through permanent legislation.  That decision is being implemented in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is expressed to expire in four years' time, but I am afraid that that must not be read as a forecast of the probable duration of control. It is rather an earnest of the Government's desire to dispense as soon as possible with the restrictions which have been carried over from the years of the emergency.  The abolition of exchange control, however, must await the restoration of free convertibility of sterling on current and capital account.  On present indications such an event is not likely to occur for some years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill introduces no new principle of control.  Its provisions are largely a restatement of the existing law, as set out in the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946, and the Exchange Control Orders made <Col N="47" /> thereunder.  I should like, however, to draw attention to the important modification that the power to acquire gold coin, bullion and securities, which is contained in the 1946 Act, is being abandoned.  The other changes proposed are of a minor nature and are designed merely to facilitate the administration of control without introducing any new restrictions.  These changes are noted in the Explanatory Memorandum, paragraphs 26 and 27, and are covered also in Sections 17 and 18 of the Bill.  In some respects, the existing law is being relaxed, for example, in relation to the determination of residential status which, hitherto a power of the Minister, is now being left to the courts in the event of dispute.</P>
    <P>The Bill in general follows the lines of the Exchange Control Order, 1947, in that it is expressed to operate by way of prohibition or obligation with power reserved to the Minister for Finance to grant permissions and exemptions. Exchange control practice, as Deputies will appreciate, must of necessity be continuously adjusted to meet changing conditions.  It has been possible to grant substantial reliefs from statutory restrictions as circumstances permit, but it has also been necessary on occasion to tighten control to deal with a deteriorating foreign exchange position.  It would obviously be impracticable to have recourse to amending legislation whenever circumstances necessitated a change in exchange control practice. At the same time, it is recognised that such changes should be effected, so far as possible, in a formal manner which can be noted judicially by the courts and which will afford the general public a reasonable opportunity of determining their position under the law.  Accordingly, it is proposed to incorporate, so far as possible, administrative exemptions of general application in regulations to be made by the Minister for Finance.  Such regulations will be presented in the normal way to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As I said, the memorandum is fairly full but if there is any particular <Col N="48" /> point on which any Deputy would like information, of course I will be only too happy to afford it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite appreciate the general purpose of this Bill. It is, I take it, to replace and put on a more permanent footing various measures which were introduced during the emergency period.  I am afraid, however, that I must describe this Bill as probably the gravest attempt that has been made in recent times by bureaucracy to encroach further on the personal liberties of the ordinary public.  This Bill is obviously the production of bureaucrats who wish to have power concentrated in their hands and contains many entirely new and anomalous provisions which, in my view, constitute a fresh infringement of the people's ordinary democratic rights.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has really studied the Bill carefully&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure you that I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is the first time as far as I know that we are to have set up in this State independent of this Parliament a body to determine what is in the national interest.  The House and the country will be surprised to learn that this body is to be the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 of the Bill forbids the export of goods from the country unless the Revenue Commissioners give their permission and paragraph (b) (ii) of sub-section (1) of the section contains this&mdash;and I think members of the House should listen to it carefully.  The section as I indicated forbids the exportation of goods &mdash;I thought our main concern was the promotion of exports, but this sets up a number of barriers to prevent exports of goods.  The paragraph goes on to say that the Revenue Commissioners are permitted to forbid the export of goods unless they &ldquo;are satisfied&rdquo; that the amount of the payment that should be made is such as to represent a return for the goods which is, &ldquo;in all the circumstances, satisfactory in the national interest.&rdquo;<Col N="49" /> In other words, we are now setting up in addition to the Government, in addition to this House and in addition to the courts, which are the instruments set up by the Constitution, a new body which is to determine what is in &ldquo;the national interest.&rdquo;  We are vesting those powers in a number of civil servants who may be extremely competent and good people, but it is another encroachment by bureaucracy into the ordinary lives of the people.</P>
    <P>Why should the Revenue Commissioners have the right to determine what is in &ldquo;the national interest&rdquo;?  I doubt if the provisions of that section are even constitutional because I am not aware that the Revenue Commissioners have any functions given them by the Constitution to determine what is in &ldquo;the national interest.&rdquo;  It is, of course, interference with the liberty of the business man or the citizen in carrying on his business.  Before he can export goods he has now apparently to obtain first of all the permission of the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners have to be satisfied that the amount of the payment is such as to represent a return for the goods which in all the circumstances is satisfactory to &ldquo;the national interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely the Government cannot have considered the full implications of that sub-section and I certainly could not be party to empowering any new organ of Government with powers of this kind. I feel that the Minister should reconsider the provisions of that section very carefully and devise some other machinery if he wishes to exercise control over exports.</P>
    <P>That is not all.  The Bill proceeds to apply the Customs Acts to all offences committed under this Bill, because this is a penal Bill and it creates offences. The Customs Acts embody extremely wide and penal powers.  I have not had an opportunity of examining the full extent of those powers, which, in this rather indirect method, the Department of Finance assumes by importing the Customs Acts into this Bill; generally speaking, from my recollection, they give tremendous powers to the customs authorities in cases of <Col N="50" /> smuggling offences or suspected smuggling offences.  I doubt if it is wise to import powers of that kind into legislation of this nature.  I can quite well appreciate the necessity for many of the restrictions imposed in the Bill but I do think that we as a Parliament must seek to ensure that any powers we give at least come within the framework of normal constitutional usage and do not create further precedent for the invasion of the personal liberties.</P>
    <P>Section 20 creates a number of new offences.  Sub-section (3) provides among other things that a person who &ldquo;assists&rdquo; in preventing the &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; of another person is himself guilty of an offence.  I want to make it quite clear that it is not a person who assists in preventing the apprehension or trial, but a person who seeks to prevent the punishment of a person who becomes liable as a principal.  This is a completely new legal principle, a legal principle under which a solicitor who defends a client would be committing an offence, a principle whereby a counsel who appears in court to try and prevent the punishment of his client is guilty of an offence, a principle whereby a Deputy of this House who makes representations to the Minister seeking a mitigation of the punishment or asking that the punishment be removed altogether would himself become an offender. Surely that is bureaucracy gone mad.</P>
    <P>As I said, I had not time to study the Bill in full or very carefully.  I am merely picking out at this stage some instances of things that occurred to me when I was reading through it. Sub-section (5) of the same section empowers the district justice to impose sentence of 12 months' imprisonment on summary conviction.  I am not certain, and I do not want to go beyond this, but it seems to me that usually in our legislation we sought to limit the jurisdiction of the District Court to a sentence of six months' imprisonment.  I know there are cases in which the District Court may impose a sentence of 12 months, but it is unwise in a matter of this kind to give the District Court jurisdiction to <Col N="51" /> impose summarily sentences of 12 months' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 21 is also somewhat extraordinary. It provides that where a person has been convicted of an offence under Section 20 for &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; or &ldquo;refusal&rdquo; to do something which is required to be done under the Act and where that act still remains undone after the conviction, that person will continue to commit a criminal offence day by day.  I think we should try to examine the consequences of a provision of that kind.  A person may be tried, for instance, for having failed to detach a coupon from some dividend warrant from some investment and may be sentenced to six or 12 months' imprisonment.  While that person is in prison, he is still committing an offence every day, because he still has not detached a certain coupon from a certain investment.  I can quite well see what the Department of Finance wanted to provide by the section, but I think they have done it in a rather extraordinary fashion and that probably a much simpler and a more effective method could easily be found, if it were carefully examined by somebody who had not the purely Civil Service approach to it.</P>
    <P>Then we come to Section 26.  Sub-section (5) of that section, as I understand it, turns the present principles of criminal law upside down.  It provides that the onus is on an accused person to prove himself innocent and that it shall be for the accused person &mdash;I am quoting now from the subsection&mdash;to show &ldquo;that he neither knew nor avoided getting to know&rdquo; certain things.  How is the accused person to show &ldquo;he did not avoid getting to know&rdquo; certain things?  Is there to be an onus on an accused person to read <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> four times a week?  Can it be said, if he does not do so, that &ldquo;he avoided getting to know something&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy does not realise the class of person to whom this section is addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that criminal <Col N="52" /> law is always intended to cover criminals, but, as well as that, the criminal law is applicable to innocent persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not&mdash;God between me and all harm&mdash;in the habit of defending the banks or the directors of the banks, but even if this section is applicable only to bank directors, I think they are entitled to the protection of the ordinary legal rules applicable to criminal offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand they are quite happy about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a dangerous precedent.  If it can be done to bank directors to-day, it can be done to the ordinary citizens to-morrow.</P>
      <P>Then, we have in Section 29 a method of serving documents on people.  There is no question of personal service in a matter of this kind.  That would be too difficult for the Department of Finance.  It is sufficient to send a document by post in an envelope addressed to that person.  It is not even registered post&mdash;that would cost too much money&mdash;but if a document is sent by post to a person, that person is fixed with notice of the contents.  I think we should stick to the ordinary rules of procedure concerning service of documents.  I do not think it would cause very much inconvenience to the Department to have to comply with the ordinary rules which apply to the service of documents.  They have been worked out as a result of long experience and I think it is unwise to change them at this stage.</P>
      <P>There is another section, Section 32, which I would ask the Minister to consider carefully.  I do not quite see the purpose of it because it is an unusual section in a Bill introduced by a Government Department or by the Government.  It provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Act shall bind the State and shall apply to transactions by a Minister of State or other authority acting on behalf of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> Usually, the tendency of Government legislation is to avoid sections of this kind.  I wonder what the purpose of that particular section is and I wonder if the full implications of it have been considered.  It seems to me that any officer of the Department of External Affairs, or any officer of any Government Department who had business to transact abroad, would find it extremely hard not to commit some offence under this Bill.  If he borrows or lends 5/- to a friend outside the sterling area, he commits an offence.  I am quite certain the Minister would have no intention of prosecuting officers of the Department of External Affairs or of any other Department in regard to matters of this kind, but I am just wondering why the section has been introduced into the Bill.  There must be some reason for it.  Has it been fully considered by all the Departments that might be affected by it?</P>
    <P>Going back, we find that, in Section 13, a new offence is created whereby a person keeping a register&mdash;&ldquo;keeping any register&rdquo;, whatever that means&mdash;there is a definition section which defines &ldquo;register&rdquo; as any book, file or index in which securities are registered&mdash;that is, keeps any book, file or card index in which any securities are registered will find himself guilty of an offence, if he makes any entry on the forms, the register or the card index unless he has evidence to sustain the entry he has made.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to read Section 13 carefully to see whether some other method could be found of dealing with the problem.  Sub-section (4) of Section 14 provides that &ldquo;except with the permission of the Minister, a person shall not detach any coupon from a certificate of title to securities with coupons otherwise than in the normal course for collection&rdquo;.  I do not know what exactly is meant by &ldquo;the normal course for collection&rdquo;.  Very often, you find people selling securities, cutting them out and borrowing money on them in advance or depositing them at their banks for some reason or another.</P>
    <P>I have drawn the Minister's attention <Col N="54" /> to a number of these matters because I think that, by and large, this Bill represents a further encroachment by bureaucratic control on the ordinary process of democratic Government.  It is a tendency we have to resist the whole time.  It has been a growing tendency in the course of the last quarter of a century.  The tempo of the growth of bureaucracy increased very considerably as a result of the war and during the emergency period.  I suppose that was inevitable but it seems to me now that this Bill, while it contains many provisions which are probably necessary for the Government, is an attempt to convert temporary measures into permanent measures and embodies dangerous precedents, the most dangerous of which I think is to set up the Revenue Commissioners as arbiters of what is in the national interest.</P>
    <P>The whole proposed method of dealing with the question of exports seems to me to run completely counter to what we had thought to be the policy of the Government, which seemed to be to remove every barrier in the way of exports.  The Bill contains elaborate sections that will add additional barriers in the way of people who wish to export goods outside the sterling area.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take kindly to the criticism I am levelling.  It is not levelled at him personally and I am sure he dislikes measures of this kind as much as I do.  I feel that himself and the Attorney-General should put their heads together to see in what way the objectionable features of the Bill can be modified before it comes to the House again.  I am quite certain lawyers will find possible ways of reaching the same results without infringing the ordinary concept of jurisprudence in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>While, of course, I am very pleased to see Deputy MacBride making himself a nuisance to the present Minister, I must say that I think that this State will need these powers for at least the next four years.  It is ridiculous for Deputy MacBride to make the type of criticism he made, after barely glancing <Col N="55" /> at this measure.  If he had glanced at the Emergency Powers Orders that were operated here during the three years that he was Minister, he would find this Bill, as far as I can see, does not depart from those Orders and that if we are going to have exchange control then we must take such powers to exercise that control as will make it effective.  There is no use in making the broad statement that we want to keep, in the type of world we are living in, control of our finances, if we do not take the measures that are necessary to ensure that we can, in fact, control the external financial transactions carried out by individuals, either citizens or non-citizens coming in to reside here.  I do not want to deal at length with this matter; I take it the Minister will go into some of the points raised by the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand, but I do not forget that I was Minister for Finance responsible for operating Orders that Deputy MacBride is now criticising.  Deputy MacBride forgets that, when he was Minister for External Affairs for three years, he operated exactly the same provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be pointed out that he himself operated this system. Take his criticism in reference to Section 17.  It prohibits the exportation of goods of any class or description to a destination in any territory, other than the scheduled territories, except with the permission of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the introduction to the section that Deputy MacBride is criticising, that unless the Minister permits it, the exportation of these goods shall be controlled in a certain way by the Revenue Commissioners or other officials.  The Revenue Commissioners have not an absolute right to decide what is going to be the <Col N="56" /> national interest.  It is the Minister who has the last word as to what are the goods to be exported and, if we are going to export goods, we must see that the State gets value for them and that an alleged export of goods is not simply a way of exporting capital.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is always talking about the export of capital and how we keep our capital abroad.  What would be very dangerous is that we should export capital to a place from which we could not get it back.  It is right that, when there are conditions in the world which necessitate exchange control, particularly by small States which want to be politically, economically and financially independent, we should have measures of this sort.  I wish we had the sort of world in which, even though the State had these residual powers, it would not have to exercise these powers in any way from day to day that would affect the comfort of the ordinary individual. Even though the exchange control powers were absolute, they were exercised as liberally as possible in the past, while they were being operated by various Governments here. We must remember, however, that if we had not exchange control, the ownership of a lot of our property abroad could be transferred outside the State and in a very short time we would have no reserves upon which the people, the community or the State, could lay their hands in order to meet their foreign debts in time of crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am hoping that the Minister is right in setting a date in 1958 for the termination of this measure.  Personally, I hardly think that the necessity for exchange control will end so quickly.  Indeed, I wish it would. The necessity for exchange control would largely disappear if there was a reasonable balance of payments throughout the world.  If there is a danger of a big deficit in the balance of payments in certain countries, then measures have to be taken to safeguard reserves and keep those countries from going into a debt which they could not repay.  Countries, of course, that have a current deficit in <Col N="57" /> their balance of payments have to take such steps and the only way in which the position can be eased and exchange control avoided, or made more liberal, is for creditor countries which are accumulating surpluses to spend such surpluses in buying the services that other countries want to sell them.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that exchange control, so long as it continues, offers a great temptation to certain gentlemen to avoid it and make a dishonest penny by exporting the capital wealth that the community as a whole requires. That is the explanation for some of the sections in this Bill and the sections in the Emergency Powers Orders upon which it is based.  I think Section 20 is the section to which Deputy MacBride objects; that is the section that makes it an offence for companies and so forth to do certain things.  I think that is necessary.  One could have not only reputable financial institutions here, but one could also have phoney institutions in a position to take steps to avoid knowing what the law of the land is in order that a few very clever gentlemen could make a pot of money by avoiding exchange regulations. From time to time we have had a few such gentlemen exposed here; the fewer we have the better.  That unfortunately is the explanation of many of the rather drastic powers given to both the Minister and his officials. However, in this, as in all other matters, the Dáil is the final defender of the people against wrong acts on the part of the Minister or his officials. I believe this measure is necessary and that is the reason why we approve of giving it a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make two very brief points in relation to this Bill.  First, the Minister has pointed out that the necessity for this Bill arises by reason of the inconvertibility of sterling.  It seems to me that we should legislate for the possibility&mdash;I admit it may not be a very likely one &mdash;of the British achieving some degree of convertibility after the next Budget. In the summer of this year there was a certain amount of discussion about the £ sterling becoming convertible in the spring of next year.  That discussion <Col N="58" /> has now largely ceased, but if the British Government intends to free the £ next spring the one thing they would do at this stage is damp down the discussion on the convertibility of sterling just as Sir Stafford Cripps endeavoured to damp down the discussion on devaluation at a time when a decision to devalue was being taken.</P>
      <P>I think there is a possibility of some convertibility&mdash;it may not appear to be a very likely eventuality now&mdash; and the British may decide to free the £ to a certain extent in the next Budget.  I would suggest that in Section 2 where the Minister is given power to bring the Bill into operation by stages he might also take power to suspend the operation of certain sections of the Bill before 1958 in order to avoid the necessity of bringing in amending legislation.</P>
      <P>There is one other comment I have to make in relation to Section 5.  That section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Except with the permission of the Minister, a person shall not&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) make, or commit himself to make, any payment to or by the order of or on behalf of any person resident outside the scheduled territories.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The effect of that provision is to make all contracts into which business men may enter illegal.  It is quite a normal thing for a business man here to enter into contracts for the purchase of machinery from Germany and such contracts would be illegal until such time as the Minister's permission had been given; but the Minister's permission could not validate a contract which was already illegal under the Act.  A way out of that difficulty might be found by making the permission retrospective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must face the fact that contracts are entered into every day between business people for the purchase of goods from outside the scheduled territories. Such contracts could be repudiated subsequently, even if permission were subsequently granted, on the ground that the contract was illegal at the time it was entered into <Col N="59" /> because no permission had been given and the best way of getting over this difficulty would be by providing that such permission would be retrospective.</P>
    <P>Deputies have stated that it is most regrettable that we should have to maintain exchange control, but such control is a necessary part of our legislation until such time as the convertibility of sterling becomes a fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said when I was moving the Bill, it is a very technical Bill and one which needs very careful consideration and a certain amount, perhaps, of the application of a wet towel before one could fully appreciate the provisions of it.  Deputy MacBride indicated that he had not been able to give the Bill that attention. I can have great sympathy with him because, before I was able fully to understand the provisions of the draft Bill that was put before me, I had to sit down and do a great deal of thinking and pondering of that sort.  If the Deputy had been able to give it that attention, he would have found that many of his difficulties are illusory.</P>
      <P>We are all agreed, of course, that it is highly desirable to avoid as much as possible any bureaucratic intervention by Departments of State, by the State as such, in the lives of our citizens.  We are all agreed, so far as exchange control is concerned, that it would be far better to be able to do without it but, unfortunately, the position is that we are not able in the existing international financial circumstances to do without exchange control and, in those circumstances, it is necessary to have either legislation such as the type that was already in existence or this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I might digress for a second to mention the convertibility of sterling to which Deputy Costello referred, I would point out that, no matter what is done about that convertibility, whether it is on current account only or on current and capital account, the whole basis of this Bill is framed in such a way as to enable the Minister of the day to ease the regulations at <Col N="60" /> any praticular point should sterling become convertible in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be right for me to even hazard a guess on that. Like Deputy Aiken, I would wish that full convertibility would come along before this Bill expires in 1958 but, even if it does not come before 1958, I think the Deputy would agree with me that it is far better now to express it as being only for four years and, if the same regrettable circumstances are still in existence in 1958, to extend it then rather than that we should admit a measure of hopelessness in making it now a permanent piece of legislation without any terminating date.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been framed, let me assure Deputy MacBride, not with a view to taking more powers, but with a view to taking less powers than there were under the existing legislation.</P>

      <P>With respect, I am afraid the Deputy has not understood Section 17.  Section 17 throws the final determination on the Minister. It is in fact the re-enactment of Article 3 (q) of the Exchange Control Order of 1947, in similar terms.  The position is, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, that we have here entrusted to the Revenue Commissioners the duty of dealing with import and export of goods under the Customs Acts.  You have there, for example, the sole discretion of the Revenue Commissioners in deciding whether a particular article comes under one tariff reference or another, but at the same time, while <Col N="61" /> you give the Revenue Commissioners that sole discretion in that matter, you have vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce the discretion and the determination of whether a duty free import licence may be granted.</P>
      <P>This is exactly the same thing.  The Revenue Commissioners are being made the agents for the purpose of carrying out the law, of carrying out the determination, but the Minister for Finance of the day stands over the Revenue Commissioners by virtue of the provisions of sub-section (1), by virtue of the governing provisions, because the whole of this Bill is based on the provision that it is the Minister for Finance who prohibits, not the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the question of determining what is in &ldquo;the national interest&rdquo; is essentially a political function.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Candidly, I do not know what exactly is in the Deputy's mind.  If the power was not vested in the Minister for Finance I could quite understand it.  Does the Deputy suggest that the determination by the Revenue Commissioners should be a more retrictive or a less restrictive method? <Col N="63" /> If I knew on which leg the Deputy was standing I would find it easier to deal with him.  I make this suggestion quite seriously to the Deputy, that between this and the Committee Stage he would reconsider his views on the section, bearing in mind that this Bill is a four years Bill and that in fact it is a piece of temporary legislation, that, so far as that section is concerned, the ultimate discretion is vested in the Minister, that the ordinary business man who wants to do his business according to the law, as a matter of common practice since exchange control was set up, always complies with the formalities when exporting the goods.  This is purely a machinery method of preventing what is, in fact, smuggling.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that the position as I see it is that the Deputy does not appreciate the effect of the section as such.  If I am right in that, and perhaps I have not quite appreciated the Deputy's point of view, then it is quite clear that we are not <i>ad idem.</i> The correct time to discuss a matter that is not <i>ad idem</i> is on the Committee Stage of the section.  I will certainly make the inquiry which the Deputy has requested during the interval.  I trust that the Deputy will also consider, for example, the duty-free importation licence provision between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It affords an exact analogy whereby the Revenue Commissioners are charged with the same kind of duty as they are in this Bill. I do not think that the Deputy, unless he is merely arguing on words&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is true that there is the right of appeal to the Minister.  The Minister has the final say, but I do not think it is the function of the Revenue Commissioners to decide political questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I was trying to get, too, in reverse.  However, as I have said, I think it would be better if we left this until the Committee Stage.  I think that when we reach the Committee Stage the Deputy will find that this is not an effort, as he originally suggested, to set up a body of civil servants superior to this House and to the Government.  It is, of course, no such thing.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to sub-section (3) of Section 20.  That, of course, is in Section 6 of the Supplies and Services Act of 1946.  If there is any danger that the Deputy, as a barrister, or that I, if I were again a solicitor, could be prosecuted under that section, then I will have the section looked into in order to prevent that calamity occurring to either of us. I do not think, however, that that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say candidly that I think the Deputy, in the remarks that he has made on most of these sections, was pursuing a somewhat far-fetched point of view, a point of view which it is perfectly fair for any Deputy to put up, but which at the same time is, as I say, somewhat far-fetched.  We do not all live like ostriches.  We all know of the immense efforts that are made to avoid the unpleasantness and the restrictions which exchange control involves.  We all know of the immense efforts that are made by people to defraud the country in which they live of the benefits that should inure to the national interest from the control of a scarce currency.  We all know how very difficult it is to prevent, or rather to bring to light, such cases.  We know that from time to time such cases come before the courts. One has only to read the newspapers <Col N="66" /> to see the lengths to which people are prepared to go in order to defeat exchange control.  It is an unfortunate position, but it is so.  Exchange control, and the necessity for it, is unfortunate, but if it is going to be necessary to impose it, then it is equally necessary to ensure that its imposition is made effective while at the same time preserving so far as one possibly can the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride would have some validity in many of his arguments if this were a permanent Bill and not merely a four-year Bill.  It is not a permanent Bill.  It is a Bill for a limited period in the hope that during that limited period we will be able to avoid the necessity for continuing the provisions regarding exchange control.  I am afraid the Deputy has somehow approached this Bill on the basis that somebody, whether it be the Minister of the day, civil servants or the Revenue Commissioners, are going to be ogres trying to find some method by which they can catch the Deputy or, for example, a solicitor instructing him, or similar people.</P>
    <P>We all understand that it is necessary to draw legislation as strictly and as clearly as we can and that it is necessary to make sure that we do not put into legislation anything that is unnecessarily onerous on the individual. We must approach our legislation on that basis, but we must equally approach it on the basis of reality and with the knowledge that we have at the present time, that there is international financial difficulty in exchange, that as long as that difficulty is there, there is going to be every effort made, not merely here but in all countries, to avoid it and to avoid the responsibility that citizens should have in respect of it.  We must try to balance one view against the other and strike the mean.</P>
    <P>This Bill is brought here on the basis that it gives up powers that were already there.  If I had decided to take the view that I was merely asking for a re-enactment of the Supplies and Services Act, I would be taking far more power than there is in this Bill.  Instead of that, because it <Col N="67" /> is for four years rather than for a single year, I am asking the House to give me less power than there was there before&mdash;but less power, may it be quite clear, to the Minister of the day who will be responsible to the House for the administration under this Bill, no matter whether the machinery utilised for its operation is the machinery of the Revenue Commissioners or the machinery of the authorised dealers and authorised depositaries who are referred to in the First and Second Schedules to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is another of those very technical Bills and, as Deputy Aiken will know, it is one that has been under consideration for a very long time indeed.  I think that almost every Minister for Finance has had a finger in the pie, in the production of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to make provision, as contemplated by Articles 10.3 and 10.4 of the Constitution, for the management of and the control of the alienation of certain State lands.  Deputies will have seen that there is a fairly full memorandum circulated with the Bill and they will have an opportunity from that of getting the details of the Bill before them. <Col N="68" /> Therefore, I want to deal only with a few rather general matters.</P>
    <P>Article 11 of the Constitution of 1922 provided, in relation to lands which were State lands immediately prior to the 6th December, 1922, that they should be</P>
    <P>&ldquo;controlled and administered by the Oireachtas, in accordance with such regulations and provisions as shall be from time to time approved by legislation&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and that they might be granted by way of lease or licence for terms not exceeding 99 years, to be worked or enjoyed under the authority and subject to the control of the Oireachtas. This article was implemented by the State Lands Act, 1924, the State Lands (Workhouses) Act, 1930, the Prisons Act, 1933, and the Foreshore Act, 1933, and all these Acts are still in force.</P>
    <P>Article 10 of the present Constitution prescribes, <i>inter alia,</i> that provision may be made by law for the management of lands which were State lands immediately before the coming into operation of the Constitution and lands acquired thereafter and for the control of the alienation, whether temporary or permanent, of such lands. No mention is made of control by the Oireachtas or of restriction of alienations to terms not exceeding 99 years.</P>
    <P>The State Lands Act, 1924, applies only to land which by virtue of Article 11 of the Constitution of 1922 belonged to Saorstát Éireann.  The administration of those lands has, however, been hampered in several respects by certain restrictive provisions of that Act.  One provision is that particulars of proposed leases and licences must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for a period which involves a delay of at least four weeks before formal effect can be given to them.  One effect of this is, for example, that at present unimportant grazing lettings on the eleven months' system, weekly or monthly tenancies and occupations of State premises by State servants for official purposes, have to be held up for a period of perhaps four weeks for the purpose of being laid before the House under the <Col N="69" /> 1924 Act.  Small lettings of that sort clearly should not be held up in that way.</P>
    <P>The second difficulty was that the Act permits only of alienations for terms not exceeding 99 years, and it empowers the Minister for Finance to make the necessary leases and licences and requires him to make these by deeds under his official seal.  It is obviously desirable to extend that.</P>
    <P>The third objection is that the Act did not permit of lettings involving removals of sand, gravel, stone or clay. The fourth objection is that it did not permit of the sale or surrender of lands and premises no longer required for State purposes.  There have been many cases over the years where that restriction has caused some anxiety and some difficulty.</P>
    <P>Article 10 of the present Constitution enables the difficulties of administration which I have enumerated to be removed and also enables the making of legislative provision for the management of lands acquired by the State since 1922.  It is accordingly proposed to repeal the State Lands Act, 1924, and to enact more suitable and more comprehensive provisions to govern the vesting in State authorities, that is to say, Ministers of State and the Commissioners of Public Works, of State land not already so vested, for example, former Crown, Admiralty and R.I.C. lands, or doubtfully vested and the transfer of State land by one State authority to another.  These matters are provided for in the Bill which also empowers State authorities in relation to State land, other than certain lands specified in the First Schedule to the Bill, to make sales, exchanges, grants, surrenders, leases and licences.  Leases and licences may be for any terms, grants may be gratuitous, dedications for use by the public may be made and the public may be permitted to use such land subject to by-laws.  State authorities may waive and release covenants in leases and may waive and release rents and arrears of rents.  These powers of State authorities are to be exercisable only with the consent, either general or particular, of the Minister for Finance.  Control by the <Col N="70" /> Houses of the Oireachtas similar to the control prescribed in the State Lands Act, 1924, is not proposed. Instead, it is provided in Section 10 (6) of the Bill that half-yearly reports, giving particulars of sales, exchanges, grants and leases, other than leases for terms not exceeding 21 years, should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Similar provisions have been made in legislation passed since 1924, dealing with alienations of minerals, foreshore and fisheries.</P>
    <P>Apart from the main provisions of the Bill to which I have referred, the Bill also provides for a variety of other matters the more important of which are outlined in the opening paragraph of the Explanatory Memorandum and all of which are explained in some detail in the body of the memorandum. It is hardly necessary for me at this stage to supplement the information contained in the memorandum on these miscellaneous provisions but if any Deputy desires additional information on any point of general principle affecting these matters, I shall be only too glad to give it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody will agree that it was wise that Article 10 of the Constitution did not have any such restrictive effect on the alienation of State lands as was contained in the State Lands Act of 1924.  From time to time, various Ministers, who have plenty to do otherwise, find themselves the possessors of lands which they do not want, which no other State Department will take and which they are unable to get rid of.  I am glad the Minister for Finance has found parliamentary time to get this Bill brought forward: he says it has been on the stocks for quite a long time.  I feel the measure will certainly have good results not only in easing the work of Government Departments but also in giving the State the right to sell property which they do not want to people who might make better use of it.  There are odd bits of such land throughout the country: we hear of them from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, the Minister is very wise in getting rid of the necessity to come to the Dáil before exercising his waiver in respect of State lands or <Col N="71" /> property.  He is wise, also, in insisting that there should be a six-monthly publication of such transactions.</P>
    <P>Section 12 relates to &ldquo;Waiver and release of rent and arrears of rent and mense rates in respect of State land&rdquo;. It might be advisable for the Minister to look into the point as to whether or not there should be a publication of the list of waivers.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a Committee Stage Bill. I feel that it will be welcomed as long overdue by the majority of the people of the country and I am glad it has been brought forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to congratulate the Minister for introducing this Bill.  It was long overdue. There is just one matter I should like the Minister to look into.  It concerns Section 19, which relates to priority of moneys due in respect of former Crown rents, and so forth.  I have not had an opportunity of looking into the provisions of Section 38 (2) of the Finance Act, 1924 (No. 27 of 1924), but I have come across a number of cases in respect of debts collectable by the State either in the case of deceased persons or in the case of bankruptcy.  Very often, such a claim might involve an injustice either on the family or on other relatives.  Possibly the Minister might look into the question of whether or not the provisions of Section 19 are essential in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a public authority, I should like to welcome this Bill.  From time to time, as has been pointed out, public authorities are faced with difficulties in providing suitable lands for housing near villages so that the houses may be built for a community and serviced as modern requirements now demand. On occasion, we have come up against problems of that kind where, if we could get a lease or transfer of such land to the housing authorities, many of our difficulties would be solved.  I am sure the people generally also see that there is a good deal of waste in allowing these lands to continue unused, as is often the case, with high walls around them.  These lands, which <Col N="72" /> were used by garrisons in former days, will now be for the public service. When we come to the Committee Stage, there may be some aspects of that problem which would need to be straightened out in one way or another so that the assurance could be there that these lands could be donated or transferred or leased to public authorities who may need them as well as to citizens who may wish to acquire them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  It appears to be a constructive approach to a problem which has existed here since 1922 when this State became the caretaker of such lands and interests in British properties which are in this country. Apart from the fact that the existence of that situation is there and causes difficulties such as those mentioned by Deputy MacCarthy in the matter of the acquisition of land for housing purposes and other matters where the public interest could be served, we have a situation where there are large tracts of land in respect of which this State is acting as caretaker for the British Government.  Apparently, this Bill will enable us to acquire these lands and make them available, if necessary, to the Irish Land Commission so that they can be divided in the ordinary way and made available to deserving applicants for these lands which would, in many cases, make good agricultural holdings.</P>
      <P>I can appreciate that this matter must have been a very thorny problem when it took so many Ministers for Finance to try and iron out the many difficulties involved by reason of the situation which has existed.  I feel that this Bill will solve many of the anomalies which have existed as a result of the circumstances under which this State became the caretaker of this type of property.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Aiken said, this is really a Committee Bill, and it is one, therefore, which we can consider far more easily on the next stage than to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Aiken raised a point as regards Section 12.  Certainly, I will approach that with my mind running <Col N="73" /> in the general direction and unless there is some very excellent reason that such a return should not be made it will be made.  It was wrong, as was the previous arrangement in respect of leases, that we had to await the document supplied for the information of the House but it is equally wrong, from the other point of view, that we should not give by way of return to the House any information that is required by members of the House acting in a reasonable manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose of the Bill is to enable, so far as this country is concerned, effect to be given to and advantage taken of certain provisions of the following Geneva Conventions signed on behalf of Ireland on the 19th December, 1949&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field;</P>
      <P>(2)  Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea;</P>
      <P>(3)  Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War;</P>
      <P>(4)  Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.</P>
      <P>The first and third mentioned conventions replace the Geneva Conventions of 1929 regarding respectively the relief of the wounded and sick in armies in the field and the treatment of prisoners of war, and bring them up-to-date to meet modern requirements. The second mentioned convention replaces the Tenth Hague Convention of 1907 for the adaptation to maritime warfare of the principles of the Geneva Red Cross Convention of 1906. The fourth mentioned convention is an entirely new convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> The Geneva Conventions of 1949 have not yet been ratified.  It is considered desirable that, before ratification, the necessary domestic legislation to give effect to the conventions should be enacted.  The present Bill is the first of the measures which will be necessary for that purpose.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Red Cross Act, 1938, was enacted to give effect to and take advantage of certain provisions of the Geneva Conventions of 1929 and provided for the establishment and incorporation in Ireland of a Red Cross Society.  The Irish Red Cross Society was established by an Order made by the Government under that Act.</P>
    <P>The Geneva Conventions of 1929 generally referred to &ldquo;armies&rdquo; which was a narrow term applying to the armed forces proper.  The 1949 Conventions refer to &ldquo;armed forces&rdquo; and set out various categories of persons, in addition to armed forces proper, who are entitled to the benefits of the conventions.  Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civil members of military aircraft crews, war correspondents and supply contractors are, for example, entitled to the benefits of the 1949 conventions provided they have received authorisation from the armed forces they accompany.</P>
    <P>In Section 4 of the Bill, which sets out the primary objects of the Irish Red Cross Society, the expression &ldquo;armed forces&rdquo; within the meaning of the 1949 Conventions replaces, therefore, the term &ldquo;armies&rdquo; in Section 1 of the 1938 Act.  The expression &ldquo;prisoners of war&rdquo; in the section has likewise the same extended meaning covering all those who come under the classification of &ldquo;armed forces&rdquo;.  As I have said, the Geneva Convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war is an entirely new convention.  For the purpose of that convention a new primary object, namely, the furnishing of relief to civilians who are protected persons within the meaning of the convention, is added in Section 4 to the primary objects of the Irish Red Cross Society.  Protected persons are defined <Col N="75" /> in the convention as covering those who, at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in the case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a party to the conflict or occupying power of which they are not nationals.</P>
    <P>Advantage is being taken of the present opportunity to amend the Act of 1938 so as to authorise the Irish Red Cross Society to engage in any activities of a humanitarian character which are considered suitable and to make, at its discretion, charges therefor. It was held in a High Court judgment some years ago that the powers conferred by the 1938 Act did not entitle the society to hire out ambulances.  The peace-time activities of the society include the maintenance of an ambulance service for training purposes on the grounds that the most satisfactory and most thorough training in ambulance service work can be obtained only by actually operating such a service for the carriage of patients.  The funds and commitments of the Society are such, however, as to preclude it from operating such a service free of charge to the extent which adequate training demands.  In a number of countries a charge is made for the use of Red Cross ambulances in peace-time and, in the opinion of the International Red Cross Committee, the hiring of material by a National Red Cross Society would not be in any way incompatible with the Red Cross spirit and the Geneva Conventions.  The deficiency in the matter in the 1938 Act is, accordingly, being rectified in Section 5 of the Bill.  The reference to a preventorium in the section is intended to remove any possible doubt that the society will have power to continue the great work which it has being carrying on for some years in the Children's Hospitals at Ballyroan, County Dublin, and Montenotte, Cork, for the prevention of tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>Any activities of the society under Section 5 which may bring it into competition with private enterprise, will, however, be circumscribed under Section 6 which empowers the Minister <Col N="76" /> for Defence to regulate and control such activities.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that the Government should be empowered:&mdash;(a) for the purposes of Article 26 of the wounded and sick convention to authorise voluntary aid societies (including the Irish Red Cross Society) to render assistance to the Army Medical Corps; (b) for the purposes of Article 27 of the same convention to consent to a recognised society of this country, when neutral, assisting a belligerent; and (c) for the purposes of Article 24 of the maritime convention commissioning hospital ships which might be used by the society.  These matters are provided for in Section 7.</P>
    <P>Under Section 4 of the Act of 1938, the emblem of the red cross on a white ground cannot be used for trade or other purposes without the consent of the Minister for Defence.  The wounded and sick convention requires that the emblems of the red crescent on a white ground, used by Turkey and other countries, and the red lion and sun on a white ground used by Iran as the emblems and distinctive design of the medical services of their armed forces, should be placed on the same footing as the Red Cross emblem.  The prohibition of the use of the emblems of the red crescent and the red lion and sun will not, however, affect any rights acquired through their use prior to the enactment of the present Bill.  Section 8 of the Bill covers these requirements.</P>
    <P>Section 9 which relates to the use of the Arms of the Swiss Confederation revises the provisions in that respect in the 1938 Act so as to bring them into line with the terms of the wounded and sick convention.  The 1938 Act, in pursuance of a reservation by this and other countries to the 1929 Convention, preserved the rights of proprietors of trade marks registered before the 13th June, 1931, and containing the Swiss Arms.  The 1949 Convention was not the subject of such a reservation on the part of any country. Section 9, accordingly, repeals the 1938 Act provision in that respect.</P>
    <P>That I think fairly well explains the provisions of the Bill and I am sure that Deputies will find little trouble in disposing of the measure.  In concluding, <Col N="77" /> however, I would like to pay a tribute to the Irish Red Cross Society which is, in a very real and effective way, carrying on its humanitarian activities in accordance with the high principles and tradition of the International Red Cross.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, I think it can be said that the main portions of this Bill are contained in Sections 3 and 7.  Section 3, as the Minister has outlined, deals with conventions which were drawn up in December, 1949, and Section 7 provides for the authorisation by the Government of certain Articles referred to in Section 7.  I would be inclined to say that, on the whole, this is not a measure which can in any respect be regarded as controversial and I personally do not anticipate anything in the nature of a delay in its passing.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) contains the references mentioned by the Minister, that is, authority to provide an ambulance service and to make at the discretion of the society, charges with respect to persons availing themselves of the ambulance service.  I think Section 6 qualifies that and makes it clear that, where the Minister for Defence is of opinion that the activities of the society bring the society into competition with private enterprise, he can refuse to give certain directions.</P>
      <P>That is the only portion of this Bill which might have caused controversy were it not for the fact that it is qualified by Section 6.  We do not want the State or any semi-State organisation to go into competition with private enterprise but I am fully conscious of the fact that there can be certain circumstances in which it would be necessary for the State to come to the rescue of certain people. In those circumstances the State or the semi-State organisation would be fully entitled to come in and operate in that particular phase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can also see the desirability of Section 8 but the possibility of any members of the Irish public wanting to use either of these particular heraldic emblems is, I think, a bit remote.  I presume that is put in to ensure that in no circumstances can <Col N="78" /> any private concern utilise either of these emblems which, again, I presume are the emblems of foreign nations pretty far removed from this nation.</P>
    <P>The necessity for Section 9 is also clear.  The heraldic sign of the Swiss Red Cross must, of course, be protected in every possible way.  There is one thing that the Bill does.  It gives those of us who have any knowledge whatever of the activities of the Red Cross an opportunity of offering them not alone our sincere congratulations on the work which they have undertaken over the years but of expressing our sincere thanks for the voluntary efforts they have made over all these years.  I think the Irish Red Cross organisation and the Civic Defence organisation are the only two remaining emergency organisations which are still operating.</P>
    <P>I wish it were possible for the Irish public to realise the desirability as well as the necessity of being members of an organisation such as the Irish Red Cross organisation.  It gives me great pleasure to avail of this opportunity to offer my sincere congratulations to the Irish Red Cross Society, its chairman, its executives and its various members throughout the country for their work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I want to bring to the Minister's notice and that is the matter of Red Cross branches along the Border. Take, for instance, the branch in Lifford, County Donegal, which is right up against the Border.  I understand that legally members of the Red Cross in any such branches are not allowed to cross the Border in uniform even on business connected with the Red Cross organisation.  For instance, if a person from over the Border is injured in the Twenty-Six Counties and is being dealt with by members of the Red Cross here they are not allowed to convey that person by ambulance to a hospital or to his home on the other side of the Border as long as they remain in uniform.  We, on the other hand, give every facility to members of the Red Cross branches in the Six Counties to enter the Twenty-Six County area in uniform I do not know if the Minister can do <Col N="79" /> anything about that in this Bill but it is a matter which would need to be remedied.  I wonder whether the Minister would approach the authorities on the other side to see that our people would be allowed in connection with functions or accident cases to cross to the towns over the Border.  I think it would be a very good thing and it would help to make the name of the Irish Red Cross Society a real one.</P>

      <P>I have only a few words to say on this Bill.  As a member of the Red Cross executive, I have much pleasure in welcoming this measure.  The Bill itself brings the Red Cross Society in Ireland into conformity with the Geneva Convention. Throughout the years the Red Cross Society has been in existence here it has more than justified its existence both nationally and internationally.</P>
      <P>In case there might be any misunderstanding it is not, as the Minister explained, the intention of the society to go into competition with private enterprise.  All the society want is to be free.  A decision was given against them in the courts and we had no protection in regard to ambulances travelling long journeys.  That was a very big draw on the resources of branches in the country.  For example, in the County Dublin we have four ambulances and it was a big strain on the society to keep the ambulances going but under Section 5 of the Bill we have permission to accept a gratuity.  We are not entering into competition with any private enterprise whatever.  I am grateful to the Minister for introducing this measure and clearing the air.  We are a voluntary organisation.  We will remain a voluntary organisation and will always depend on the support we receive from the public and the Department of Defence.  With these few remarks I welcome this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Bill has been received so well.  The points raised by Deputy Traynor are, of course, very important.  On the question of hiring ambulances, I intend, subject to consultation with the <Col N="80" /> society, to issue directions along the following lines regarding the hiring of ambulances.  In order to avoid any possibility of complaints of unfair competition, the scale of charges for the society's ambulances will not be lower than the comparable rates for commercial ambulances.  In accordance, however, with the humanitarian principles which govern all the society's activities the ambulances will continue as at present to be used free of charge in cases in which the circumstances of the patient preclude his paying the full charge.  I will see to it, and I am sure my successor will see to it that that conflict will not arise.</P>
      <P>On the question of the protection of emblems&mdash;the provisions are being made in order to conform with the convention.  The convention lays that down, and we must make that part of our domestic law as it will be part of the domestic law relating to other countries as well.  I may say that a large number of countries have ratified the convention and a small number have not.  We are amongst the small number that has not, because we propose to do this sort of work first. We think it is the best method.  You will have at least two or three other Bills of this nature in a short time for the purpose of enabling us to ratify the convention.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the situation is about the Border, but I think it is a matter we need not bother about.  The Red Cross is for rendering aid and succour to those in need of it, and we know there is a Red Cross at the other side as well as this one, and humanitarian efforts can apply equally on either side.  The question of uniforms is, I suppose, a matter of courtesy arrangement, but if we extend it, and the others do not, we cannot help it.  I do not think there is any suggestion that we should withdraw it because of that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Burke agrees with me that there is no necessity for <Col N="81" /> the Red Cross to go into competition with anybody else.  He knows how essential it is that this Bill be put into operation and that the other Bills arising out of the convention be enacted so that the convention may be ratified.</P>
    <P>I am glad we all agree on the fine work done by the Red Cross Society in this country as a voluntary organisation. Certainly in a very short time they have built up a very efficient organisation in many directions, and they are to be complimented, and the people should express their congratulations to them and assist them and give them more help than they do.  I would like to see in every area an efficient, well-organised, effective branch of the Red Cross.  I would also like to see the life-saving and other activities of that body taken to heart by the people, because it is a great thing if some accident occurs to have somebody near at hand, known practically to everybody, who knows what to do in an emergency&mdash;whether drowning or shock or whatever it may be.  I would commend the Irish Red Cross to the people of this country in a very positive way, and I can assure the Irish Red Cross Society of my Government's appreciation of their services both now and in the past and our appreciation of the services which I am sure they will render in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I do not think I need say overmuch as to the provisions of the Bill which proposes to remove from the Statute Book once and for all the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893.  That Act has over the years been the subject of much criticism and in this day and age it is hardly necessary to argue very strongly to convince people as to the injustice it occasions to members of the community with causes of action against public authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> The Act was put rather hurriedly through the British Parliament and was alleged to be a consolidation of existing statutory provisions, and nobody at the time seems to have been too well aware of what it involved. Under its provisions a person suing the State or a local authority has to bring proceedings within six months of the act, neglect or default complained of and not within six months of the date the cause of action arose.  In this respect the Act differs fundamentally from other statutes of limitation under which the rule is that time begins to run from the time the cause of action arises, or, as it had been termed, the date of accrual of the cause of action.  The provisions of the 1893 Act can thus lead to what one judge called &ldquo;the starting result that you may lose a cause of action before you have got it&rdquo;, because the period of six months runs not from the date the plaintiff suffers injury but from the date of the act of the public authority or the ceasing thereof, which may be long before any actionable injury is caused.</P>
    <P>The period of six months is, of course, far too short and cases have arisen where a person could not bring his action because the damage caused to him did not manifest itself in time. A typical case is where damage is done to the foundations of a house by vehicles belonging to a county council passing along the roadway near the house.</P>
    <P>Where a person with a cause of action against a public authority is insane or an infant and cannot, accordingly, sue, the 1893 Act makes no provision postponing the beginning of the six months' period until his disability has ceased and in this respect again, it differs from other limitation statutes.</P>
    <P>The remaining objectionable feature of the 1893 Act is that the public authority gets specially favourable treatment as to costs.  An unsuccessful plaintiff is liable to solicitor and client costs instead of party and party costs. Even a successful plaintiff is liable for solicitor and client costs if he proceeds with an action after an offer has been made or after payment of any money into court and if he does not recover <Col N="83" /> more than the amount offered or lodged in court.  Finally, solicitor and client costs may be awarded to a public authority, if the court is of opinion that the plaintiff did not give the authority sufficient opportunity to make an offer for settlement.</P>
    <P>The construction of the 1893 Act has led to endless difficulty in the courts and as a judge of the Supreme Court said once in a famous case: &ldquo;It is scarcely possible to lay down, with any approach to completeness, any affirmative principle of interpretation of the words of the Act&rdquo;.  It may be that originally the Act was designed to prevent people challenging important administrative acts of public officials after a long lapse of time but it has turned out that the vast majority of the cases in which the Act has been relied on are cases of ordinary negligence by servants of public authorities as, for example, the negligent driving of a local authority vehicle or the negligence of a local authority medical officer and the like.  There seems no reason why these wrongdoers should be given special protection simply because they are paid from public funds.  Injustice has resulted and does result from the Act and a British committee observed rather pointedly that it was only those who benefited from the Act who considered it should continue.</P>
    <P>At all events, my view and the view of the Government was that the Act should be completely repealed and the present Bill is the result.  The text of the Bill is based on that introduced in 1952 by the present Minister for Agriculture as a Private Member's Bill.  My predecessor in office agreed to examine that Bill and I think I may say that, after he had considered various amendments which would alleviate the injustices of the 1893 Act, he had more or less come round to the view that the best thing to do was to abolish the Act altogether.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) of the Bill now before the House repeals the 1893 Act and Section 2 (2) repeals the enactments specified in the Schedule to that Act in so far as they are not repealed by <Col N="84" /> that Act.  These enactments, about 100 in number, gave protection to persons acting in pursuance of particular Acts of Parliament.  The repeal in the 1893 Act is limited to so much of the Acts as relate to any proceedings to which the 1893 Act applies and there is, consequently, a doubt as to how far these old Acts might be considered still to apply.  The repeal in the Bill will clear up any such doubt.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (3) of the Bill provides for the repeal of Section 44 of the Great Northern Railway Act, 1953, which applies the 1893 Act to the Great Northern Railway Board subjects to the extension of the six months' time limit to 12 months and subject to the non-application of the special provisions as to costs in the 1893 Act.  Section 44 was inserted in the 1953 Act to bring the law in this part of the State into line with that applicable in the Six Counties.  The 1893 Act does not, by reason of Section 10 of the Transport Act, 1950, apply to C.I.E.</P>
    <P>The new Act is, under Section 1, expressed to come into operation on the 1st January next.  Under sub-section (4) of Section 2 the repeal of the 1893 Act and the repeals of the other enactments will not apply to any proceedings if the cause of action accrued before the 1st July of this year.  The effect of this is that, where a person suffers actionable injury after the 1st July by the act of a public authority, the authority will not be able to plead the 1893 Act.  Where, however, actions have arisen before the 1st July the authority will be able to plead the 1893 Act.  These provisions are designed to prevent stale claims being brought and I think they are reasonable.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House. It provides a highly desirable and long needed reform of the law and even if it comes a bit late it is better late than never.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to admit that I have come around to the view that this Bill should be totally repealed.  That was my own personal view, but I think that before we left office the position was that we were trying to convince <Col N="85" /> other Departments that that view was right.  Apparently that has been done now, but, whatever my personal views are, a number of members of our Party who are members of local authorities&mdash;and there are others in other parts of the House&mdash;think that time should be given for consideration of what the reactions are likely to be on public authorities.  Although we do not propose to vote against the Second Reading, we should like to have some time before Committee Stage to consider that aspect.</P>
      <P>Everyone agrees, I think, that the six months' period is just ridiculous, and I do not know how it persisted so long, but whether a period of six years in which to bring an action against a local authority is not too long is a matter for consideration.  I may be wrong, but I have a recollection of reading a debate in the British House of Commons on this point, and I think there was some suggestion there that the six years' period allowed by the Statute of Limitations was too long and that it might be reduced to three years or some such period.  I do not know whether the Minister intends to look for all stages to-day or not.</P>

He has all the facts, and I cannot deny it.  I was personally in favour of the Bill as it stands, and I agree that Section 44 of the Great Northern Railway Act ought to be repealed, so as to bring the position into line with whatever is done here in respect of public authorities.</P>

      <P>There can be no doubt that this Bill is long overdue, and there can be equally no doubt that the provisions of the Public Authorities (Protection) Act, 1893, worked a great hardship on the public in general and, as I think, worked great injustice on many plaintiffs in many actions whose lawful rights were interfered with.  The country as a <Col N="86" /> whole must, therefore, welcome the repeal of the Act, and the only comment I have to make on the Bill before the House is that there appears to me to be an omission from it on which I should be glad to have the Minister's view.  If it is an omission, I should like him to consider inserting a section to deal with the point I wish to refer to.</P>
      <P>The Bill intends to repeal the Public Authorities (Protection) Act, 1893, but does not purport to repeal the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, Section 51, sub-section (7) of which does put a limitation of six months, and in certain circumstances, a further limitation of three months on any action against county councils where a claim made against a county council is to be payable out of the poor rate.  Many claims are payable out of the poor rate, and this particular section of the Local Government Act, 1898, has been pleaded, sometimes successfully, in the courts.  It seems to me that it would be a hiatus in our legislation if we were to allow local authorities to plead Section 51 (7) of the Local Government (Ireland) Act in certain circumstances. This particular section is not repealed, and I think a section should be put into the Bill specifically repealing this section of the Local Government Act, 1898.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other point I wish to make is that, in repealing the Act of 1893, we will also be repealing Section 2 of that Act.  Section 2 does repeal certain provisions&mdash;in fact, all provisions&mdash;in public general Acts, which refer to the necessity of commencing proceedings in particular places, the necessity of giving notice of action and certain provisions which may be in certain public general Acts relating to the fact that a defendant might, in particular kinds of actions, be deprived of costs in certain specified events.  It seems to me that it would be advisable, as we are repealing Section 2, to re-enact certain provisions of Section 2 which may be applicable at the present time. It will not be and need not be reenacted <i>in toto,</i> but, for the sake of clarity and to avoid difficulty in the future, by reason of the fact that old Acts may appear suddenly in the courts, certain provisions of which may <Col N="87" /> have been repealed by the Public Authorities (Protection) Act and which we had brought to life again by the repeal of that Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I also should like to support this Bill as a reform of the law which is much needed.  There is only one point which I should like the Minister to consider.  Sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Bill provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The enactments specified in the Schedule to that Act are, so far as they relate to the limitations of actions, prosecutions or other proceedings and are not repealed by that Act, hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The position is that there are a large number of Acts specified in the Schedule to the Public Authorities (Protection) Act, 1893, which, prior to the passing of that Act, did impose limitations of time on the commencement of the proceedings against various bodies, including local authorities and State bodies.  These Acts were, in so far as they imposed a time limit, repealed&mdash;most of them&mdash; by a named section of the Act of 1893 and I should like the Minister to consider whether sub-section (2) of this section in its present form does not have the effect of repealing the Public Authorities (Protection) Act, 1893 and repealing the specified Acts only in so far as they were not repealed by the 1893 Act and therefore, in effect, reviving the specified Acts in the Schedule to the 1893 Act in so far as they affect time limits.  That is the only matter I should like the Minister to consider, on the effect of this sub-section because it does seem to me that, if the sub-section is left in its present form, the effect would be to repeal the 1893 Act and revive a great number of Acts which were in force prior to the Act of 1893 and which are equally as harsh, and sometimes more harsh in their time restriction than was the 1893 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everyone is agreed that the repeal of the Act in question is overdue but I wonder whether everyone is agreed with regard to the period which it is proposed to allow within which actions <Col N="88" /> may be brought against local authorities. The existing statutory limitation of six months was certainly too short but personally I do not think I could agree to extend the period to six years.  It is all very well to extend the playground for the legal profession, which is virtually what this Bill does.  Local authorities are always looked upon as good marks for actions of any kind and the judicial authorities regard them as such but I think that a three years' limitation would be ample to protect the interests of the public in these cases.  In fact, I question whether the period of six years in the Statute of Limitations within which actions can be brought by private persons is not in itself rather long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister might give an assurance that at some future date, the six years allowed in the Statute of Limitations should be reduced to a period of three years, thus bringing local authorities on a par with private individuals.  We would all be perfectly satisfied with that.  It is not likely that the lawyer members of the House would agree to any curtailment of the limit provided for in the Statute of Limitations and they may not agree to the six years' limitation with regard to local authorities but those of us who realise what local authorities are up against with regard to legislation of this kind &mdash;they are always regarded as fair game by any person who feels that he might be able to substantiate an action arising out of something that happened years ago&mdash;must regard a proposal of this character with some doubt.  If a period of six years is allowed within which a person may bring an action against a local authority, some person might think it worth while to try to establish that some defect in his health or physical condition was due to an injury that occurred six years ago and by that means, and no doubt with the encouragement of his legal advisers, endeavour to substantiate an action in a case where he knows the ratepayers' money is involved.  While we are all agreed that the limitation of six months was much too short, I doubt if members of local authorities will agree that six years would be a suitable <Col N="89" /> period.  I think the Minister should consider meeting the local authorities half way by prescribing three years as the period of limitation in the case of local authorities.  I am not prepared to argue that particular point but I do know that local authorities hold very strongly on this point, as to the liability which they will incur if you allow the limitation of six years proposed in this Bill.  I would strongly suggest that the Minister should give an assurance that the period in the Statute of Limitations should be reduced to three years in all cases.  If the term were made three years, I would be perfectly in agreement with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to disagree with the Deputy who last spoke in imposing any kind of lesser restriction in the matter of time, in relation to this legislation on local authorities, than will be afforded to anybody else. I think that what was contemplated by the proper authority in bringing a Bill before the House to repeal the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, was to bring public authorities into line with the provisions in the ordinary Statute of Limitations.  Very often, even a term of three years might work an injustice in the case of a person whose cause of action might not become obvious within that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of the Bill to which I should like to refer and ask the Minister to reconsider.  That is sub-section (4) of Section 2, which says that &ldquo;the foregoing repeals shall not affect any action, prosecution or other proceeding if the cause of action accrued before the first day of July, 1954. . .&rdquo;  I would prefer to substitute the words &ldquo;the institution of proceedings&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;the cause of action&rdquo;.  I would rather make this Bill, after it becomes an Act, relate to the institution of proceedings as the time limit rather than the cause of action because a cause of action which might not be obvious on the 30th June last might become obvious in the early days of July and, accordingly, it might work hardship on a particular applicant or plaintiff as the case may be.  I am not saying that with the object of further extending the playground <Col N="90" /> referred to by the last Deputy who spoke, because I think there is no need to impress on the House and the country that legal practitioners never sought to set up a local authority as a cockshot because, after all, we have a certain sense of responsibility as practitioners and our aim is to protect the people's interest, either in the local authorities or in the National Assembly.  Predominantly our attitude, of course, is to protect our clients' interests.</P>

      <P>I perhaps should not intervene in this debate having, for the moment, shed myself of my functions as a practising lawyer, but I did speak on a previous occasion when the Minister for Agriculture was introducing a Bill similar to this.  I just want to controvert one or two comments which Deputy Brennan made.  It is a matter of consideration as to whether or not a period of six years is too long as a limitation.  It is a matter for consideration as to whether it is too long for private individuals.  This Bill is intended to put local authorities, public bodies and all the people who are entitled to the protection of these Acts &mdash;the Public Authorities Protection Acts&mdash;on the same basis and to give no one person a privilege over another. The question can be subsequently considered&mdash;and if we get a chance we shall consider the whole field of limitation of actions&mdash;of bringing in a Bill, as I had intended to do when I was previously in office, dealing with the period of limitation of actions, but all people, whether public bodies or private individuals, should be on the same basis and no one should have any privilege over another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan suggested that members of the legal profession are out after local authorities, making actions of this type a sort of playground. If I were to look upon this question from the point of view of creating a playground for members of the legal profession, I would leave the Act as it is, because it is an instrument by which my colleagues might make substantial incomes.  So far as the allegation that public authorities are the victims, I do not know whether Deputy Brennan has heard <Col N="91" /> of the case of Carter versus the Kildare County Council.  The Kildare County Council fought a small farmer who had a small public-house in County Kildare.  He got damages from a Dublin jury who found that his premises were damaged through the negligent operation of a steamroller. It was not possible to ascertain that damage until after the period of six months had gone by.</P>
    <P>The owner of the house did not know the house was damaged, because it did not start to fall down until after six months.  Then he brought an action against the Kildare County Council and a jury, under the direction of Mr. Justice Maguire, gave a verdict in his favour.  Mr. Justice Maguire decided that because the man did not know of the damage at the time, on the interpretation of the Act his cause of action was not gone.  A majority of the Supreme Court decided on appeal in favour of the Kildare County Council, a public body which, according to Deputy Brennan, is the victim of the machinations of the legal profession; that public body brought this unfortunate poor man, and his mother, to the Supreme Court.  The case lasted for days&mdash;I was in it myself&mdash;and ultimately a majority of the Supreme Court on a very narrow and, in my view, wrong interpretation of the law decided in favour of the Kildare County Council.  In addition to that, my unfortunate client on the application of this public body was made to pay solicitor's and client's costs&mdash;an outrage and an injustice.</P>

      <P>One of my present Ministers was a member of the Kildare County Council.  At all events, I want now to disabuse the mind of anyone here who thinks there is anything sinister in connection with proceedings against local authorities.  I want, too, to emphasise that private litigants are in a very inferior position when fighting public authorities. Public authorities have the money and <Col N="92" /> money, therefore, means nothing to them.</P>
      <P>They have the experts.  The private individual is not able to afford the expense of employing the powerful weapons that are in the hands of public authorities and private individuals very often suffer injustice because of that.  Let that be perfectly clear to anyone who thinks that public authorities are entitled to privileges. The people about whom we should be thinking here are the private individuals with small means, individuals who have to fight powerful bodies like local authorities with any amount of money behind them and all the necessary resources in the way of experts and advisers.  These are all available to local authorities and as often as not the private individual has not got the resources to fight public bodies.</P>
      <P>No Deputy could possibly conceive that public authorities are victims.  If there is any victim, it is the private individual.  Let that be quite clear.  Let me impress upon the House that what we want to do here is to put all on the same level so that no privilege can be obtained over a fellow citizen.  Hitherto certain people have benefited by the interpretation of the Act in a manner in which I believe it was never intended they should benefit.  If the period of limitation is too wide, let us consider that and, having considered it, let us put everyone on the same basis.  If necessary, we can cut down the time.</P>
      <P>Speaking as one who made his living out of such actions, I am against State actions.  Such actions are no good to anybody for one does not get one's fees until the case is over.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Minister consulted with the executive officers of local authorities before he decided to introduce this Bill.  The case as to why local authorities are in a different position from private individuals is one which could be argued with a good deal of justification.  Possibly the period allowed at the present time during which a person can institute proceedings against local authorities is too short and needs to be extended.  The Taoiseach adverted to one particular <Col N="93" /> case where a private individual got the worst end of the stick.  I take it that was a decision of our courts.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has said that local authorities are well able to bear it; that is the feeling.  For that reason local authorities require some protection over and above that given to the private citizen.  We know very vexatious actions have been taken against local authorities.  The records of the courts show that.  Both the Department of Local Government and the Department of Finance are intimately concerned in this matter.  So are county managers and county secretaries throughout the country.  I think the opinions of these rather important people should have been obtained.  The Taoiseach, with his experience of the courts, and the Bar Council hold a certain view.</P>

      <P>Such injustices are well-known facts.  The administrative and <Col N="94" /> executive officers of local authorities could cite many such cases.  I am not pleading that the time should not be extended because I believe it should, but I want to emphasise that I think there is a difference as between local authorities and private individuals. Local authorities are fair game all the time.  We know that quite well.  Between now and the Committee Stage I suggest the Minister should seek the opinion and advice of the responsible officers of local authorities.  I do not say local authorities may not have abused the Act on occasion, but it is our duty to be fair to all our citizens.  We have to hold the scales as evenly as possible.  That is the function of this House.  I take it the Government had that in mind in introducing this Bill.</P>
      <P>We had a debate on this matter before and the present Minister for Agriculture&mdash;then Deputy Dillon&mdash; introduced a Bill and expressed very strong views here in relation to it. Certain eminent Chancellors of the Exchequer in another Parliament were quoted.  He regaled us with amusing episodes and incidents that took place in that Parliament.  We were highly diverted on that occasion.  Between now and the Committee Stage I appeal to the Minister to consult with the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance and to obtain the views of the executive officers of local authorities throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Is not it a strange thing that it took until the year 1954 for us to realise this and we are here now trying to put local authorities on the same footing as the ordinary citizen of the State?  That is all we are trying to do.  If we think the Statute of Limitations makes the period in which action may be brought too long, that is a different day's work. It may be considered, as the Taoiseach said, and we may bring in amending legislation, as he said, and as we hope to do some time in the near future.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Brennan, did express regard for local authorities in that proceedings may be instituted against them under the Workmen's Compensation Acts for injuries which a workman may have sustained a considerable period prior to the institution of the proceedings but this Bill has nothing whatever to do with the time limit under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  The Workmen's Compensation Acts have their own time limits for the institution of proceedings and anything we do by enacting the Bill before the House will not affect them.</P>

I can assure the House that at the time this Act was brought in it was to protect public bodies against demands made upon them when the rates had been made.  It was to give them protection and provided that action could not be brought against a public body after the rate had been made for six or eight months.  I agree with the other speakers and with my predecessor that public bodies should not be given preferential treatment vis-á-vis the private citizen.  I am glad the Opposition have accepted the principle. Deputy Boland has asked for time in which to put in amendments.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is essentially a Committee Stage Bill.  For this reason, I thought it best to provide Deputies with an Explanatory Memorandum in which every provision in the Bill is explained separately.  I feel that some explanation is necessary for the fact that the Bill involves so much legislation by reference.  Legislalation by reference is something which I, speaking both as a lawyer and as Minister for Local Government, deplore. I find, however, that if legislation by reference were to be avoided, the Bill would be inordinately long and, moreover, would not gain in simplicity what it would lose in brevity. The Bill is, however, a step towards the consolidation of local government law, which is so badly needed and so long overdue.  The first step necessary towards consolidation was the enactment of the Local Government (Repeal of Enactments) Act, 1950, which repealed a large number of obsolete enactments and enabled the text book on local government law, which it is hoped will be published this year, to be confined to more or less manageable size. Consolidation of the general local government law, which will be a lengthy and complicated job, is proceeding and preliminary heads of a consolidated measure are in the hands of the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office.  In the meantime, many reforms and improvements of the law cannot wait for the general overhaul of the law which consolidation will necessitate and are included in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to go into its provisions in the same detail as in the Explanatory Memorandum.  I will take each part separately and deal with the more important provisions in a general way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" /> Part I is concerned with definitions and does not call for any comment.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with establishment matters.  It has two chapters.  The first deals with offices and employments generally and is largely a series of amendments to Part II of the 1941 Act, and Part III of the 1946 Act. The second chapter deals with the amendment of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926.</P>
    <P>In the first chapter, perhaps the most important section is Section 25 which provides a scheme of conciliation for servants of local authorities who may appeal to the elected members against a decision affecting their remuneration, duties or conditions of service.  There is an obligation on the elected members to refer the appeal for consideration to an advisory committee to be set up under Section 59 of the Bill.  An advisory committee under that section may include persons who are not members of the local authority. This will enable representatives of the servants concerned to be appointed on these committees so that their case may be properly pleaded.  The local authority when they have considered the advice of the advisory committee may decide the appeal.  Their decision is subject to confirmation by the appropriate Minister where it relates to a matter of remuneration.</P>
    <P>If the local authority concerned is not a rating authority, their decision must be approved by the rating authorities who defray the expenses of the local authority.  This is reasonable because it is the rating authorities who meet the cost of any wage increases.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that the 12 point programme of the Government includes the provision for employees of local authorities of a scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  Section 25 will fulfil that programme in so far as local conciliation is concerned.  The question of providing by legislation or otherwise for a scheme of arbitration for local authority employees is at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>Another important provision in this chapter is Section 21 which modifies the provisions of Section 70 of the 1925 Act.  That section prohibits any person from being employed by any <Col N="98" /> local authority while he is or was within 12 months after he has ceased to be a member of the local authority or any local authority in the same or in an adjoining county or county borough.  The provisions of this section have been considered to be too harsh in so far as minor employment by a local authority is concerned.  Section 21 will provide that the disqualification of a person from employment as a minor officer or servant will operate only in respect of membership of a local authority by which he is employed. There is an exception to ensure that membership of advisory and visiting committees will not of itself involve disqualification from employment.</P>
    <P>The only other provision in this chapter to which I ought to draw special attention is Section 24.  This section and the Second Schedule will clarify the position in regard to the power of the appropriate Minister to make age limit Orders.  It was considered that under existing law, age limit Orders could be made applying only to officers who on compulsory retirement would be entitled to a pension.</P>
    <P>There was some doubt about this and it is now proposed to re-state the law and to limit the powers of the Ministers accordingly.  Doubts have also been raised as to the validity of age limit Orders in relation to managers, in view of the terms of the Management Acts which provide that a manager shall hold office until he dies, resigns or is removed from office.  Section 24 and Second Schedule will now make it clear that age limit Orders will apply notwithstanding any statutory tenure that an officer may possess under any other enactment.</P>
    <P>Chapter II will deal with amendments of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926.</P>
    <P>Section 27 will exclude certain types of offices from the scope of the Act. These are temporary offices; part-time offices as engineer or surveyor under the council of an urban district or the commissioners of a town; and technical offices, such as that of radiographer which are relatively junior.  The removal of these offices from the scope <Col N="99" /> of the 1926 Act will facilitate administration and will enable local authorities to fill these posts more speedily.</P>
    <P>Section 28 will remove a source of inconvenience to local authorities by imposing a time limit of three months within which persons recommended for appointment by the Local Appointments Commissioners must take up duty on pain of losing their posts.</P>
    <P>Section 31 which is the only other section to which I need refer will enable the commissioners to compile panels of qualified persons from which the needs of a number of local authorities can be met.  This provision should help considerably to speed up the making of appointments and will also faciliate candidates in that they will not be required to pay an entrance fee for every particular post for which they apply.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains a number of minor amendments of the law and a few more significant provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 32 will enable a road authority to acquire land for quarries compulsorily, if necessary.  At present there is a doubt as to whether a road authority can acquire land for this purpose otherwise than by agreement.</P>
    <P>Section 37 makes a number of changes in the law on traffic signs, at present contained in Section 69 of the Local Government Act, 1946.  It has not been found possible to make suitable regulations under that section, but it is hoped when the more flexible provisions of Section 37 of the Bill become law, to make appropriate regulations regarding the major categories of traffic signs.  It is highly desirable to get uniformity in the matter of traffic signs, especially the more important ones, and the regulations should secure that end.  In the meantime, a review has been undertaken in my Department of the whole question of traffic signs, including their shape, size, colour, reflecting qualities, and so on, so that when the regulations are made, they should make the best provision possible.</P>
    <P>With the growth in traffic, it becomes necessary to improve the sign-posting system and to ensure that road-side signs which would confuse <Col N="100" /> road users are not permitted.  In sub-section (3) of Section 37 therefore, it is to be made an offence to provide any sign, device, notice or light capable of being confused with or obscuring a traffic sign.  This is based on a recent international convention, which we hope to adhere to in the near future.</P>
    <P>Section 38 enables local authorities to appoint traffic wardens to shepherd school children across the road at busy crossing places.  Dublin Corporation some time ago requested that steps be taken to enable them to appoint such wardens.  In the city, school hours coincide with peak morning and mid-day traffic, and it will be of help both to the school children and to vehicle users if the children are guided across the street in orderly groups.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána are not in a position to have police officers available at all necessary times at the places where school children cross, hence the need for these &ldquo;traffic wardens&rdquo;.  The powers requested by Dublin Corporation are being made available to local authorities generally, in case others wish to follow their example.  It will be noted that any arrangements made by a local authority under the section are to be subject to the consent of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, who, it is understood, will assist in ensuring that wardens are properly instructed.</P>
    <P>The Motor Car (International Circulation) Act, 1909, was passed at a time when motoring was in its infancy and tourism had not reached its present importance in the balance of payments. It is only to be expected that it does not fully meet modern conditions. The Act had two chief objects: first, to facilitate Irish motorists going abroad and, second, to facilitate foreign motorists visiting Ireland.  It is in regard to this second object that it needs improvement.  Orders can be made under it only to implement formal conventions whereas it might be desirable from time to time to give effect to informal agreements or even to take unilateral action.  Again, it does not cover tourists who wish to drive Irish cars as distinct from tourists importing their own cars.  Section 39 of <Col N="101" /> the Bill which is designed to replace the Act should give ample power to make whatever arrangements are considered necessary in the matter of driving licences for foreign visitors and the regulations applicable to their vehicles.</P>
    <P>An important matter is dealt with in sub-section (1) of Section 41.  Navigation rights were involved in a number of bridge projects considered recently, and doubt was raised as to whether a bridge Order could safely be made providing for the construction of a bridge which would curtail even to the slightest extent any right of navigation, even where the right had not been exercised for many years.</P>
    <P>Section 41 therefore provides that a bridge Order given in such a case may be carried into effect.  Such a power will, of course, be subject to the safeguards embodied in the Local Government Act, 1946, viz., the ventilation of the whole question at a local inquiry and the requirement of the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is the responsible Minister in navigation matters.  Section 41 of the Bill provides for compensation in respect of any private right of navigation affected.</P>
    <P>Section 42 of the Bill, which enables a border county to adopt a scheme for the construction or maintenance of a cross-border bridge, follows generally the lines of a similar provision in an Act in force in the Six Counties. Under the section Donegal County Council will be able to proceed with a scheme for the replacement of Lifford Bridge on which Tyrone County Council and themselves have agreed.</P>
    <P>I now come to Part IV of the Bill which deals with local finance.  Perhaps the most important provision in this part is Section 51 which deals with the question of levying the county demand.  Complaints have been made over a long period about the present method of calculating the amounts to be contributed towards county expenses by boroughs and urban districts.  This method is briefly apportionment on a valuation basis, but as not all the valuations taken into account are productive, and lack of productivity is more prevalent <Col N="102" /> in urban than in rural districts, there have been well-founded complaints that an undue share of common charges tends to fall on urban ratepayers.  The provisions of Section 51 will meet these complaints. In future county-at-large charges will be shared between the county health district and the urbans in proportion to the net produce of a rate of 1d. in the pound in each area.  This figure can be ascertained from the rate accounts of each local authority and the new method of assessment should not involve any complexity.  Urban councils and county councils will get full credit for non-productive ratings, irrecoverable rates and so on in the assessment of their shares of county-at-large charges.</P>
    <P>Section 50 is another section which I think calls for some comment.  This section provides that where a person who is retained by a public body in any professional, advisory or consultative capacity certifies any sum as being payable from the funds of the public body and such sum is paid, he shall in so far as the payment certified by him is concerned be an officer for the purposes of Section 20 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1902, which deals with the making of charges by auditors.  I want to make it clear that this section will not give the auditor any power to question professional advice given by a consultant. The auditor's powers will be confined to querying any sum paid on the basis of a certificate issued by a consultant.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with miscellaneous matters.  There are four sections in this part on which I would like to comment.  The first is Section 53.  Under the Local Government Act, 1941, county councils have power to provide a community or parish hall, but they have no power to make a contribution towards the erection of such a hall by a local committee or parish council.  It is felt that the power given in Section 53 to contribute would, by fostering local initiative and also by freeing the county councils from the burden of providing and managing the hall, be much more acceptable to county councils.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> Section 54 will enable sanitary authorities to make grants to societies, clubs and other bodies providing or proposing to provide swimming facilities. This section will, I am sure, be welcomed by swimming clubs which are not usually in a position to incur the heavy capital expenditure involved in providing swimming pools and also by local authorities because it will relieve them of the expense of managing and maintaining swimming pools as well as part of the capital cost of providing them.</P>
    <P>The corporations of the four county boroughs can legally spend money on the decoration of streets on occasions of public rejoicing and other appropriate occasions.  Section 55 of the Bill will extend this power to all urban authorities and town commissioners. A limit of 3d. in the pound on the rateable valuation of their areas is imposed.  I may mention that many local authorities have already incurred expenditure on Tostal decorations in anticipation of the enactment of this section.</P>
    <P>The only other section in this part which I would like to draw attention to is Section 59.  It is the section to which I have already referred in connection with appeals by servants. It enables local authorities to set up advisory committees consisting partly of members of the local authority and partly of other persons.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule to the Bill contains a list of the enactments being repealed.  Most of these repeals are consequential on amendments in the body of the Bill.  There are two repeals, however, to which I would like to draw special attention.  The first is the repeal of Section 51 (7) of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898.  The repeal of this provision will put local authorities on the same footing as other bodies in so far as liability for payment of debts is concerned.  I should like to refer in this connection to the Public Authorities (Judicial Proceedings) Bill, 1954, which is at present before the House and which will have the effect of placing local authorities on the same footing as other bodies in so far as legal actions are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> The other provision in this Schedule to which I would refer is the repeal of Section 10 (2) of the Irish Universities Act, 1908.  Under that section the amount of money which could be raised in any year for the purpose of university scholarships could not exceed the proceeds of 1d. rate or such higher rate as a local authority with the consent of the Minister for Local Government might fix.  This limitation is now being repealed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the privilege of helping to introduce into the House the 1946 Local Government Act, which dealt with a number of miscellaneous matters&mdash;as in the case of this Bill, which could be described as a consolidating or cleaning-up Bill.  As the Minister says, it is largely a Committee Bill and we will have to reserve discussion on many of the sections until the Committee Stage.  A great deal of the Bill requires very careful examination because, as the Minister says, it is by reference.</P>
      <P>In speaking of the Bill in general and the extent to which it effects consolidation, I think I would not be out of place in asking the Minister whether he has examined the work of the legal officers who were classifying and preparing the work of consolidation of local government law and whether he does not think the expenditure of a certain amount of money by his Department would not, in the long run, save enormous sums in the form of legal expenses, administrative expenses and a number of offices in his Department, if it would have the effect of bringing about a larger measure of consolidation than that which is evident in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister himself is in the legal profession.  He knows the position; he knows that certain specialists in local government law have been appointed, I think by various Ministers from time to time, to deal with consolidation; but while the last Government and the previous Government have done a certain amount, Local Government law is, from the standpoint of being able to find out what the law is, still in rather a chaotic condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example.  I think the franchise <Col N="105" /> law in this country is embodied in something like 60 statutes dating back to 1845.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister, when he replies on this stage of the Bill, to tell us how far the work of consolidation is proceeding. He might also tell us whether the specialists in his Department are continuing their work and whether he agrees with this side of the House that the money spent on salaries or consultants' fees would be more than repaid over a period of ten or 15 years through the process of simplification.</P>
    <P>The next question is a rather more fundamental and important one. Deputy McGilligan, the present Attorney-General, during the course of the last election, made a number of important observations on what purported to be the view of his Party on bureaucracy in this country.  He said in the course of one speech that one of the methods of economy would be to cease recruiting for the Civil Service.  Another Deputy in the same Party pointed out in another speech that that would create some sort of grievance and that people who were accustomed to send their children to the Civil Service would be deprived of that facility.  Deputy McGilligan went on to say that it might be possible to delegate very largely the powers of the central Government, the powers of the Minister for Local Government, to local authorities and that by so doing the number of civil servants required in the Department of Local Government could be materially reduced, to the point of actually effecting economies in the whole of the State administration and a considerable reduction in the cost of the Civil Service.  That speech of Deputy McGilligan was made apparently in absolute sincerity.</P>
    <P>When we look at this Bill we see that the Minister for Local Government retains all his powers, his powers being clarified and extended, and that there is not the smallest indication that he intends to take the advice of Deputy McGilligan and to delegate to local authorities the many powers that he has.  As the House well knows, the Minister for Local Government controls practically every single act of <Col N="106" /> local authorities.  He controls the whole of the machinery of appointment and he insists on uniformity in regard to all local authority establishments. He controls the entire arrangements for the financial working of all local authorities.  The reason for that is twofold, as the Minister knows.  The history of local government has been that&mdash;largely because local authorities were engaged in the work of struggling for independence&mdash;they were considered to be irresponsible, capable of committing abuses and, as a result, the central Government took more and more control of their activities.</P>
    <P>The other reason for the power of the Minister lies in the fact that the Government now provides grants for almost every type of local government administration, and as the grants are provided by the central authority, the central authority insists on uniform methods of carrying out the work for which the money is provided and insists on uniformity in regard to the whole of the establishment.  That is an excellent reason for having this central control, but I would like to ask the Minister whether this Bill reveals the fact that he does not intend to make any major change in regard to his own powers, and whether he has come to the conclusion that, now that the rates provide only a proportion of the expenditure of a local authority, it is necessary for him to retain the enormous panoply of powers which this Bill contains and which other Acts have given to him.  It would be best if he were frank with us in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Further than that, the Minister announced his intention of introducing a Bill amending the County Management Act.  We are asked to consider this Bill before the County Management Amendment Bill is introduced, and we are being asked to consider it although there are many sections in which the powers of local authorities are referred to, but according to the present law the powers of the local authorities in regard to these questions involving establishment, administration and the appointment of officers are, in fact, reserved to the county manager.</P>
    <P>It is not going to be easy for us to <Col N="107" /> discuss on the Committee Stage quite a number of sections of this Bill when we have not yet any idea of what is in the Minister's mind in regard to how far the elected members of the local authorities may or may not be given back some of their original powers in regard to determining the number of officers, the kind of officers, the payment of officers and so forth.  I am not suggesting that we on this side believe necessarily that local authorities should be given wide authority in regard to matters of employment, staff conditions and so forth.  That is a matter for consideration later on; but I do say that to examine part of this Bill without knowing what is in the Minister's mind, and whether he is going to make any drastic changes in the law, is going to be difficult.  Therefore, I would like to ask him how he views that matter and whether he considers it wise under present circumstances to introduce this Bill without introducing at the same time the new County Management Bill.  I think it is a fair question which the Minister should be able to answer.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I would refer particularly to Sections 12 and 14 of the Bill, which relate to the power of the local authority, with the consent of the Minister, to abolish offices or create new offices.  There has been a feeling for some considerable time that the staffs of local authorities have grown to the point where the elected members should have powers of consent, to decide whether or not either temporary or permanent officers should be appointed.</P>
    <P>In other words, they should begin to take again at least some responsibility for the complexus of officerships for which they have to provide rates and, therefore, Sections 12 and 14 can only be discussed properly if we have some idea of what is in the Minister's mind in regard to that matter.  For example, there have been cases in some areas where dispensary doctors have been allowed to appoint substitutes living 14 miles from their area.  Is there anything in this Bill which would enable the local authority to check this <Col N="108" /> practice?  Is there anything in this Bill to give the elected members some right to decide whether or not it is right for a substitute midwife to be appointed in an area 15 miles from where the normal midwife is carrying out her duties?  That is a reasonable question.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to all the sections of this Bill where the transfer of offices from one to another, where the abolition of offices or the creation of new offices is involved, will depend on what the Minister can tell us on the Committee Stage of his intentions in regard to the powers of local authorities now, without our having to wait for the County Management Bill to be drafted and introduced into this House.</P>
    <P>I come now to the sections amending the law in regard to roads.  I should like to ask the Minister whether the absence of any legislation which would have some effect in deciding upon the vexed question of private roads indicates that he has not been able to make up his mind on the matter and whether he intends to make no further change in the law.</P>
    <P>I admit that, because of the immense financial difficulties involved, no Government in this country&mdash; neither our Government nor any Government&mdash;have really faced up to the realities of the 20,000 miles of private non-public roads in this country which amount, I think I am right in saying, may be compared with the 50,000 miles of public roads.  I am not suggesting that the present Minister is in any way remiss in that, because while a great deal was done to enable these roads to be put in proper condition by the Fianna Fáil Government, and continued by successive Governments, it seems to me that at the present time the position is becoming more acute.  In the course of the past few years an Act was passed here, at the instance of Deputy McQuillan, enabling local authorities to take over non-public roads, cul-de-sac roads, which, under the Local Government Act of 1925, they had been forbidden to do before unless they led to new houses or except under special circumstances. I understand that very few local authorities have taken advantage of that Act.  I understand that they <Col N="109" /> have been afraid to expend the money that would be involved if they set any precedent in regard to taking over, to any degree, any group of non-public roads in a particular area.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, in areas where there is a high degree of unemployment in the winter months the minor relief grants have been sufficient to effect a considerable amount of repairs on these non-public roads.  In areas where the number of unemployed registered in the winter months is not sufficient, the only relief available is that under the rural improvements schemes grants, which were first promulgated under the Fianna Fáil Government. Very great difficulties have been experienced in getting consent for the contribution required, even if it is only 10 per cent.  The whole social character of large parts of the Irish countryside is changing, due to the gradual and continued disrepair of these roads and the ever higher standards required by the users of these roads for social and economic purposes.</P>
    <P>The changes relate to the value of farms at the end of boreens, which have gone down in value regardless of the value of the land itself.  We know of residences which have ceased to be residences and have become straw farms, out houses.  It may be that this change in the character of our agricultural life and in the value of farms may continue and is something that cannot be arrested.  I would ask the Minister if any change in the classification of roads indicates that he has not made up his mind about it or that he feels the present legislation is as far as he can go and that we shall have to watch the gradual deterioration of many thousands of miles of non-public roads because no finance can be made available under any head to repair them.</P>
    <P>I am glad that, in Section 39, arrangements have been made to simplify the administration in connection with cars that come from the other side of the water.  I would ask the Minister whether, under Section 39, it would be possible for British citizens who come here to have some <Col N="110" /> means by which they would not have to get an Irish driving licence.  It seems to me that it would be a useful thing from the tourist point of view.  They come over in very large numbers.  If the Minister thinks he must have the money from the driving licences, I suppose it would not be desirable to make that change but, under Section 39, can the Minister make an Order of that kind?</P>
    <P>In the 1946 Act a good deal was done to improve the legislation in regard to traffic and road signs.  I am glad to see that further steps are being taken in that direction.  I hope the Minister, when he makes use of his powers, will do something to create some kind of uniformity in the use of bend signs.  The standards adopted by county engineers throughout the country as to when, and when not, to have a bend sign vary enormously. There are places where it would be far better to have a bend sign at the beginning of a long stretch of road to indicate that there will be continuous bends for, say, three miles.  That has been done in some areas and not in other areas.  If the Minister could effect greater coordination under this section in regard to the use of bend signs, it would be of immense benefit.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to make use of these sections also in order to encourage some uniform attitude in regard to the use of halt signs at important crossroads?  At present, in some counties, if you proceed from a minor road to a main road, the major road ahead sign is used with a fair degree of uniformity, but in other cases there are startling omissions.  The sign compelling a motorist to halt before emerging from a side road to a main road is rarely used, and is used inconsistently.  In some cases, roads which now have the halt sign seem to be much less important, from the point of view of traffic safety, than other dangerous intersections where the halt sign would be of great advantage.</P>
    <P>I would further ask the Minister whether or not he intends to make use of these amending sections to try and establish some sort of uniformity or to encourage county engineers to come <Col N="111" /> together to make up their minds, themselves, as to how to use &ldquo;cats' eyes.&rdquo; They are of immense benefit to motorists but, again, their use is completely haphazard.  There are some counties where, on the main arterial roads, the &ldquo;cats' eyes&rdquo; are continuous even where there are no bends, but there are other places where the road suddenly bends and where there are no &ldquo;cats' eyes&rdquo; and, naturally, that confuses the long-distance motorist.  In connection with all these traffic and road sign regulations, I think myself that the Minister, instead of using compulsory powers, should try and get the county engineers to come together and work out a system for themselves, to be approved by their local authorities. I hope the Minister will make use of this legislation for that purpose.</P>
    <P>There is a section enabling local authorities to acquire land for the purpose of quarries.  I am glad to see that provision.  The Minister is, no doubt, well aware that local authorities have had difficulty in some areas in obtaining stone which, when mixed with tar, does not polish very rapidly. We are aware that a scientific test can be applied to stone and, literally, millions of pounds can be saved over a period of 30 years if care is taken in the selection of the stone.  The types of stone that polish quickly are a source of enormous expense to the road authority as they are also in connection with disbursements from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>In the section relating to powers the Minister is going to have in regard to the character of bridges across rivers, I do hope the Minister will consider the amending section very carefully. As the Minister knows an inland waterways association has been formed in Athlone to try to increase the use made of the Shannon for social, tourist and fishing purposes, and has suggested that there should be buses on the Shannon, that is to say, motor cruises for tourist purposes during the summer months.  In the meantime, so far as I know, the arrangement has definitely been made that the bridge of Athlone should now be a fixed bridge.  We have been told that the <Col N="112" /> cost of providing a temporary bridge if a fixed bridge is constructed, added to the cost of the bridge, will be as great as the cost of an opening bridge. I am not aware of all the facts in that connection but I do hope the arrangements for providing for inquiries to decide whether bridges should be fixed or open bridges will be such as to provide for a rather far-seeing view in the matter.  It is quite possible to hold an inquiry when some of these matters which relate to future policy will not be properly considered.  I should like to ask the Minister what his view is on the fixed bridge question on the Shannon and whether he regards the amendments provided in this Bill as sufficient to allow for some flexibility of action.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 43, I notice an improvement in drafting in relation to financial powers of local authorities which I should have thought to be hardly necessary.  He has decided that there should be a redrafting of a considerable amount of legislation which I thought was fairly clear.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that under Section 45 something is being done to enable local authorities to carry out the reconstruction of town halls.  Many of them are a disgrace to our present civilisation, and I am glad that such powers are now being taken.  In relation to Section 48, I hope the Minister, when he comes to describing in detail the changes in the Local Authorities (Works) Act legislation, will make very clear the position in regard to compensation. We on this side of the House regard the Local Authorities (Works) Act in two ways: we agree that a great deal of the money was usefully spent but we also claim that enormous sums were wasted, that in certain areas where rivers were repaired at the wrong time of the year men were standing up to their waist shovelling earth out of streams and that no arrangements were made to maintain such rivers.</P>
    <P>There are a great many rivers at the present time which have been cleaned under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, but because there is no statutory method by which they can be maintained and because local authorities <Col N="113" /> are not responsible for maintaining them, hundreds of thousands of pounds spent in the course of the last four years were wasted money.  I would like to ask the Minister whether he has considered the absence of any law in regard to the maintenance of rivers repaired under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  We have legislation governing arterial drainage which has been approved by the House and which appears to be working fairly well.  It provides for the maintenance of arterial drainage by each county on the basis of a report prepared by the Commissioners of Public Works.  We have the Land Reclamation Act under which minor drains on agricultural land have been repaired, and we have the Local Authorities (Works) Act which provides for rivers which do not come within the ambit of the Arterial Drainage Act.</P>
    <P>From what I can see in this Bill the Minister has not faced up to the problem of the maintenance of Local Authorities (Works) Act rivers once they have been drained; neither is he compelling a local authority to maintain them nor is he making arrangements whereby the State may give to the local authority a continuing grant for their maintenance.  As I have said, the Local Authorities (Works) Act has had good and bad effects; a lot of good work has been done and bad work has been done.</P>
    <P>There remain in a number of counties rivers that could be well repaired and satisfactorily repaired provided difficulties in paying compensation to mill owners could be overcome. I hope the Minister will explain on the different stages of this Bill whether he has done enough to enable the opposition that is encountered in all local authorities to paying compensation to be got over.  There are at least four rivers, for example, in County Longford, in which there are mills which are more or less derelict or where the water is rarely used and where nothing can be done because of the objection of the mill owner, the difficulty of paying compensation and the difficulty of persuading county councils even to start proceedings to recommend the repair of the river.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> Section 51 removes an anomaly in connection with the apportionment of the country rate with urban authorities. I understand that the implication there again is that the Minister for Local Government, like all his predecessors, is once more tinkering with the valuation problem.  I can cast no reflection against him because no Government has yet tackled it, but I do think this section, though when we come to discuss it it may prove to be an excellent and a wise one, is once more tinkering with the problem.</P>
    <P>Section 52 will succeed, I hope, in getting over the difficulties whereby the arrangement for plebiscites for changing street names would appear to be undemocratic.  Even though we did our best under the 1946 Act to put the matter right, I would like to ask the Minister whether the Act has been widely availed of and whether in fact there has been a necessity for the provisions made one way or another.</P>
    <P>Under Section 53 the Minister has provided that county councils will now be able to make grants for the building of parish halls instead of building them themselves.  I should like to ask the Minister whether in that connection he has examined the clause of the 1941 Act which provided for the setting up of parish councils or whether he has decided that the 1941 Act has said the last word in regard to that matter. As the Minister knows because of the growth of specialisation and of the number of functions of all local authorities, we have over the last 30 years been increasing the size of local authority units.  He knows, as we all do, that the boards of guardians have been abolished, rural district councils have been abolished, officers have been appointed for more than one county and so forth.  I think it has been considered in a rather vague way recently that the process might have gone too far, that in relation to the need for establishing a greater degree of cooperation amongst smaller units of the community, perhaps an experiment in the opposite direction might bear fruit.  Has the Minister considered in connection with this legislation whether parish councils should be given a greater authority than they <Col N="115" /> have under the 1941 Act?  Has he considered why there are so few parish councils, whether it is true that the vast majority of people in this country have not got the parish mentality in the administrative sense? Has he considered whether the amount of money they could spend under prevailing conditions would be so small that to strike a parish council rate would have quite a different effect than it would in England because there simply is not the amount of prosperity in the purely rural community to make the striking of a rate such as that effective.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister brought his mind to bear on the whole problem of whether, if we do have local authority areas becoming larger and larger as time goes on, we should not by way of complete contrast try and experiment in creating very small areas in order to implement the work of associations such as Muintir na Tíre and so forth and give some statutory significance to the work of the small communities?  I have not made up my mind about this problem nor has any member of our Party.  None of us has faced this question of creating a sense of local responsibility by reversing the general trend of local government law in regard to the size and units of local authorities.  I think the Minister will agree it is a matter worthy of consideration that we should not abandon all thought of the parish council idea solely because there are very few parish councils, if any, established under the 1941 Act.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether the amendments in this Bill are an indication that he intends to take no further action in regard to that problem.</P>
    <P>There are a number of useful small sections enabling local authorities to give grants for swimming pools to local authorities, which should have an excellent effect.  There must be a tremendous vacuum in the swimming world in this country which needs to be filled.  May I, without going beyond the provisions of the Bill, ask the Minister why he did not take advantage <Col N="116" /> of this Bill to examine the derelict site legislation?  I know that when I ceased to be Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government the Derelict Sites Act of 1940 had already proved to have limitations, and there were difficulties in regard to implementing it.</P>
    <P>There is still a vast number of derelict sites throughout the country although they have been improved. There are derelict sites which have been repaired by simply putting up a wall between two houses behind which grow nettles and ugly trees.  They look like a temporary patch on a place that still looks unkempt.  There is an enormous amount of work to be done in this connection.  I am well aware that it is very difficult to get the work done on account of the very high rates which local authorities bear.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, a great part of the housing of the local authorities will be completed in the course of the next two years.  I understand that 45 out of 116 housing authorities are about to complete the building of houses.  As the Minister knows, building labour is very immobile and the present Government will find it just as difficult as we did to give employment to constructional workers throughout the year.  The present Government will find, as we did, that local building contractors do not like to do much work in the winter months. Unemployment inevitably arises in the winter months and something needs to be done in order to overcome the difficulties of unemployment in addition to what can be provided through the National Development Fund, namely, increased contributions for roads and sanitary services for small villages.  It might be, if the Minister were to revise the derelict sites legislation, that he would get more work done under that head.  He might consider altering the methods by which the work is done or encourage the local authorities to do more work.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister in connection with a minor amendment in regard to legislation governing the control of fair tolls, as in the case of valuation, found it impossible, like other Ministers, to make up his mind <Col N="117" /> what should be done about the holding of fairs in crowded market streets.  I have no observations to make on that except to say he has decided not to go forward in regard to the matter.</P>
    <P>The section in relation to the provision of conciliation machinery is one which will, I think, create an interesting discussion.  I see no objection to providing conciliation machinery but in most cases it has been found that conciliation machinery for workers should consist of persons who are quite independent and who have no connection with the employment of the persons concerned.  Industrial tribunals in other countries where they are formed locally for local purposes consist of an employer's representative, an employee's representative and a neutral chairman.  It has generally been found difficult to provide proper conciliation where the people who are on the conciliation committee consist in some degree of the employers of the persons concerned.  Anomalies and difficulties arise.  Prejudice exists.  I should like the Minister to let us know, when answering on the Second Stage, whether he has considered all that matter.  In the case of industrial courts and local industrial courts in other countries, it has been found that the independent view can be a humane view.  The people concerned can have the independent judicial sense which bodies have when their members do not consist of those who employ the men who come before them for the consideration of their cases.  The Minister in proposing this machinery is making a departure from that general conception.  I am not saying he is wrong.  I think it is a matter we should think over very carefully on the Committee Stage.  Giving powers to a local authority to appoint non-members to act as conciliation bodies in these cases might create difficulties just as great for the workers concerned as for the employing authority.  I wonder has the Minister considered the matter sufficiently fully?</P>
    <P>I could spend very much longer on the Second Stage, but, as the Minister said, I think this is a Committee Bill. I should like to ask the Minister how far he can give us information in <Col N="118" /> advance as to how he intends to alter the powers of the County Management Act when we come to discuss the administrative section of the Bill and the part of the Bill which relates to the employment of officers and their conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to approach the Second Reading of this Bill on the basis of trying to get from the Minister answers to certain questions.  When he hears them, he will agree with me that it is somewhat difficult for those who are members of local authorities to fully appreciate and understand, and not misjudge, certain items in this Bill.  Obviously, this is a departmental Bill and in my opinion it must have been under consideration for years.</P>
      <P>There is no question of Government policy involved.  It is not a ministerial Bill arising from Government policy.  The Bill was introduced in July and we only received a copy of it last Saturday morning.  The Second Reading Stage was to be taken to-day.  There is no objection to that.  At this stage I should like to ask the Minister whether he would be agreeable to give us a reasonable period of time between Second Stage and Committee Stage to study the Bill.</P>

      <P>We have got to consult with each other and see how it affects the interests of local authorities. First, I should like to say this. I am not able to say&mdash;maybe the Minister will help us on this now or later and if he does so now it will make it unnecessary for me, at any rate, to deal with a number of points which I have noted&mdash;if the local authority referred to in this Bill is the manager or the elected representatives. From the way I have read the Bill it appears to me that the local authority referred to every time except in one section is the manager. That being the case, of course, I have a considerable amount of objections to certain things and I suppose by the Committee Stage with my colleagues <Col N="119" /> we will probably find agreement as to what amendments might be introduced.  It is only in Section 25, I think, that the term &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; refers to the elected representatives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to the consent of the House, I will clarify the position in this matter.  The words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; in this Bill will be construed as the law stands at present on the basis of the reserved functions and executive functions but when we come to deal with the County Management Bill, which I would rather not discuss at this stage, and the amendments to it, the words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; will then be construed as meaning the reserved or executive functions as the House may decide when they discuss the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree then that I am correct in concluding that so far as this Bill is concerned the local authority is the manager?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this is a Bill which has been worked on for years by officials of the Department, and has been put to the Minister for him to pilot through the House in order that the Local Government Department and the Custom House can get rid of a lot of difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="120" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take full responsibility for the Custom House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I am not going to suggest that I am for one moment believing that this is the Minister's or the Government's policy.</P>
      <P>Section 59&mdash;I am not going through it from beginning to end, but as I pick the points out&mdash;proposes in the year 1954 to make the councillors only an advisory body.  We are going back to the 1927 Act when the Cork Bill was passed, and all that we as councillors will be able to do as a result of sections of this Bill will be to strike a rate and we will have practically no other responsibility.  The Minister referred to the explanatory memorandum which he said was issued in order to make the Bill a little bit more understandable but I would like to say to him as a layman, not a legal man, I find that in certain parts, the explanatory memorandum is just as difficult to understand as the section of the Bill it purports to explain.  In the explanatory note in connection with Section 59 it is not clear whether this is a reserve power or otherwise.</P>
      <P>In amending the 1941 Act, in all the various sections under what we call Chapter I here, all this Bill is attempting to do is to give the Minister complete control of staffs of local authorities, and elected representatives will be completely excluded from any say in the selection, appointment or terms and conditions of appointment of officials.  At this stage I should like to say that where Section 25 deals with this conciliatory body that it is purporting to set up and to which the previous speaker has referred the word &ldquo;servant&rdquo; is used.  Now the Minister will know just as I have said that the local authority here is the manager and the word &ldquo;servant&rdquo; as we understand it in our local authority applies solely to those who are in receipt of weekly payments and all who receive monthly payments are excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Superannuation might explain that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I know superannuation might explain that, but the <Col N="121" /> fact is that if a manager either by himself or with the consent of the Minister wants to make certain new regulations or deal with certain officials they cannot appeal to their elected representatives as can those who are described as &ldquo;servants&rdquo;. There is no appeal to the elected representatives, and that in my opinion will be considered by us.  I think, personally, if we have to keep in mind that amendments to the Managerial Acts restoring greater powers to the elected representatives are to be introduced, it will take away from the reserve functions certain of the sole rights of the manager but it is going to be more difficult unless we know when this Managerial Act is coming in.</P>
      <P>The Minister recently I think spent a considerable amount of time visiting quite a number of local authorities, meeting elected representatives and trying his best to hear from them their grievances and what suggestions they had.  In the case of Dublin, he will recall that I apologised for not being able to be present for a particular reason and he was good enough to say that he could appreciate that on that occasion he could not be met by the representatives with all the details of their complaints, but he would welcome from them whatever suggestions they had when they could get together, and that there was no Party situation involved.</P>
      <P>He did not say he would accept the suggestions but that he would consider each suggestion made to him.  To us that sounded good because we have a whole series of grievances, but now our grievances are going to be nailed down and much more difficult to remove if we are going to legislate in favour of things to which we object.  I cannot understand nor appreciate how the position will be.  The Minister will find himself in very serious difficulty if now at this stage he legislates and gets a Bill through copper-fastening certain sections which afterwards in the amendment of the City Management Act he wants to take away, not from the present position but from the position that has made the present position even worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things that I want to <Col N="122" /> point out to the Minister is this: the local authority, the manager, can when and if this Bill becomes an Act in its present form if he likes, pick, and add to the staffs.  He can employ 20 engineers, God knows how many doctors without consulting the elected representatives and without asking them if they are prepared to meet these extra charges when the striking of the rate comes round.  We think it would be a good thing if the Minister would agree that those responsible for striking the rate and who have to face the criticism of the public and the Press should have at least some knowledge of these alterations in regard to staffs, these alterations in conditions, if you like, improvements in salaries and so on, because they have to find the money to pay for them.</P>
    <P>This same situation arose on the last occasion on which we had a Bill to amend the managerial system.  The Minister brings in an amendment in Section 25 of this Bill to the 1930 Management Act and I should like to know from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle if it will be possible to bring in other amendments to that Act.  Does the Minister not open up the road by this method?</P>
    <P>We had all this out before on the other Act because there were certain amendments which we wanted to put in at that time.  I moved, at the time the other Act was being discussed, an amendment to insert before Section 59 a provision that, at the beginning of every month, the manager shall cause to be prepared and furnished to every member of a council particulars of all staff proposals submitted by him to the appropriate Minister since the next previous meeting of the council and the decisions of the said appropriate Minister received by the manager during the same period.  I wanted to ensure that the councillors would know that the manager had said to the Minister: &ldquo;I want sanction to put on 12 extra engineers at such and such rates of salaries&rdquo; and, if the Minister agreed to the appointments, the manager having shown reasonable cause on the basis of need and so on, that once a month the people who have to raise the money to pay these <Col N="123" /> appointees would at least be notified. What is the present position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no necessity to notify them at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dealing with it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is a Bill which deals with the county manager in one section at least.  The Bill deals with all county managers, but it deals with city management as well.  I am sure the Minister knows that this is what happens.  We in Dublin Corporation, shortly before the period arrives when we have to strike a rate&mdash;I am speaking as chairman of the finance committee and I have the whole council as members of the committee&mdash;are presented with a volume of estimates already prepared by the city manager and we have to examine as best we can certain things.  We cannot interfere with certain things.  We handle an expenditure in the City of Dublin of £8,000,000, a good portion of which is, of course, grants.  The Minister says: &ldquo;I am giving you a right now of an appeal for your servants to yourselves if they are unfairly treated or think they are unfairly treated.&rdquo;  I want the Minister to extend that same right of appeal to all officials, including what are described as the servants.  I want him to realise that there are certain sections in the Bill which will, in fact, amend the management of local authorities.  That is what this is doing. If one reads the Schedules, one will find that it amends Management Acts all through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has introduced a section in this Bill which permits authorities, other than those which at present have sanction, to levy for the decoration of the city.  I, on a previous occasion, sought to amend the position we are faced with.  Every local authority other than ours can <Col N="124" /> strike a rate or can levy this penny and up to threepence by a majority of the members.  In the case of the City of Dublin, two-thirds of the members have to be present, and I want to know whether the Minister is prepared to put us in the City of Dublin on the very same level as all other local authorities and allow a majority of those present at a meeting of that kind to make the decision&mdash;notice has to be given so the Minister has control over our expenditure&mdash;so that we will not be put to the trouble of having to have two-thirds of the members present, unlike all other authorities.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say that Section 18 seeks to amend Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1941, by the deletion of the words &ldquo;local authority representatives&rdquo;, that is to say, the elected representatives, and preventing them from having any say in the matters referred to?  These are the alterations and amendments which are driving us further into a dictatorial situation so far as local authorities are concerned in their relations with the Custom House.  We do not mind control, but if we are to regard ourselves seriously as elected representatives, acting on behalf of those who elected us, we ought to have some say in the doing of things and everything should not be left in the hands of what is called here the local authority&mdash;a new name for the manager.  The elected representatives cease to be members of the local authorities and are just puppets.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is objectionable in the same way and Section 17 is a section of which I am rather doubtful.  I am doubtful if it will be acceptable to any set of local representatives.  The local authority representatives, as I have already made clear, will have no say whatever in the appointment of their officials, but Section 17 gives the local authority, the manager, the right to switch officials from one local authority to another.</P>
    <P>Surely if the manager up in Donegal wants to make a deal with the manager in Dublin about bringing somebody down from Donegal, or sending somebody from Dublin to Donegal, the local authority representatives should have some say in the <Col N="125" /> matter.  They should at least be consulted and not suddenly find that they have a number of officials from other areas altogether transferred to them without their knowledge or consent. Surely that is an unfair suggestion.  It is something in objecting to which I will do my very best to influence my colleagues on this side to support me. I do not know that the Minister really studied this Bill because I think he will give us credit for having a little more intelligence than sub-section 5 of Section 12 would suggest we have. That sub-section suggests that at any time an office in a local authority can be abolished but, if there is a certain person in that office, it can only be abolished with that occupier's consent. What does that mean?  It means that the Local Government Department will have a device by which they can, without disclosing their policy or reason, get rid of every town clerk in every local authority because when his time comes to go or if he cannot be induced to go before his time is up, the position will be declared vacant and the office can be abolished.  In the Dublin Corporation&mdash;I take it the same position obtains all through the country&mdash;the link between the elected representatives and the official side of the local authority happens to be the town clerk.  I would not like to see that office abolished without the consent of the elected representatives. Why are they not included for consideration? Why should the Minister and the management take it upon themselves to decide to abolish an office under any local authority?  Surely that should be a matter where there should be an understanding between all concerned, including particularly the elected representatives.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to understand Section 24.  I think one would have to be a lawyer really to understand it. The explanation in the memorandum is equally hard to understand and to relate.  It deals with the age limit and with the officers, including the managers themselves.  I am a bit suspicious that this is not going to work out in the way public representatives want it to work, if this section is carried.  It is quite clear, because we discussed it on many occasions in this House, that if <Col N="126" /> you want a man to fill the serious and important office of city or county manager, he must be someone of intelligence and experience and if he is not taken from the service, if he is taken from outside&mdash;a brilliant man from outside the Civil Service or the local authority service&mdash;he at least must have reached the age of 40 years and under this section he would not qualify for a reasonable pension.  We are going by this device to open up a position where the office of city or county manager will be channelled into a situation where only either civil servants or local authority servants will be able to do the job because no man of the calibre suitable for the job of City of Dublin Manager, if he is 40 or over, would accept the position if at the end of 25 years he must give it up.  Where would his pension rights be?  There are certain limits to what can be added and I would ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy suggest an upper age limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The position that existed before made the appointment of manager an appointment in certain cases for life.  There was no age limit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the ideal situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it is ideal, but it is not any less ideal from a sarcastic point of view, than the other.  We, as public representatives, have a suspicion that because of the age limit attached to this particular office and because of the difficulty of getting a man of the calibre required to fill such a position, you will never get candidates at the age such persons enter the Civil Service.  You will never be able to get a man who can give 40 years' service and qualify for a full pension.  We shall be opening the door, with our eyes open, to a position where, from now on, every city manager will be an official brought <Col N="127" /> from some Department or other, because even if he has reached the age of 40 or 50, he will already have to his credit a sufficient number of years' service to qualify for a full pension at the end of his managerial appointment.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, one has to consider that we are now enacting corrective and retrospective legislation.  A few people were appointed for life and an attempt was made by the Department to get rid of them.  In one case, a manager succeeded in maintaining his right in court to hold his position as long as he wished or until he was removed for legitimate cause.  We are now including the office of Manager of the City of Dublin.  Again, may I say this man was appointed under a particular Act, which is also being amended?  I am not arguing it because of that fact, although it is wrong in my opinion.  That man was appointed under an Act of Parliament giving him a statutory right to his position for life, and to come along now and say, in the language we are using, that we now deem it to have been that he was never so appointed and, therefore, his term of office must end when he is 65, is ridiculous.  Many years ago, we brought in an amendment&mdash;I think it was to the Copyright Act&mdash;resulting from a legal decision, and the wording of the amendment was something to this effect: &ldquo;That the word &lsquo;may&rsquo; in the principal Act shall now be deemed to have been &lsquo;shall&rsquo;, and shall always be deemed to have been &lsquo;shall&rsquo;.&rdquo;  In other words, you bring in a Bill to provide that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; meant &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, and we now say it always meant &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has, in Section 60, a suggestion that certain Orders or regulations, when they are to be put into effect, shall be laid on the Table of the House.  In view of the fact that these regulations will be made without the knowledge of any single member of the council, including the Lord Mayor, would it not be fair to say that these regulations laid on the Table of the House should be open for inspection, and, if not objected to within 30 days, that they then become effective? It is unfair to elected representatives <Col N="128" /> to put them in the position that regulations will be made about which they know nothing concerning the administrative side of the body to which they happen to be elected and which they help to run and that, after a certain period, those regulations are laid on the Table of this House; we will know then what the regulations are, but we will have no means of altering them or protesting against them.  If the Minister listens too much to the official side in the Custom House as to how to manage local authorities and the elected representatives, he will, in turn, cause those local representatives who give their time free and without any compensation whatsoever in serving the public on local authorities to give that position a great deal of examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not, of course, confined to Dublin.  Local representatives do that voluntarily all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but in the case of Dublin they do not even get car fare.  Those of us who attend the City Hall and who use our own cars to get there have to pay the car park attendant for looking after our cars while we are engaged on our public duties. If the Minister puts us in the position of being merely puppets, which will be the effect of this particular Bill if some of the sections are carried into effect, I can assure him that many people will cease to seek election because they will not be interested in acting merely as an advisory body in a very limited fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been good enough to say he will give us a reasonable period in which to consider this Bill in detail.  Apart from the variety of interests, if you like, of a Party such as this which has representatives in it from all over the country, the members of every local authority will also have to come together and see whether they agree or disagree.  In our particular local authority we will probably appoint a committee, representative of all Parties, to go into the matter in detail in order to find out what will be for the best interests of <Col N="129" /> Dublin.  From what I know of my colleagues on that body I think I am safe in saying that they will approach the matter from the point of view of trying to achieve the best form of civic administration irrespective of political allegiance.</P>
    <P>I do not like a number of these sections.  I hope that when we deal with them on committee the Minister himself will have come to the conclusion that some of these had better be postponed.  Perhaps this Bill could be postponed until the introduction of the County Management (Amendment) Bill so that the two might be discussed together. It has been stated that the policy of the present Government is to restore to the elected representatives of local authorities the powers which were taken from them through the medium of certain Acts.  There is no sense in saying that is the policy if in the meanwhile legislation is introduced which will make the present bad situation very much worse.  I take it the Minister has enough experience of local authorities and local representatives to realise that this will have the effect of souring those who serve the public on local authorities.  He has been good enough to say he will give us time to consider amendments between this and the Committee Stage. He has been good enough to admit that the words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; referred to in this Bill really mean the manager, with certain limited exceptions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite serious about this.  Apparently the Minister is serious too because he is not prepared to answer offhand the question I put to him.  It is quite clear that &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; in some sections means the manager to the exclusion of the elected representatives.  The Minister says that in the sections which he enumerated it means the city or county manager plus the elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to the sections in which clearly &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; means the manager to the exclusion of the elected representatives.  The Minister says on the Committee Stage he will make the matter clear section by section. If the Minister undertakes to do that I shall be quite satisfied but I do not think he should blame me in the meanwhile for reconsidering this and <Col N="132" /> holding fast to my interpretation of what is meant in certain of the sections.  The Minister agrees that he will on Committee Stage in each section indicate whether it is the manager alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1941 Act makes the manager the local authority and the Minister is recognising it in this. I am not saying he is to blame for the 1941 Act but there are things in the 1941 Act which, as a result of experience, are found not to be perfect and which should be amended.  This whole Bill seeks to amend imperfections as far as the Custom House is concerned in a whole series of their Acts.  We cannot say who was responsible for all those mistakes, errors and omissions. This is a Bill seeking to rectify omissions in previous Acts by the Custom House.  I have not got the 1941 Act here, Part II, Chapter I, but I am satisfied that if that is the Minister's answer then &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; does mean the manager and nobody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Seosamh Ó Cinnéide Seosamh Ó Cinnéide">
      <NameTxt>Seosamh Ó Cinnéide</NameTxt>
      <P>Do labhar an Teachta Ó Brioscú agus an Teachta Childers ar an mBille seo agus nilim chun an Dáil a choimeád ró-fhada ach tá cupla rudai a bhaineann leis an mBille ar mhaith liom chur sios orthu anseo.  They are in connection with the sections that deal with the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Certain powers are given under the Bill for certain finances to be raised towards the cost of the administration of the Local Authorities (Works) Act and I have a suggestion to make to the Minister. All over the country there are drainage districts which embrace certain catchment areas.  Why not widen these catchment areas and include the maintenance of the drains that empty into them and let the local authority and the central authority <Col N="133" /> make a contribution towards that work?</P>
      <P>Such contribution was made under the Department of Local Government heretofore.  It was made in connection with minor employment schemes or minor relief schemes by the Department of Finance through the Board of Works.  Why not now deal with this matter systematically rather than wait for a particular unemployment position to arise in any area?  Why not make the maintenance of these drains an annual function of the local authority and enlarge the catchment areas?  I put that suggestion to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to note from the Explanatory Memorandum that the definition of a road means any public road, and includes &ldquo;any bridge, pipe, arch, gulley, footway, pavement, fence, railing or wall (where such fence, railing or wall was erected by or was liable to be maintained by the county council or grand jury) forming part thereof.&rdquo;  The Minister takes broad powers unto himself to define a road and that is all to the good.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers has dealt with a very vexed question with which every Deputy from rural Ireland is confronted every day in the week.  Lorries and motor cars use boreens daily and the maintenance of these ways into the farms and homes of the people is becoming a problem.  While, under Deputy McQuillan's Bill, the maintenance of these roads can be undertaken by the local authority, the problem is so big that they baulk at doing it and will continue to baulk at doing it.</P>
      <P>Again I make a suggestion to the Minister, that in co-ordination with the Department which deals with rural improvement schemes, he could authorise the local authority to contribute 25 per cent. or less towards that work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is what may seem a trivial matter, which I raised when our Government were in power and again when the inter-Party Government were in power and again now, namely, that the beneficiaries on these boreens should have the same responsibility as have the beneficiaries on the highways.  They <Col N="134" /> should be compelled to breast and to cut the hedges.  Since this State was established, millions of money have been spent on the highways while one would be far safer from the point of view of light and of clothes being torn off one's back going through the African jungle than going through these boreens.  Even after the expenditure of £500 on these roads, there is a canopy of trees over them, there is no sunlight and one might as well throw the money down the drain because, through rain seeping through the hedges they revert to their former position in 12 months' time.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it can be done under this Bill or not but I would suggest to the Minister to authorise the local authority to contribute its portion that the beneficiaries hesitate to contribute now because one or two will kick.  In that way the beneficiaries could be made to carry out their responsibilities in the same way as beneficiaries on the highway have to do it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers dealt with another matter, the contribution from the local authority towards parish halls or local halls.  It is my experience and I am sure that of every rural Deputy that the body that will do anything is the town improvements association, not the parish council.  Parish councils were established during the Emergency and had on them representatives of the rural community who were noticeable by their absence.  It is the few people in the towns at present who are civic minded and these are the people to deal with when local things are to be done.  Eventually the others may come in.  They are the people who carried the burden of the Red Cross and many other activities during the war.  These are the people who build the local halls and everything else.  I suggest that we should get in touch with these people and that we would then begin to advance, instead of visualising a parish council which will represent every townland and outlying area, which will not operate as well as a local town improvements association.</P>
    <P>Fairs are mentioned in this Bill, fairs on the street and fairs in the towns.  I will confine myself to my own <Col N="135" /> constituency.  There is a local authority doing its best to improve the health of the people.  Athlone has a splendid fair green on which thousands of pounds were spent.  In that narrow old town, a good town but which is a thousand years of age, nowhere will do to show sheep and cattle but the street.  Children have to go to school in danger to their lives.  They have to go through dirt and walk into school with the dung on their boots.  Where there is a fair green in a town the local authority should be compelled to exercise complete power by keeping cattle, sheep and pigs off the streets. They should be taken to the fair green and put into the pens provided for them.  Money should be made available out of the National Development Fund to provide these fair greens in places where they are not available at present.  I know that in saying that the publicans will kick up hell.  I was born in a public house myself, and I know that the publicans will want the dealing to go on, as happens at present in so many cases, outside their houses. We have advanced a little, and the fact is that now the ordinary man selling his cattle, sheep or pigs on the streets knows that, in no matter what part of the town he sells his stock, he has to go down and meet the dealer outside the bank to get paid.</P>
    <P>The shopkeeper should look at this from the practical point of view.  If he dishes up the proper goods to his customers, whether it be drink or anything else, they will come to his shop and deal with him.  From the point of view of the health of our people, the Minister should go ahead.  There should be a proper public opinion created to ensure that, where fair greens and market places are available for the marketing of live stock and other goods, the business of selling and buying should be carried out there. The same should apply to the marketing of vegetables so as to ensure that our highways would not become a danger to the health of our people and sometimes to life.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I want to refer to.  The Minister is taking power under the Bill to provide <Col N="136" /> conciliation machinery for workers.  I suggest that there should be a realistic approach to this whole matter of workers and their remuneration, and of officials and their remuneration.  We are a rural community, with 74 per cent.  of our people living on valuations of £20 and under.  They have no other means of income unless they come under a £4 valuation whereby they get certain benefits if they are unemployed during a certain closed period in the winter.  The fact is that the majority of our people are living on holdings with valuations of from £4 to £20.  These people, in the rates levied on them, pay the officials and pay the workers, and you can kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  You can keep piling on the rates, but eventually, while you are talking about conciliation, arbitration and fair play for everyone, you are going to smash the majority of our people.  There needs to be a conservative approach in this whole matter.  You can reach the stage when, say, in the County of Westmeath in the case of the 700 people employed there on the roads from one end of the year to the other, the day may come, with this conciliation and arbitration that you may drain the last farthing out of the small farmers and have to cut down your employment by half if you increase wages. I say that because the standard of living is the standard of living of those people on the land.  Sooner or later&mdash; I do not care what Government is there&mdash;that is a problem which it will have to face up to, and face up to very soon.  It is all right to be liberal in your talk about what pay such a one should have.</P>
    <P>Take the conditions under which people are living down around Benown near Athlone, which at present is under floods.  That is an act of Providence, of course, and I am not making politics out of it.  But take the conditions under which the people there live at ordinary times.  They have no standard of living.  I would like people to remember that when they are so glib in talking about &ldquo;fair this&rdquo;, &ldquo;fair that&rdquo; and &ldquo;fair the other&rdquo;.  The Minister for Local Government is the responsible Minister dealing with this Bill, and he will want to be very careful <Col N="137" /> about conciliation.  On the other hand, I know what he is up against.</P>
    <P>He is up against a number of county councillors who will compete with one another at election times in promising to give the most to everyone, and later will make a great show when it comes to striking the rate by saying that they will strike the lowest rate possible.  I want to see candour and honesty in this whole thing.  I think I have said the things that I want to say on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that, unlike Deputy Briscoe and some other speakers, I did not get my copy of the Bill until yesterday morning, and therefore, had very little time to examine it.  Listening to a number of the Deputies who have spoken on the Bill they were, in my opinion, putting the car before the horse.  We know that the Minister went down the country recently and interviewed all the county councils.  He told the different county councils a whole lot about the changes that were going to be made in the Managerial Act.  From my study of the Bill, I want to know, to whom we are giving the powers set out in it.  Drastic changes are being made under the Bill, but before I could honestly vote for these changes I would want to know to whom I am giving the powers set out.  I think that the Minister would be well advised to introduce his amendments to the Managerial Act before asking the House to pass this Bill.  I am sure that his Parliamentary Secretary will bear me out in this that he also would like to see to whom we are going to give those powers before he would vote for them.  The changes that are forecast in this Bill are, in a number of cases, big changes.  They have been mentioned by a number of previous speakers.  I would ask the Minister to consider what I say very carefully before he asks the House to vote for the changes set out in this Bill.  He should not ask people to vote blindly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On different sections of the Bill the Minister himself was not prepared to say, in the case of some sections, who was the local authority, whether it was the county council composed of the elected representatives or the <Col N="138" /> manager.  I have been a member of a local authority for a number of years and I know now who is the local authority.  I know that the power which the county councils have is very light.  I am not going to say at this stage how I would vote as between the county council and the local authority.</P>
    <P>I would like to vote with my eyes open.  I do not want the Minister to come here and present us with a Bill giving certain powers to what is now called the local authority without first knowing who was going to be the local authority in, say, a month's time.  I think that, in all fairness to the House and to the people whom the Minister met when he was down the country, the amendments to the Managerial Act should have been introduced before the bringing in of this Bill because in that event we would know to whom we were giving the powers proposed.  That is all I have to say on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like first of all to refer&mdash;and may I do so with all respect to Deputy Childers who opened for the Opposition&mdash;to the remarks of Deputy Briscoe.  He commenced his speech by saying that this was not a ministerial Bill, that it was a departmental Bill, one which was lying on the stocks for a good many years and he then proceeded to criticise me.  I have been here only a very short time, but if this Bill has been lying on the stocks for a number of years why did he not criticise my predecessors who are members of his Party?  I may say that the same goes for the remarks of the last speaker.</P>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Childers that this is a Committee Bill, and that it discloses nothing of policy&mdash;of the future policy of the Government.  The amendments to the County Management Act will be introduced in due course when the House will have an opportunity of discussing them. Deputy Childers is in full agreement with me that this is a Committee Bill and I expect to take it as such.  With regard to the various points which have been raised, we can go into them on the Committee Stage and consider amendments where necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> Deputy Childers asked me what I think of consolidation.  I am in full agreement with consolidation, and I am very glad that we have got a considerable distance with it in regard to local government law.  In my opinion, this Bill will assist in consolidating the Local Government Acts.  Deputy Childers was worried about the relationship of this Bill to the County Management Acts.  I do not think there would be any difficulty whatsoever in dealing with this Bill first.</P>
    <P>Play has been made about the definition of the words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; by many speakers.  &ldquo;Local authority&rdquo; in this Bill will be construed on the present basis of reserved functions and executive functions, and when the County Management Acts are amended the words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; will mean either reserved or executive functions, according as this House may decide to amend the law on management.  May I refer the various speakers to Section 6 of the present Bill, which clearly sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this chapter of this part of the Act &lsquo;appropriate Minister&rsquo;, &lsquo;local authority&rsquo;, &lsquo;major office&rsquo; and &lsquo;office&rsquo; have the same meanings respectively as in Part II of the Act of 1941.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There should be no ambiguity at all as to the definition of the term &ldquo;local authority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers also referred to what has now become known as the McQuillan Act, and he told us that no local authority has taken any steps to implement that Act.  That is not true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;few&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected. They are gradually taking advantage of the Act, and year by year they are adding to the county roads as a result of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Childers asked me if under Section 29 British citizens could be dispensed from taking out driving licences.  The section will give the Minister power to make regulations in this matter if he considers it necessary and desirable.  Reference was made <Col N="140" /> also to the advantages of the signs known now as &ldquo;cat's eyes&rdquo;.  The county engineers throughout the country have annual conferences, and this is one of the matters discussed at them.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies, including Deputy Gilbride, referred to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The reference to the Local Authorities (Works) Act in the present Bill is purely financial.  As Deputies know, there is no financial provision set out in the 1949 Act, and it was merely to regularise that that this section was put in here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers and others referred to the advantages of parish councils. I am in absolutely full agreement with that, but we know what happened when we tried to set them up.  We found that very few of them functioned and we found that on that account local authorities were unable and actually did not desire to take advantage of their powers to provide parish halls.  We think that by amending the law now and by giving powers to local authorities to give grants to parish councils, we may assist in the erection of more parish halls all over the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers also referred to derelict sites.  Of course, that is not a matter for a Local Government Bill such as this.  It comes in under the Housing Acts and we hope to introduce some legislation in the near future to amend the Derelict Sites Act of 1940.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe made an attack on the County Management Acts.  I regret very much that Deputy Briscoe was not with the Lord Mayor and his colleagues the day I met them in the council chamber in Dublin.  I must say at this stage that I appreciate very much his reasons for not being there; he sent me an explanation, one which I accept unreservedly.  On that particular day the county manager and the County Management Acts were referred to and all the delegates there were unanimous that they had no objection to the county manager or the County Management Acts, but they referred to what is known as local government frustration.  I think that if there was local government frustration and if Deputy Briscoe is in agreement <Col N="141" /> with his colleagues, then he need not attack me.  I am not responsible for local government administration except from the month of June last. Deputy Briscoe also referred to the position of the City Manager of Dublin.  There is no doubt whatsoever but that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health thought in 1941, when he introduced the Act, that the age limit Order included all officers, including the city managers. This section, Section 24 of the present Bill, is removing the doubt which has since arisen.  There can be no doubt whatsoever but that the Minister, my predecessor, in introducing the 1941 Act, thought that the age limit did apply to the city manager and we are merely trying to remove the doubt.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Deputies, and in particular Deputy Childers, for their most constructive criticism on this Second Reading of the Bill.  In conclusion, may I say that it is really a Committee Bill and that I will be prepared, if I get the Second Reading this evening, to give any reasonable interval before the Committee Stage.</P>
