      <P>I invite the Deputy's attention to the replies I gave to questions addressed to me on the matter in this House on the 26th November last.  I regret that there is nothing that I can add to those replies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder could the Taoiseach say, as far as he is aware, whether there is any elected representative of the people in prison in any democratic country in Europe outside this particular case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the terms of the Flags and Emblems Bill, approved by the Stormont Government, have been brought to his notice; and if, in view of the fact that Nationalist citizens of the Six Counties regard the tricolour of the Republic of Ireland as their national emblem, he will, on behalf of the Government of the Republic, protest against the introduction of such a measure which is designed to prevent the flying of the tricolour in the Six Counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that there is not in existence any modern Irish grammar using the standard official forms and constructions and standard vocabularies of words that have been in use for 20 years in Acts of Parliament and statutory rules and orders; and whether, in order to promote the rapid spread of the Irish language as a modern language, he will see to it that this work is put in hands immediately and brought to a conclusion with all possible speed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>The Oireachtas Translation Branch has been engaged for a considerable time past on the preparation of a modern Irish grammar of the type referred to by the Deputy.  A booklet was published last July giving the outline of the main features of the proposed official standard; this was done so as to obtain the views and criticisms of persons and bodies interested in the subject before the standard was definitely adopted for official use.  A more <Col N="4" /> comprehensive edition of the booklet is now being prepared in consultation with various authorities on the subject and it is hoped to have the new edition available in a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say if the new edition is intended for vetting and for criticism or whether the new edition will be issued with something like the force of law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The point was this.  It was the same with the spelling.  It was decided that there should be a standard form for official use.  If the standard was satisfactory it was likely that it would then be adopted generally.  The same approach is behind the effort to produce this manual, to have a standardised grammatical usage in so far as official use is concerned.  The Department will, of course, take into account whatever criticisms they have got in regard to the first edition, and I am sure that even the second edition would not be the last word if subsequently they get satisfactory criticisms or suggestions for improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach say what connection will the Department of Education have with the final review and decision in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are consulted from time to time.  I was, for example, present when there was such a consultation in regard to a certain particular aspect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach realises that not only the spelling proposals but the grammar proposals were initiated without any reference to the Department of Education?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about the initiation.  Somebody has to initiate, but the Department of Education was consulted at some stage &mdash; I do not know what stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach realises that it is hardly customary in a civilised country to initiate proposals in regard to grammar changes without consulting the Department of Education, if that country has a Department of Education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is obvious that somebody has to begin.  The translation department was particularly well fitted to deal with it.  I do not think there is any body in the country, any group of people in the country, who have such a constant contact with the living language and given such attention to its structure and use as the translation staff.  From the point of view of initiating it, I took the responsibility of suggesting the initiation of it to them.  They had to consider the whole field.  Then they came to the conclusion that certain things could be done and when they came to this conclusion they consulted the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say what steps are being taken through the Department of Education to assemble in the most effective and competent way, judgment on the proposals that are now made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Education is kept in touch.  This manual was issued to be a standard for the translation staff concerned in the first instance.  It was issued to get public criticism, and the Department of Education know all about it.</P>

      <P>It has been decided that a branch of one of the Departments of State should be decentralised, but, pending the acquisition of a site for the new building that will be necessary for the purpose, it would not be in the public interest to make any announcement in regard to the details of the proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that some years ago an examination was made of the position in Cork as to whether or not the Department of Social Welfare could be transferred there, would the Taoiseach say whether a report has been made on that matter by those who carried out that investigation and whether that report has been published and whether any announcement can be made on the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state in respect of each of the 187 industries which Government spokesmen claim have been established since June, 1951, (a) the date of establishment; (b) the commodities produced; (c) the location; (d) the number of persons employed, and (e) the amount of State aid granted.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy so far as it is available to me, has been summarised in the form of a return.  I am arranging to lay this return on the Table of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The 187 industries included in the return were established in the period 13th June, 1951, to 19th October, 1953. Since the latter date a further 16 new undertakings have come to the notice of my Department as having commenced production.</P>
      <P>Industries which received State assistance in the form of guaranteed trade loans are shown separately. Cases in which grant moneys were made available by An Foras Tionscal up to 31st March, 1953, are also shown separately.  Information about subsequent grants by An Foras Tionscal will not be available until the board presents its report for the period to 31st March, 1954.</P>
      <P>Employment is a variable factor and it would not be possible, therefore, to give employment figures without making a special investigation.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise that the return includes only those undertakings which have come officially to the notice of my Department, but there may be others of which there is no official record to date.</P>
      <P>Following is the return:</P>

      <P>As this House provides the funds with which An Bord Fáilte operates, surely the House should have some say in the directions in which they spend the fund; and further, arising out of the Minister's statement, is he aware that practically every association connected with tourism in County Donegal has protested against the inadequacy of the publicity which the county is receiving?</P>

      <P>The manager of the Wexford employment exchange was notified on the 29th December, 1953, that an appeals officer would attend at Wexford on the 7th January, 1954, to hear appeals.  All the appellants concerned were notified by the employment exchange in writing.  There were 15 appeals in connection with unemployment benefit.  Twelve of the appellants attended the hearing and in 11 of these cases the appeals were disallowed and one case was deferred for further inquiries.  The three cases in which the appellants did not appear were also disallowed.</P>

      <P>The manager of the employment exchange at Wexford was notified over the telephone on 29th December, 1953, that an appeals officer would hear appeals at Wexford on 7th January, 1954.  On the 2nd January, 1954, in accordance with the normal practice, written notification regarding the date and time of the hearing was issued by the employment exchange to each of the 12 appellants whose appeals were on hands at the exchange on that date.  Between the 2nd January, 1954, <Col N="38" /> and the date of the hearing three fresh appeals were lodged.  The appellants in these cases were also notified in writing to attend the hearing on the 7th January and, in fact, the three attended.  Those three people were notified to attend so that their cases might be disposed of without delay.  It should be noted that if any of them had asked for a postponement of his case, because of short notice, the appeals officer would, as is always done in such circumstances, have deferred the case to a future hearing.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Australian Government decided last month not to proceed with the appointment of Mr. Dominic Paul McGuire as Australian Ambassador at Dublin.</P>
      <P>The difficulty arose from inability to find agreement upon the manner in which Mr. McGuire's Letters of Credence should be addressed.  Every effort had been made to reach agreement, but unfortunately without success. When the Australian Government sought the Irish Government's assent to Mr. McGuire's nomination in April, 1953, our Ambassador called at the Department of External Affairs in Canberra. He took occasion to point out that the Letters of Credence should be addressed to the President in his constitutional title, &ldquo;President of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Irish Government gave their assent to Mr. McGuire's nomination and subsequently the Australian Government announced his appointment.</P>
      <P>Some weeks after the announcement, however, the Australian Government raised objections to having the Letters of Credence addressed to the President of Ireland and notwithstanding many exchanges of views, no acceptable solution was found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> A suggestion to address the Letters of Credence to the &ldquo;President of the Republic of Ireland&rdquo; was made by the Australian Government but was not acceptable as the Government were advised that such letters, following the usual diplomatic practice, should be addressed to the President in his constitutional title, namely, &ldquo;Uachtarán na hÉireann,&rdquo; or, in English, &ldquo;President of Ireland.&rdquo;  The Republic of Ireland Act, 1948, which provided for a statutory description of the State did not purport to affect, nor did it indeed affect, the President's constitutional title.</P>
    <P>The credentials presented by the British Ambassador addressed to President Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh were accepted because the Government were convinced that as Britain is keeping Ireland partitioned against the wishes of the majority of the Irish people, it was essential for the peaceful solution of that issue that diplomatic relations should be maintained at the highest level.  Such relations are necessary to prevent deterioration of the existing position and to help secure the basis for the friendship which should exist between two close neighbours.  I need hardly add that the arrangement made between Ireland and Britain is no precedent for two countries which have no quarrel.</P>
    <P>In answer to the two questions not already covered, I may say that it is not proposed to make any change in our representation at Canberra, and that the average total cost of our Embassy there is around £9,000 a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether the Australian Government, which, I understand from his reply, accepted the decision that the Australian Ambassador should be accredited to the President of Ireland, gave any subsequent explanation for the substantial change in its attitude on the second occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As the reply clearly points out, they were told in advance of our Government's agreement that the letters should be addressed to the President in his constitutional title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Ambassador called at the Department of External Affairs and saw an official.

      <P>The assumption that the entry of the Army jumping team was late for the International Horse Show at Berlin is correct.</P>
      <P>On the 23rd December last the show committee was informed that it was hoped to send a team to Berlin and on the 2nd January&mdash;which was officially the last date for receiving entries&mdash;the committee forwarded entry forms which they requested should be returned as early as possible.  The entry forms were received in my Department on the 12th January and on the 15th January details of the team were wired to Berlin.  On the 18th January the committee intimated by wire that for technical reasons the entries could not be admitted.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that married members of An Fórsa Cosanta Aitiúil when reporting for training for the purpose of qualifying for children's allowances as married soldiers submitted short form birth certificates for qualified children in accordance with the recently enacted Vital Statistics (Births, Death and Marriages) Act and that such certificates were returned by the Department of Defence as inadequate and with instructions that the long or full form of birth certificate should be submitted which costs 7/-; and whether, in view of the expense and inconvenience this involves, he will make arrangements with An tArd Claraitheora to have birth certificates for the purpose of qualifying soldiers' children for children's allowances issued at the cheap rate of 1/- just as is done in connection with children's allowances under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The short certificate of birth is not adequate for the purposes of payment, under Defence Force regulations, of an allowance in respect of a child, because it does not contain the names of the parents of the child.</P>
      <P>The instructions issued to married members of An Fórsa Cosanta Aitiúil who are eligible for marriage and children's allowances directed that birth or baptismal certificates should be furnished in respect of children. The procedure laid down is similar to that for the permanent force and for the Reserve&mdash;First Line, the members of which ordinarily find no difficulty in furnishing baptismal certificates if they do not possess full certificates of birth.</P>

      <P>There may be a certain amount of truth in what the Deputy states but there is practically no difficulty now in securing a baptismal certificate and, under the Defence Force regulations, payments for the children of soldiers cannot be made unless they have proof obtained through the medium of the baptismal certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been ascertained from the local authority that to date 23 applications were submitted for the <Col N="55" /> provision of pumps and three for extensions of water supplies.  Their programme for the present financial year under these heads comprises 13 pumps and three extensions.  In the coming financial year it is hoped to provide approximately eight pumps and two water fountains.  The cost of pumps is being met from revenue and during the coming year the provision proposed for pumps is £1,000 plus any balance remaining unexpended from the year 1953-54.  It is anticipated that the county council will submit a proposal to raise loans to meet the cost of the extensions and will provide in their estimates a sum to meet the loan charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Under the Constitution, 43 of the 60 members of Seanad Éireann are elected from five panels of persons who have knowledge and practical experience of certain interests and services.  The Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1947, governs the election of these members.  Under that Act some of the persons to be placed on each panel are nominated by members of the Oireachtas and the remainder are nominated by nominating bodies registered in respect of each panel.  The purpose of this Bill is to simplify the 1947 Act in regard to the nomination of candidates by nominating bodies and to make some minor amendments which experience of the Act has shown to be desirable.</P>
      <P>The present system of election of Seanad panel members originated with the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1937, dealing with general elections and the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) (By-elections) Act, 1940. These provisions were reviewed by a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas set up in 1946 &ldquo;to consider and make recommendations on the method of regulating elections of those elected members of Seanad Éireann who are required by the Constitution to be elected from panels of candidates and the definition of the electorate for such elections.&rdquo;  The 1947 Act was the result of the report of that joint committee.</P>
      <P>In the course of its operation some minor defects were noticed in the 1947 Act and an inter-departmental committee was established to review the legislation.  The Bill as introduced in the Seanad was based on the report of that committee.  The Bill was referred in the Seanad to a select committee and on the recommendation of that committee it has been amended to secure further simplification of the system of election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major change made by the Seanad is the abolition of nomination committees.  Under the 1947 Act every nominating body registered in respect <Col N="68" /> of a panel is required to appoint five persons annually to be members of a nomination committee for that panel. At a general election where there are three or more bodies registered in respect of a panel&mdash;as is usually the case &mdash;more persons will be proposed by nominating bodies for nomination than can be put on the panel.  The nomination committee's function was, by secret ballot, to reduce the total number of nominations to the appropriate number to be put on the panel.  The present Bill as introduced in the Seanad contained provisions to obviate as far as practicable the nomination by nominating bodies of large numbers of persons who had little chance of having their names placed before the electorate and to avoid having meetings of nomination committees to effect very small reductions in the number of nominations. The Seanad went the whole way.  To quote the report of the select committee:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The committee considered that these modifications tended towards making the nominating bodies the real nominators of the candidates. In their view the system of nomination committees had not worked out satisfactorily, and accordingly they decided to take the further step and amend the Bill by providing for their abolition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This proposal means that every qualified person who is nominated by a nominating body will be put on the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>The Bill as introduced contained a formula restricting the number of persons which might be proposed for nomination by each nominating body and this provision has been retained&mdash; it is Section 7 of the Bill.  It will ensure that the ballot papers will not contain an unreasonable number of names.</P>
    <P>Under the new formula the number of persons which a nominating body may nominate will in certain circumstances be reduced to one instead of two, which is the present minimum. The abolition of the nomination committees would allow, therefore, of each nominating body having at least one <Col N="69" /> nominee on the ballot paper.  If a large number of bodies is registered in respect of a panel there will be a corresponding number of nominations. The experience of the past few years, however, suggests that this number is unlikely to become very large.  Prior to 1947 the maximum number of bodies which could be registered in respect of a panel was 15.  Since 1947 there has been no statutory limit but there has been no significant increase in the number of bodies registered in respect of the various panels.  The largest number registered at the moment is 17 in respect of the industrial and commercial panel.</P>
    <P>One of the functions of nomination committees is to fill casual vacancies among members elected from the nominating bodies' sub-panels.  The abolition of nomination committees entails the adoption of a new procedure for filling such vacancies.  The procedure is embodied in Section 11 of the Bill.  Briefly, nominations will be made by the nominating bodies themselves&mdash;each body may nominate one person&mdash;and the electorate will be the members of the Dáil and Seanad.  This is the same electorate as for a by-election to fill a vacancy on the Oireachtas sub-panel side.</P>
    <P>Another important provision in the Bill is that contained in Section 4 which obliges the Seanad returning officer to disallow an application for registration in the register of nominating bodies made by a body which appears to him to be a branch of or affiliated or subsidiary to a body which is already registered or whose application for registration he is allowing. He must also delete the registration of every body which appears to him to be a branch of or affiliated or subsidiary to a body whose application for registration he is allowing.  Under the 1947 Act the Seanad returning officer was given a discreation in the matter.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very largely a technical one and, as amended, was agreed to at all stages in the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated, this Bill was agreed to in the <Col N="70" /> other House, and agreed to unanimously. I do not think that, after it had been amended, there was any objection to its form.  It is a Bill primarily to simplify the business of election to the other House.  Therefore, I think we might, at any rate, take the Second Stage of the Bill without any long discussion on it.  It is, of course, a fact that the method of electing the Seanad is provided for by the Constitution and by the 1937 Act, as the basic Act, but in so far as it was intended to provide any system of vocational representation in the other House it has been proved to be a complete failure.  At the same time, as one who was in the other House for some time, I also want to make this clear, that it has been very obvious that the people in the other House who have taken an interest in the proceedings of that House, who have criticised and examined legislation, and who have examined carefully the proposals that have come before the other House, have always been the politicians and not the so-called members of the vocations.  It has always been only the politicians who have got down to the humdrum work of doing the really analytical work that is necessary for a Second Chamber.  But the method of electing the Seanad as a whole, through the members of the Oireachtas and the county councils, while an improvement now on the system that was in existence some years ago when seven members were chosen for each county council&mdash;while, as I say, that undoubtedly is an improvement the system is still a bad system, but that does not come under question in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this Bill is concerned, it merely deals with the removal of the nominating committees.  As the Minister has indicated, they were always a cumbersome process and really did not achieve the object which they were originally intended to achieve.  I am not so certain that I quite like the method of dealing with by-elections, but it is sometimes wiser not to throw out dirty water before you can see what clean water you can get to put in.  While I dislike the method in respect of by-elections, I can quite see <Col N="71" /> the Minister's difficulty and the difficulty which the select committee in the other House had of supplanting it with machinery which would be reasonable and easy to get together, and, at the same time, achieve the purpose desired.  So far as we are concerned, we agree to the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>That, for the purposes of any Act of the present session to make provision for a fund to be known as the National Development Fund, it is expedient to authorise the payment into such fund, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, of a sum not exceeding £5,000,000 (a) in the financial year ending on the 31st day of March, 1954, and (b) in each of the three next following financial years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is the list: for Gaeltacht projects, £250,000; to the Department of Local Government and the Road Fund, £1,000,000; the Works Act programme under the Department of Local Government, £100,000; the Special Employment Schemes Office under the Office of Public Works, £500,000; Cork harbour improvements through the Department of Industry and Commerce, £550,000; road development works in connection with the E.S.B. hand-won turf stations in the West, the project announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce last year, £200,000; and Dublin harbour improvements, £527,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is then a list in connection with <Col N="72" /> the Department of Agriculture as follows: development of hatcheries, £25,000; progeny testing, pigs and sheep, £88,000; special veterinary research, £25,000; production of foundation stocks of seed, £150,000; cattle progeny testing, £35,000; artificial insemination stations for north-west counties, £40,000; and control stations for eggs and poultry, £100,000.  In addition, there is a sum of £20,000 being made available in respect of a railway over the Limerick-Cork road towards the cement factory in Limerick. As Deputies are aware, although sanction was given for going ahead with the works for which these sums were allocated, there are some which will take perhaps two or three years and, in some cases, four years, to complete. The Dublin harbour works for instance, will last for the next three years or more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We all knew that the Minister was just flying a kite that day, and the proof of that is here.  We all knew, also, that a great deal of this Bill was pure camouflage and propaganda. I said then, and I repeat now, that there was no reason whatever why much of the work which is to be done under this Bill could not be done without any of the powers incorporated in it, and it was merely for the purpose of creating ballyhoo that the Bill was brought in in the way it was brought in.  Take the sum of £100,000 allotted to the Local Authorities (Works) Act. What has happened in respect of that <Col N="73" /> money?  It has merely been handed over, and, having been handed over, has been utilised in exactly the same way as the moneys provided in the Estimates for this work were going to be utilised.  It is a dishonest way on the part of the Government to try verbally and technically to keep within the promise of the Minister for Finance when he said there were going to be no Supplementary Estimates and to cover up their tracks it has been done in this guise.</P>
      <P>So far as the Road Fund is concerned, there has long been in existence the appropriate machinery by which moneys could be borrowed for the purposes of the Road Fund which were not there in sufficient amount allowing for the ordinary income.  Without knowing the details of the Gaeltacht project, I could not analyse that money, but we do know that there are already in the Estimates provisions for harbour development, and these provisions for harbour development could quite well have been added to these Estimates in exactly the same way.  The figures given by the Minister prove conclusively that all this Bill is designed to do is to make good the deficiencies in the Estimates already put forward by the Government and which it was necessary to repair.  With the exception of the Gaeltacht projects, which I am not at present in a position to analyse for the reason that details are not available, there is not a single thing that could not have been dealt with by way of Supplementary Estimate over and above the Volume of Estimates already circulated, except that the Minister wished, for political purposes, to make ballyhoo about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many features of the disbursements envisaged by the Minister on which I should like information.  Is it possible for the Minister to indicate from what source certain of the plans and specifications in relation to these projects came?  Are they plans and specifications that were on the stocks awaiting merely the transfusion of finance for their completion?  I want to know from the Minister whether local authorities are yet advised as to what amounts of money are going to be available to them under these new <Col N="74" /> grants.  I want to know from the Minister whether there is any departure that might have necessitated the establishment of this separate Bill. Is there any function to be performed under this Bill for which the machinery is not already in being?  Is this National Development Fund Bill to be purely a method of passing a large financial subvention to enable the infusion of finance that is necessary for certain projects under various Departments now stultified by lack of money? If this is so, can the Minister indicate to the House what was the urgency or what, in fact, was the necessity for the departure into this type of legislation?  Can the Minister give the House any information as to whether many of the projects on hands by various local authorities of immense consequence to the immediate neighbourhood can hope to have any subvention in aid from this fund to enable them to go on with those projects, particularly in districts such as the area I have the honour to represent, where the spectre of unemployment is becoming serious again and the potential of employment termination is very real?  Can people like the Clonakilty Urban District Council who have submitted plans in connection with water schemes and the provision of a new town hall-can projects submitted by Skibbereen Urban Council and the Bantry town commissioners over a period of years&mdash;hope that from this money now voted will flow some subvention in aid to enable them to get on with the necessary works, or is this Bill designed purely, as suggested by my colleague Deputy Sweetman, to overcome the difficulty of the introduction of Supplementary Estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to leave out at this stage political comment on the Bill.  I feel that I would like information from the Minister as to what work is going to be done, and in particular, I want to know what benefits are going to flow and what good is going to inure to my constituency by virtue of this grandiose styled new legislation called national development.  Is national development within the concept of his Bill one limited to the political fruitfulness of the area in which the money is going to be disbursed, or is it one designed to <Col N="75" /> give an honest impetus to various areas that are, in fact, trying to advance, whether it be under the aegis of an urban council or a local council?  We see already out of the £5,000,000 that this Bill proposes using this year £3.6 million provided for.  In it I defy the Minister to nominate any project enunciated by him for which the machinery of continuity of effort does not already exist.  The various sub-sections of the Department of Agriculture are able to deal with all the projects that have been grouped under money granted to the Department of Agriculture whether it be for fishing ponds, examination of fish fertility or the quality of progeny of certain spawn.  The machinery already exists within the Department for that particular type of activity. All that was necessary was money.</P>
    <P>I say, as I said on the Second Reading of this Bill, that there was no necessity, so far as any of the money already voted was concerned, for this large window-dressing and flag-waving of a Bill styled National Development Fund Bill, when, in fact, all the various projects enunciated by the Minister, whether it be Dublin harbour develop-or Cork harbour development, all of which we are more than delighted to welcome in so far as they hold forth a reasonable prospect of this work being gone ahead with and a reasonable employment content for the people in those areas&mdash;these projects are welcome; but will the Minister say why it was necessary to bring in this type of legislation to enable him to grant that money?</P>
    <P>Was it not possible for the Government, whether by way of advance from Contingency Fund or by way of Supplementary Estimate to the main Estimate, to make these moneys available for the work that they now propose to do?  I do not want anybody to feel that I am in any way opposed to spending money at home here on worthwhile projects that are going to inure to the benefit of the Irish people, but I feel that we should do it in a practical way, and if the machinery was already available, as I contend it was, for every project in that £3.6 million already enunciated, why should we create the <Col N="76" /> atmosphere of a National Development Bill that is not doing anything new? I had hoped that the National Development Bill did conceive some co-ordinated plan whereby projects for national development that have for some reason or another been held up or not favourably considered could have been financed not on the basis of an impetus to departmental work already in existence but on the basis of a side by side drive that was going to enable the increase in employment that we had hoped this Bill would immediately effect.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister, not in any acrimonious way, what hope, if any, projects that are shelved but which are known to Departments to be of value and of need to areas now have of reaching realisation?  Can I go back, can my colleague Deputy O'Sullivan go back, or my colleague Deputy Murphy go back, to the people of West Cork and say: &ldquo;You have prospects now of getting the recurring flooding of the Island River in the town of Skibbereen dealt with, prospects of getting the question of a new town hall, so long needed, in Clonakilty dealt with, you have prospects of getting various projects in relation to the provision of better hygienic and sanitation conditions for some of your older type of building schemes&mdash;you have hope of getting a Grant-in-Aid for these or a total grant to enable you to do it?&rdquo; Or are we to go back with the story of the deception that the Bill, in fact, carries a title but only provides a way in which money can be poured in to supplement the amount of money that various Departments now find necessary to get in addition to what they got in the Estimates?  I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some reasonable hope that these projects can look forward to substantial grants to enable them to be put into operation.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the problem to-day of a rapid expansion of local works, whether it be works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act coming directly under the county council or whether it be works carried out under an urban authority, there is an immediate and urgent necessity to decelerate the movement out of rural Ireland <Col N="77" /> and slow down the impetus of mass emigration.  That is particularly true of West Cork where there is grave necessity at the present time for the creation of good, solid employment within the area.  Local authorities have schemes of practical national value and importance.  It is possible for the Minister under Section 4 of this Bill to exercise discretion.  I want to know in what direction the Minister's mind is running.  Is there any hope that he will exercise his discreation in the direction of making available in the rural areas, such as that which I represent, along the west coast of Ireland and in the various Gaeltacht districts, money to enable the local authorities in these areas to give employment that has some degree of continuity and reasonable prospects of enduring for a period?  If that is not the case, then the clarion of trumpets that played in the National Development Bill will become very muted indeed in the realisation that this Bill might be better described as a new method of introducing Supplementary Estimates <i>en masse.</i></P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to try to hoodwink the House and the public into believing that this Bill has any greater scope or any wider purpose than that shown by the £3.6 million allocated.  I do not want a Bill such as this to go on the Statute Book unless the Minister can tell us here and now that it is his desire, as acting-Minister for Finance, to ensure that this money is disbursed throughout rural Ireland to enable projects of national development, shelved or turned down for lack of money, to be put into operation in order to create local employment markets thereby alleviating the unrest and unease which result in emigration from the rural areas to the cities or across the water.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The glorified title given to this Bill by whoever is responsible for baptising it has, I suggest seriously to the Minister, caused considerable misapprehension and misunderstanding amongst members of local authorities. I welcome the financial provisions in the Bill in so far as it is intended to spend money on the carrying out of worthwhile schemes within a reasonable <Col N="78" /> period.  I am surprised to learn from the Minister that portion of the money provided will be set aside to carry out schemes, presumably already sanctioned by the Department of Local Government&mdash;perhaps a long time ago &mdash;under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I cannot understand why a direct Vote of £100,000, or more, should not have been taken before now instead of waiting for the introduction and passage of this measure.</P>
      <P>Members of local authorities were engaged last week, and they will likewise be engaged this week, in considering the estimates in relation to the various local authorities throughout the country.  They should have been made aware long before now as to the amount of money that will be available to local authorities for the carrying out of essential schemes.  At the private preliminary meetings that have been held by county councils&mdash;and this is true of my area&mdash;there was considerable confusion and misunderstanding and some misapprehension in relation to the moneys that may be made available to local authorities under this Bill.  As a result of that misunderstanding, to put it mildly, in one case a councillor got up and moved a reduction of £14,000 on a particular section of an estimate in the hope that the money that was going to be provided through the medium of an increased rate will now come from or through this National Development Fund. Nobody knows for certain what final amount will be given for the remainder of this financial year or for the duration of the next financial year.  In fairness to the members of local authorities, to the county managers and the county engineers and to all those responsible for administering these schemes a circular should have been sent out to the local authorities in relation to this matter long before now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases meetings of local authorities, called for consideration of the estimates, have been twice deferred. That has certainly happened in one particular county where the local authority representatives are awaiting information that should have been given to them long before now.  If it is true and the Minister knows what the <Col N="79" /> facts are in relation to his own particular constituency, that essential road repair and maintenance work is urgently necessary and if the local authorities will not provide the necessary funds out of the rates, surely these are the things that should be considered by the Minister in allocating moneys from this National Development Fund.  If that kind of situation is to be considered, a decision should be given within a reasonable time before the end of this financial year.  If moneys will not be provided out of this fund for this urgent road repair and maintenance work, then the county managers and members of local authorities should be so informed to enable them to understand the position before the estimates for the coming financial year are finally sanctioned.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that when decisions are being taken in relation to the allocation of grants from the National Development Fund, the conditions, if any, attaching to the allocation of such grants should be made known to the authorities concerned, including harbour authorities. I quite realise that it is impossible for a harbour authority like the Dublin Port and Docks Board to carry out in its entirety the scheme for which over £500,000 is now being provided.  I am not interfering with any other area except my own, but there are hundreds of worthwhile schemes waiting to be carried out by the local authorities in my area.  There are hundreds of men, particularly in towns and villages, waiting to get employment on that work and the sooner the Minister or the Departments concerned, particularly the Local Government Department, convey to the members of the local authorities or to the county managers and other local officials the amounts that can be allocated and the conditions attached to the allocation of them the sooner these works which are waiting to be done can be commenced and completed.</P>

We can deal with the matter on the Bill itself, but I should like to ask the Minister in what particular form he proposes to announce in a periodic way the proposals which have been sanctioned and the amount of money involved.  I should like to ask him, too, whether this fund will actually be a real fund with money set aside, or whether it will be a notional fund which he will fill from time to time for the paying out of money in respect of calls made on the fund.</P>

      <P>As my colleague Deputy Davin has said, the local authorities are about striking the rate now.  We had a meeting on Monday and we will have two more meetings. We asked our acting-manager if he had any idea of the amount of money which we would get from the National Development Fund and he said no, that he was only guessing.  The result was that we made no progress at our estimates meeting on Monday.  We are waiting and hoping that the Minister or the Department will give some idea to the local councils and to the county managers as to what this money may be used for.  We were told by our managers that it cannot be used for the roads, that it can only be used for sewerage and water schemes.  We are told that this money is around the corner, but the people who are signing on at the employment exchanges are waiting for that money to be provided so that they can get work.  We sent up different schemes on several occasions to the Department for sanction without result.  The last schemes we sent up were thrown aside and the engineers had to go out again and get a new set of schemes to go before the Department but there is no sanction for them yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The striking of the rate will depend on what money we are going to get. We were told that we were going to get money in abundance for schemes <Col N="81" /> of work to give employment which is so badly needed.  According to a question answered to-day, there are 700 unemployed in Wexford town, 300 in Enniscorthy and so many hundreds in Gorey, but these figures do not include the rural places where the unemployed sign on at the police barracks.  This matter is a great torment to us as members of local authorities.  People are clamouring every day of the week to get a job on the roads or to get something going to give them a job.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to make it clear in his reply when the money will be forthcoming and when we will receive it for some schemes which we have submitted to the Department.  The sooner that is done the better so as to clarify the whole matter.  The striking of the rate will be a very difficult matter this time owing to the extra expenditure under the Health Act and increases in the estimates already provided. We ought to know how we are to balance our budget and the amount of money we are to get.  The sooner the Minister gives that information to the various local authorities the better it will be for everybody connected with a local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies who have spoken have taken two different points of view as to how this fund should be used.  Some of them obviously wanted it to be used as a rate relieving fund; that we should immediately tell all the local authorities that the rates are going to be reduced and that they can draw on the fund to provide the money for the works which the local authorities themselves should go ahead with in a county or in a town or city.  There was no such intention when this National Development Fund was introduced. There was no intention that it should be used at a rate relieving fund or a fund in relief of rates like the money that we vote for the relief of agricultural rates.  It was intended to be used to encourage the local authorities to spend more rapidly on development work where there was acute unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We pointed out that the necessity for dealing rapidly with a situation might arise with very little notice where normal development work of <Col N="82" /> some sort had ceased, such as the coming to an end of a house-building programme or drainage or water schemes or something of that sort.  The fund was intended to help local authorities to meet such a situation and to get ahead with other work of a national development kind as quickly as possible.  From that point of view, this fund has been a success.  Notwithstanding the fact that it has only been a couple of months in operation, unemployment on the whole has been reduced on an average by about 10 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are there and, as against last year, the reduction in unemployment is about 10 per cent. I am not saying that it is all due to the National Development Fund but, with the general recovery in certain sections of our economy and the help of the National Development Fund, the trend of employment to worsen and to decrease has been reversed and instead employment is on the increase and we hope to keep it on the increase. While Deputy Davin and some other Deputies said that we are late in telling local authorities exactly how the additional grant will be provided and in what amount it will be provided, on the other hand, Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Collins objected to this procedure saying that we should have instead introduced Supplementary Estimates for all these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies are perfectly well aware that, if that had been the procedure, instead of being able to give what information we have been able to give to local authorities, they would be waiting for another six months at least. We know how long it takes the Department of Local Government to get an Estimate through the House&mdash;two or three weeks.  We know how long it takes the Department of Agriculture&mdash; sometimes several months.  But we have been able by this means to put funds of <Col N="83" /> £1,000,000 at the disposal of local authorities directly through the Road Fund and through the Local Authorities (Works) Act programme another £100,000; also, through the right to draw on the Special Employment Schemes Office to a further extent for the development of such things as waterworks, sewerage and all the projects upon which local authorities usually spend grants of that nature. In addition, we have seen here in the City of Dublin works that would never have been done in the normal way being proceeded with through grants from Local Government out of this Special Employment Scheme Fund and they have had the result of bringing relief quickly to a large number of men now employed on these schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for the relief of rates for roads either.  The Minister for Local Government took steps to increase the Road Fund.  He took steps last year to increase it very <Col N="84" /> greatly by increasing the vehicles duty and, in addition, he got an extra £1,000,000 out of the National Development Fund in order to go ahead with the repair and building of new roads.  That, immediately, will not have any effect in reducing rates but perhaps ultimately it will make it easier for local authorities to keep roads in repair without increasing the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>This was to save an increase in the rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman talked about the fund being a camouflage and said there was nothing in it for ground limestone, for an increase in the use of ground limestone.  Deputy Sweetman reads the papers as well as anybody else and knows perfectly well that since I was speaking on the Second Reading of the Bill the Government made an arrangement with the banks that the banks would give advances to all creditworthy merchants and lime merchants to extend their business.  He knows also that the Government announced a fund from which the farmers who had not money of their own to invest in lime and fertilisers and who could not get credit in sufficient quantity from local merchants could have resort to the funds of the Department of Agriculture.  That was in addition to what has been given for the development of agriculture already under the schemes that I listed here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not intended that this fund should be in substitution of all other funds that the State and local authorities make available for special development. The State is collecting quite a large amount of money in taxation and raising quite a lot of money by way of loan.  The local authorities are doing the same thing.  This year in addition to all the sums that were being collected and raised by means of taxes, rates and loans, the Government have made this extra sum available as an extra boost to development and useful employment.  Even the list that I outlined here would have provided many months of work for the Dáil if we had to wait for the Dáil before giving the Ministers concerned approval to go <Col N="85" /> ahead.  It has shortened the usual Dáil procedure.  I was quite ready to admit when bringing it in that it was unusual procedure to ask the Dáil to give this open credit of £5,000,000 without having the detailed proposals before the members, and I justified it on the grounds that we felt that there were a lot of useful projects available that would add to national production, and that where there was grave unemployment we should take active measures and unusual measures to put the unemployed to work in order to create means of further production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <P>All the Coalition did about unemployment was to set up a commission to inquire into its causes as if they did not know already.  We are trying to do something about the problem.  We are not only trying to take people off the unemployment list registered at the exchanges, but we are also trying to provide opportunities to the greatest extent that our resources will permit and offering alternatives to emigration to the young people growing up.  Some of the projects I have already announced will have some <Col N="86" /> effect in achieving the results we desire.</P>
      <P>Over and above this £5,000,000 and over and above what the Government and the local authorities are spending, there is the possibility of private individuals in this country using their own capital or using the capital they can raise in order to promote productive enterprises.</P>
      <P>I was dragged in on the Second Reading of this Bill to point out that the farmers have a very big fund at their own disposal&mdash;of £70,000,000&mdash;on which they are getting only 1 per cent. or 1½ per cent. interest.  I pointed out that in their own interests, the interests of their children and the community as a whole they should put some of that money to work in liming their lands if liming is necessary, adding fertilisers if fertilisers are necessary, buying machinery and generally improving the productive capacity of the soil.</P>
      <P>I pointed out that it was the cheapest loan they could get.  The cheapest credit was their own money on which they are getting 1½ per cent., and if they invested it in the proper way in their own soil they might get some hundreds per cent. benefit from it.  I gave an instance where the expenditure of £2, all other factors being equal, made a difference of £100 in increasing production in one farm over six crop years.  It is foolish for the farmers to keep that money in the bank.  It is foolish for them to raise money, if they have got money in the bank, in order to apply to the soil the constituents it wants for maximum production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties is this.  Why I went into the matter so much the last time was that unfortunately the Deputy put in a Minister and kept him for three years who did not believe in it himself and who said so.  He tried to convince the members of this House to the contrary when I was reading the facts, disclosed not for the first time by the Department of Agriculture, that an application of a <Col N="87" /> couple of pounds worth of lime could have such results.</P>
      <P>I hope the farmers will not only believe the truth of this matter but will act on the basis of the truth.  It is in their interests that they should do so.  It is foolish that they should be led off by Deputy Dillon or anybody else into leaving their money in the banks at 1½ per cent. when it could be invested in soil improvements in a manner which would give them several hundred per cent. in certain cases.</P>

      <P>The fund will be an actual fund.  It will be a separate and distinct fund into which this year, at any rate, moneys raised by means of loan will be put.  If there was a year in which we had a surplus of £5,000,000, we could pay in moneys raised by taxation. This year the fund is being fed by borrowed moneys.  If the fund had money lying in it that was not being used or called upon it would be reinvested in any of the ways in which surplus funds of Government are used. In this particular case, seeing that the money might be wanted quickly, I think the most appropriate and liquid form would be that of ways and means advances to the Exchequer.</P>

The Government borrowing rate at present is 4¾ per cent. &mdash;that was the rate of the last loan, leaving out the question of discount on issue price.  Do I understand, then, that the Minister's proposal of working this fund is to raise £5,000,000 at 4¾ per cent. although he can only hope to use probably £2,000,000 at the outside, that, therefore, £3,000,000 will be unused and that £3,000,000 will be lent back again to the Government at the ways and means advances rate which is certainly not 4¾ per cent.

      <P>Surely it is.  If the Minister asks for power to establish a fund it will be a fund to be established out of borrowed money, and when he puts proposals in statutory form before us asking for power that if all these moneys are not being used they may be loaned to the Government as ways and means advances, surely we are entitled to ask what is the difference between the rate at which the Minister is borrowing this money at the present time and the rate he is paying for ways and means advances.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister as a practical business-minded man that it is no use putting £5,000,000 in round figures into the fund during the next five or six weeks if only £1,500,000 or £2,000,000 is going to be spent in the current financial year.  I think that situation will arise not alone this year but next year unless the people who are going to be charged with the responsibility of spending the money on approved schemes are told by the Local Government Department or by the Minister now through this House what are the kind of schemes that are likely to secure sanction and an allocation of the necessary money.  Is it fair to the members of the county councils, to the county managers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not want £5,000,000 pushed into the fund carrying an exorbitant rate of interest with only half the money being spent.  The failure to spend that money will be the failure of the Minister or some other Minister, or the Local Government Department in particular, to tell the members of local authorities or county managers what kind of schemes they should submit and what kind of schemes are likely to secure the <Col N="92" /> approval of the Minister for Finance and the allocation of the necessary funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 4, the Minister has given some figures to-day in a general way as to the amount of money that he has sanctioned for certain types of projects.  I would like to ask him if these are for specific projects that he has approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked him whether he would say the particular Departments through which these projects were going&mdash;as Departments that were involved, particularly, in general national development&mdash;and how much of the £3,600,000 was approved for these Departments and, if the Minister had the figures, the total amount of the proposals put up to him from each of these Departments. I take it that the proposals that are coming up to the Minister have previously been vetted and fairly well sifted by these Departments.  I do not know to what extent the Minister for Finance takes on himself the responsibility for re-vetting these proposals. Generally, I suggest to the Minister that he ought to accept an amendment here that a return will be furnished to Dáil Eireann every month setting out the particular projects that have been approved and the amount involved. With a fund operated in this particular <Col N="94" /> kind of way, and in the spirit in which the Minister says it will be operated, it is desirable, in relation to the projects approved under this particular fund, that the Oireachtas should have information, in a systematic way, of what is being done under the fund. The provision of a monthly statement in the Library would obviate the necessity for inquiries by way of parliamentary question as to what was happening under this Bill.  It would also provide information in a systematic and understandable way, as to what was being done under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any necessity to put in an amendment to this Bill in order to secure that the Government would provide all the information that Deputies might want about the matter.  To-day, when I was asked a question by Deputy Sweetman, I immediately gave the list we had approved of.  We can find ways&mdash; whether by means of parliamentary questions or by tabling it in the Library every time a project is approved&mdash;of letting the Dáil know about the matter.  I do not want to be committed on this: I will have to examine the matter.  However, some way or another, members of the Dáil will be let know within a reasonable time after a project has been approved. In my view, it would be better to keep it until there is a reasonable list so that we shall not have a long debate on each project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure for getting a project approved&mdash;a project which would be paid for out of this fund&mdash;is simple enough.  A number of Departments have things that they want to do which would improve national production; they have a long list that they could never get around to proposing or getting accepted.  Each Book of Estimates has the same likeness to its predecessor these past 20 or 30 years.  The lists of projects on which funds are being spent increase in length.  A number of the things which I read out to-day were projects that, say, the Department of Agriculture would like to have spent money on a long time ago but, with the other more urgent matters, they did not get around to.  It is the same <Col N="95" /> with the Department of Local Government. I understand that the Minister for Local Government has asked local authorities to send him a list of projects with which they would like to get ahead with&mdash;projects that were more or less put on the long finger.  Certain of those are going ahead and more will be started even if not completed, in this financial year.  Once there has been a promise that it will be met out of the fund, they will get the money whether it falls due to be paid before the 31st March or after it.</P>
    <P>When the Departments put up propositions there are two ways of going about it.  There is a direct approach to the Government, if it is a very great project, or it can go to the National Development Committee which sits as often as may be and vets the propositions put up by the various Departments.  It vets them and, to the extent to which it approves of a project, it makes a recommendation to the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance can then approve of it or he can turn it down or he can refer it back for further study.  If a project is disapproved of, that does not stop the Minister concerned&mdash;if he is particularly anxious to get the matter pushed through&mdash;from taking the matter further at a Government meeting, if he so desires.</P>

Under the Special Employment Schemes Vote he can do some portion of the £500,000 because the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance has schemes of his own to be paid out of that.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> That it is expedient that a Joint Committee consisting of 15 members of the Dáil and 6 members of the Seanad be appointed with power to send for persons, papers and records, to inquire into the present system of workmen's compensation for injuries due to employment and to consider and report as to what changes are necessary or desirable and, in particular, whether a nationalised scheme of social insurance should be substituted for the existing system, or, if no such change is recommended, whether insurance by employers should be made compulsory.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that during the passage of the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Bill last year it was suggested that a Parliamentary Committee might be set up to go into the whole question of workmen's compensation. The present system has long been criticised on various grounds and I am of opinion that a committee of investigation would be very desirable. I put down this motion asking the Dáil to approve of a committee composed of members of both Houses and I recommend the motion to the House. I do not think any fault will be found with the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy will admit that there is necessity for an inquiry.  A comprehensive scheme of workmen's compensation has been demanded indeed by many people both in this House and outside it for a long time past and I personally feel that the best way to get a report on a comprehensive scheme is to get a committee composed of all Parties of the two Houses.  If we get agreement between the Parties I feel that it will be a good scheme, that it will be a scheme that will go through without any political division and, therefore, will have the goodwill and the good wishes of everybody in the country.</P>
    <P>An amendment has been put in by Deputy Sweetman.  Deputy Sweetman is of opinion that this would be better done by a commission on which the various interested parties would be represented.  Personally, I prefer the Oireachtas Committee because I think members of the Dáil and Seanad, <Col N="99" /> asking them all round, probably have  much sounder idea of what is required than any other group you night get and there would be great advantage indeed in having an agreed scheme by having an Oireachtas Committee appointed.</P>
    <P>I know there is an argument that house who are interested should be represented.  There are employers represented, say, by chambers of commerce and manufacturers' organisations and various employers' organisations and there are the workers represented by the trade unions.  You might also have those interested in a financial way&mdash;insurance companies, bankers, auditors and so on.  I feel that all these interested parties could be called before a Committee of the Oireachtas and could give their views. The committee could weigh up those views and make up their minds as to whether there was substance in the arguments put forward or not and then they could submit a report.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much room for argument or explanation on this proposal.  We probably have our minds made up fairly well that some investigation is necessary&mdash;I think we are all agreed on that&mdash;and a decision on the net point, whether it should be an Oireachtas Committee or an outside commission, should be a simple matter. There is one point I should say in favour of an Oireachtas Committee, that is, that we are likely to get a quicker decision.  A commission composed of outside people sometimes goes very slowly.  Some of the commissions appointed in the past have acted with great expedition but others have gone very slowly.  From all points of view, therefore, I would recommend the motion for the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;that a commission of inquiry, representative of suitable interests, be appointed with power to send for persons, papers and records, to <Col N="100" /> inquire into the present system of workmen's compensation for inquries due to employment, and to consider and report thereon, and as to what changes are necessary or desirable, and in particular whether a nationalised scheme of social insurance should be substituted for the existing system, and as to how insurance by employers could be made compulsory, and whether either of these alternatives (nationalisation or compulsion) would be recommended&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the first place I want to underline what the Minister has said in regard to his motion.  It is the same as that in my amendment.  We are both in entire agreement on the necessity for an inquiry and on the terms of reference. The Minister will agree that the terms in my amendment follow his wording exactly, as I wanted it to be clearly understood that there was no difference between us on that point.  This is not the time to discuss whether it is desirable to have nationalised insurance or to have insurance made compulsory. The whole idea of this motion is to have an inquiry to get the facts upon which the House ultimately can make up its mind.  I suggest that a body of 21 members of the Oireachtas &mdash;15 from this House and six from the other House&mdash;is far too unwieldy, if each member individually is to take part in the inquiry, and under those circumstances I feel we will not get any results within any reasonable period of time.  As far as I can appreciate the position, what the House wants is the relevant facts and data so as to be able to make up its mind.</P>
    <P>If the Minister adverts to the method of having a committee for the sole purpose of having a non-political scheme. then it would be far better to get all the facts presented by a White Paper or otherwise and then have a Select Committee of the two Houses to consider them.  I feel personally that the worst possible way of getting the information in a reasonable time is by having 21 members of the Oireachtas sitting down to this task.  We all agree that it is a very technical job. Presumably there will be certain evidence first from the Department and <Col N="101" /> then from various interested bodies&mdash; chambers of commerce and the Federated Union of Employers on the one side and the Congress of Irish Unions and the Trade Union Congress on the other side.  I hope that some bodies representative of the people who would be in the position of consumers, so to speak, will be called before this committee to give evidence.  Inevitably that committee will take much longer to assimilate that evidence, highly technical as it will be, than a much smaller committee.  The type I had in mind was a commission of not more than five or seven people&mdash;say, one representative of the Federated Union of Employers, one of the chambers of commerce, one from each of the two trade union congresses and three others selected as representative of the ordinary man in the street.  I know there is difficulty in getting representatives of that class, but they can be got.  I seriously suggest that a body of seven like that would produce the facts more quickly than a body of 21 if the 21 are going to do their job.  Of course, if the 21 are not going to do their task, there is no point in setting them up and we might just as well ask the Department to produce a White Paper on its own.</P>
    <P>This is to a large extent a fact-finding or data-finding inquiry.  The Minister will agree when I say that large committees are very unsatisfactory in that type of investigation.  It is very different if you have a cut-and-dried scheme already there and you are asking a committee to consider it to see what amendments could be brought in or the implications of the scheme.  In the present case it is a wide, roaming investigation.  A committee of 21 will do one of two things &mdash;it will take infinitely longer to get an efficient inquiry or there will be few of the 21 people concerned carrying out the investigation.  I want to stress again that the inquiry is necessary, and now it is purely a question of the way in which it will be carried out.  I agree with the Minister that, if he is going to have an Oireachtas Committee it is not feasible, in the Oireachtas position, to have a smaller one.  This is not in any way a political issue.  On the contrary, it is far less likely to be a <Col N="102" /> political issue if you have a body set up outside as a departmental commission to gather the information which would be put before the House or issued as a White Paper by the Minister. At this stage I cannot see how 21 people can enter on a roaming investigation without taking an endless amount of time to produce the information that all of us want.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Minister's point of view that an Oireachtas Committee would be more effective.  If we leave it to a commission I do not think we will get the quick results that Deputy Sweetman envisages.  As far as the members of the House are involved, I believe that it would need only nine or ten members from the big Parties and probably only two would turn up to the committee as they would have certain information and certain instructions. The same would apply from our end.  I agree with the Minister that a committee of the House would be more effective.  The sooner we can get a committee working the better, as there are many things which need to be done in regard to the Workmen's Compensation Act.  Even the last amendment operated against many workers who were injured.  The sooner we get this committee going the better, as I do not think it would be a controversial matter at all.</P>

      <P>On the particular issue raised in this motion and amendment, I would like to express the view that as far as possible investigations of this kind should depend on a committee of the House rather than on a professional commission.  We have had a number of professional commissions from time to time&mdash;those dealing with education and unemployment, for example.  While they may be suitable for that particular purpose, I think that a Parliamentary Committee would work more expeditiously. There are people who have a specialised knowledge of these matters.  A Committee of the Dáil can summon these people before it and ask them questions.  In the past, we have had a number of matters referred for examination to commissions of experts.  I <Col N="103" /> think it would have been far better if we had had a Committee of the Dáil and Seanad investigating these matters for themselves, with an opportunity to question and cross-examine the experts, rather than having such matters investigated by the experts themselves.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any substance whatever in Deputy Sweetman's suggestion that the greater the number you have on a Parliamentary Committee the more will that tend to prolong its discussions.  I think you could have much more prolonged discussions with a small number of persons, particularly if those making the investigation were experts on the subject under examination. Some of them might have a vested interest in preventing legislation coming along quickly.  I think that a representative committee of both Houses would feel that there was an imperative duty on it to report and get a decision as quickly as possible. The members would feel that they owed that duty to their constituents and to the country, that is, to present their report as soon as possible so that desirable reformative legislation could be put through.</P>
      <P>I was rather struck by one reference which Deputy Sweetman made.  It seemed to me somewhat amusing.  He referred to what he called consumers, in addition to the trade unions and representatives of employers.  He said that there was another type of people called consumers.  It would be interesting to know what type of people he had in mind, whether members of the legal profession or of the medical profession.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Sweetman, in the suggestion that he made, wants more or less to have the best of both worlds.  I am of the opinion that his amendment, if accepted, would tend to prolong the whole proceedings.  I understood his suggestion to mean that there should, first of all, be a commission to examine the facts and tabulate them, and that then a Committee of the Dáil should consider the whole matter.  It might put the whole thing aside and say that the report it had received did not suit <Col N="104" /> at all.  That would mean starting the whole proceedings over again.  I agree that the position would be different if we had to start on something on which we really had no basis for examination. But that is not the situation.  We have the position as it exists and, therefore, its advantages and effects can be examined by a Committee of the Dáil with a view to examining its defects, if there are any, and of suggesting a remedy for them.  I think myself that a committee is going to give the best results.  It will be representative of different interests and different views, and all the available information will be at its disposal.  I expect that, in addition, there will be memoranda from the trade unions, the Federation of Employers, insurance companies and other interested parties.  All that information can be supplemented by the personal attendance of witnesses before the committee and so there can be a very full inquiry.  That, I suggest, is a much better approach to an examination of this question than to have a commission.  In my opinion, it is far better that a Committee of the Dáil should get to work at once on this question rather than that a commission should be set up.  The findings of the commission might not be agreeable to the Dáil, and in consequence it might be necessary, subsequently, to set up a Dáil Committee to start all over again on the investigation.  A Dáil Committee can go ahead with the work at once and finish it as quickly as possible.  That, I submit, is the better approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  Last August, I announced that the Government, with a view to encouraging and expediting projects of a building or constructional character, intended introducing legislation to provide for a two-thirds remission of rates for a period of seven years on the valuation of certain types of new and enlarged buildings.  I said that the concession would apply to buildings where the work of erection or enlargement was begun and completed within the period of three years from 27th July last.  Part II of the Bill implements that promise.  It will extend rate remission which, since 1940, has been more or less confined to dwellings and farm buildings, to such buildings as hotels, offices, factories and shops where the work of building, erecting or enlarging them is begun and completed within the prescribed period of three years.</P>
      <P>The remission in the case of new buildings, will be on two-thirds of the valuation and will last for seven years. This means that in the case of a new building which is valued at £90, the rates will be assessed on £30 for seven years.</P>
      <P>In the case of an existing building, the remission will be on two-thirds of the total increase in valuation following revision.  Thus, a building, the valuation of which is increased from £60 to £90, will be rated at £70 for seven years.  Where a building is enlarged during the prescribed period and in the revised valuation following that enlargement earlier improvements or additions are taken into account the remission will also apply to those earlier improvements and additions.  In the case I have quoted of a valuation increased from £60 to £90, if only £10 of the increase is due to enlargements carried out during the prescribed period and £20 is due to earlier improvements or additions, or simply to an increase due to the fact that the existing valuation was out of date, the remission will be on two-thirds of the total increase in valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> There are certain exceptions to the rate remission provisions.  These are set out in Section 3 of the Bill.  The remission will not apply to cottages or houses erected or provided under the Labourers Acts or the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  Where, however, such dwellings have been sold by a local authority, the occupier will be entitled to the remission if he enlarges or improves the dwelling within the prescribed period without assistance under the Housing Acts or the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts.  The Housing Acts and the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts have their own provisions for rate remission and consequently building work carried out under these Acts, including houses erected or reconstructed by private persons and public utility societies, will not be entitled to remission under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Where the houses concerned are extended or improved within the prescribed period, without the benefit of a further grant or rate remission under these Acts, the occupier will be entitled to remission under this Bill.  Other exceptions are new or improved farm buildings which get the benefit of the seven years' deferment of valuation under the 1852 Valuation Act, and buildings which get remission of rates under the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952.  Finally, the rate remission will not apply where work of a trivial nature of alteration, extension, repair or renewal is carried out on an existing building.  The Commissioner of Valuation will be empowered to decide whether the work is of a trivial nature and there is provision for appeal by aggrieved persons against such determinations.</P>
    <P>Part III and the Schedule to the Bill relate to Buncrana Urban District. In the year 1950, the urban council requested a revision of all rateable hereditaments in the urban district.  As a result of the revision carried out, the total valuation of the urban district at 1st March, 1951, was £11,445 as compared with £7,563 on 1st March, 1950. The provisions in Part III and the Schedule are designed to bring the valuation of the urban district for county demand purposes back to what it is estimated it would have been if <Col N="107" /> no general revision had occurred and only normal increases had taken place. In the year 1963-64 the county demand will be based on £11,520; from then on, the ordinary basis of calculation of the county demand will apply.</P>
    <P>Part IV provides a link up between the provisions of the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Acts, 1940 to 1952, and Part II of this Bill. Under those Acts, two-thirds remission of rates for five years was provided in respect of certain dwelling houses&mdash; mainly houses provided without State assistance.  The Acts expired on 31st March, 1953, and the remission provided thereunder does not, therefore, apply to work completed after that date.  Part IV of the Bill will provide for the extension of the Acts to 31st March, 1954, so as to cover cases where work was commenced on dwelling houses before 27th July, 1953.  Where work is commenced on or after 27th July, 1953, and completed within the prescribed period, the rates remission granted under Part II of the Bill will apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, in order to be considered by the House, must be related to the circumstances which made it necessary.  As Deputies realise, for some years there has been a very definite public grievance with regard to the archaic nature of our valuation laws, and with regard to the administration of these laws.  It has been for some time back common opinion in the country that increases in valuation have been a very definite tax on initiative.  This complaint has applied particularly to persons engaged in business anxious to develop their buildings, to extend their businesses and incidentally to provide employment. For that reason, the Fine Gael Party some time ago decided to initiate a legislative proposal designed to bring a measure of relief in relation to unfair increases in valuation and the Valuation Bill of 1953 was introduced in this House on 10th June, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unnecessary to go in detail into what was proposed to be done by that Bill, except to say that that Bill, had it been accepted by the House, would <Col N="108" /> have ensured that no person owning a business premises, no farmer improving his farm buildings and no labourer improving his cottage would find his improvements taxed as a result of a visit from the valuation office.  That Fine Gael Bill provided that the valuation of no building could be increased unless improvements were carried out to it and that any such increase in valuation, following improvements, would not take effect for a period of seven years, so that the owner of any building contemplating the expenditure of money on improving it would know that, for a period of seven years, he would not be taxed and would have that period to meet the expenditure involved of a capital kind in improving his buildings.</P>
    <P>That Bill introduced by this Party in June of last year was met in the month of August by a few panicky announcements from the Custom House&mdash;assurances, directed to the people of South Galway, that the Government would do something about valuations.  I am sorry if I am being unfairly kind to the Minister&mdash;they were not about valuations but about remissions of rates.  The Minister has referred to that announcement made last August which he says foretold the introduction of this Bill.  Deputies realise that the Fine Gael Valuation Bill was discussed and debated in this House in the autumn session and was defeated by the votes of two Deputies in Dáil Éireann, and accordingly, upon the defeat of the Fine Gael proposal, the Minister comes to the House now with this document entitled the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Bill, 1953.  I think it is fair to describe the Minister's Bill as a half-baked proposal introduced in a half-baked manner and carrying out a half-baked kind of policy.  It is called a Temporary Reduction of Valuation Bill.  In the ministerial announcement last August there was no reference to a reduction in valuation.  People were told that they would get a certain remission of rates but in the title of this Bill the words &ldquo;Reduction of Valuation&rdquo; appear, because, of course, the Fine Gael Party introduced and had defeated by the Fianna Fáil Party a Valuation Bill a few <Col N="109" /> months ago and that is why the term &ldquo;Valuation&rdquo; appears in this Bill.  But, of course, that is the only possible reference to valuations in the entire Bill.</P>
    <P>What does the Bill propose to do? For the next two and a half years any person who enlarges or improves his building other than in a trivial way, whatever that may mean, is told that the increase in valuation which will follow his improvements will only affect him to the extent of one-third for a period of seven years from the date of the new valuation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words under the Minister's Bill there is a two-thirds reduction in the rates following upon an increase in valuation, and that is limited to work done in the next three years and operates for a period of seven years.  That is fair enough if it meant what it would have meant in the Fine Gael Bill defeated by the Fianna Fáil Party a few months ago, but unfortunately it does not mean what it appears to mean in the Title to this Bill, because the Minister's Bill is careful to define the limited extent to which the relief in respect of the increase in valuation is confined.  It only applies to rating purposes; in other words, it is merely a remission of rates and nothing else.  A businessman down the country who at the moment has a small shop or a small factory or a small building employing a small number of people and who desires or contemplates the extension of his premises for the purpose of increasing or developing his business has to bear this in mind, that under the Minister's Bill, while he will obtain for the next seven years a two-thirds reduction in the local rates attributable to any increase in valuation, he still will have to pay the full income-tax attributable to the increase in valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Bill very carefully <Col N="110" /> provided that the increase in valuation itself would not come into operation for seven years, so that there would not be either an increase in rates or an increase in income-tax or any of the incidentals that normally follow from increasing valuation.  The Minister's Bill does not do that.  Accordingly, such a person desiring to extend his business and improve his business buildings knows that from the Minister he will merely get a remission in rates, but will be bound to pay every penny of the increased income-tax that will follow an increase in his valuation. That is a very serious and, I think, a very unjust tax on initiative in this country.  It is so serious that it will prevent, in my opinion, much of the development that could take place under a judicial modification of our valuation laws.  It certainly will prevent the kind of building development that would take place if this House had accepted the Fine Gael Bill introduced a few months ago.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that example merely of the owner of a small factory or a small shop down the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a large factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a large shop.  It does not much matter; but the comparison from the Minister's point of view between the two Bills becomes particularly odious when one considers what would happen in respect of licensed premises under the Minister's Bill.  The owner of any licensed house who contemplates improving or enlarging his premises knows at the moment that if he does so his valuation will be increased.  He knows also that the increase in his valuation will mean that he will have to pay first of all more rates, secondly more income-tax, thirdly, higher excise duty, and fourthly, possibly an increase in other outgoings attributable to his licensed premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Bill would have ensured that for a period of seven years he would have to pay nothing by way of an increase and he would have been encouraged into expending money in the way of improving his buildings. Now, the Minister comes along with this Bill which is nothing but a political <Col N="111" /> measure designed for political purposes and intended to cod the people of this country.  The Minister comes along telling the owner of such a licensed house that he is going to get a temporary reduction in his valuation.  Of course he will if he carries out improvements or enlargements of his buildings, but what does that mean? It merely means that in the six financial years after the increase in valuation the amount of rates attributable to him will only be increased by one-third of the value of the improvement assessed by the Valuation Office, but he will have to pay every penny of the increase in income-tax, he will have to pay every penny of the increase in excise duty.  If he has his premises insured, as most of them would have, and if the insurance is, as a lot of them are, attributable to the valuation of the premises his premiums will increase.  If his E.S.B. bill is based on the valuation of his premises, that will increase and such a man will, accordingly, find that under the Minister's present Bill he will get a very, very small relief indeed.  So small is the relief, I fear the Bill will not achieve what the Minister expressed its intention to be, namely, the encouragement of persons to spend money and provide employment by way of improving or enlarging their buildings.</P>
    <P>The Bill in relation to Buncrana enshrines a progressive increase in the valuations in Buncrana.  It was somewhat regrettable that the Fianna Fáil Deputy representing Buncrana did not vote for the Fine Gael measure a few months ago.  It is regrettable that Fianna Fáil Deputies as a whole did not vote for it because, had they done so, that measure would now be law and, if it were the law now, everyone in Buncrana would be relieved to learn that no such general revaluation as had taken place there could take place again unless, of course, improvements or enlargements were carried out to buildings.</P>
    <P>The Minister now in relation to Buncrana proposes in effect that the total amount to be collected from Buncrana will be a sum starting at <Col N="112" /> roughly £8,500, which he says would have been the increase in relation to normal increases if the revaluation of 1950 had not taken place, and the Schedule to his Bill goes on to provide that this sum of £8,550 will increase each year until it reaches £11,500 in ten years' time.  I do not know whether that will appeal to the people of Buncrana as a very worthwhile effort towards meeting the appalling position in which they find themselves.  They certainly became in 1950, because of the laws that we hoped to change, hostages to fortune and I fear they will not be very thankful to the Minister for providing now for a statutory notice to them that the amount they will have to pay in the way of rates will progressively increase over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset this was a half-baked proposal; it is neither fish, flesh nor good red herring.  It is nothing but a weak Fianna Fáil effort to answer the proposal we introduced some months ago.  We do not intend to oppose it because we feel that even a half-baked half-loaf is better than no bread.  To the extent that a slight remission in rates is given, we accept it. We hope, however, that at some time in the near future it will be possible for the House to reform our valuation laws, laws based on a Victorian Statute of over 100 years ago, laws that are immersed in and enshrined with all the outmoded notions of that particular era.</P>
    <P>We are providing now in a limited way for a very small modification of those laws and in a very insignificant way we are trying to remedy some of the grievances that exist.  It is a pity the Government had not the strength or the courage when introducing this Bill to fight the issue with the Department of Finance.  It is a pity that once again a worthwhile relief has been frittered away because of the advice given and influence exercised by the Department of Finance.  The mountain has been in labour: what a little mouse has been produced by way of remission of rates in respect of improvements over the next three years, a remission limited to two-thirds of the increase in rates!  That will not satisfy the people <Col N="113" /> who are at the moment extremely concerned because of increases in valuations.</P>
    <P>I give notice to the Minister that we on this side of the House propose to introduce amendments on the next stage designed to give this Bill some realism and to ensure that the limited increase in valuation proposed in this Bill will apply for all general purposes to income charges and other charges of that kind.  We will also deal by way of amendment with the unsatisfactory exclusions under the Bill in relation to labourers' cottages.  I take it, though it is not clear under sub-section (3) of Section 3, paragraph (d), that it is the intention of the Minister that the benefit of this Bill should apply to labourers' cottages which are the subject of a purchase agreement.  I should imagine that intention is implicit in the provision of paragraph (d) of Section 3 but I am not satisfied that that purpose will be achieved, because the very cumbersome provisions of the Labourers Acts applying to cottage purchase seem to make it clear that the local authority exercises effective ownership until the terminable annuities are eventually discharged and the payment period expires.  I give notice that is also a matter with which we hope to deal by way of amendment.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister excludes from the provisions of this Bill every farmer who decides to improve existing or build new farm buildings.  On the occasion on which the Fine Gael Bill was debated here, we had a discussion in relation to the effect of Section 14 of the Valuation Act of 1852.  We are satisfied that over the years a number of farmers improving or enlarging their buildings have had their valuations increased.  That is a view which was not accepted by the Minister when the last Bill was being discussed and he provides specifically in this Bill that the erection, enlargement or improvement of a farm building will not qualify for the remission contained in this Bill.  That is a matter which we hope to deal with by way of amendment.</P>
    <P>May I say finally that we accept the Bill?  We think it is a very small effort on the Government's part to deal with <Col N="114" /> a very grave and serious problem.  We know that a number of Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party desire to see a general revaluation carried out, particularly in the City of Dublin.  That is a point of view upon which different opinions may be held.  But, until such a very large step is taken, there will remain very serious grievances amongst the people in regard to the effect of the valuation law, effecting of course increases in rates.  We do not think that this is any serious step to deal with these grievances, but, in so far as it goes a few inches forward, we are not going to raise any obstacle.  We do regret, however, that the Minister did not take the stride forward that we proposed in our Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really amazing how easy it is for some Deputies to bring into a simple Bill an approach which has for its purpose only the creation of confusion.  This is, in my opinion, a very simple Bill designed for a very specific purpose.  The Deputy who has just spoken tried to relate it to a Bill introduced by Fine Gael and debated in this House last Session which had as its basis quite a different approach.  It was made clear by those of us who spoke from these benches that we wanted to see valuation applied generally with distinct and clear equity and we expressed ourselves as not being too happy about the situation which confronts us to-day because of the manner in which valuation is applied arising from a very old Act.  We have suggested that within a reasonable space of time, after the people who are concerned with the technical details have had an opportunity of making a survey or examination, we should be able to discuss and consider and come to conclusions about what Deputy O'Higgins said was a general revaluation.  We are all in agreement with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the purpose of this Bill? This Bill is designed primarily to try to encourage additional constructional operations on the part of private enterprise in order that more people will find employment.  It is designed in the form of giving some concession. Deputy O'Higgins related this Bill, first of all, to his own Bill which purported <Col N="115" /> to be a cure for the evils in the present valuation system.  In discussing it further, he related it almost entirely to one particular class of business, the licensed trade.  We are concerned with the general situation.  If we can get people in small, medium, and, in some cases, large businesses, to add to their present premises, to reconstruct their present premises, or to put up new business premises, then by doing so within a certain period they will be given a concession.  The policy to-day is to try to create employment by every means possible. and, particularly, by assistance from the State.  The State says here, &ldquo;If you put up a new building, for a period of years from the time the building is complete you will have a remission of rates equal to two-thirds of the amount that the building will be valued at.&rdquo; The same applies to additions to existing premises.  There will be a two-thirds remission of the additional rates arising from this addition on the basis of the new valuation.</P>
    <P>Speaking for myself and the City of Dublin, I am pleased that there is this approach, and it is a limited approach. I have, however, one criticism and one suggestion to make.  I believe it will encourage people to do certain work now so that they will benefit very substantially by a remission of rates arising from the new building.  As I say, Deputy O'Higgins tried to confuse the issue.  He has tried to make it appear that this is the Fianna Fáil cure for all the grievances that exist in connection with the present valuation system, and he knows that that is not the correct view at all.  I suppose on the eve of by-elections it is good policy to advance arguments that will create confusion.</P>
    <P>I say that this Bill, when passed, will give an impetus to building.  I was very amused at Deputy O'Higgins itemising the disastrous consequences which will fall on the shoulders of a publican who, as a result of this Bill, attempts to reconstruct or add to his premises.  The Deputy tried to set off as against the remission of rates the increased charges which would follow <Col N="116" /> from other operations.  He told us that one of the things which would be brought about by the valuation would be an increase in insurance.  I do not know the figures, but I notice that Deputy O'Higgins was particularly careful not to give us one single example of figures in relation to this terrible disaster of the increase in income-tax resulting from the increased valuation arising from an addition to a premises.  He could have easily given us that in figures.  We do know the present rates in the £ a person has to pay on property.  When a person estimates roughly what his increased valuation will be, he can estimate approximately what the increased payment by him will be, and he can reduce it in accordance with the terms of this Bill and say: &ldquo;All I will have to pay of that will be one-third for that number of years.&rdquo;  I suppose we will have an opportunity of discussing this matter in other places in the next few weeks, but I am satisfied and I think the Minister will agree that this is a limited matter, limited entirely to a specific case to encourage people to do works to-day which they may not be inclined to do because of the cost of rates on their shoulders.  We will see what will happen.  There is only one fault I have to find and I would ask the Minister to consider it.  I think the prescribed period is not long enough.  I think the year 1956 should be extended to 1958 because in the case of a new building of some size, the acquiring of a site, preparing of a site and the actual construction itself will not in my opinion be completed in the prescribed period if it has not been started already.  I have experience of such with regard to local authority work and hospital work and if you put on, say, a wing to a hospital, or put in &mdash;as we have done in Baggot Street&mdash; a new outdoor dispensary, the building has taken up to the present some four years and it is not yet finished.  I do not know whether this Bill is like a contract in that it provides for the extension of the lost period if <i>force majeure</i> arises, if there is a strike or something happens that the building operations are interrupted for a lengthy period.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to explain, <Col N="117" /> perhaps, why he has limited the prescribed period to a few years and what objections there could be to extending that to 1958, which would give approximately five years from the time of preparing a building site to the completion of operations and consequently before the building was qualified.</P>
    <P>I have no other fault to find with the Bill.  I am not pretending for one moment to be accepting or swallowing it as an alternative or cure-all for the present valuation system or the inadequacies which exist.  I explained when the Fine Gael Bill was being discussed in this House that obviously in the City of Dublin we will have to do something about changing valuations, which are high valuations in what we will call places no longer actually first-class districts, having been first-class districts when they were originally valued.  We have other areas where in the minds of some, in the middle of what have now become newly-built-up areas there are premises with the old valuations, and there should be some easily understandable method of applying valuation so that people will know more or less what their commitments are going to be before they enter into a commitment on building or reconstruction or adding to their present premises.  I will appeal to the Minister to consider whether he will be prepared to amend Section 3: &ldquo;&lsquo;the prescribed period&rsquo; means the period 27th day of July, 1953, and ending on 26th day of July, 1956&rdquo;&mdash; amend that to read &ldquo;26th July, 1958&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins apparently sees all kinds of mysterious subways in this Bill and he quoted paragraph (d) of sub-section (3) of Section 3.  I am not a legal gentleman.  I am not trained in legal methods but it is quite clear to me that that does not preclude what was previously a cottage under the Labourers Acts, if it is now, or ever comes, within the period, into the private ownership of the occupant from qualifying.</P>

In this case here there can be only one correct meaning of that paragraph.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I want the Minister to agree to recognise that in the City of Dublin it can be difficult to complete a certain type of structure in the period specified and that he should extend that period from the beginning of operations up to their ending to the year 1958.  With regard to the general situation we are all studying and we are all hoping that some other people are studying so that in a reasonably short space of time the question of valuation generally will be reconsidered and some modern method adopted which will be understood by everybody and will have the result of a more equitable distribution of the burden of rates.</P>

      <P>I think everybody will welcome this Bill because at the time of the previous Valuation Bill we accepted and supported the principle of that Bill and were prepared to put down certain amendments to make it all we wished it to be and there is no reason why we should not do the same with this Bill.  But like Deputy Briscoe I think there is a great need for a general overhaul of the whole system of valuation.  I am not going into it now except to say that there is great need for a revision of the whole system.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Briscoe that the period is rather short because the object behind this Bill is mainly to give employment and to encourage people to give employment. <Col N="119" /> Even if the period were to be extended to ten years it would not be any great concession.  I think the Minister could consider that aspect of it.  As far as we are concerned, we welcome the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe has asked for an extension of the effective period of the measure.  I would like to support him on that and I would like to go in the other direction as well with the view to giving some little advantage to those who with all the difficulties confronting them faced reconstruction of their premises before there was any talk at all of the introduction of this measure.  I wonder why July has been decided on.  I thought at least that the rating year would be the period covered in the Bill and I would prefer if it were from January of 1953&mdash;that any works commenced in January, 1953, and which would not have been completed until perhaps later in that year or perhaps taking a further period for completion would qualify.  The people generally who are affected by this valuation&mdash; and I would call it an iniquitous system to put such heavy taxation in various ways on people who reconstruct their premises&mdash;feel that a fair thing or a reasonable thing would not be objected to.  Generally speaking, the people who came to me and I am sure to other public representatives from time to time said: &ldquo;Why not, at any rate, give us some number of years to recover?&rdquo; Let it be five or six years to recover at least portion of the expense to which they have gone in providing these improvements which are of general advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister has not gone far enough to meet that point of view. An extension of the number of years would only be equitable for those people.  However, he has approached the measure in a certain way and we have only to ask him to consider these points.  Deputy O'Higgins mentioned that the Fine Gael measure was responsible for all this.  I would ask Deputy O'Higgins to read the records <Col N="120" /> of the annual Municipal Congress which was held in Arklow a few years ago and there he will see a decision on this matter which was brought to the attention of the present Minister by deputation the following spring.  I do not know the exact dates but I was at the congress.  I presided and I know what happened.  I was on the deputation. Consequently, this question was before the Minister and his Department and it has been under consideration. Pronouncements were made in that regard in the meantime both to the municipal authorities and otherwise and the Bill has now come along.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill.  Deputy O'Higgins says it is a political measure but it has come really from the consideration of this matter by the Congress of Municipal Authorities which has representatives from all Parties. There is no use trying to pin politics on every improvement which is of advantage to the people and the country.  Even though politics is necessary in the scheme of things, there are higher motives which inspire members of this House and Ministers to bring in these measures.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, if he can do so at this stage, to reconsider the points which have been put to him and to improve the measure to the advantage of those who have to reconstruct their houses.  With regard to labourers' cottages, surely the tenant stands much in the same relation to his cottage and his little plot of ground as the farmer who pays annuities to his land.  The farmer pays annuities to the Land Commission.  The labourer pays rent or annuities after the leasing of his cottage to the local authority.  The difference is not a very big one.  They should have the same advantage in that regard.  I am sure nobody has any doubts but that they are being included in this measure.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacCarthy raised the question of extending the period for which this Bill will run.  I want to pose this question.  Why, since we have the means of so doing, have we not abolished the system whereby people are taxed for improving their houses, businesses or land?  It seems a most ridiculous system to follow.  I can <Col N="121" /> thoroughly understand why such a system was initiated a long time ago in this country, but I cannot understand why, now that we have got the management of our own affairs in our own hands, we allow that impost to be placed on the backs of our people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one means of getting money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Government in every country under the sun must find the funds to administer the necessary affairs.  Surely, it is a most iniquitous system whereby a person who improves his house, out-offices, business premises or land is plastered at once with a fresh impost of taxation while the sluggard living next door and allowing his place to fall into ruins gets away with it and actually gets a remission of taxation?  That is an appalling system.  Deputy O'Higgins mentioned that the Act which made this possible was imposed on this country 100 years ago but there were Acts before the 1852 Act which had the very same basis for levying taxation on the people.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a disappointing one. There is nothing really in it to oppose. There is nothing in it upon which to congratulate the Minister.  I am puzzled to know what class of person will benefit under this Bill&mdash;one out of every thousand.</P>

      <P>There is very little encouragement in it.  If a person sinks money in order to build a new premises or improve an old one he is at once plastered with taxation for doing so.  The policy of the present Government is to ensure that any business a person is already doing will be slashed in half or crushed altogether. Most of the people who build new houses get a remission of rates for seven years provided they get a grant. The things which have been urged on every Government by T.D.s from all sides of the House and which have pressed so hard on the people have not been removed in this Bill.  Part 3 of the Bill relates to Buncrana in Donegal.  Section 3 of the Bill consists <Col N="122" /> principally of eight paragraphs telling all and sundry the different types of premises that will benefit, including labourers' cottages.</P>

This Bill has been brought in for the benefit of a certain few people who will be building.

      <P>The Minister should amend the Bill on the next stage to bring it into line with the suggestions put forward by myself and some other members of this Party on the motion which was before the House on this subject in November last.  The injustice in regard to the valuation of out-offices and farm buildings should be removed in order to give agriculture, the principal industry of this country, a chance.  It is not possible for anyone but the Minister to introduce amendments along the lines I have suggested. Standing Orders would not permit it; accordingly I ask the Minister to amend this Bill.</P>
      <P>Let me take this opportunity to remind the Minister of what has been happening in regard to revision of valuations particularly in towns.  It is bad enough in some cases in the rural areas but in the towns it is absolutely oppressive.  I am not blaming the officials in the Valuation Office or the Commissioner of Valuation because they must administer the law as it stands. The Commissioner of Valuation has not the power to introduce legislation and it is the duty of the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance to amend legislation that becomes out of date or out-moded as the country progresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a very poor attempt at grappling with the problem, because in rural Ireland there will not be six people in every county who will benefit, and I do not know of anybody in my county who will benefit.  There may <Col N="125" /> be a few hundred in the City of Dublin and in other cities.</P>

Surely a motion that was supported by half this House and which would have been supported by more than half if the Whips were taken off, should not be treated in that frivolous way by the Minister.  Surely the Minister must have constituents who must have brought home to him the importance of this problem.  The survival and success of our principal industry is at stake.  At the present time if the farmer has out-offices or farm buildings erected the valuation officer is on top of him and he is actually punished for making improvements.</P>

      <P>In the old days, under English rule, if the landlord did not actually evict the tenant for improving his holding he doubled or trebled the rent.  That is the system that has been handed down by the old enemy of this country, to kill initiative and to prevent people from advancing themselves and improving the country.  If this system were given full rein in an undeveloped country after hundreds of years of occupation, there would be nothing but mud huts and hovels all over the place because nobody would dare to improve them.  The Minister could amend this Bill by bringing in a few amendments along the lines I have suggested on several occasions in regard to the problem of rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express briefly my approval of this Bill.  It is not a far-reaching measure and it does not claim to be.  It claims to bring into <Col N="126" /> line those who have been left out by previous legislation.  There is quite a number of people who improve their property and secure remission of rates for a period of years.  There are quite a number also who have not been affected by this remission of valuation and it is the intention of the Bill to bring those people into line with that reform.  Deputy Blowick was very severe on the Minister.  No doubt the Minister has improved as a result of the lecture which he has received, but I think the Deputy was talking a lot of hot air.  He asked: &ldquo;Why tax improvements?&rdquo;. Is it not a fact that initiative in every country is taxed to a considerable extent?  Income-tax is a tax, if you like, on initiative and enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the system in the United States, for instance, to tax initiative and improvements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The man who remains idle, and who makes no progress in the world, evades and escapes income-tax to a great extent.  The same is true of property tax.  I think it is the desire of every Deputy that direct taxation should be equal and that its burdens should not press unduly on any particular individual or section of the community.  I think, also, we all desire that, as far as possible, initiative should be encouraged and for that reason we have remissions of rates for a certain period under the various Housing Acts.  We also have those remissions under the Undeveloped Areas Act and under a number of other measures designed to improve the conditions of the country. It is the intention of the Government and I am sure it is the unanimous desire of the House to ensure that any sections of the community who have been left out of previous legislation will be brought in under this Bill and that anybody doing useful improvement works, giving employment and helping to build up the nation will get a measure of relief for a period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe made a strong case for extending the period to which this Bill applies beyond three years.  I should like to endorse that appeal. While three years may be a sufficient <Col N="127" /> period in regard to small works it is a very short period when you are dealing with a large constructional work.  We all know the length of time it takes to acquire a site, to draft plans and so forth, and we are all only too well aware of the various delays that may occur.  I quite appreciate that it is desirable to have a time limit because I assume that the purpose of this Bill is to speed up building work.  By setting a limit of a certain number of years, I expect that people will be encouraged to undertake the work immediately.  That is what everybody desires in order to give the maximum employment at the earliest date.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins expressed the point of view that this Bill is simply an answer to the measure brought in by the Fine Gael Party a few months ago.  The main difference between this Bill and the Bill brought in by the Fine Gael Party a few months ago is that this Bill is brought in by a Government in office.  The other Bill was brought in by an Opposition Party&mdash;a Party out of office.  Naturally, a Party that is out of office will try to be very generous to everybody but a Government has the responsibility of facing every financial difficulty that may arise.  Deputy O'Higgins said, in connection with this Bill, that a mountain had been in labour and had brought forth a mouse.  The Fine Gael Party was in labour for three and a half years and they did not even bring forth a mouse. Nothing resulted, in the matter of a revision of valuations, during the period of office of the Coalition Government.  During that time I pressed for some relief in this matter but I did not get much sympathy from the Coalition Minister for Finance who seemed to think that the ratepayers generally&mdash;and the farmer ratepayers in particular&mdash;were getting away with murder.  Anyhow, we have got this Bill and it is a relief to a considerable number of people.  It is an encouragement to them to go ahead and carry out works of improvement and to give employment.  For these reasons I think the House should have no hesitation in giving this Bill wholehearted approval.</P>

      <P>This Bill is of some concern to me.  I do not know what caused the conception of it at all.  It is rather a thing of rags and tatters than a Bill.  Apparently it is meant to cover up sore spots here and there, leaving the main problem still unsolved. Anybody who knows anything of what is going on from day to day is very well aware that all the main reconstruction work has taken place in this country in the past six years and that all that property lies under the burden imposed upon it.  What kind of a burden was that?  It was stated in this House&mdash;and it was not contradicted&mdash;that the present basis of assessing valuations in the Valuation Office is on the letting value of the property at the time of the making of the valuation.  We all know that there was a run on property and for the possession of property in the past six or seven years and that ridiculous rents were offered and paid for property during that period&mdash;rents that will never again be offered in our lifetime, I believe: certainly, they would not be offered to-day, or anything approaching them.  Take, for example, the entire licensed property of this country&mdash;to which considerable improvements have been made within the past six years.  Bear in mind the period in which the valuations were imposed on that property.  Assume that they were valued at the letting value on the date on which the improvements were carried out&mdash;on the basis of the rents they would then command.  What are they worth to-day, would anybody tell me?  Would they go 50 per cent. of the letting value of five or six years ago&mdash;even 50 per cent.?  These houses throughout the country, and the owners thereof, are now going to be saddled in perpetuity with this valuation, and the liabilities attaching thereto, unless something is done about it.  For that reason, it is difficult to understand why, as a matter of justice and equity, a major Bill has not been put before the House.  I want to make that protest on behalf of those people who are caught in that net now and have no remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does all this talk mean about giving two-thirds relief in valuation <Col N="129" /> from July last to 1956?  Has all this thing not now become absolutely stagnant in this country?  I should like to see the man who to-day, or within the next three years, will venture on a major improvement of his property in view of existing conditions of trade and prospects of trade not only in this country but throughout the world. Whether they are right or whether they are wrong, it is the general opinion of economists throughout the world that we are on the eve of a recession, whatever the extent of that recession may be.</P>
    <P>The only matter on which I want an explanation from the Minister is this. I think the Minister should explain the Schedule to this Bill.  The heading reads: &ldquo;Relevant Local Financial Years and Appropriate Amounts.&rdquo;  The Schedule then begins with the local financial year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, and deals with each of the local financial years up to the local financial year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, and it specifies the amounts for the respective years.  Is that the valuation on which the town will be rated during those years?</P>

      <P>You are gradually increasing the burden on these people. They will find it hard to exist because of world competition.  As Deputy Blowick has said, nobody can do anything to this Bill but the Minister. If he is going to do anything for the town of Buncrana he should do something decent and give them equitable treatment and not attempt to lead them up the garden path, making believe that he is doing something for them.  There are four or five little textile industries in that town which are keeping the town alive.  If this proposal had been made four years ago when there was a buyers' market it could have been borne more easily than it can be now having regard to the future that is facing the world and the enormous competition that will arise, particularly in the textile industry.  The House would be prepared to support the Minister in a generous act.  When he is reducing the figure to £8,550, he should make it a basic figure that will be continuous until such time as the House deems it prudent to have general revaluation of the country and then let them take what the public generally get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points in connection with this Bill that I would stress.  In my view the period should be extended beyond three years.  Three years is a rather short period in the matter of erecting a building or repairing premises.  If the work is of any magnitude, more than three years will have elapsed by the time plans are drawn, tenders are invited and the actual work undertaken and completed.  I would also suggest that the Bill should be made retrospective to 1st January instead of the 27th July.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal at length with the question of the reduction of valuations in Buncrana so as to enable the county-at-large charge to be based, not on the present valuation of Buncrana, but on the figures laid down in the Schedule to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly object to the interpretation of this Bill expressed by the other Donegal Deputy who has just spoken. He does not understand the position in Buncrana.  His statement that the <Col N="132" /> Minister was leading the people of Buncrana up the garden path by giving them medicine in small doses, is not correct.  The figure of £8,500 is somewhat higher than the valuation of the town of Buncrana in 1950 but had there been no 100 per cent. revision of valuations in that town the valuation of £7,000 odd, obtaining in 1950, would have increased since then as a result of the erection of new houses and reconstructions.  Deputy McMenamin cannot see that in the next ten years, even had there been no 100 per cent. revision, the valuation of the town of Buncrana would have increased to some extent year by year.  That does not mean that I agree with the figures given in the Schedule.  I think the Minister is taking for granted that in the natural course of reconstruction and building the valuation would increase by about £300 per annum. After all, Buncrana is not a large town.  I do not think the valuation there or in any town of its kind would increase by £300 per year.  I suggest that the figure of £8,000 odd should stand and that to it per year be added the natural increase which will take place.  From the year 1950 to 1955 or 1956, if the natural increase in valuation were £50 that could be added to the basic figure of £8,550.  If it is more, add more to it.  That should be the procedure, rather than to guess at a figure, as is done in the case of these figures for the years from 1956 to 1964.</P>
    <P>Again, I wonder if the reduction will apply to the financial year beginning on 1st April next.  I am very anxious on that point, as it would be to the advantage of the ratepayers there that they should get immediate benefit.  I do not know whether it is possible that a measure such as this could be made retrospective&mdash;but if it could I would go so far as to suggest that that should be done.  All this has been due, as the Minister says, to an action taken by those people themselves in seeking 100 per cent. revision of valuations&mdash;and getting it, of course, with a heart and a half&mdash;but that action taken by them should not result in the whole town being penalised over the last four years.  I think that this increase in valuation has meant a very large extra <Col N="133" /> contribution to the county council over those four years.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful and thankful to the Minister.  So are the people of Buncrana, despite what Deputy McMenamin says.  They are of the same opinion as myself, that it is something to their benefit&mdash;and very great benefit at that.  However, now that the Minister has admitted that an action taken by a certain number of the urban councillors at that time led to hardships in the town and now that the Minister has admitted by this part of the Bill that there was a genuine grievance, it should be clear that, if the payment by the ratepayers of Buncrana is unfair now it was unfair in 1950, and the unfair part of the payments since 1950 should be refunded in some way.  One way in which those people could get the benefit would be by freezing the £8,500 figure for the next four years.  I can assure the Minister that Part III of the Bill is appreciated in the town of Buncrana.  I hope that the points I have mentioned will be considered by him so that some of the injustices of the past may be remedied.  I cannot figure out how it was decided that those increases should go from £8,000 odd in 1950 up to £11,000 odd, and I do not think that the natural increase would amount to those figures.  I suggest again that the £8,550 be taken as basic and that the natural increase be added, except for a four-year period to compensate for the four-year period since 1950.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the position as Deputy Cunningham has stated it.  It was the result of their own direct actions.  There was just one question on which I had sympathy for them, the fact that as a result of the new valuation&mdash;which was £11,400 odd as against £7,000 odd&mdash;they were going to be paying on that new valuation the county demand, while other urban councils in <Col N="134" /> the county, such as Bundoran and Letterkenny, were getting through on the old figures.  Deputy Cunningham, who has shown a keen interest in this matter for a long time, has been after me very strongly on this question.  I must say I was very reluctant indeed to meet the situation, even in the limited way that we propose to meet it here.  We are meeting it in so far as the county demand is concerned.  In doing so we feel that the ratepayers of Buncrana will have no objection to paying on the increased valuation of their own town for their own local services.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham has posed the question, why or how did we arrive at the figure mentioned in the Schedule, on which the county demand will be based in the coming year?  It will take effect for the year 1954-55.  That was a matter that puzzled me and my officials also, when we came to consider how it would be dealt with here.  The valuation of the town of Buncrana before the increase was £7,563.  If you were to fix that figure in this Bill as the valuation on which the county demand would be paid, you would be doing an injustice to the other urban areas, because their valuations were progressively increasing according as new buildings were erected and old buildings were repaired.  This is how we reached the conclusions that are set out here.  In fact, it was my own suggestion.  I asked the officials to proceed on the basis of the way in which the valuation had moved in Buncrana and the other urban areas for, say, five years prior to revaluation and to take then an average of those five years.  In Buncrana, for the five years prior to 1950, the valuation increases in that town were: £450, £332, £287 and £330.  The average of these four figures is £330.  The new valuation came into existence on the 1st March, 1951, and if you take four times £330 and add it to £7,653 you will find that in the year 1954-55 the valuation would have been £8,000 odd and it is on that basis that the county demand will be made that year, progressively increasing by £330 until finally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, post-war or otherwise, the position is that it was a practical difficulty that had to be met, and, as far as I could see, the only sensible way in which it could be met is the way which is set out here.  As I have said, I have figures relating to the increases that have taken place in the other urban areas in the county, and they more or less work out along the same lines.  Deputy Cunningham has suggested that we should take the figure that was mentioned here of £8,000 odd, and then allow increases to take place as improvements and extensions might take place in the town of Buncrana, but remember the Valuation Office has already revalued the town of Buncrana at the town's request.  Surely, the Valuation Office should not be expected to stay in Buncrana and set up headquarters there to meet its particular views.</P>
      <P>I am saying much more on this than I had intended to say because I had not the slightest desire to lead anyone up or down the garden.  This is a genuine effort on my part to deal with a matter that should not, in the ordinary way, be dealt with in a measure like this.  Deputy O'Higgins referred to the Title of the Bill and was apparently attributing some ulterior or mysterious motives, but, as a matter of fact, the Title of the Bill was so decided by the draftsman because of the fact that we wanted to bring in Buncrana, and for no other reason.</P>

      <P>Some would like to think that it would be more generous, but it may not part with it either.  One would think from the discussion which we have had here that this should be a Revaluation Bill.  Deputies on the other side have expressed the opinion, not only in the course of the discussion on this Bill, but on other occasions that we wanted such a measure.  I remember when a Revaluation Bill was introduced in the Dáil some years ago.  As far as my memory serves me there was no evidence of any enthusiastic reception for it, not only on the other side of the House but, indeed, on our own side.  A general election intervened and the measure never was resurrected.  You meet people every other day in the week who tell you of the necessity for some revision of the whole valuation code.  It is all very well for people to talk like that until you present them with a document, and then you find that they will have all sorts of qualifications, conditions, objections and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure is designed to meet a situation which most people are aware has existed in many parts of the country.  There were people who carried out improvements to business and other premises, people who had been carrying out improvements over a long number of years.  The fact of their having carried out these improvements had not been discovered by the rating authority, but when carrying out some additional improvements it was found that all this improvement work which had been done by people, maybe over a period of ten or 15 years, was then coming to an end.  Public men on all sides of the House who saw the effect that that was likely to have, that it was a desirable sort of development, have said that perhaps it would be a good thing to give a form of relief to such people so as to encourage them to engage in that work. I do not know if you could prevent the Valuation Office from carrying out a revision of valuation following the erection of a building or the reconstruction of an old building.  Even if you could do that I do not think it would be desirable to do it because the Valuation Office must keep in line as best it can with its work.  Therefore, <Col N="137" /> all you can effectively do is to provide remissions.  Now, whether the remission is to be a complete remission or whether it is to be what is set out here&mdash;all these are questions that have to be decided by the Government, and decided having regard to their effect upon the general ratepayers all over the country.</P>
    <P>The provision which has been criticised here by Deputy Briscoe, and some others, that the time up to the year 1956 is too short a period inside which the work must be completed, is designed to ensure that those who want to take advantage of this measure will do so as quickly as possible&mdash;that the period will be as short as possible so as to give benefits in the way of employment. I do not know, and it may be right, that in many cases, where fairly big enterprises are involved, that the period will be too short.  I would not have any objection to considering the whole question of the duration of the period of work if I could find a way of providing that it would not be a temptation to those engaged on a smaller type of improvement to drag it out too long.</P>

That will only give an encouragement in respect of about six <Col N="138" /> months and it just cannot be done.

Some Deputy urged that we should go back at least to 1st January, but in all such measures as this, there is always the point that a date has to be fixed and a line drawn.  If we go back to 1st January, we will be asked why not go back to 1st December and why not go back even 12 months, two years and so on.  The decision to fix 27th July, was made having regard to the requests that have been made in relation to some retrospective effect in this provision, I do not think there is any chance at all of our going back any further.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to build up a case on an amendment after the lapse of such a period.  I think the House will agree with me that it is unfortunate that this important Bill should be dumped into the Order Paper in the way in which it is being dumped now&mdash; giving us this evening a matter of 55 minutes to discuss it.  In that time, it is almost impossible to have a proper discussion on one section and when the House comes to deal with the Order of Business to-morrow or in the future, it should consider how unsatisfactory it is to have a major Bill dealt with in this fashion.  It is very hard to keep up enthusiasm for a measure which has been the subject of such long delay and which, I am sure, is a source of worry and annoyance to the Minister and to the Department, as well as to the Deputies concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 38 of the Bill, which my amendment seeks to delete makes provision for the billeting of the Defence Forces in peace time and it provides that members of the Defence Forces may be billeted in hotels, in licensed premises, and, according to an amendment which the Minister proposes and which follows my amendment, in <Col N="140" /> restaurants registered as such under the Health Act, 1947.  To that extent, it is a very important section so far as the general public are concerned and particularly in so far as the three classes of persons involved are concerned.</P>
    <P>Every hotel proprietor, every proprietor of a licensed premises&mdash;a premises licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquors&mdash;and every restaurant registered as such under the Health Act, 1947, must realise now that, if this section becomes law, the Minister for Defence may make regulations whereby that proprietor will be required to provide lodging, attendance and food for members of the Defence Forces.  He is also obliged to provide livery stables; that is, the occupier of a victualling house must provide stables and forage for horses of the Defence Forces, and the owners of victualling houses and garages must provide garaging for mechanically-propelled vehicles of the Defence Forces.  All those people who will be obliged by those regulations to provide those facilities will be paid such sums as the Minister may by regulation prescribe and they will be subject to such orders and instructions as may be given by persons whom the Minister vests with power to do those things. If they do not comply with those orders they are liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £20.  The section further provides that members of the Garda may be given responsibility and powers in connection with the section, and where they do that that the regulations made by the Minister shall only be made with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice.  It is also provided in the section that no member of the Defence Forces shall be billeted in a private house or in any premises occupied by women only; and the section further provides that every regulation made under the section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if in the usual way a regulation annulling such regulation is passed by either House in the next subsequent 21 days on which such House is sitting after such regulation is laid before it such regulation shall be annulled accordingly <Col N="141" /> but without prejudice to anything previously done under such regulation.</P>
    <P>I object to this section on a number of grounds.  I object to it first because of the very archaic language that is used in it.  It is the taking over of an old section from very old Acts of Parliament that applied at a time when up-to-date facilities for military forces in regard to food and accommodation were not available, when the normal method of transport was horses, and when the provision of forage for horses and candles and paraffin for light were matters of some importance.  But this old section has been transferred into this new 1951 Act as if we had had no developments in the last 100 or couple of hundred years, as if we had no progress and as if there had not been great progress in the matter of the provision of essentials for military forces not only in peacetime but actually in the field in times of war.</P>
    <P>I object to the section on another ground.  If we want as a Parliament to lay it down that it is the duty of the persons named here to provide accommodation and facilities such as are mentioned in this section for the Defence Forces in time of peace then we should say so in the Act.  We should make it the law of the land in this Act, instead of saying here that we give to the Minister for Defence power to make a law whereby they will be obliged under penalty of a fine of £20 to obey rules and regulations made by the Department of Defence. If I may say so with respect, whatever experience the Department of Defence has got in regard to making regulations for soldiers I doubt very much if their experience could possibly be held to fit them as the proper persons to make laws governing the civilian population; and that is what this section provides.  It says the Minister for Defence, but in actual fact, as we know from our experience of the machinery of Government, that means the Department of Defence.  The Department of Defence is going to be vested with very extensive powers to make laws governing the citizens and the particular classes of citizens that are mentioned in this section.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the beginning that <Col N="142" /> the owners of hotels, of premises licensed to sell intoxicating liquor, and restaurants registered under the Health Act, would be compelled to obey these laws; but other persons, as a reading of the section will show, are compelled to obey them also.  That is the occupiers of livery stables.  Where the Minister is going to find livery stables I do not know.  He will find difficulty in finding a great number of them; but nevertheless the occupiers of livery stables are also bound to obey the law that the Minister may make. The occupiers of garages, which has a very much wider meaning and which covers a much greater number of people, will also be obliged to carry out the Minister's law.  I feel, as I have already said, that where this House wants to make laws governing the ordinary citizens of the country it should make those laws in a specific way; and while it may be justified in giving the Minister power to make regulations to govern the Defence Forces&mdash;the organisation, administration and discipline of the Defence Forces&mdash;the House in my view should hesitate and should not except for the gravest reasons give the Minister for Defence power to make the type of law I have mentioned that affects so many ordinary citizens of the country.  I ask the Minister to explain to the House and through the House to the country why he wants these powers at all in peacetime.  Is there not adequate provision by tentage or otherwise whereby all the Defence Forces can be accommodated if they wish to spend a night away from barracks?  Is there any difficulty in the provision of food through the medium of field kitchens, or otherwise, for members of the Defence Forces who happen to be moving from place to place in peacetime?  Is there any difficulty in garaging Army tanks, Army armoured cars or vehicles which necessitates the powers for which the Ministers asks in this section?  It seems to me ludicrous to talk about garaging the vehicles of the Army when one's experience is that these vehicles are generally dispersed and placed under trees, or otherwise hidden, remote from buildings that might be bombed.</P>
    <P>That is one of my difficulties in relation <Col N="143" /> to this Act.  In my view this measure has not been adequately considered in relation to present day events and present day experience.  If I could see any justification good, bad or indifferent for this section I would not waste a moment in opposing it. But there are grave reasons for objecting to the section.  I see no reason why the section should be there at all.  It is no use the Minister saying that there is a protection in sub-section (7) which says that every regulation shall be laid before the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas will have the power to annul such regulation.  There is no protection in that provision because when a Minister makes such a regulation he obviously has a Parliamentary majority behind him and, if he has a Parliamentary majority, the regulation he makes will not be annulled here or in the Seanad.  Therefore, the protection it is alleged the citizen has in sub-section (7) is no protection at all.  As the House knows, if such a regulation is laid on the Table of the House all that this House and the Seanad can do is vote on a simple motion to annul it or not to annul it, as the case may be. The House has now power of amending it in any particular no matter how harshly the regulation may operate against citizens.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to withdraw this section and to substitute for it, if he thinks it is necessary to have this particular power in peacetime, a simple comprehensive section which will specifically state what citizens will be obliged to do and the penalties they will incur for non-compliance instead of laying it down, as it is laid down here, with all the solemnity of parliamentary procedure that we will give the Minister for Defence powers to make laws which must be obeyed under threat of the very serious penalties provided in this section.  It is for those reasons that I recommend to the House that this section be deleted from the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of billeting has been debated <i>ad nauseam.</i> We debated it at great length when we were examining the Bill in the first instance in the Special Committee. <Col N="144" /> I recollect that on that occasion Deputy Cowan, who is now pressing for the deletion of this section, urged me very strongly to extend the scope of that particular section in order to take in other types of premises, such as milk bars, etc.  I must admit that Deputy Cowan is an adept at making a very simple matter appear a very serious one.  May I point out to the Deputy and to those who support him that this power has existed since the establishment of the Army and it has never been abused?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it longer&mdash;200 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking now about the situation as we know it.  We are faced here with the making of laws by which the Army will be guided. Whether it dates from 200 years ago or 30 years, that makes very little difference.  The point is that during all that period, far from being abused, the power of billeting has never been utilised; and there was a period in recent times when it might have been necessary for the Army to utilise that power.  I refer to the period of the emergency when large forces were concentrated in special areas during manoeuvres.  Even during that period, the powers that were there were never utilised.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan asked me to give the House a reason why this power should be there.  The only answer I can give is the one that I am sure he himself would give were he in my place: that is, we must try to foresee, as far as possible and as reasonably as possible, the requirements we may need.  I can very easily visualise circumstances in which it might be necessay to utilise these powers.  There might, for instance, be a very large concentration of troops in a particular area for purposes of manoeuvres or for ceremonial purposes, not necessarily connected with actual war, and if these powers are not provided in peacetime men might have to engage in manoeuvres in very adverse circumstances because no provision was made for their comfort. That is why it is necessary to have this section in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the fact <Col N="145" /> that this section will be implemented to a very large extent through the medium of regulations.  In the course of his remarks he said it was the Department which made these regulations and the Minister had very little to do with them.  I may not be quoting the Deputy's exact words but I am quoting what I deem to be the effect of his words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I say &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; the Minister knows that I am referring to any Minister and not to a particular Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Minister would be not only very foolish but indeed criminal to sign a regulation put up to him by his officials without having full knowledge of the purpose of that regulation.  I do not think any responsible individual would do that. The Department puts up the regulations&mdash;and they must of necessity do that because the regulations will be drafted by the experts dealing with that particular type of work.  It is these experts who will have to explain to the Minister, if he is dissatisfied about any particular phase of a regulation, why it is necessary to have the regulation in the form of words in which it may be produced to him.  If the Minister is not satisfied he is not under any compulsion whatever to sign a particular regulation and he may have it altered as he thinks fit. It is true, therefore, to say that the Minister is the person who is responsible for the regulations.</P>
      <P>I cannot see any reason why the section should be deleted.  As I said, Deputy Cowan was pressing me at the Special Committee to expand the section so as to include restaurants, milk bars and so on and the next amendment which is in my name is intended to meet, as far as it is possible to do so, the Deputy's wishes at that particular time.  This amendment, which is in my name, will be dealt with when the present amendment, which I am not accepting, is disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to say now is to correct the Minister on one point, as I would not like it to go on <Col N="146" /> record uncontradicted that I took a different attitude in the Special Committee from what I took here.  In the Special Committee I put down several amendments, an amendment to each sub-section, the net effect of which was to bring about the situation which I have advocated here.  I will just quote one extract from the report of the Special Committee and it is a very good job that we had the reports of the Special Committee.  Here is what I said, as reported in column 139 of the report of the Special Committee on the 19th March, 1951:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The idea I have in mind is that sub-sections (a), (b) and (c) should be positive sections whereby, under this Act, the occupiers or owners of victualling houses and of livery stables and of garages would be required to provide lodgings, attendance and food, stabling and forage for horses and garage space for mechanically propelled vehicles.  It was also my idea that the section should oblige them to do that and that the Minister would be authorised under the section to make regulations as to the conferring of power upon such persons who would require these services.  I do think that, as a general principle, where we make a law affecting the civil population and the community, and where we provide for a penalty not exceeding £25 for breach of that law, we should specifically make it a law rather than a law depending on regulations to be made by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is exactly what I have said in the case I made here.  I know that the Minister has misinterpreted it unconsciously, but in my own interest I want to have the record correct.  The Minister will recollect that, as reported at column 142, the question was put by the chairman, &ldquo;That Section 38 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.  That was after Deputy Collins and I had spoken against the section.  It is on record in very precise and unambiguous terms that we opposed the section.  The committee divided and there were six for the section and two against.  It was a committee of considerable size, but only eight members happened to be present at the time and the vote <Col N="147" /> was six for and two against, and the two against were Deputy Collins and myself.  So that I would not like it to go on record that the case I am making here is different from what I made in the Special Committee.</P>
    <P>I tried to improve every sub-section because I thought that &ldquo;victualling houses&rdquo; was a ridiculous term to use in 1951, as it was then, or now in 1954. I wanted to put it in modern language instead of that archaic term and I put in my amendment &ldquo;place of public refreshment&rdquo;.  I did provide for inns, restaurants, board and lodging houses, milk bars, public dance halls, communal halls, halls owned by local authorities, cafes and refreshment rooms.  They were all subject to the one provision and I thought that whatever we wanted to say about these things should be said in the Act and not left to the Minister to make regulations that it is possible to do these things.</P>
    <P>It is of such interest that I said also, as reported in column 137:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We should, in this Bill, specifically lay down that occupants or owners of these houses are bound to provide lodging and food when so required by an officer or by the Minister in certain circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is still my idea.  If this House wants to say that the particular people I have mentioned should provide facilities for the Army, then we should say it in the Bill and not leave it to the Minister to make regulations which would have the force of law and which apply to all these people.  The Minister says that we have debated this <i>ad nauseam.</i>  I am afraid that is always the idea of a person who wants to get something through as against somebody who disagrees with him, but it is an important business as far as the general public are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that in 30 years this section has not been used.  I have never known it to be used.  I do not think it has been used since the first world war, except, perhaps, in Abyssinia or up on the North-West Frontier or somewhere like that.  I know of no civilised army using that <Col N="148" /> power in any of the countries with which we are familiar.  If that is so, why put it in the Bill?  One hundred years ago trains were very important things.  We have all sorts of new systems of transportation.  We have to take account of those changes such as air transportation in our everyday lives and in our Acts of Parliament. But here, the Department of Defence says: &ldquo;We want this old Act that was of some use in India or somewhere like that 100 years ago,&mdash;or even in Ireland, when the British forces were here as an occupying power.  We want that power still but we can give no reason for it.&rdquo;  The Minister has said he can visualise a large concentration of troops in a particular area for training or ceremonial purposes or something like that.  What areas did the Minister visualise?  Would not that be the way to test it?  Take the town of Kells. How many victualling houses are in the town of Kells?  How many people could be housed in the victualling houses there?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think he has been advised properly in regard to it and it is for that reason I am very doubtful about this House giving powers the use of which could be advised in the same way as the Minister is advised that the section should be in the Act.  Let us leave out Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Cork <Col N="149" /> and Dublin for the moment and take any other town in Ireland and ask ourselves how many victualling houses are in it.  Even with the new interpretation that victualling houses are premises registered in a register and either licensed premises or restaurants, how many of his large concentration of troops could be billeted in these houses?  Very few.  We all know that every unit of the Army has its camping equipment and that whether they assemble for a ceremonial purpose or otherwise it is very good training for the troops to camp in conditions as near as possible to the highest comfort they can have in war-time.  Obviously the officers would be in command of them and would prefer to have them in a very nice field where they would have them under control instead of going around to these victualling houses and trying to get in touch with Tom, Dick or Harry whatever his rank might be.  How is the Minister going to deal with it?  Who is going to be put into the first-class of victualling houses, the hotels?  Is he going to put his officers in there?  Is he going to put the sergeants into the public houses and who is he going to put into the restaurants?  The whole thing is absurd.  There is no practical basis or foundation for it and because I believe that I think the section should go out.</P>
      <P>I think after the very fine discussion we had in the Special Committee where the same line was gone through that the views expressed there should have been taken into consideration and that this antique section dealing in antiquated language with things that do not exist&mdash;for instance victualling houses&mdash;should have been omitted. Nobody in Ireland knows what a victualling house is.  It is used in the Act and then so that somebody might have some idea of the meaning the Minister has to interpret it.  I am sorry the Minister did not delete that section.  I do not think he has made a case for it in the Special Committee.  He did not make a case for it here and I would request the members of the House not to make fools of themselves by adopting such a ridiculous section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was most anxious to hear what justification the Minister <Col N="150" /> might make for this section.  Like Deputy Cowan, I would like to put on record my very pertinent protest against the manner in which we are dealing with this Bill.  It does become difficult to correlate one's thoughts of 12 months ago with the matter we are discussing to-day.  I am not saying this in criticism of the Minister as the Minister well knows.  I am saying this so that my protest might go on record in this House against the manner in which the time is allocated to this Bill and&mdash;if our voices in this House can help&mdash;I am doing so to try and get a fixed, regular method of completing this Bill.  I say that only in passing.</P>
      <P>I want to say this&mdash;that the more you read the section the more archaic it sounds.  I do not want to be taken as being eternally critical of the Civil Service plugging machine but this is a bit of plugging.  This section was obviously found in the archives in some part of the Minister's Department.  it is taken holus-bolus, word for word, in a context that might have been pertinent to military problems of 100 or maybe 200 years ago.  The day of the charger is gone and it is time the Department, in its concept of drafting of legislation, appreciated that.  We have had knowledge&mdash;any of us who have had the honour of serving in the Army&mdash;of <i>faux pas</i> that have occurred in the past because the Department was not abreast of the fact that the artillery section was now motorised and had not horses pulling its gunwagons. This section in its entirety is a little bit reminiscent of that particular type of activity.</P>
      <P>I was trying to figure out while the Minister was talking what concentration of troops could occur that would necessitate this particular type of section. Taking into account the general power under Section 4, I cannot find any justification at all in the argument adduced for the retention of the section. Take the language of the section. It certainly is not the conception of the Department.  It is a transcription into this Act of a clause from one of the old British Army Acts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or some such document.  It is a little bit irksome <Col N="151" /> for the limited group of people here who are trying to help the Minister and get this Act into reality to have to spend time arguing on archaic expressions and I am pressing the Minister on this issue that where sections such as this have no reality in fact or no pertinent relativity to what might be a reality, it would be far better if he found a formula for dispensing with them because it would enable us to dispense with much of the discussion which has arisen.  Read the section at random.  You have got to provide lodging, attendance, food, stabling and forage.  It seems an negation of reality to have a section such as this in relation to an Army such as ours with its transport subsidiary unit attached to each brigade, with its full brigade organisation on the basis of being able to move into the field with all its requirements by way of transport, ambulances and field ambulances.  Either we must have an Army some way up to date or else we are only playing soldiers.  It is time that the Department in its conception of regulations realised that we have an Army integrated with all the appurtenant services from brigade level to field units.  If the Minister's advisers brought themselves up to date with that situation, I think we would not have such sections as this particular one brought in.  I suggest to the House that it is not only nauseating in itself, but it is virtual affront to our intelligence. We have not reached the stage where we have to incorporate in a comprehensive measure of the importance of this particular measure a section such as that.</P>
      <P>I want to see this Bill dealt with expeditiously and I want to see it go through in a reasonable way, but unless it is culled of verbiage such as this we may find this Bill, as its predecessor, surviving the present Government.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;As regards amendment No. 38, the expression &lsquo;victualling house&rsquo; means premises described in Part III of the Tourist Act, 1939, as premises&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely reading this to show that Deputy Cowan, who has been telling us for the last 20 minutes that he does not know the meaning of the word &ldquo;victualling&rdquo; or where a victualling house is to be found&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was reading the definition in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;here stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the expression &lsquo;victualling house&rsquo; means premises described in Part III of the Tourist Act, 1939, as premises licensed under the Licensing Acts for the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption on the premises.  In other words, the two places that are termed billeting houses are hotels and public houses.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He continued:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Now, I want to add a new paragraph, because I agree with what <Col N="153" /> the Minister, and, I think, Mr. Brennan, has said about licensed premises.  I suggest that it should include restaurants, public milk bars, communal halls, community halls, cafes, and refreshment rooms, and public dance halls, and these should be places where soldiers might be billeted.  I think the Minister might accept that amendment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would be just as justified in asking Deputy Cowan what is a communal hall or what are community halls as he is in asking me what is a victualling establishment.  If the Deputy said parish halls, I would understand immediately what he was aiming at but I do not know if there are such things as communal halls in this country. Maybe there are but if there are I do not know where you will find them. However, I am putting down this amendment in order to meet the Deputy's wishes in the matter.  I think it does so because in the regulations mentioned in the amendment a restaurant is defined as a premises in which is carried on the business of selling meals to the public.  Milk bars may or may not come within the definition.  I suppose it depends on circumstances in each particular case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this amendment I want to say that the Minister provided for machinery here for hotels and public-houses.  It seemed on the Special Committee that if there was to be billeting that at least that should be extended to the types of place I mentioned, restaurants, board and lodgings, milk bars, public dance halls, communal halls, halls owned by local authorities, oafes and refreshment rooms.  That was the amendment I moved.  That amendment was debated. The Minister would not accept it and now he decides he will accept part of it, a restaurant that is registered under the Public Health Act.  Now we have a new expression, a victualling house which means a premises registered in a register kept under Part III of the Tourist Act, 1939, (No. 24 of 1939) or premises licensed under the Licensing Acts, 1839 to 1846, for the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption on the premises and a <Col N="154" /> restaurant registered in a register kept under regulations made under Part V of the Health Act, 1947 (No. 28 of 1947).  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Local Government to introduce proposals for legislation to amend the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948, so as to secure (1) that servants of local authorities who did not apply for registration as established servants within the statutory period of six months be now permitted to apply with full credit for previous service; (2) that employees of local authorities who had been directed to work other than county council employment during the statutory three years' qualifying period be given full credit for periods spent at such work, e.g., farm work, minor relief schemes, Land Commission schemes, E.S.B. employment, drainage committees; <Col N="155" /> (3) that the subscription of 1/2d. in the 1/- be abolished and a charge of 1/-per week substituted, and (4) that servants of local authorities, who have been registered as established servants but who for any reason have not been credited with previous service, be now given credit for such service. &mdash; (Deputies Dunne and Kyne.)</P>

      <P>As the Minister for Defence said a while ago, when these matters are going on from time to time, we find it difficult, particularly after the Christmas period, to get back into our stride again.  However, before Christmas we drew attention to the difficulties that beset the road workers, that is, what we may term the established servants of the council and also established officers.  We appreciate that no matter what legislation may be passed in this House, it is only when it is put into operation that the various snags which are bound to arise can be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the biggest problems we find in connection with Part III of the Act dealing with established servants is that of local authorities and the advice expressed not so much by members alone but by legal advisers to these various councillors.  Let me say, however, that I do not believe for a moment that legal advisers to any county council try to put a certain view merely to suit themselves.  From the experience we have had in various parts of the country I can say that those legal advisers co-operated in so far as it was possible for them to do so.  The difficulty seems to be that the Act is such that very many views can be expressed both by the legal authorities connected with the various local authorities and the members themselves. In County Cork, for instance, <Col N="156" /> we have been confronted with the problem of the outlook of certain members who at the very outset seemed to be anxious to take advantage of any opportunity which arose to prevent this particular section from coming into operation to the benefit of the men.  It is so easy for us to speak of established servants but in certain parts of the country there were men working for the county council as road workers, servants of the council, for anything up to 20, 25 and even 30 years and it has not been accepted by that local authority that those people are established servants.  That means that for a very large percentage of such road workers this Act would give little or no benefit because in many instances unless they were going to obtain the advantage of their past service they would gain little or nothing by applying under the Act.</P>
    <P>It may be true to say that when this Act was introduced and passed by the House, all Parties believed that such disadvantages could have been overcome but unless we can have some form of amending legislation to ease this difficulty, at least 95 per cent. of the road workers in southern Ireland at any rate&mdash;I speak more particularly of Munster and some of the counties adjacent to Munster&mdash;will not get the advantage which we had really hoped they would get.</P>
    <P>Again it is stated under the Act that even after proving the case of establishment in a period of less than five years pensionable service if the man should work less than 200 days in any one year, he is victimised once more. In this regard I am not to be taken as either praising the Administration of the time or attacking the present Minister, but it is quite obvious to me, as it is to the other members of our Party, having considered the operation of the Act, that mistakes have been made in it.  It is a great pity if we cannot, through a system of co-operation, help these men rather than leave in the hands of various councillors and various local authorities an opportunity to avail of many loopholes.  Those of us here who are members of local authorities know that it frequently happens that there may be sufficient employment for these men, who may be classified <Col N="157" /> as established servants, for a few years; but it can also happen that there would be a bad year.  For instance, we agree with the policy of local authorities in concentrating on the steam-rolling and tarring of main roads, generally improving these roads, and getting as much work as possible done during the summer period.  However, there is the difficulty that coming into the autumn period when harvesting work has to be done, some of these road workers, because of their loyalty to their neighbours, and because of their understanding of rural life, realise the necessity of giving their time in helping neighbouring farmers at the harvesting period.  Unfortunately, as the Act is before us, that worker, through his sense of co-operation and his realisation of the necessity for helping in the harvest work, particularly in a bad year when it might be most important to do so, even after a four-year period having well over 200 days employment, is victimised even though he has been considered as an established servant of the council. That, in my opinion, warrants the consideration either of an amendment to the Act or, if necessary, new legislation.</P>
    <P>Let us also realise that even in the reading of the Act it is undoubtedly beyond the compass of the average layman to scrutinise every section and sub-section in it, to weigh the &ldquo;whereas&rdquo; in a section and the &ldquo;wherefore&rdquo; in a sub-section, and so forth.  When we leave it to the legal advisers, the legal advisers are inclined to give different interpretations. Therefore, we consider that the only satisfactory solution to this problem is the complete overhaul and adjustment of the measure in such a way that the difficulties will be surmounted.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, there is also the matter of the percentage contribution by the worker.  It would be well to glance back over a period of years in this country&mdash;indeed, we need go no further back than the past five or six years&mdash;and to take into consideration the wage increases which the worker has received in that period. Any increase he has received is not commensurate with what he deserves to enable him to keep his family going. <Col N="158" /> In my view, the charge is undoubtedly a heavy impost on the average road worker, if he has a family to keep.  If it were possible to have that matter remedied, I believe the road workers would realise the advantages coming to them.  We appreciate that there had to be a certain period, when this Act became law, when road workers were entitled to live registration&mdash;but were they to miss that period they would have to wait a long period again before they could qualify.  Furthermore, one of the weakest points of the present measure is that it is left to the local authority to decide the maximum number which they consider suitable to enter on the register in their area for employment.  That, in itself, again places us in a most awkward position. Should it happen that a county council, because of improvements they may consider necessary in various parts of their county, decide to employ a larger number of men, the register has been computed in such a way that the men coming in cannot take advantage of it for quite a long period of time.</P>
    <P>Then there is the problem of established officers.  Naturally my approach to this matter is, from the outset, the same as that of my colleagues, Deputy Dunne and others, and that is to face it from the viewpoint of the established and unestablished servant.  We realise our responsibility to consider the case of the established officers also.  We have heard of men in various counties who were established officers but who retired, through ill-health or otherwise, since 1948.  I have here particulars of a man who retired in November, 1948.  It may be that the Minister is not in a position to give due consideration to their demands for the increase in their pensions which was provided to them under the Act of 1948 but which they never got.  Other sections of the community have received certain advantages either through consideration in respect of the cost of living or in some other way.  If this Act has been preventing the just case of men from being met, then we are entitled to say that, though the intention behind this Act may have been good, there are so many loopholes in it that it requires revision.</P>
    <P>Again I have in mind the question <Col N="159" /> of established officers or clerks who were established during the period 1948 to early 1949.  Some of these people&mdash; not a large number&mdash;gave some years' service in a temporary capacity.  Those officers who were established prior to the 1948 Act did not have to give any contribution but those men who, after 1948, were considered permanent and pensionable are now faced with the problem that, even though they gave valuable years of service to the local authority the impost is placed on them of having to pay a certain contribution, which they find it difficult to meet.</P>
    <P>I believe that the points I have made support the case we have been making for an investigation of and consideration by the Minister of the question either of amending the measure or of introducing legislation which will improve it.</P>
    <P>It frequently happens, of necessity, that a Minister is allowed by the various Acts introduced and passed by this House to make regulations.  It is written there for us to read that, if necessary, regulations may be annulled by this House within 21 days.  How often does it happen that regulations are made by a Minister&mdash;I am not thinking in particular of this case&mdash; and the papers are placed on the Table of the House at a time of the year when the House is not sitting?  We all know that a number of regulations can be placed on the Table of the House about the 2nd or 3rd of January, at a time when neither House of the Oireachtas is sitting and when the members are thinking not of regulations but are wondering how they are going to meet their own Christmas bills.  Therefore, in the matter of questioning regulations, it can be said with justification that we are often at a disadvantage because of the time of the year when they are placed on the Table of the House.  I have a horror of departmental circulars.  I do not mind which Minister or what Department is concerned.  There are people in certain Departments of State, including Local Government, who seem to have a mania&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear, by giving the date, that I cannot say if it is the present Minister who is responsible.  I presume he was not there at the time.  Therefore, it must be his predecessor.  I have already said that.  As long as I am in the House, within the Rules of the House, I will draw attention to such matters. The circular in question is circular E.L. 5/51.  That circular was issued to local authorities.  I would ask Deputies to notice the date&mdash;21st May 1951.  At that time we were in the throes of a general election.  Circulars should not be issued at such a time.  That circular was a damnable circular and offered <Col N="161" /> opposition and obstruction to the working of the 1948 Act.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider that circular to see how far it is helping or obstructing the present Act.</P>
      <P>I have tried to be fair in my contribution to the debate.  The time is limited and I want to allow Deputies who wish to speak to get in.</P>
      <P>In Cork and other counties it is almost impossible for road workers to prove that they are established servants. There is also difficulty in the case of officers.  There is a provision that, if an established officer has 20 years' service or over, he is allowed ten years.  As a result of the terms of appointment they also are victims in some cases.</P>
      <P>It is vitally necessary for us to admit the weaknesses in the Act.  Legislation should be introduced to close the loopholes so that the Act may be regarded as an Act for the benefit of road workers in rural Ireland and all the others concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that there was a legal action in Cork in connection with Cork Corporation employees.  One court held that a certain number of the employees were exempt from contributing to a superannuation scheme.  The corporation and the city manager appealed against that decision and the decision was reversed. The whole thing hinged on whether a register of employees was or was not kept in years previous to the passing of the Act.  The first court held that where a wages book had been kept for a certain number of years the men who were enrolled on it for a certain number of years were qualified for exemption.  The higher court decided that there was not a proper register of employees kept and that those employees should pay their contributions. A great deal of money was in arrears at the time.  Some people had paid the first portion and it was supposed to be paid back.  There was a hold-up in the payment of contributions by others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, an injustice was done to those employees because in other local authorities where a register was kept the employees were exempt from <Col N="162" /> paying contributions.  Before the action was taken I discussed this matter with officials of the Department and they were convinced that the employees would win under the Act.  That was not the case.  Amending legislation should be introduced without delay.  We have made representations to the Minister on that matter.  I hope the Minister will bring in amending legislation without further delay.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy Desmond that the contributions demanded from some road workers would make it impossible for them to come within the scheme.  In some cases it would amount to from 10/- to £1 a week.  They could not be expected to make such a contribution. A reasonable contribution should be required from them.</P>
    <P>I am especially interested in the City of Cork employees, and would ask the Minister to bring in amending legislation as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience of the discussion in the House when the 1948 Act was under consideration there would appear to be no difference in principle between the members of the House on the pertinent point as to whether pensions should be provided for employees of local authorities who were supposed to be covered under the terms of the 1948 Act.  The only question that remains to be decided by the Minister and his advisers is whether the administration of the 1948 Act complied with the wishes of all the members of this House who voted for the 1948 Act.  The Minister ought to have figures at his disposal to convince him as to whether the Act was administered in the way that he as a Deputy intended it to be administered when he voted for its enactment, or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no experience of the working of this Act, as I am not a member of a local authority, but I have received large numbers of complaints&mdash;in some cases through union representatives and in other cases from individual road workers, for example, who made application for the benefit of the Act and whose applications were rejected by the county manager.  I submitted many of these appeals during the past couple of years to the Department and it was <Col N="163" /> only in a very small percentage that the applicant succeeded in having the decision of his county manager reversed.</P>
    <P>I discussed this matter with other colleagues of mine in this group and I listened to lengthy discussions on the manner in which this Act has been administered in different counties throughout the State.  It was a pleasant surprise to hear the sympathetic way it is administered in counties adjoining the two counties of my constituency, compared to my own constituency.  That may be due to the advice tendered to the county manager by the legal advisers in counties outside my own, or it may be due to the generous and sympathetic way in which the county manager himself endeavoured to give the best possible terms to the individual applicants.  I am not making that point as a complaint against one county manager as compared to another; I am making it for the sole purpose of endeavouring to impress on the Minister the necessity to amend the existing Act so that there can be no difference whatsoever in its administration in one county as against another.  If a certain type of road worker has certain qualifications, experience and service, similar to his colleagues in an adjoining county, all things being equal, I do not see why, for legal or managerial reasons, he should be turned down while his colleague in the other county gets the full benefit of the Act.  There is room for tightening up there, no matter what Minister is in power and no matter how sympathetic or fair-minded his officials may be.  It would be a good thing if the Act were amended in such a way as to remove that kind of grievance from the minds of road workers and others.</P>
    <P>Addressing the Minister through you, a Cheann Comhairle, is it not a fact that we all agree with the principle of providing pensions for certain types of employees of local authorities, no matter what local authority they served under?  I believe the local authority should be the model employer in any county but I know of industrial concerns <Col N="164" /> and small firms and individual employers who are treating their workers, when they retire at the end of their working life, in a far better and more generous way than any local authority I know of is treating its workers under the terms of the Superannuation Act of 1948.  I say the State should be the model employer in the country; I say the local authority should be the model employer in the county.  If we believe in pensions for workers at the end of their lifetime of service, whether it is in a local authority, a manufacturing concern or a private concern, let us try to be just and fair in the way in which we make provision for their pensions or retirement allowances.</P>
    <P>I think it is not unfair to ask the Minister to state whether&mdash;from the facts and figures at his finger tips, furnished to him by his official advisers &mdash;he believes that the Act of 1948 is being administered in accordance with the wishes of those responsible for its enactment?  If he believes it is, he is not going to move an inch.  He has facts and figures at his disposal, so I would ask him to give us, when replying, the percentage of applicants for pensions to the various local authorities who actually received those pensions.  Could he say what percentage of applicants was turned down when they appealed to the Department &mdash;how many had their appeals allowed and how many were rejected?  Deputy McGrath, the Lord Mayor of Cork, has quoted a case which I have heard discussed by some of my colleagues.  He has made a convincing case so far as that section of workers is concerned that there is room for the amendment of the Act.  If his statement is correct &mdash;and I assume it is&mdash;that the official advisers to the Minister were of opinion that the section of workers represented by the Lord Mayor of Cork were entitled to their pensions and if they did not get them, that is an indication.  One case is, therefore, quoted and is on record where the intentions of the members of the House have not been fully complied with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect of it.  We are not looking for something for nothing.  Those of us who subscribe to the principle of the 1948 Act&mdash;and that means all of us, I presume&mdash;believe in a contributory system of providing pensions.  I personally have always held very strong views on that over a long period.  Someone may point out, in reply to that kind of argument, that the civil servants are getting pensions for nothing.  Not at all; they get pensions and their contribution is by deferred pay&mdash;there is no doubt that when the salaries of civil servants are being fixed, no matter what Government is in office or who is responsible for fixing them, the question of the cost of providing these pensions is taken into consideration.  We are all in agreement on the question of a contributory pension scheme.  Therefore, we are not asking the Minister to provide something more for nothing. We are asking him to provide pensions for those who have given service with reasonable qualifications and for a long period.</P>
      <P>We now come to the amount of the contribution.  I was a member of a contributory superannuation scheme and I served for a number of years on an advisory body in connection with the administration of that scheme.  I am fully conversant with a number of solvent superannuation schemes of a contributory nature.  They are based on a contribution by the employer and a contribution by the worker.  The pension is based on the number of years' service and a gratuity is provided in some cases.  It may be interesting information to the Minister and his advisers to know that in no case I am aware of or had anything to do with was the contribution less than 4 per cent. or more than 6 per cent. of the salary or wage of the worker concerned.  To that extent, I agree with Deputy McGrath and everyone else who says that the contribution provided under the Superannuation Act of 1948 is excessive, when you take into consideration the small number of people who benefit by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that a solvent pension scheme can be established by a contribution <Col N="166" /> based on a reasonable percentage of the employee's wage or salary.  How is it we have no complaints&mdash;there is no justification for them, I suppose&mdash;in connection with the pensions paid to permanent officials of public bodies?  This question only arises in the case of the ordinary worker.</P>
    <P>There is a request contained in this motion by Deputies Dunne and Kyne. It asks the Minister when considering this whole matter and, when introducing amending legislation&mdash;as I hope he will&mdash;to take into consideration as part of the qualifying period the service that was given by road workers, say, in other spheres.  These are indicated in the terms of the motion.  No one knows better than the Minister that there is a sort of policy or understanding between members of certain county councils in certain parts of the country.  Deputy Cogan knows this, I am sure.  During the busy period, when agricultural labourers are badly needed by farmers for harvest work, there is an understanding that road workers would be laid off in order to make them available for work on the farms or in the bogs.  Why should that be used against them when they come to apply for pensions under any properly laid down pensions scheme?</P>
    <P>The road workers in Laois and Offaly, during the whole of the emergency period, were taken from ordinary road maintenance work and told to get into the bogs to provide fuel for the nation during that period. Why should they suffer for that?  They were transferred and directed to go from their normal work and work for Bord na Móna and for the community as a whole.  I submit that their working period on that kind of work should be credited to the employees of local authorities under any amending scheme which may be brought in to bring this Superannuation Act of 1948 into conformity with the reasonable wishes of the Minister and of the majority of the members of this House.</P>
    <P>There is no question of Party or of politics in this.  It is a question of justice.  I am sure that the Minister has at his disposal reliable information to convince him that the superannuation <Col N="167" /> scheme of 1948 has not worked out in the manner that was intended.  I may be pressing an open door and hope that I am.  I do not intend to say more, but I hope that the Minister will give an indication that he is prepared to bring in the necessary amending legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a good deal of what has been said by the other speakers in support of this motion.  I have the feeling, as a member of a county council familiar with this problem, that those Deputies who have spoken have not touched the kernel of it.  In dealing with established officers employed by the county councils, the matter is quite a simple one.  It is very easy for a man who has secured employment over a period and becomes an established officer, thereby to qualify for a pension.  In the matter of road workers you are dealing with a very big problem because road work is, and always has been, regarded as a source of employment for those who are casually or temporarily disemployed in agriculture, turf-production or sugar manufacture.</P>
      <P>For that reason the number of workers employed by the county councils increases and contracts from month to month and year to year.  Because of that, it is difficult for any county manager, or county council, accurately to estimate the number of men who can be put on a permanent established basis.  I think it is altogether wrong to put men on the register as established servants of the local authority if there is not a reasonable certainty of being able to give them permanent employment, and thus enable them to qualify for superannuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that if a man is employed by a county council on the roads, and if there is no certainty whatever that he will be able to secure the amount of employment that will qualify him to remain on the register, he should not be asked to make a contribution. It is right, as Deputy Davin has said, that a man who wishes to qualify for superannuation should pay a contribution towards his pension, but it is equally wrong that the man, for whom there is not a reasonable certainty of <Col N="168" /> permanent employment, should be asked to make a contribution.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think that the whole of the existing legislation should be reconsidered and revised and, if necessary, tightened up so that only those men for whom there is the prospect of permanent employment on the roads should be registered as established servants of the county council and be asked to make a contribution.  The law as it operates now is somewhat different. Men who, for example, may be engaged on constructional work for a year or two, or who may have worked a certain number of days, automatically qualify to go on the register, but when that happens&mdash;having become registered servants&mdash;the employment may not be there for them and their service lapses.</P>
    <P>I think the whole position should be reviewed.  Road work is a natural means of relieving temporary unemployment. It is available in every part of the country, and is, therefore, a means readily available to manual workers to secure temporary employment. I think, for that reason, that it is not right to endeavour to declare men established servants when you are not in a position to guarantee them permanent employment.  I know that this is a problem which has arisen in a number of counties, and that it is causing considerable difficulty.  Even in small counties, it is necessary to have at least two officials permanently employed keeping a check on the number of hours worked by men so as to ascertain whether they will become established servants or not, or, if they are established, whether they can retain their positions.  I think all that is wrong.  What we should have, perhaps, in every county is a hard core of permanent employees who would be registered established servants, and that any man who cannot be put into that position, because there is not a certainty of continual employment for him, should not be asked to make a contribution.  One of the difficulties about putting men on the established list is that a single man, perhaps, even by chance gets a place on the established list and so will have priority over a married man who is <Col N="169" /> seeking employment.  That very often causes a good deal of bitterness and discontent, but that would not arise if we had a position similar to that in the Civil Service.  If men were definitely selected as being good workers, and selected as permanent employees on the register as such, there would not then be any question of the number of hours worked or anything else.  They would be declared to be permanent employees, and the obligation would be on the county council, having taken them on as permanent employees, to give them permanent employment. Those who would not be on that list would receive employment as and when it became available.</P>
    <P>The whole matter requires revision and reconsideration.  Deputy Davin was quite right when he said there was a considerable amount of dissatisfaction, but it is true that county managers in the counties with which I am familiar, together with the officials and members of the local bodies, try to be as sympathetic as they can to the workers in the administration of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of this motion appear to be very reasonable. They are designed to remedy certain defects which have been discovered since the Superannuation Act of 1948 came into force.  In many of these cases, the defects which this motion seeks to remedy could not have been anticipated until that Act came into operation.  The Act was designed for a class of public servant who were not previously catered for and was a very progressive step, a step which was long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of road workers, in addition to the permanent staff, are required to contribute towards a pension fund when they come into the employment of a local authority.  They do not qualify to come under the superannuation scheme unless they have completed three years' full service. One point which affects County Dublin particularly is the fact that Dublin County Council was abolished and we had there a county commissioner. Some road workers who had very long periods of continuous service were dismissed because it was considered by <Col N="170" /> the commissioner that they were not fit to carry out the class of work they were required to do under the county council in connection with road repairs. Many of these men had far more than three years' continuous service. Many of them had between ten and 20 years' service before they were dismissed and the terms of the 1948 Act did not take such cases into consideration.</P>
    <P>It did not go back far enough to take in these men from the date on which they were dismissed, with the result that they were not entitled to the benefits of that Act.  Less than 20 men in Dublin County were affected in this respect, but these men have now reached an advanced age and for that reason any amendment of the Superannuation Act would be welcome and would only be fair to them, in view of the fact that they had been so long employed by Dublin County Council. I am not now referring to men who had only three years', or a little more, service.  I am referring to men who had in some cases more than ten years' service with the council.  I agree that the service of a number of men was broken during the emergency years by reason of the necessity for diverting them to various emergency services which left them in the position of not being able to qualify according to the terms of the Superannuation Act, and for that reason the motion is very desirable.</P>
    <P>It is a very reasonable motion and I hope the Minister will consider the introduction of suitable amendments to remedy the defects which have been discovered in the 1948 Act.  I must say that, in general, the defects have been very few but it is a small section of the community who are so badly hit, and that is why an amendment of the Superannuation Act should be carried out in order that justice be done to these people.  A very reasonable case has been made for an alteration in the subscription towards the superannuation scheme which is to be made by persons employed by these local authorities who would be qualified to benefit under the scheme, and I should like to see the Minister introducing amending legislation as soon as <Col N="171" /> possible to meet the purposes for which the motion is designed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>If anybody has a genuine case in respect of an amendment of the Bill, it is the employees of Cork Corporation.  The men contested it originally and went to the Circuit Court, where they won their case.  It was appealed to the High Court and they won their case in the High Court and those from whose wages deductions of so much per week had been made got a refund.  The matter was again brought before the courts in relation to a similar class of workmen and the same judge tried the case.  He could not but come to the same decision and it was then sought to have a case stated for the Supreme Court.  The men were beaten in the Supreme Court, but not by a unanimous decision, because two judges made a very important statement that the men were entitled to get the benefit of the Superannuation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason that they lost their case was that the Act sets out that there should be a register of permanent men kept and the city manager and his officials stated that they had no such register, but that they had a list of the permanent men.  To prove the justice of their case, ten years before, we had an argument as to who should be displaced when a question of redundancy of men arose and a list of the permannent men was made out by the city manager and his staff.  Professor Alfred O'Rahilly was brought in as arbitrator and each man's period of service was mentioned and it was agreed that all these men were on the permanent list.  Nobody was to come within the Act except those with three years' continuous service and not only had these men three years' service to their credit, but some had six and seven years' service, but their temporary period did not count.  There were men in the corporation and there still are, with 26, 30 and 33 years' service without a break.  Because of that technical point that the word &ldquo;register&rdquo; as against &ldquo;list&rdquo; was not used in the case of the permanent men a majority of the Supreme Court decided that <Col N="172" /> there should be a register as the law specified.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister that the Act should be amended in such a way that these men in the corporation service from three to 33 and 34 years could get the benefit because, after all, the 1948 Act was intended to serve the men who had been in the corporation's employment for all those years.  I hope that the Minister will agree to amend the Act.  His own Deputies from Cork, both the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy Lynch, and Deputy McGrath, have all the facts and know the merits of the case of the Cork Corporation employees.  I understood that the Minister had some headings for the amendment of this Act, and I do hope that the employees of the Cork Corporation for whom the Act was intended and many like them will benefit by the amendment of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had conveyed to the House, but maybe I am wrong, in reply to parliamentary questions dealing with certain aspects of this matter that it was the intention to introduce amending legislation.  If I have not made that announcement to the House I am doing so now; but the question naturally arises as to when that amending legislation will be ready and, of course, get its place here on a very congested Order Paper.  However, it has not reached the stage when we need consider that matter.  Having made that announcement, I suppose there is not very much point in my discussing some of the experiences that Deputies have had in the particular counties and local bodies since the coming into operation of the Superannuation Act of 1948.  If I say that I am about to, or thinking of, introducing such amending legislation, I do not want to convey that the proposals which I will submit to the House will be proposals meeting in their entirety all the recommendations that are contained in the three motions that we are now discussing.  As I said, it is scarcely necessary for me to go into the matter in detail, but I think I should at least make that statement so <Col N="173" /> as to leave no Deputy here under any misapprehension.</P>
      <P>There are certain matters mentioned in motion No. 6 that in our view should be dealt with.  One of the first would be that of dealing with those who failed to take advantage of the Act when introduced inside the period of six months.  I can quite see how a county council worker, not knowing how such an Act as that was going to operate, might be hesitant.  He might have a number of reasons in his mind for being hesitant about taking advantage of it, and I could produce dozens of arguments to show that he might allow the period of six months to elapse and he would then be late even though he might then be anxious to take advantage of the Act's provisions. That is one of the difficulties that we would, of course, propose to amend.</P>
      <P>Then you come to the question of the broken period and the cost.  Some of these motions make a recommendation or suggestion that employment of any kind&mdash;employment on farms, employment on special works, employment with semi-State organisations such as the E.S.B. and so on&mdash;should be reckoned for the purpose of entitlement to recognition and benefit.  While as I say there is no reason why we should have an argument or a prolonged discussion on a point like that I could say right off that there would be no possibility of my conceding such a demand as that.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the amount of the contribution to it, if it is to be a contributory scheme then there must be a contribution; and while I am not very conversant with schemes promoted by commercial concerns and outside organisations, as far as I know this scheme stands favourable comparison with anything that has been produced outside.  Deputy Davin suggested that the State and the local body in the area over which it has jurisdiction should be the outstanding employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that that standard can be readily accepted as far as a basis for this contributory scheme is concerned. However, as I say, these are all matters that can be dealt with when the proposals I have indicated are taking shape and will be introduced in this House.  I do not think there is any <Col N="174" /> need for me to say more.  As I say, when that time comes there will be ample opportunity for Deputies to express their views on what is provided in the amending legislation and what has not been provided for.  All I can say is that I am sorry I cannot say when I may be able to bring these proposals to the House.  It is not just as easy as some Deputies imagine to introduce a measure of this kind which dealt with a subject that was new. Some Deputies referred to the difficulties that confronted county councils and confronted those who were trying to break into a new field entirely and to provide under the 1948 Act for all the difficulties that undoubtedly arise when you invade such a territory as that.  It took a good deal of time to see what those difficulties were.  There would not be any point in coming forward with amending legislation if in a month's time another difficulty or two arose and you had to paddle back here with amending legislation.  When an Act is passed like that it takes a considerable period before the Department which is mainly responsible for keeping an eye on how it is working out can see all the snags, if any, which may arise in connection with it.  We have, we hope, seen quite a few of these and as I say I will try to get these proposals pushed ahead as speedily as I can.  I am not suggesting that they will meet everybody's point of view or that they will satisfy all the Deputies who have spoken and been responsible for these motions, but at least they will be introduced with the intention of making amendments where we have satisfied ourselves such amendments are necessary, and they will strengthen the whole code that, as Deputy Davin said, I suppose Deputies thought they were providing when they were supporting the 1948 Act when it was going through this House in the form of a Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister will do that.  There is this point I would like to mention with regard to the Act generally which has been in existence since 1948.  One might say it has been in operation in some counties at least for five years and such flaws as the Act contained have become apparent during that period.  I will not suggest that the introduction of a Bill of this kind is at any time an easy task, because I understand the Superannuation Act of 1948 represents the conglomeration of experience gained over a long period of years of superannuation legislation, and certain precedents established in other legislation enacted here and, I think, in the British Parliament, had necessarily to be taken into account.  The net result is that we are left in the extraordinary situation of having law agents in the different counties taking diametrically opposite views on particular issues. That is confusing enough for the ordinary lay member of this House who has only a nodding acquaintance with the law, but it is doubly confusing to the ordinary county councillor who comes up against this kind of legislation for the first time in the performance of his duties as a county councillor.  Imagine the predicament of the road worker who has not a clue as to what it is all about but believes he has certain entitlements and discovers, according to those who are deemed to be qualified to interpret these matters, that he has no such entitlements at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have set out in our motion certain matters that we consider of prime importance.  The Minister has dealt with the first point, that of late application by a person who might <Col N="176" /> benefit, as one which can be provided for in future legislation.  Perhaps the most important point is the amount of the contribution.  Undoubtedly there must be some contribution.  The average wage of the county council road worker is in the neighbourhood of £4 per week and, calculating at the rate of 10d. in the £, we find the road worker is expected to contribute 3/4 per week from his already meagre wages for the very doubtful benefits conferred on him by this Act.  All sorts of complications have arisen in the administration of this Act in those counties in which it has been adopted by resolution.  There have been cases of gross injustice.  Nobody suggests that these injustices are deliberately inflicted on the parties concerned by the official interpretation.  I myself have come across cases.  Road workers believe they are qualified in every respect for pension but when they cease to be employed by the county council they discover they are not beneficiaries under the Act.  There is the case of a man who may be employed over a period of 30 to 40 years but he may not have the requisite 200 days in each year.  His position is rendered impossible because of the interpretation the particular law agent puts on the Act.  In other counties a man in a similar position will be treated in an entirely dissimilar fashion and he will be given the full benefit of the Act on the advice of the law agent in those counties.  This is not a matter that concerns only the Cork Corporation or the Dublin Corporation.  If I may be permitted to localise&mdash;this may be outside my province but representatives from Cork City have referred to their particular local problem&mdash;in Dublin City we have a group of people who have been or are about to be pensioned by the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>In the 1920's certain functions of the Dublin Corporation, such as the cleaning of the streets, were carried out by a firm of French contractors.  The employees to whom I refer were employed during that time by this particular firm, though they were normally employees of the corporation more or less seconded for these duties.  They reverted to their former employment <Col N="177" /> on the departure of this firm but they have been denied credit for their service during the period in which they were in the employment of that firm.  That is obviously an injustice to those particular workers and it is one that should be remedied.  I am sure when legislation is introduced that position will be rectified.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I am informed that many employees are dissatisfied with a particular aspect of this Act; it is not specifically adverted to in our motion but it is one to which the Minister might give some consideration.  Local authorities when computing pension do so on the basis of the average earnings of the individual concerned for the last three years of his employment.  That is harmful in some cases because it has happened in recent years that for a considerable period local authorities did not increase the salaries or wages of their employees, and a decision was then taken to grant an increase.  Where a servant of the local authority is now pensioned off following a year during which an increase has been granted he is at a disadvantage because, if his pension is to be based on his average earnings for the last three years, he will have two years calculated on comparatively low earnings plus one year of relatively high earnings.  That does not seem to be an equitable approach to the matter.  Is there any reason why the average earnings should not be based on the last year of service?  Why is this three year period taken?  There does not seem to be any good reason why it should be taken, other than perhaps the question of precedent. Precedent may be sacred in the Civil Service.  It should not be sacred in the Parliament of the nation.  We have to set new precedents for ourselves.</P>
    <P>I consider that this is a very urgent matter.  It is not one for which we can wait too long for a solution.  As I indicated, it is something that affects not only the Dublin Corporation or the Cork Corporation employees but about 15,000 road workers throughout the length and breadth of the country. Many road workers who have had considerable service with county councils are prevented from availing of the provisions of the Act by reason of the high contribution.  Others are absolutely <Col N="178" /> at a loss to understand just what their entitlement would be if they were to avail of the Act.  I have heard county councillors discussing the Act even at meetings of councils and they betrayed, as all of us do who have had anything to do with this Act, the confusion of mind that exists generally in regard to it.  In some counties it is considered that only permanent men. 12 monthly employees, should come under the Act or could come under the Act.  That is not so.  Under the terms of the Act, it is conceivable that a worker employed purely on a casual basis could possibly come within the scope of the Act provided he has 200 days employment in each year.  But many councils do not accept that. Some councils, not many, have indicated to employees that only permanent workers are entitled to become pensionable servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be 200 days in each year.  If there is a break of ten, 12, or 20 days in the employment in one particular year so that the 200 days days are not completed by the worker some people say that that means a break in his employment.  There again we come up against the fact that the legal advisers of some councils say that even with that the worker is still entitled to the benefit of the Act.  Others say the reverse.  It is not at all satisfactory that we should have that confusion of mind amongst the legal men who are paid by the councils to advise them.  We all know that county councils are bound to take the advice of those they employ to make a study of these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall discussing this question together with some of my colleagues in the Labour Party with the Minister's predecessor and with the late Mr. T.J. Murphy when he was Minister for Local Government.  Both Deputy Keyes, when Minister, and the late Mr. Murphy were men with experience of service in local authorities who had considerable acquaintance with the problem and appreciated the difficulties in connection with it.  I would prefer that the Minister would give an assurance, as I am sure he can, that legislation will be introduced amending <Col N="179" /> this Act along the lines which he himself, of course, will consider from his own point of view, and I am quite sure that we will take issue with him in regard to some aspects of the legislation which he has in mind.  He has already indicated that he cannot meet us fully in connection with the matter.  I ask him to give an assurance at least that before this Dáil comes to an end, whenever that may be, whether it be immediately after the by-elections or next year, he will introduce a Bill so that the first definite step will be taken to have this position, which is so vexing to everybody and which creates so many problems for everybody, rectified.  I feel that the Minister is as anxious as anybody to do that.  I am sure he is, if for no other reason than that in his own county I dare say there are within the ranks of his own Party a sufficient number of misguided road workers to exercise some degree of pressure in regard to this matter.</P>

I am sure the Minister will find a very hefty file in his office.  There must be a very hefty file going back almost to 1948 in regard to the very varied interpretations that have been given of the different aspects of this Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the matter referred to in the second part of our motion with regard to county council employees who were directed to work on farm work, minor relief schemes, Land Commission schemes, drainage committee schemes, or, in some areas, for the E.S.B. on the rural electrification scheme.  There is a definite case established that the disemployment of these workers came about because the county councils desired to make labour available for these schemes.  The period of disemployment with the councils during which they were working for these other bodies should be counted for pensionable purposes.  I believe that if the Minister looks carefully into the matter he will find that, as a general rule, workers are not anxious to leave the employment of county councils.  But, during the war, labour was somewhat scarce in the rural areas because of the fact that we were exporting it in bulk to Great Britain.</P>
