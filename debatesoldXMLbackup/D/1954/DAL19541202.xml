      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="1460" /> Industry and Commerce if he will state whether the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards have submitted a final report to him regarding the possible industrial uses of kelp and seaweed, and, if so, what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <P>Investigations into the possible industrial uses of kelp and seaweed were undertaken by the Industrial Research Council, and subsequently by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, and the question of publishing a comprehensive report of these researches has been under consideration by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. Summaries of the results obtained from the programme of research in regard to the industrial application of kelp and seaweed have been published in the annual reports of the Industrial Research Council for the years 1934-1946, while references to subsequent research work are contained in the annual reports of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  In the circumstances, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards have not felt it necessary to publish a separate comprehensive report of the investigations.  The Industrial Development Authority is keeping under constant review the question of utilising seaweed and its derivatives for industrial purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that petrol companies charge a higher rate for petrol in the southern counties than in Dublin, and, if so, if he will investigate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The differential of 1d. per gallon between the price of petrol in the Dublin zone and in other areas is in accordance with a long-standing trade custom and is based on the fact that distribution costs in the Dublin zone are lower than in other parts of the country.  The matter is at present under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct to say that supplies of petrol to the South coming in through the Shannon would work out to a large extent at a much lesser cost than by the present method of transporting it to the South?  Is it correct to state, as I have been informed in the past, that, due to a certain amount of industrial alcohol being used as an admixture in Dublin, the petrol here is maintained at a lower price than that in the South?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state what proposals have been put forward by C.I.E. for the manufacture, in this country, of component parts and equipment for diesel rail cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received proposals from C.I.E. for the manufacture of component parts and equipment for diesel rail cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is widespread concern in the railway workshops because C.I.E. is importing parts for rail cars which could be readily manufactured in the C.I.E. engineering shops and that if the present course is pursued the heavy engineering parts necessary will not be available not only to C.I.E. but to others concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This fact has been brought to the notice of C.I.E. and I have no doubt the company is giving it the necessary consideration.  What I was asked in the question was what proposals C.I.E. had for the manufacture of component parts and my answer to that was that I had not received any proposal yet.  It may, of course, come along later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not know the difference between a chassis and a rail car.  Is the reason why the Minister has not received a reply from C.I.E. that they have not yet formulated a proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far C.I.E. have submitted no proposals on the matter.  It may well be they intend to do so and if these parts can be manufactured in their Inchicore works I would personally urge the company to have them manufactured there.  So far, however, I have no information on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that there is considerable public dissatisfaction in regard to the quality of the tea now on sale, and, if so, if he will state the reasons for this deterioration in quality, and what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received no complaints in regard to the quality of tea now on sale and, therefore, the other parts of the Deputy's question do not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister making inquiries which would no doubt satisfy him that at least twice the amount of tea must now be used by the housewives to make the same brew as heretofore? It seems that the tea drinking community are getting the offsweep for quite a long time and this means a 100 per cent. increase in the price of tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained that I <Col N="1464" /> have received no complaints regarding the quality of tea at present in use.  A similar question was put to my predecessor, Deputy Lemass, on the subject in December last and his answer was precisely the same&mdash;that he had up to that period received no complaints. The position is the same up to the moment and it is the same class of tea that we have been using between then and now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that recently the initial cost of the tea delivered on quota to each blender was kept untouched by the device of increasing considerably the proportion of low grade tea and eliminating the good grade tea and is not this the reason as everybody but the Minister, apparently, has heard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that statement is incorrect.  It is not true to say that there is any particular emphasis on low grade tea.  The tea ordered by the wholesaler is delivered by the wholesaler and as I explained to Deputy Davern I have had no complaints at all in the Department of Industry and Commerce any more than Deputy Lemass had up to last December.</P>

I am not in a position to state when development of the area is likely to take place as its prospects of being selected for development will depend on how its returns compare with those of other areas still awaiting development in the board's Galway district.</P>

    <P>My Department has not yet been furnished with documentary evidence of title to the site for either of these proposed new schools.  In so far as my Department is concerned every effort <Col N="1467" /> is being made to have the matter expedited.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the urgency of the need for the schools, and as I informed the Deputy in reply to his previous question on the 7th July, 1954, a grant towards the cost of the erection of each of the schools will be sanctioned by my Department when satisfactory evidence of title to the site has been received from the manager's solicitors.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state, in respect of the financial year ended 31st March, 1954, the total amount allocated by his Department for (a) primary education, (b) technical education, (c) secondary education, and (d) university education; further, if he will state the average sum spent by his Department on the education of a student undergoing full-time instruction in each category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The following are the amounts expended by my Department in the financial year ended the 31st March, 1954, in respect of (a) primary education: £8,091,530, (b) technical education: £928,388 and (c) secondary education: £1,420,875.  Grants in respect of university education are a charge on the Vote for Universities and Colleges which is accounted for by the Minister for Finance.  The amount provided in that Vote for the financial year in question was £791,384.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, on the basis of the average attendance of the pupils 1952-53 and of the sum already mentioned by me for primary education plus the amount of £1,071,053 expended on the building of schools which is met out of the Vote for Public Works and Buildings the average sum spent on the education of a primary school pupil was £22 16s. 6d.  Similarly, the average sum spent on a secondary school pupil related to the number of recognised pupils in attendance and the expenditure stated was £28 19s. 7d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the variety of factors which would have to be taken into account and the impossibility of assessing the <Col N="1468" /> incidence of these factors in endeavouring to apportion expenditure as between full-time and part-time pupils in technical schools, I regret I cannot furnish the information which the Deputy has requested in regard to the average sum spent on pupils receiving full-time technical education.</P>
    <P>Owing to the fact that similar and other difficulties arise in relation to university education it is likewise not possible to state the average sum spent on full-time students in the universities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister will agree that the emphasis is on higher education and that less money per head is being spent on primary school children, who are in the majority in this country, and is he not alarmed at that situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear of the import of the particular average the Deputy is looking for and I certainly have not sufficient basis here to make any opinions such as the Deputy suggests.  I do, however, suggest to the Deputy that there are certain matters, when he has taken on an examination of this kind, that he might wish to pursue and that he will find in the Appropriation Accounts, which are published about 15 months after the end of the appropriate year, and in the Estimates.  In a recently published publication, <i>University Statistics</i>, he will find an unlimited amount of material for arithmetical calculations of an interesting kind.  I leave him to these documents for the present.  I will be glad to assist him in any of his studies in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of proposed sale of an unvested allotment each case has to be dealt with on its own merits and if the Deputy has in mind any such case or cases he might instruct the person proposing to sell to apply to the Land Commission for permission to sell, which is the usual course.  A general permission to sell in all such cases would almost certainly defeat the purpose of the Land Commission in making such allotments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowe" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I know different cases in my own county where small farmers have bought small portions of land, we will say three acres, from a cottier and it is left unattended to for the past five years.  I know one instance where the land was in conacre for the past four years.</P>

      <P>It may be useful to inform the Deputy and other Deputies who may know similar cases that in <Col N="1472" /> the case of unvested allotments it should be realised that the land is still the property of the Land Commission and the person using it has not the right to sell it without the consent of the Land Commission.  Those purchasing such allotments might walk into difficulties if they do not first inquire if the person owns the land.  I think it would be useful if this statement of mine got publicity so that people who have in mind to purchase such allotments from cottiers and others would not find themselves in the position that they would perhaps pay portion of the purchase money for the land and then find that the Land Commission would not give their consent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will request the Land Commission to carry out immediately a resettlement of the holdings in the Gortnatraw district of Carrowkeel, County Donegal, particularly as one holding, essential to any resettlement <Col N="1473" /> programme in the area, has recently been offered for sale by public auction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission fully appreciate the desirability of carrying out rearrangement in Gortnatraw South and are having inquiries made regarding a certain holding which, I presume, is the one the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, a fortnight ago, I sent the Land Commission details of this proposed sale and in the last week, again, nothing having been done, I rang up the Land Commission and I was then told they were making preliminary investigations?  Is it not true that about ten years ago preliminary investigations were made to the satisfaction of the Land Commission who went to make a voluntary purchase of this same holding?  Why is it necessary now to allow this farm to be sold, as it has been sold, while there is this congestion in the district and a rundale system operating which has caused untold trouble over the years and of which the Land Commission is very well aware?  Is this their policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The determination of the particular land to be acquired is a matter entirely at the discretion of the Land Commission and, while I have no doubt that what the Deputy said about the locality is true, while the law remains as it is, the question of whether the commissioners will acquire or purchase any particular holding or estate is one for their own discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister is it not so that the Land Commission in the ordinary run of things carry out the policy of the Government in office? Is that not really their function, to carry out, within the framework of the laws of the land, the policy of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite correct but, if the Deputy is trying to insinuate that the policy of the Government is not to relieve congestion, he is making a complete misstatement.  The policy of the present Government is to relieve congestion and to press the <Col N="1474" /> Land Commission to do so to the utmost extent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>But even the Government cannot give the Land Commission a direction to take up any particular holding or farm.  The Deputy is long enough in the House to know that.  If he does not know it, he should know it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want from the Minister is this.  It is asking a lot in respect of a very small holding but, knowing that he will have the interest of the relief of congestion at heart, I would ask him in this instance to urgently act in this matter and try to see whether or not the Land Commission are in fact using the powers that are at their disposal for the relief of congestion.  My own opinion is that they are not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just short of 100 men employed at the South Kerry forests at present and the number is slightly higher than at this time last year.  There is no development in prospect which would warrant any large-scale increase in employment but the number employed in forestry in South Kerry and elsewhere will rise with the planned expansion of afforestation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The commencement of forestry operations on any new area depends almost entirely on the outcome of acquisition proceedings and it would not be practicable at this stage to say what new areas will come into the possession of my Department between now and next December.  As an indication of the probable development in County Donegal, I have had a table prepared showing the offers of land totalling 991 acres on which price agreement has been reached and title clearance is in progress.  With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I will have this list circulated with the Report.</P>
      <P>There are further offers totalling 2,325 acres in the negotiations stage and it is possible that some of these areas may also be acquired before the end of 1955.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the playing of pongo is contrary to the Gaming Acts.  For some time, however, the police, acting on the instructions of my predecessor, have not taken proceedings against promoters for gaming of a minor nature where each stake does not exceed 6d. and where children are not allowed to participate.  As a result of recent complaints that games of pongo, etc., were being operated, particularly in Dublin, on a wide scale, I gave instructions to the police that the toleration extended to minor games hitherto should cease.  Later, however, having received representations on behalf of the Irish Showmen's Guild and the Irish Amusement Caterers' Association that the police notice to them of one week was short, that an immediate close down would cause unemployment and, furthermore, in consideration of guarantees received from the guild and the association not to continue to operate contrary to the Gaming Acts after 31st December, I directed the police to continue in their former attitude up to that date.</P>

(b) The Six Counties, Great Britain and Germany.  (c) The total amount exported from 17th July to 31st October (latest date for which statistics are available) was 21,215 cwt. practically all of which was exported by the Butter Marketing Committee. (d) My Department has no information as to the prices obtained by creameries for butter exported by them.  The prices obtained by the Butter Marketing Committee for its butter exports to date ranged between 365/- and 376/- per cwt. for bulk butter and between 379/- and 395/- per cwt. for butter made up in rolls.</P>

As to the second part of the question, the cost to the Vote of subsidy on the butter exported during this period was £52,207 2s. 4d., in addition to which the Butter Marketing Committee has incurred a deficit estimated at £31,530 which will fall due for recoupment either from my Department's Vote or from the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to proposals under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The initiation of proposals under that Act is a matter for each local authority concerned. There are no proposals before my Department in relation to either of these two rivers in connection with grants available for works under the Act.  I understand that officers of the county councils concerned inspected the River Duff in 1953 and came to the conclusion that any effective drainage work on it would be of arterial dimensions. Work on that scale would be outside the scope of the schemes dealt with by local authorities under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion on the Order Paper standing in the names of a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann disapproves of the price fixed for next year's wheat crop and asks for its immediate reconsideration.</P>
      <P>As is plain to everybody, the motion is phrased in moderate terms and there is no need for a heated discussion.  The problem is too serious for the agricultural community, for either heated argument or flippancy.  They are in no mood at present for flippancy or side-stepping.  It is a serious motion with a serious object in view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question that comes to my mind, as a result of the price fixed by the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;and, I am sure, approved by the Government &mdash;is what really is the attitude of the Government towards wheat production in this country.  That is the question that everybody is asking and they want to know if the price is a reflection of the attitude and of future policy.  Does it mean that wheat growing is not so important to our national economy or national security, that it is something that is going to be discarded or at least very, very seriously curtailed? If that is the case, I think this Dáil would be well advised to deal with <Col N="1493" /> this matter and this motion very seriously.</P>
    <P>It was the Fianna Fáil Government in 1932 who introduced and encouraged wheat growing.  It was one of the primary aims of their policy.  They believed that it should be the primary aim of the national policy of any Government in this country, because it was a national necessity and a national safeguard.  It was quite clear at that time&mdash;having, as was then the case, only 21,000 acres of wheat in the country&mdash;that if that state of affairs were allowed to continue this country would be in a very vulnerable position. We all know that the world has changed very considerably in the past 30 or 35 years, that it has become very contracted, that it has become very small and that the weapons of destruction have been very much improved. We were all out for the production of wheat and the wisdom of that policy was very clearly demonstrated here during the years of the emergency.</P>
    <P>The reduction that has been made in the price of wheat is 12/6 per barrel. If the Government wish to indicate that they desire a reduction, I hold that this steep reduction is altogether unwarranted&mdash;particularly in view of the fact that we have just experienced the worst harvest in living memory.  In my opinion, the agricultural community deserve better of the Minister and the Government than a sweeping reduction of this kind.</P>
    <P>I would like to know did the Minister consult agricultural organisations? Did he discuss with them the position, before fixing the price?  I would even like to ask him did he discuss it with the farmer members of the Fine Gael Party?  I am sure, if he did, that it was not they or the agricultural organisations throughout the country, who advised him to make this cut in price, in any case to make it to the extent he did.  I can understand, of course, that as Minister for Agriculture, he has a fairly difficult position in the Cabinet, because he has very few farmers to support him there. The percentage is very small but, nevertheless, there are quite a number of farmer-Deputies in the Fine Gael <Col N="1494" /> Party, many of whom, I am sure, have embarked on the growing of wheat.  I find it very hard to believe that any one of them would admit to the Minister, or agree with him, that the farmers have made the huge profit out of wheat growing that some people suggest.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the price of wheat at 12/6 per barrel means, on an average of eight barrels to the statute acre, a very sweeping reduction; it means a reduction of £5 per statute acre in the farmer's income.  With that, we have to consider what decrease there has been, or is likely to be, in the farmer's outlay.  The one, in my opinion, should be related to the other, but £5 is not the reduction in full; it is not the only decrease in his income, because there are many other things that have to be taken into consideration. As I said, there has been no decrease in his outlay; rates are high, and are likely to continue so, if not further increased, in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I met a number of merchants dealing in fertilisers, who told me it is likely that superphosphate will be increased by at least 10/- per ton, and that sulphate of ammonia would go up by £3 per ton.  All that has to be taken into consideration, and should be considered by the Minister when fixing prices.  I am sure that the Government had information to enable them to know as much about the position as any of the merchants, or manure manufacturers, in this country. In addition to that, the farmers have to pay, and rightly so, a fixed agricultural wage, in which there is not likely to be a diminution&mdash;indeed I would be sorry to see such a diminution.  On top of that, there is the weekly half-holiday, and the annual week's holiday, but the farmers get no relief in respect of that.  In my opinion, all these things should have been taken into consideration and a price fixed which would be an encouragement to the farmers to continue the growing of wheat, which is, as I have said, a national necessity, the foundation of national self-security.</P>
    <P>I hope that national self-security is not going to be undermined, that this <Col N="1495" /> whole question of price will be reconsidered by the Government, and that an improvement will be brought about. Anybody perhaps is liable to make a mistake, but it is not easy to excuse a Government for coming to a rash decision, particularly on an important matter like this.  In addition, the price fixed has been fixed on a periodical gradient basis, and the periods that have been taken are very strange.  We have from August to November, including November, of course, for the £3 10s. price per barrel on a 63 bushel-weight content.  We know that a 63 bushel-weight content, and over, is a very superior wheat, and that the percentage of farmers who have got that, even in past seasons, is very small indeed.</P>
    <P>What was the idea of stretching it to November?  Is it intended as a curb on the use of the combine harvester? Does the Minister and the Government wish to eliminate the combine harvester?  If that is so, it is very inconsistent with pronouncements made by the Minister in this House, when on occasion he urged mechanisation of the most modern type, and, in fact, on one occasion, he sarcastically referred to the horse with the bush tied to his tail.  A number of people have come to use the combine harvester, and I believe it was very necessary to do so in order to harvest their crops at the proper time.  But if that is not so, or if there is some reason to give relief to the millers in the taking in of the wheat, does the Minister seriously contend that an increase of 2/6 per barrel is sufficient remuneration to the people who hold on to their wheat?</P>
    <P>The Minister knows quite well that, compared with other crops, dried wheat, in good condition, has a much greater wastage than any other cereal we know.  Dried wheat is almost like shot wheat, and the simplest tear in a sack will allow a stone of it to be scattered about, before one would realise it.  The Minister also knows very well that rats and mice are very attracted to it, and that, unless one has an almost air-tight compartment, they will be able to get there, and take <Col N="1496" /> away a considerable amount and destroy a considerable amount.  There are many other ways.  I could understand if the Minister had fixed the first period from August to, say, the end of October when at least 50 per cent. of the grain is delivered at the mills but I cannot understand why he stretched it out to November and then brought in December when, I think he will ascertain from the statistical returns in his own Department, a much smaller percentage of wheat is delivered.</P>
    <P>We come on to January and we find that an additional half-crown is being given from January to July.  The percentage of wheat not delivered at the mills after the month of January and from the period of January to July is negligible.  A certain amount of wheat, of course, is held over by seedsmen for wheat and a certain amount of it is held over by the farmers themselves, but of the total amount of wheat produced in the previous season of the previous year, the amount that is held over to be delivered to the mills after that period is not 2 per cent. of the entire crop.  The extra half-crown bringing the price for top-grade seed wheat to £3 15s. is not by any means a sufficient inducement to any farmer to hold it over for that period.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Government have agreed that the farmer's profit from wheat is too high?  Will that be one of the reasons advanced?  When they take profit into consideration what profit do they go on, is it gross profit or is it net profit?  If the farmer's profit has been gone into on the net basis, despite all we hear to the contrary about the fine time they have, that they are pampered and living in luxury, I can tell the Deputies here, the Minister and the Government that the net profit is very small and has always been very small. If we look up the returns of those who are given a secondary education or even a university education in this country we will find that although the farmer in my opinion has as much natural love and affection for his children as the parents of any other section of the community, the number of children of the farming community in proportion to the population and to the number <Col N="1497" /> of farmers will not compare at all with that of the children of those in the professional classes or in salaried occupations. That is a criterion that goes to prove that despite all we hear about the huge profits the farmers are making it is not at all the case.</P>
    <P>Has this reduction in price been decided upon in order to curtail what has been described as the speculator or the rancher?  As far as speculators are concerned this is a free country and the person who so desires can speculate on anything and I do not think there is any written law to hinder that.  When we come to this question of the rancher, in addition to being a rancher either as a grass farmer, a wheat farmer or anything else, you must have the land; you must have an area of land whereby you can be described as a rancher.  The number of people who speculated is a very small percentage of those who went in for wheat production last year, and the number of ranchers is also very small.  It may be stated that we have foreigners, and so on, coming in and taking over land, going in for ranching and cashing in on it, then after a few years when the land is impoverished they will clear out.  It is news to me to know that there is this great pool of land in the counties adjoining Dublin or anywhere in the Midlands that can truly be described as ranches.  The speculators had to get the land on a letting basis from whoever had that large amount of land. As regards the rancher, if he is that type of person known as the gentleman farmer and who would rather let his land or lease it for a purpose of that kind, I would like to know where we will find so many of them even in Counties Meath, Louth, Kildare, Carlow, or any of the other places.  If there are many such, as I stated here on a previous occasion, there is a very sure way of dealing with them and the Minister and his Government might direct the attention of the Irish Land Commission to such people.  That would end for all time this question of ranching either as grass farmers or as wheat farmers.</P>
    <P>The people I am most concerned about are the small and mediumsized farmers and they are the people <Col N="1498" /> who are being hardest hit.  As I mentioned a few minutes ago, the reduction in price means £5 per acre.  Take the farmer of £20 valuation and up to £30 who has three acres of wheat. That means that there is £15, if he was sowing three acres, taken away with one stroke of the pen.  After all the hardship that he has endured during the present harvest, as is well known to the Minister and to the Government, £15 is £15 and it is not easy to pick it up on the road or anywhere else.  It means a considerable amount to the farmer when he is faced with his rate demand notes, with bills for manures and for all the other requirements of his household.  The cost of living that we heard so much about, and in which there were to be such sweeping reductions&mdash;which have not been brought about&mdash;affects the farmers very considerably as well as any other section of the community. They have to purchase provisions that they are not able to produce on their own land and there is no reduction there: there is no reduction on anything.</P>
    <P>This decision by the Government will have a very detrimental effect on our whole agricultural economy.  Farmers have gone wholeheartedly into debt to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for the purchase of modern machinery. They have gone out to expand their economy as far as agriculture is concerned in many other ways and is this what they are going to get now for their risks and endeavours and efforts to bring to full fruition the policy of Sinn Féin?  &mdash;for that is what it is: that is what the policy of wheat-growing means, i.e., self-sufficiency up to a reasonable standard.  That was the gospel we were brought up on, anyhow, and we believe it is the true gospel for the welfare of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of talk about the people who went into wheat-growing last year because the price was so generous and so high&mdash;that it was because of that that they went into it on such a large scale.  I happened to meet a member of the Oireachtas in the restaurant in November of 1953. I may say that he is not a member of <Col N="1499" /> the Fianna Fáil Party: he is a very prominent member and supporter of the Fine Gael Party.  He is also a very big man in business and in the livestock trade.  I had a bit of a joke with him and I just said to him: &ldquo;Was it because of your defeat in the by-election in August that you did not come down to the Ballinasloe October Fair?&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;It is no such thing.  I am not going to buy any live stock at all this year.  I have been across in England and I have contacts there with people who are in the livestock trade.  The opinion they expressed to me was that cattle bought now this year will lose 40 per cent. next October.&rdquo;  Then he said: &ldquo;I am conveying that information to your Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;  That was the impression that was created.  There was a guaranteed price for wheat and many of the people who went into the growing of wheat did not even think that that price was good enough.  I recollect a resolution that was before the Fine Gael Árd Fheis asking for £5 per barrel as the fixed price for wheat, as the price that was fixed by the then Minister for Agriculture was not considered at all sufficient.  That was why a great many people, in order to utilise their land and in order to neutralise the effect of the decrease in live-stock prices, as they imagined and believed, went in for wheat-growing to the extent they did in this year of 1954.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the time of the House.  I know there are a number of other speakers from all sides of the House who are anxious to express their opinions on this question. I regret the Minister's failure to protect the interests of the agricultural community within the Cabinet.  I understand his difficulty.  After all, as I mentioned, it is a Cabinet of professional gentlemen and salaried people&mdash;almost 80 per cent.&mdash;and it is not so easy for him, perhaps, to carry his point there.  If this motion is supported by the farmer Deputies on the Fine Gael benches and in Clann na Talmhan&mdash;as I think they should support it, without Party prejudices entering into it&mdash;and if it is carried in <Col N="1500" /> this House, then I believe the Minister's hand will be strengthened in going back to his Cabinet and asking to have this whole question reconsidered. In doing that, he will be doing something that will give encouragement to the people.  It will raise hope in the hearts and minds of the people who believed that this policy of wheat production in this country was accepted by the present Government and that it would be understood as being the proper policy for every future Government&mdash;because that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>There would be very little use in raising an Army here, no matter how powerful we might have it, if we did not have the staple food for our people produced from our own land.  Every country in Europe at the present time which is in a position to do is giving higher prices and greater subsidies for the growing of wheat.  Why are they doing it?  They are doing it because they know it is necessary from a national self-security point of view, If we are to travel away from wheat and go back to the old position, where have we the guarantee in the world of to-day that, like from 1939 to 1945, we will not become isolated once again, with all the waters around our shores infested, if you like, with submarines and other implements of destruction? That is a point that not merely the agricultural community have to consider but which the general community have to consider as well.  It is something that the Labour people should also take into consideration and, in addition to that, the Labour people should take into consideration the fact that a great deal of employment was created in the flour mills all over the country.  Is that now going to be thrown to the winds?  Is that now going to be no good?  Is that the way the farmers are going to be treated? The farmers are paying their share for the protection that has been afforded to the industrialists and manufacturers of this country&mdash;and why should they not do so?  In the same way, the rest of the community should not complain about paying our farmers a fair price for their wheat&mdash; a price that will encourage them to <Col N="1501" /> continue in the production of the food that is of the greatest value to all the people.  I ask the Dáil to take this motion very seriously and to discuss it, as it should be discussed, on its merits and to give to it a majority which will enable the Minister to make a strong case to the Government for reconsideration of this whole matter.</P>

      <P>I wish to second this motion.  When I mentioned here a little over a week ago that the farmers were stunned and staggered as a result of the blow that had been struck them by the Government I was correctly anticipating what we now know to be the fact from the protest meetings which have been held in every grain-growing county.  Obviously, very scant sympathy was given by the Minister and his Government to the hardships suffered by the grain growers during one of the worst harvest years in living memory.  Very few grain growers expected after the herculean task in which they had engaged that the reward of the Government would have been to strike at them by cutting the price of wheat, at a very minimum, by something between 15 and 16 per cent. The Minister yesterday in reply to a question put by me informed the House that last year, which could be regarded as a normal harvest year, 18 per cent. qualified for the peak price and something like 48 per cent. for the next price carrying a reduction of 2/6 per barrel.  Therefore, in examining this price we cannot approach it from the angle of a maximum price of 70/-per barrel.  We have to assume, conditions being what they are, that very many farmers in the grain-growing areas will get substantially less than the maximum price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago farmers began to question what the approach of the Government was.  After to-day I think they will seriously question the matter further since we have one section of the community assailed in a very important commodity with a very big proportion of their incomes severely slashed, while at the same time we have another comfortable, smug, well-cared-for section receiving consideration from the Government by the <Col N="1502" /> implementation of a very substantial increase.</P>
    <P>These are the questions which will be posed by farmers throughout the country.  A few weeks ago we had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy O'Donovan, going into a built-up area and loudly boasting that the ill-gotten gains which had been wrung from the farmers by another section of the community were being passed on to the consumer.  He went further and promised another slashing for the unfortunate producer. Thanks to Providence, those promises were short-lived.  Time and time again, the present Minister for Agriculture, having left office, expressed his worries and misgivings about his successor, Deputy Walsh.  Over and over again I have heard him repeating to different audiences in my own constituency that, psycho-physically, he thought that Deputy Walsh was a very timorous and weak man.  We are now in a position to measure one Minister against his former colleague.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to visualise the Cabinet meeting which fixed last year's price.  We can see there Deputy Walsh &mdash;this timorous little man&mdash;fighting as a farm producer, fighting a Cabinet in which I have no doubt there was a very pinched and penurious Minister for Finance; we can see him fighting interests in that Cabinet which were purely non-agricultural, interests one would expect to exert the kind of influence one would expect from their political background.  Yet, we had Deputy Walsh, as Minister for Agriculture, offering, after a normal year, a price of 82/6 per barrel.  At least he can claim the credit that he wrung from his Government that price of 82/6 per barrel for wheat.</P>

My <Col N="1503" /> constituency is a constituency largely made up of small farmers, mixed farmers.  In the area in which I live there is one of the largest creameries in the country and the average farm there, reckoned by the number of dairy cows, is a nine-cow holding.  The Minister went down there and he promised gooseberries for Christmas to the small farmers.</P>
      <P>All over the country, particularly in County Kilkenny, we had the Minister saying: &ldquo;Let the farmers of Ireland travel with me along the inter-Party road for the next five years and I promise I will dazzle them with prosperity.&rdquo;  To-day the small farmers are discouraged and disillusioned.  But there is one difference: on that particular occasion the Minister was the crowing cock of the Fine Gael Party. To-day he sits on the benches opposite, the plucked rooster of the inter-Party Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture has of late made much play by calling in representative groups of farmers, in particular the representatives of Macra na Feirme.  I am sure the Minister is aware that within that group there is a grain committee.  I wonder did he call in that committee? Did he consult with them?  Did he try to get agreement from them before he slashed the price of wheat?  That is a question I would like the Minister to answer when he comes to reply. Again, both in this House and outside it we have seen the Minister sweat foam and froth many a time because of the price of fertilisers.  He yelled across the floor at me: Did I agree that a 20 per cent. tax on fertilisers and phosphates when imported by collective groups of farmers was a fair price?</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon.  Is it now the policy of the Minister to eradicate the combine?  Must he send the gentle maiden with her sickle to the wheat fields?  Is not that very much what he is doing?  He is trying to stop the march of time, put back the hands of the clock, to take the combine from the fields, when every farmer in the country knows that the one great godsend, the one great boon to the acute labour problem which exists in the country is the combine. And now the Minister says, &ldquo;Fair maiden with thy sickle return to the wheat fields.&rdquo;  But perhaps I am exaggerating.</P>

      <P>We revert to the old orthodox method of the reaper and binder and of the stacks in the fields where the destruction from vermin amounts to from 7/- to 10/- a barrel says the O.E.E.C. report.  And again, for those who are fastidious, a return to the storing of wheat in stacks and ricks means there is a continuous fouling <Col N="1505" /> of the grain by vermin.  That is another factor that has to be taken into consideration.  There is always and forever in existence the danger of Weil's disease from rat infested stacks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position of the farmers and the farming contractors who have gone into the credit corporations and into the banks and who have gone steadily and substantially into debt?  Remember&mdash;and the figures are available&mdash;that most of the debt was contracted within the last couple of years and those people now find that they are prevented from recouping the capital which they invested and are irretrievably being driven completely out of business. And, again, do the representatives of labour in this inter-Party Government study the repercussions from the diminution in wheat acreage?  Does this not mean substantial unemployment among lorry drivers and lorry owners?  Can we not assume that C.I.E. and those people employed in the mills are going to have unemployment? Can we not assume that in the fertiliser factories there will be a considerable reduction in employment? Can we not assume that in the very big grain-receiving depots there will also be unemployment?  In my home town there is a depot which gives employment to 60 or 70 workers in the grain season and on a permanent basis 25 or 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are factors which must be considered.  I would ask the Minister what the effect of the destruction of the wheat policy would be on grass. I have stated in this House before that a sensible approach would have been rotational grain and grass production. One thing that grain-growing would do is that it would cause to be ploughed up land all over the country in which all the productive grasses had died. Tillage would have helped to rid the fields of the Yorkshire fog and Goulaher, beal-a-gorm and other non-productive grasses.  In that way, wheat-growing would have very favourable <Col N="1506" /> repercussions on milk and beef production as the Minister is very well aware if he has studied the conditions in the grass areas.  I was glad to see some of the grass areas ploughed up because everybody knows that if our dairying economy is wasteful, our beef economy is many times more wasteful. If we are to get the maximum in beef we can get it only through improving our grass in the beef areas.  That can be done, and a very suitable way of doing it is by having grain and grass rotating.  I have said over and over again that the only real wealth a farmer can own is the accumulated fertility in his soil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>When the other sections of the community&mdash;the non-agricultural sections&mdash;were faced with starvation when this island of ours was an island besieged, the farmers of the country were called in to take the front-line trenches.  They dissipated the reserves of fertility in their land without having fertilisers to put in.  They dissipated the accumulated reserve of fertility they had in order to save the non-agricultural community from starvation. And now, a very short time afterwards, when the farmers should have all the sympathy of every section of the community, they are being deprived of an opportunity to restore the fertility in their farms&mdash;which they so magnanimously and so generously gave in time of crisis.  I am no financial wizard but I wonder did the Minister and the Government examine what the repercussions would be if this price was instrumental in killing wheat-growing?  Did the Minister and the Government think of the position that would arise if we were forced to pay with dollars for the bulk of our wheat from the hard currency countries?  These are all factors which should be considered.  I do not intend to labour this thing much further, but I would say to the Government: &ldquo;You cannot have one policy for the industrialists, for the millers, for the non-agricultural consumer and another for the farming section of the community.&rdquo; No Government will stand or stay very long in office that will attempt to make the farmer the pack mule or the <Col N="1507" /> sweated coolie for the non-agricultural interests in this country.</P>
      <P>I need only recall a meeting early in 1951 when the present Minister attended the Engineers' Hall, Dawson Street, when he faced at the annual general meeting of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society a very irate group of farmers.  That was in the last days of the last inter-Party Government. I can recall the words used by the Minister to try to coo and to coax those irate farmers.  He said: &ldquo;You are breaking behind me.  You will trample me under but I will go back behind the counter and earn that miserable pittance of £1,500 a year or whatever it was which you gave me as Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;  Does the Minister recall?  Am I not quoting the exact words he used?</P>

      <P>Deputy Moher expressed apprehension lest there should develop in this country a reduction in the total cereal acreage.

      <P>What I did say was a very different statement.  I do not <Col N="1508" /> want to be misquoted or to have what I said misinterpreted.  What I did say was that the combine was the solution to a very acute labour problem&mdash;a very acute labour problem&mdash;in the grain-growing areas.  That is a very different statement from that made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the old story of whether the hen comes before the egg or the egg comes before the hen.  I think what Deputy Moher, in any case, says is that when there are very few labourers on the land the combine is a great blessing for the farmer who is without labourers on his land.  Is not that so?  I remember the time when I used to be told that the wheat policy was designed to multiply the number of agricultural workers employed on the land.  You pays your money and you takes your choice.  I hope I do Deputy Moher no injustice, but it seems that when it suits Deputy Moher to say at the cross-roads that he is urging the employment of more and more men on the land and that the policy he advocates of 82/6 a barrel for wheat is designed to employ men on the land, that is scarcely consistent with the proposition so resonantly put forward by him to-day that the combine is the most valuable instrument available to a farmer who has the fewest labourers on the land.</P>
      <P>There is one thing about Deputy Moher's speech with which I entirely agree.  I used to say that the farmer's function was to get from his land the maximum return for himself and his wife and family, always provided that he left his land in autumn a little better than he found it in the spring.  I am gratified to learn that Deputy Moher has so often listened to me at meetings.  Perhaps he has heard me in East Cork laying down that doctrine.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moher says to-day that the only wealth a farmer can have really is the accumulated fertility of his soil. I wonder how much accumulated fertility was left in the 1,000 acres of conacre that were put under wheat in County Dublin and County Kildare, of which I will read out particulars before I sit down here to-day.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil is very fond of making dirty messes and then jeering at those whose unfortunate assignment it is to succeed them for the purpose of cleaning them up.  Deputy Beegan asks why is the escalator principle introduced at all into the guaranteed price for wheat.  I will tell you. There is no secret about it.  I felt that farmers were put to desperate inconvenience as a result of the attempt being made to handle all the wheat in six or eight weeks when the harvest came in and that, if we could introduce a system where it could pay at least certain categories of farmers who were in a position to do so to stack their wheat and hold it back so as to let those who were not in a position to do that to get their wheat handled, it would be a useful thing to do.  In so far as the principle is concerned, I think I am right in saying that every organised body of farmers with whom I discussed it agreed that the principle was a good one if we could make it work.</P>

If this degree of escalator in the price does not succeed in putting it right, I am quite prepared to consider an adjustment in order to procure the end we all want.  That is the principle. You asked me why it was brought in and that is the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, Deputy Beegan says, why did you give a premium on wheat delivered in December and January when you knew that the quantity of wheat delivered in December and January is negligible?  That is the very reason <Col N="1511" /> we gave the escalator price for these months, because we wanted the quantity delivered in these months substantial so as to relieve the months in which the bulk of the crop is at present delivered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan then grew philosophical and said that some people complained of individuals speculating on wheat.  Said Deputy Beegan: &ldquo;Well, this is a free country and any man is entitled to speculate on anything.&rdquo; Is he?  Does Fianna Fáil accept that proposition?  Does Fianna Fáil accept the proposition that a gentlemen is entitled to come into this country, to take 1,000 or 1,200 acres of conacre land, to tear it up, sow it in wheat, get a contractor to plough it and sow it and fertilise it, and make a deal with the contractor to come back on the first available day after the 1st September to combine it and leave the straw standing in the field and deliver the wheat?  He never saw the wheat; he never handled the wheat; he would not know wheat if he did see it and he hoped to collar the &ldquo;boodle&rdquo;.  Does Deputy Beegan say that that is a kind of speculating that ought to be encouraged in what he calls a free country?</P>

The House is entitled to ask me, as representing the Government, why we fixed the price at 70/- per barrel for wheat bushelling 63 lb.  It was because we believe that those farmers in this country who have gone into the practice of growing wheat and desire to grow wheat and who depend on it as a cash crop were entitled to have from their Government a fair profit on wheat that they grew and an ample margin above the world price available for wheat.  Accordingly, the price of 70/- was fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1516" /> I would ask Deputies of this House to remember that, as evidence of the desire of this Government to give farmers security in this matter, we fixed the price not for one year but for two years.  That has never been done before.  I want to ask Deputies what margin do they think is fair between the price that should obtain at home for wheat grown in Ireland and the international price of wheat in the markets of the world?  I want to tell the House that the margin fixed by this Government is between 15/- and 20/- per barrel in favour of Irish wheat.  I think that is a fair one.  I think if you guarantee to our farmers that they shall get in any cereal year from 15/-to 20/- per barrel, that is £6 to £8 a ton more than the world price for wheat, our farmers are getting a fair price for their product.  I do not believe that the farmers of this country will fail to understand that and to appreciate the policy that we are concerned to put before them.</P>
    <P>I want the House to consider as deliberately as they can the policy by its results.  I have often said in public before that the best test of policy is results.  I want to apply that test and none other to the policy of the inter-Party Government as opposed to the policy of Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil, I concede it at once&mdash;I wish Deputy Moher would not go away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You will be very welcome.  Fianna Fáil fixed 82/6 a barrel for wheat bushelling 63 lb. and over.  What is the result of that?  What has been the result of that?  Do not let us forget that at the same time that Fianna Fáil fixed that price for Irish wheat they signed the International Wheat Agreement which binds this Government now throughout this year and next year to accept delivery of 270,000 tons of wheat whenever anyone wants to tender that quantity of wheat to us at the minimum price of one dollar fifty-five f.o.b.  Port Arthur for No. 1 Manitoba wheat. That liability attaches to me now. Between now and the 31st July any person in the International Wheat <Col N="1517" /> Agreement who desires can compel this country to accept this wheat and pay for it by virtue of the International Wheat Agreement.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil then fixed this price for domestic wheat.  It had two remarkable and immediate results.  I do not blame anybody for the confusion that the unprecedentedly bad harvest brought upon us.  On the contrary, I think we have every reason to congratulate ourselves that we came out of those difficulties as well as we did. Here are two astonishing problems. The first of them is the emergence for the first time in our history of an entirely new type of person.</P>
      <P>In the County Dublin three individuals harvested or tried to harvest over 1,000 acres of wheat each, and of that 60 per cent. was conacre land.  I ask Deputies to think about what this means.  The wheat price at 82/6 represented approximately a subsidy of £8 per acre to the man who grew wheat.  These three individuals between them collected £24,000 in subsidy from the Irish Exchequer.  In the County Dublin three other individuals had each between 500 and 1,000 acres of wheat.  In each case, a large proportion of it was conacre land.  In addition to that, there were 16 persons in the County Dublin and each of them had between 100 and 500 acres of wheat. Most of them&mdash;certainly half of them&mdash; were limited liability companies, some of which in my judgment were clearly established for the purpose of making a killing out of the guaranteed wheat prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We come to Kildare.  In Kildare, we have one grower with between 500 and 1,000 acres of wheat. We have 24 individuals in the County Kildare with between 100 and 500 acres of wheat.  In Louth, we have at least ten, each one of them having from 100 to 500 acres of wheat.  In Meath, <Col N="1518" /> we have one combine who have between 500 and 1,000 acres and we have 11 with between 100 and 500 acres of wheat.  In Kilkenny, we have 23 individuals with between 100 and 500 acres of wheat.  In Tipperary, five, and in Carlow, eight.  Does the Dáil consider that a development of that type of agricultural activity is of any advantage to anyone in this country?  On every one of these larger holdings you had three or four combines working. The amount of labour employed was negligible.  In many cases the proprietor of that growing grain never saw the grain: it was planted by a contractor, the ploughing and harrowing was done by the contractor, and he came back with combines in the autumn and proceeded to drag it out as best he could.  Is that desirable for agriculture? If it is, I recommend to the Dáil, if that is what they want, to renew the same price for wheat next year and you will have 20 times as many of that kind of operator in the field then as you have now; and all those fellows avowedly are hoping to get back what they failed to collect, if we give them another chance.  Do you want to do that?</P>
      <P>Suppose these fellows were an inseparable feature of a good agricultural policy, I would be inclined to say: &ldquo;We are not living in Paradise and you have to take the fat with the lean, and if you have a few parasites on a good plan I would advise you to put up with it.&rdquo;  But what is the result of this policy?  Does it mean an expanded acreage of cereal production? It does not.  The astonishing part of it is that as wheat went up oats and barley have gone down.  Now look at the position we are in, and it is a grotesque position, in my opinion.  We have a very large accumulated stock of wheat in very poor condition, much of it saved off the kinds of farms I have described.  We have no feeding barley.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Who would grow feeding barley when you can get 84/- for wheat?  We have no oats and we have <Col N="1519" /> not enough malting barley.  I am now faced with the obligation to issue licences to bring in Iraquian barley for feed, to bring in Canadian barley for roasting or to close the breweries down; and I must give men licences to bring in oats from Scotland or close down every oatmeal mill in the country.  Was there ever a dafter policy&mdash;that wiped out oats, wiped out barley and furnished us with an abundance of a crop which, unfortunately, at the moment is in very bad condition?  Surely common sense and prudence should suggest to us a policy that would get for us such a quantity of wheat as we wanted, sufficient barley to make imports of barley unnecessary for malting or feeding and that would produce on our own land the oats we are going to import from Scotland in order to keep the oatmeal mills open?  Which is the best policy?  I think the policy I advocate is the best one&mdash;I think it is much better than the Fianna Fáil one&mdash;and that is to bring the three of the cereal crops into some kind of rational relationship so that you can get a fair proportion of all.</P>
      <P>There is no use arguing that the desirable thing to do is to lift the price of all cereal crops indefinitely. In so far as feeding oats and feeding barley are concerned, they are the raw materials of our live stock, and livestock products export industry.  As Deputies know, if you extinguish the margin of profit for the pig feeder of West Cork he just does not feed pigs and if he does not feed pigs we will not export bacon or pork and we will have to close down our bacon factories&mdash;as we did have to close them down, until they were opened again by the inter-Party Government after the Pigs and Bacon Agreement of 1951.  Knock the profit out of pigs and the bacon factories will close down for the want of pigs to slaughter.  I cannot control the price of pigs or bacon on the world market.</P>

As far as I am concerned, I want that judgment to be made.  This Government's agricultural policy is founded on the aphorism: &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow, and one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;  Our purpose is to evoke from the farmers a greater acreage and a greater supply of oats and barley which we can profitably process and convert into meat, bacon, pork and whatever else you can find a profitable market for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind Deputy Moher of this, that when he sings the praises of the combine for eliminating labour from the land, there is no combine that will feed a pig or attend a pig when she farrows, there is no combine that will look after a cow or remove the manure by machinery.  If you have live stock and if their production and fattening is proceeding on the land of Ireland, there must be human hands employed to do the work, so long as it pays a profit.  It will not be fair maids with reaping hooks that will do it.  I am not sending our people anywhere, but I am asking them to look on cattle and pigs as the two most efficient machines we have for processing the corn crops of Ireland and the grass growth that should follow thereon.  I think it is a good policy, and accordingly it is the intention of this Government to provide a guaranteed <Col N="1521" /> price for wheat and to secure for the farmers of this country a minimum price for feeding barley.  It is the intention of this Government to interview the oatmeal millers of this country forthwith and point out to them that the time has come for them to do their duty and to make contracts for the production of oats by our farmers on Irish land, which they are at present asking me to admit under licence from the land of Scottish farmers.  We are giving a fair price for the man who grows wheat, not a profit that induces a man from the Continent of Europe to come into this country, take 1,000 acres in conacre from £25 to £30 per acre and grow wheat upon it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not think they were fools.  Is it better to fix a price which will give the farmer who grows that crop in regular rotation a fair profit and to go and say to him: &ldquo;If you want to grow barley, and are so circumstanced that you can, we will facilitate you in growing it, and will guarantee that you will not get less than 40/- a barrel for it.  If you get more you are welcome&rdquo;?  If we go to the oat miller and say: &ldquo;Estimate your requirements of oats and go to the farmers as the Beet Company or the maltster goes and make your contract with them for so many barrels of oats,&rdquo; would that not be a better policy than paying 82/6 for wheat for the benefit of the 1,000 acre or 500 acre farmer?  If we bring that within the reach of Deputy Beegan's man who, he says, is going to lose £15 in his gross income this year, will he not make up the £15 involved, by his access to that diversification, if he puts in one pair of pigs?  On every farm of £30 valuation where the farmer feels himself bereft by the reduction of £15 in price for his three acres of wheat, he can correct that by putting in one pair of pigs for which he will have a <Col N="1522" /> profitable market&mdash;and there is no £8 per acre subsidy on them.  Is that not the better policy?  I think it is.</P>
      <P>I do not want to depart, however, from some of the arguments that have been put forward.  I know there was an arresting list of prices paid by other countries in Europe for wheat. I know that that impressed a number of men who were in perfectly good faith.  I know that when men read that Turkey was paying 94/5 a barrel for wheat and that Portugal was paying a similar amount per barrel to their people, some people said: &ldquo;Is it not a queer thing that our Government would pay only 67/6?&rdquo;  These people do not stop to think.  Did they ever think that the moisture content of the Iraquian barley which is grown not 100 miles from Turkey averages 12 per cent.?  The moisture content of wheat grown in Ireland averages 23 per cent., but that is not all.  Did the pundits who put these figures before our people ask themselves what the average yield per acre in Turkey and Portugal of wheat was?  The average yield in Turkey is 9.9 cwt. per acre; the average yield in Ireland is 23.3 cwt.</P>
      <P>The Turks would have to pay nearly 200/- a barrel for wheat on their yield before their people would be paid a comparable price with what the Irish farmer was getting for his product. The Portuguese are paying 94/5 per barrel.  Does anyone realise what their average yield is?  7.2 cwt. per acre is the average yield of wheat in Portugal. If the Portuguese wanted to pay a price to their farmers comparable to the price our farmers receive they would have to pay 210/- per barrel. Do Deputies understand that?  When &ldquo;Pop&rdquo; laughs we all laugh.  I have the greatest admiration for a disciplined Party.  Keep watching the signals and then you will not go wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall get back to anything to avoid having to contemplate the horrible spectacle of Deputy Collins <Col N="1523" />&mdash;anything.  I think these figures are relevant and important.  I think it is wrong to mislead our people by the pretence that the price paid by the Irish Government for wheat grown in Ireland is the lowest price in Europe, in any true sense of that term.  Come, let us compare like with like.  Let us compare the conditions obtaining in Ireland with the conditions obtaining in France.  France is paying 96/- per barrel for wheat.  Here the average yield is 16.9 cwt. from the acre.  Is it unfair for me to say that if France were to give the same price to their farmers as we are giving to our farmers France would require to be paying nearly 105/- per barrel for wheat to treat them as like with like? Do Deputies appreciate the fact that France, having paid 96/- per barrel for wheat to her farmers is, at the present time, selling it in London to the British millers at 50/- to 55/- per barrel delivered into a British mill at an average moisture content of 15 per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the House to remember this. This year, if Providence had blessed us with a good harvest, we could easily have had an exportable surplus of wheat from our own resources and, on top of that, we could have had 270,000 tons of wheat delivered to us which we would also have had to sell in whatever foreign market we could get.  The French are selling in the best market they can get, and they are delivering at 15 per cent. moisture content to London and the west coast of England at 50/- to 55/- a barrel, having paid freight on it from France and having paid storage facilities on it in France. France has her colonies and her accumulated wealth.  England has her great industrial national income from which she can draw funds to subsidise agriculture in any way she likes.  The United States of America has all the resources creation put upon the earth from which to finance any price stabilisation policy she chooses to enunciate. Do not let us forget that Ireland has 12,000,000 acres of arable land and the people who live on it and nothing else. It is that which is setting the standard of living for every individual in this country whether they live in town, city or countryside.  And after 25 years' <Col N="1524" /> argument, we have brought Deputy Lemass out to the Publicity Club to say that after 30 years in the public life of this country he has discovered that, too.  I must try, as my predecessor and his predecessor before him have done, to help the people who are living on the land of Ireland to get, not for themselves alone but for us all, the standard of living we enjoy and, more than that, the raw materials and the means to provide industrial employment for between 100,000 and 200,000 of our people who if they are not thus employed must go elsewhere to seek a living.  Bear this in mind, that if we fail to export agricultural produce profitably, it is not the farmer who will feel the first blast.  When we have not the means to pay for the raw materials of industrial employment, the man who is thrown out of work in the cities and towns has no cottage to go home to where he would at least find milk, eggs and oatmeal to assist him over the lean period; he has nothing to go home to but his unemployment pay.</P>
    <P>I ask the farmers of this country with full confidence to come with us in the prosecution of an agricultural policy that will get a decent living for us all.  I know there are Fianna Fáil Deputies sitting on the benches opposite me now who know I am right. I know there are Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches who are not sitting there because they have not the brazen-faced impudence to face me across this House and claim they think I am not right.  They have agreed with me but when &ldquo;Pop&rdquo; walks down the lobby they will all trot after him and I do not blame them.  I am a party man too.</P>

      <P>Thanks be to goodness the day is gone when they were able to wreak their spite on others by making them walk the plank.  I want the support of Oireachtas Éireann for our policy but much more I want the support of the farmers in this country. I think I will get the former and I am certain I will get the latter.  This day 12 months, I will invite this House to judge our policy by results and if I have nothing better to produce than that list of speculators, if I have nothing better to produce than applications for licences to import barley from Iraq&mdash;for we have none in Ireland&mdash;and oats from Scotland, because we have none in Ireland, to feed our pigs and open our distilleries and breweries, then I will quit the job I have now. If I were responsible for a policy that resulted in the tale I have told to-day I would be ashamed to be Minister for Agriculture in this country.  But I am not responsible for that story.  I am not responsible for that scandal.  I am not responsible for the humiliation that we have to seek in Iraq and Scotland what we might so profitably have grown here while we fatten the speculators on the conacre land of Ireland and, as Deputy Moher pointed out, provide them with hammer and jemmy to plunder the soil of this country of its fertility and to fly this country with their evil-gotten swag.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember the time when it used to be said by Cumann na nGaedheal that wheat could only be grown in this country at the point of a gun.  The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, supported by the Labour Party, is now loading a machine-gun in order to prevent farmers growing it.  Deputy Dillon's speculators can be dealt with without robbing the farmers of this country who till a reasonable proportion of their land, with a reasonable proportion of it under wheat, of a fair price for their product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What guarantee has the Minister for Agriculture to offer to the farmers of this country that if his policy succeeds in putting wheat up the spout&mdash;and that is what I believe he has in mind, of reducing it to the 21,000 acres we had before&mdash;what guarantee has he that he <Col N="1526" /> will be able to sell the alternative product from that land for sufficient to buy the wheat that should have been grown on it?  Deputy Dillon is now guaranteeing the farmers that if they follow his policy he will double tillage in two years.</P>
    <P>What did he do during the three years he was in the Coalition Government? He reduced the tillage by 1,000,000 acres.  This policy that he is laying down to-day is inevitably bound to lead to a great reduction in the meagre amount of tillage that we have in this country at the present time.  If we are to produce from our soil the maximum to sustain our people, either for direct consumption or for sale for the things we require, we want to have a reasonable amount of tillage.  We have got to turn over our soil, to get rid of the weed-infested pastures and to plant them with good grasses at the end of a proper rotation.  Let us examine this matter from the narrow point of view of economics&mdash;this policy of getting rid of wheat production and, by some manner of means, raising the £15,000,000 or the £20,000,000 that the foreigners may charge us for the 500,000 tons of wheat that we must import in order to feed our people.  Let us examine this proposition, because that is where this policy is leading us. That is where the Minister for Agriculture wants it to lead: he has never made any secret of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This year, we have probably had 450,000 acres of land under wheat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>What would that give us this year?  Even if there had been a good harvest, I calculate that it would not have given us the wheat we require for human consumption plus the wheat we require for next year's seed.  Let us say, however, that up to 500,000 acres were under wheat this year.  What are we going to do with that 500,000 acres in future if we cut out wheat-growing, if we can kill wheat growing?  Take the farmer who has grown wheat and got a few pounds' profit per acre out of it.  Consider the <Col N="1527" /> case of such a farmer who puts that land back into grass.  If he can get a bullock at a good price he will be very lucky if he increases the value of that bullock by £20 within a year on the two acres.  It would be good going.  On those same two acres, even at the price at which we have to import wheat&mdash; £29 or £30 a ton&mdash;the farmer could have produced as much wheat as would have saved our importing two tons at £30 a ton.  Therefore, from the farmer's point of view and from the point of view of the country, it amounts to this.  We put back into grass 500,000 acres in order to produce an extra £20 worth of bullock on every two acres, and we import wheat at £30 a ton or £60 for the two acres.  We improve a bullock by £20 and we go to the British market and buy dollars &mdash;and we are £40 short to buy the same amount of wheat as could have been produced on those two acres. That is the calculation.  Nobody can deny it.  Why should we follow that road?</P>
      <P>It has been proved&mdash;notwithstanding all the prognostications and prophecies made 20 years ago that wheat could not be grown, that it would dirty the land, that we could not do it except at the point of the gun&mdash;that wheat was the only crop that stood up to the most disastrous weather the Lord was pleased to send us this year.  We hope He will be more favourable in the future to us and to the rest of Europe. However, this year it was proved that, if we want to grow a cereal crop that will stand up to the utmost hardship that anybody can conceive, wheat is the crop to grow&mdash;not barley or oats. The reason why we have a shortage of malting barley and why some has to be imported is not because we had not a sufficient crop of barley to give us all the malt we wanted.  It is simply that barley would not stand up to the weather.  Let us now consider oats.  We all know that the crop that stood up least well to the weather of this year was the oat crop, and that if farmers succeeded in getting it cut it grew more quickly in the stook than wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not ever want to see this again but last Sunday, the 28th November, I saw a crop of wheat standing in water <Col N="1528" /> not two miles from Dundalk and the head was still perfectly good.  If any sort of good weather comes it can be reaped and the farmer can get a reasonable crop out of it.  I want to say that, from the point of view of the ordinary farmer who tills, from the point of view of the farmer who puts 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. of his land under wheat, who has 20 or 30 or 40 per cent. under tillage, this policy of killing wheat is ruinous.  From the point of view of the country, we have to get an extra £15,000,000 or £20,000,000 of exports of butter and eggs and bacon and beef in order to buy the dollars to get the wheat. Where are we going to get it?</P>
    <P>It is easy for the Minister for Agriculture, moved by his own prejudices against this crop, to promise unlimited and profitable markets for other crops. I remember the Minister for Agriculture, in one such fit of enthusiastic, prophetical frenzy, promising every farmer's wife in the country that when she saw a chicken put its beak through an egg she could say to herself: &ldquo;I know if this young chick lives to be a pullet, the price I will get for every egg she will lay.&rdquo;  It was not three months until the price of eggs fell.  Even if the Deputies on the Fine Gael Benches are so prejudiced against wheat-growing that they are prepared to throw all question of national security and all question of economics out the window, they should at least ensure a little bit of fair play for the farmers.  If they are going to cut the price of wheat to the farmers, let them cut it gradually: do not have this disastrous cut of between 15 per cent. and 16 per cent.  There are Deputies who are going to vote for an extra £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 for the civil servants.  What would those Deputies say if the Government proposed, instead of giving this uncovenanted benefit to the civil servants, to cut them by 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>If every civil servant who had £1,000 was cut by £150 and every civil servant who had £500 by £75 some harm would be seen in that; but that is the proposal in this case and there is no alternative offered to the farmers.  We know, of course, that it <Col N="1529" /> is the duty of any Government to see that the commodities our people require are available at as reasonable a price as possible.  A Government making up its mind on a question such as that, on the price it is prepared to offer for wheat and the period during which it will guarantee that price, should keep in mind the fact that there are two fundamental reasons for giving the farmers a fair price.  The first is the question of national security.  If we had not had our own wheat during the last war we would have been, or an effort would have been made to make us, a partisan of foreign powers. Of that there is no doubt.  Proof of that exists.  Apart from that, however, there is the question of giving the farmers a reasonable price for the crops they produce during the next year or two.</P>
    <P>What has happened to the five year guarantee about which we heard so much during the last election and after it?  What happened the five year guarantee the farmers were to get?  It was indicated that that five year guarantee would be the Fianna Fáil price of 82/6 per barrel and not 70/-. What has happened to it?  All round County Louth and all over every other county we heard about it.  The Taoiseach announced on the radio that Fianna Fáil gave 82/6 for one year but they were going to guarantee the price for five years.  What has happened this guarantee for five years?</P>

      <P>That is not true.  Deputy Aiken has said that it was promised in his constituency that the inter-Party Government would, if elected to office, pay 82/6 per barrel for wheat for five years after their election.  No such promise was given.  The inter-Party Government promised to give a guaranteed price for wheat to be announced <Col N="1530" /> in each cereal year for every one of the five years during which it is in office, and they will give it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said and what the Minister has said is on the record. We will leave it at that.  Every farmer in the country knows perfectly well that what the Taoiseach said when speaking on behalf of Fine Gael over the radio was that the Fianna Fáil Government guaranteed the price of wheat a year ahead, but the Fine Gael Government would do it for five years ahead and, as proof that they would carry out their intentions, he alluded to the fact that the last time Fine Gael were in Government they had guaranteed the price for five years ahead.</P>
      <P>The result of the farmers and others all over the country putting Fine Gael into control has been a cut in the price of wheat by 12/6 per barrel.  Another result is the upset of our whole farming economy.  For pity's sake, why should not the Government accept the motion, reconsider the matter and recognise that it is only fair to the ordinary farmer that he should get a fair price for his wheat?  The Government is prepared to pay other people who make demands on the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's excuse for this escalator principle being so slow-moving as not to come into operation in the second stage until December is absolutely phoney.  If the Minister had really been against the combine he would have given the farmers every possible reason to avoid combining their wheat and every encouragement to use the ordinary reaper and binder, hand-reaping or any other form of reaping, and to put their corn into stack and deliver it after the normal time of delivery by the combine.  Farmers know that normally the winter wheat is ripe enough for the combine in late August or early September, and in no part of the country except in those areas above 500 or 600 feet altitude will wheat come in as late as October.  Over the years, the pattern has been that it comes in the latter half of August, and from the middle of August onwards the other wheats <Col N="1531" /> start coming along.  If the Minister had wanted to encourage the farmer to use the reaper and binder he could quite easily have increased the price in October and that would have had the result that the farmers would only have a month or so to look ahead and, with any kind of reasonable weather, the wheat could be left in hand stacks or in a rick and they would get 2/6 or 5/- a barrel extra to cover the additional cost incurred in saving it in that way as against saving it by combine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree there is a wide difference between the hand stack and the rick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain circumstances. In certain circumstances the hand stack is much safer.  If wheat is saved in poor weather and put into a rick in poor condition the whole of it may be lost.  In bad weather you may lose the capping sheaves of hand stack, but that is all.  However, that is a technical point and I will not go into it any further.  If the Minister had really wanted to favour that method of harvesting as against the combine he should have moved the price upwards before December and given the farmers a premium to keep their wheat until October or November. The general experience this year in the case of farmers who reaped wheat reasonably early and put it into hand stacks or cap stooks was that there was only 18 per cent. moisture. From the point of view of saving and in connection with drying capacity and encouraging farmers to employ men rather than machines, the escalator should have started to move upwards in October and not in December. As far as January is concerned, it is of no interest to anybody.  It is just a notional figure put in by the Minister to make the price look good. The Minister has succeeded effectively in reducing the price of wheat by 12s. 6d. per barrel&mdash;a cut of over 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, Governments have to make certain that they watch the two sides of the account&mdash;what they give to the producers and what the consumers have to pay.  It was the custom of Fianna Fáil, of Fianna Fáil Governments <Col N="1532" /> over 20 years&mdash;and which I am afraid the Coalition Governments have not followed&mdash;that when the Minister put up a proposition, every other Minister and their Departments were supposed to pick as many holes in it as they could.  I believe that some of the proposals put forward by Coalition Ministers are announced at some meeting or another without prior consultation or criticism.  The Minister has alluded to memoranda of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to wheat prices.  I wish I saw what was put up by the Department of Finance and I was in charge of the Department at that time in the absence of Deputy MacEntee.</P>

I want to say that I was in charge of the Department of Finance at that time and my instructions were that as many holes as possible should be picked in any proposal put up by the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Industry and Commerce. And I gave them fair warning that I kept myself free to favour a proposal, perhaps subject to alterations.  What usually happened then was that the Government knew everything possible which could be said against a proposal. Actually when the Government was considering the price of wheat or the amount of wheat to be aimed at last February or whenever it was, you had from the Department of Industry and Commerce, and from the Department of Finance of which I was in temporary charge, the greatest objection to giving any long-term guarantee for a greater acreage of wheat, but the final result of that meeting was that the Government decided in the interests of national security and for various other reasons to aim at getting at least 300,000 tons of dried wheat, which is equivalent to an acreage of 450,000 acres&mdash;more than we had ever grown at any time other than during the war. <Col N="1533" /> When we took the decision to step up the acreage to 450,000 we were faced by the fact that in the previous year we had only an acreage under wheat of 254,000.  This has been said over and over again.  It was no secret.  The then Taoiseach announced it to this House; the then Minister for Agriculture announced it to the House.  It was generally known throughout the country through the Fianna Fáil Party that our policy was to make certain that we should at all times have at least this 300,000 tons of dried wheat to the mills plus what we would need for seed&mdash;a produce of about 450,000 acres.  Our policy and price were aimed at getting that acreage.</P>
      <P>My belief is that instead of meeting the food requirements of our people in addition to our seed requirements, this sudden disastrous cut in wheat prices is going to drive wheat away downwards&mdash;I do not know how far: the Lord knows how far.  It will depend upon an estimate by a number of farmers as to what is going to happen.  Will the price of cattle be maintained?  Will the price of eggs keep up and so on?  It may be very disastrous and wheat production may go down to nil and if that happens we are going to be on the road with our eggs in our baskets and our sides of bacon under our arms looking for a market to sell them for £15,000,000 or £20,000,000.  The Lord knows how much we will pay for our wheat because the wheat we are getting in here from America is subsidised; the price we are paying for it is a subsidised price.  We do not know at what time the American public may say: &ldquo;We are not going to pay this subsidy any longer.&rdquo;  Then the Irish consumer will have to pay the American farmer the cost at which his wheat was actually produced.  If we are to get out of wheat-growing, and if Europe was sufficiently foolish to do the same, the price of American wheat would not be 155 cents a bushel but 310 cents a bushel.  It is not so very long ago since we had to pay dearly; this has been alluded to time and again.  We had to pay £50 a ton and were glad to get it at that price at the time.</P>

My belief is that the Minister is manoeuvring to put his old policy into effect, and he has lined up these gentlemen behind him in order to do it.  I think it is a disastrous policy, and we are asking the House to force the Government to reconsider this matter by passing this motion for a review of the price fixed.  We are asking the Government to reconsider it with a view to fixing a price that will give us reasonable security in the future and give the farmers a reasonable price for their product and so that our farmers will have the reasonable expectation that when Governments change there is not going to be all this sudden changing of policy which has such an ill effect upon agriculture.</P>

      <P>Anybody who has listened to the case made by the movers of the motion and to the case made by the Minister for Agriculture must now be satisfied upon the facts. The Minister for Agriculture has set out clearly the policy of the Government in relation to the guaranteeing of a reasonable price for wheat for two years.  The case made by the movers of the motion and those who spoke in support of it was that the price was made by men who had no idea of farming and that it was only a Fianna Fáil Government that was purely and truly representative of the agricultural community. They said that the price was fixed because there was not proper farmer representation in the Government. In reply to that allegation all I would say is that on a comparison of the two Front Benches there is no doubt where the representation lies, and that this inter-Party Government has a far higher percentage of farming and agricultural interests generally.  There are <Col N="1535" /> at least a few people in this Government who have a fair knowledge of farming.  I would put myself against my opposite number in the last Government as to knowledge of farming.</P>

      <P>I was listening to the ex-Minister as well as you.  There is his experience of it and he tells us how to do it.  He was the first speaker of former Government rank who spoke after the Minister for Agriculture and one would imagine that he would make an effort to explain how the Government's decision of January, 1954, was to be put into effect.  The Minister for Agriculture challenged the former Government to show how they would reduce the acreage, to say what was their plan.  He asked them to say whether they would appoint more inspectors, whether they would parcel out allotments, whether they would allow five, six or ten limited liability companies or other people who would come into the country to grow all the wheat and prohibit Deputy Beegan's farmers or Deputy Carter's farmers in Galway or Longford from growing any and provide that the only people who could grow wheat would be people with <Col N="1536" /> combines and the limited liability company.  Deputy Aiken completely avoided that question.  He tried to bring in something that he knows well had no bearing on the question put to him.  He tried to create a doubt that there was some change in certain procedure in Government.</P>
      <P>Everybody who has ever been in Government or has had anything to do with Government knows that when a memorandum is submitted by a Department it is examined by the Department affected and in particular by Finance and that, no matter who is in Government or who is out of Government, that procedure will remain.  When the former Minister for External Affairs tries to say that the decision is made somewhere down the country or in some meeting place, what is he trying to prove?  He is trying to assert that this Government has not the responsibility that the former Government had and that this Government did not know how to do things.  Is that the way to decide the question as to what is a fair price for wheat?  Yet, that is the line on which Deputy Aiken would have the House approach the matter.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Agriculture pointed out, because of the price that was guaranteed by the previous Government, speculators came in and attempted to batten on the people of this country and to make a million. It is not the first time it happened in the previous Government's administration that people tried to get rich quick but the vast majority of the Irish people had not that chance or opportunity. Then the Minister pointed out that, as a result of Government activities, wheat went out of proportion and that the other two essential crops for our own welfare, for the feeding even of ourselves, oats and barley, went down completely.  The figures are very striking.  The reduction in potatoes, barley and oats was very great.  Wheat went up because the speculator was trying to make on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that if God had given us a good season, that if the moisture content of wheat was all right, that if the farmer could have saved his crop without great hardship, given good weather, a few shillings a <Col N="1537" /> barrel one way or the other would not matter very much.  The careful farmer, the small farmer, to which class the majority of us belong, who has not the reaper or binder or combine but who has his own labour and that of his sons and daughters could, by careful handling of the crop, have saved the crop without grain loss.  The reaper and binder is a rapid method of harvesting but there is grain loss when that method is employed.  It is a well-known fact that the reaper and binder will lose on the field as much as a barrel and a half of grain to the acre. If men were employed, instead of the reaper and binder, there would not be such a loss.  It may be contended that I am advocating a return to the old pattern of having workmen on the field.  That is what I would like to see.</P>

      <P>I have done it with a hook and with a scythe and the reaper and binder.  I know what I am talking about.  I have seen a combine but I am not wealthy enough to own one yet.  If I were to join a limited liability company with some of those who came in to batten on our people and to impoverish our land, I would put out the reaper and binder.  The Minister in handling the situation has shown this year that he had a full recognition of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What did he do?  He increased the percentage for the moisture content, so that he assisted and came to the rescue of the hard-pressed farmer.  He arranged with the millers to take it; he arranged with the millers to give a reasonable price for the unmillable wheat, and he has done everything a Minister could do in the circumstances in which he found himself, but what did that do to the people who have to get the bread?  Because of the condition of the wheat this year, were it not that some importation of wheat took place, we would not <Col N="1538" /> have the wheat required for the grist to make the bread even eatable. Therefore, in the circumstances everything was done that should be done to keep the balance fair.  Deputy Aiken very properly said that it is the duty of the Government to try to keep the balance fair between all sections of the community.  That balance was kept.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the policy of the Minister and of the Government relating to the price of wheat is fair and equitable.  It is not as much as farmers would like to get.  I know well that every farmer would like to get more for every crop, but we must bear in mind that the number of people who grow wheat to sell is only one section, that it is not every farmer who grows it and that the small farmers in particular do not grow it.  When I say a small farmer, I mean the ten or 15 acre farmer and these are the overwhelming majority of the farmers of the country. Some people may argue, as indeed I did hear argued, that they are not farmers at all, but I should like to see the person who would say they are not, because they are proud of being farmers. They have the mixed farming and this year, bad and all as it was, they have been able to save every one of their crops&mdash;potatoes and all.  Better than that, I know that they have their wheat in the stacks and that next year they will have it in the stacks and that the increased price for the later delivery will be a benefit to them as against the limited liability company and the fellows who came into it to get rich quick.</P>

It is true that a large number of farmers are, but, on the other hand, we get another section of farmers who are affected by milk, another section who are affected by beet and another section affected by the price of cattle.

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I suppose these are points of order.  The Minister and the Government have set out their policy in no uncertain way&mdash;to assist the farmer who wants to make <Col N="1540" /> a living on the land and to keep himself and his family and his worker on a decent standard; to encourage mixed farming; and to encourage the things that are necessary to give employment on the land.  We will try to continue that while we are in office.  I know that, as the Minister has said, results will prove the benefit of that policy.</P>
      <P>In the year that is passing, the farmers have had a very rough time and it is to their credit that, generally speaking, the farmers have succeeded, in 99 per cent. of cases, in saving all their crop.  The only people&mdash;and I say this deliberately&mdash;who have been shouting and complaining about the Minister for Defence not making the Army available are the people who ran into the 300, 400 and 500 acre tillage of wheat.  Although the small farmers beside them had their wheat saved, having paid labour to save it, a large number of these 100 acre tillage farmers who came in for the short time wanted the Army to come out and help them to save their wheat, paying the Army nothing for doing it.  They wanted cheap labour.</P>
      <P>My contention is that, if God is good to us and a good season comes, the price fixed is a reasonable one and that what we should all be doing at the moment is hoping and praying that we will have a better season next year than ever before.  If we do not, if the Government fix 110/- per barrel, it will not make much difference.  The weather will make all the difference and the fixing of a price of 80/- or any such figure will have no effect, if it is a bad season.  If it is a good one, the price fixed will be reasonable.  I have no hesitation in saying that the House should approve of the action of the Government and its Ministers and I ask the House to reject the motion because those on the opposite side of the House are not as much interested in the agricultural community as they pretend to be.  The facts given by the Minister for Agriculture indicate clearly that the best interests of the country are served by the line of action he is taking in the interests of every section of the community.</P>

      <P>I happened to be listening to Deputy MacEoin, Minister <Col N="1541" /> for Defence.  I have a great regard for him as a man who did his bit for his country.  I am sorry to say, however, that I must take exception to some of his remarks in regard to the saving of wheat.  I am surprised that such a man as he should make the statement that if the farmers had gone out and employed labour with the old scythe and sickle they would save a lot.  Have we now reached the stage of having to go back to the days of the scythe and sickle?</P>
      <P>I also remember a speech made by a Deputy J. Tully of Meath, Acting General Secretary of the Federation of Rural Workers.  He said that some &ldquo;wheat ranchers and chancers&rdquo; were this year prepared to wait until a combine was available to deal with their harvest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks of Deputy MacEoin, Minister for Defence, would lead up to that.  If I had to cut with the reaper and binder I would have had to have the corn three or four days in stooks, whereas with the combine I could send it to the mills in good condition.  The Minister for Agriculture advanced no argument except to talk about the five or six ranchers who grew wheat.  He is inclined to condemn the genuine farmers because of three or four ranchers.  The constituency which I represent does not contain such ranchers but tillage farmers. I can tell the House that those people are not very fond of the Minister for Agriculture for giving them this price for their wheat.  The Minister for Agriculture need not try to look down on us back benchers.  I am proud to be a representative of the farming community. My name is appended to this motion.  I am not playing politics.  In view of the fact that we experienced the worst harvest in living memory, the least the farmers expect from the Minister for Agriculture is to leave wheat at this year's price and give the farmers a chance of recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> I heard the Minister for Agriculture over the radio say that he was going to come to the aid of the people in the Shannon valley.  Would he not come to the aid of the farmers and leave the price of wheat as it is?  The people whom I represent should be considered as well as the people in the Shannon valley for whom I have sympathy too.</P>
    <P>The matter of storage is out of the question to my mind.  The only safe way to store is in the straw.  Could we depend on this year?  Would we get a chance of putting the straw into a reek?  The Minister advised the farmers to stack their straw.  How many hours or days did the farmers get to allow them to save their wheat? This year with regard to labour the farmers were very glad to get it and pay any wage.  There would be nothing to prevent me threshing in September in a normal year.  The corn merchant would buy my corn and keep it until June or July.  Would he not be in a very good way of reaping a large profit at the expense of the farmers? There is nothing to prevent the corn merchant asking a loan and saying to the bank: &ldquo;I have so many tons of grain in my loft.&rdquo;  That is the best form of security.  Storage in any part of the country is out of the question. Wheat is one of the crops which cannot be stored with any good result.</P>
    <P>If we want to have a tillage policy &mdash;and we must have it&mdash;then the farmers whom I represent want their straw to make manure.  What will be the consequences to the land if the farmers have not the straw to put back into manure?  They have met with serious losses on account of the amount of straw lost as a result of the cutting of the straw by the combine. Straw is very valuable from the point of view I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I do not think the motion was put down for political purposes.  Indeed, in proof of that, one has only to take up the daily or local papers to see strong objections therein from the Minister's best supporters in regard to the price of wheat.  Owing to the very bad harvest, the least we expect from the Minister is that he would leave the price of wheat as it is this year.  There is no use talking about <Col N="1543" /> bushels or about taking the wheat to the mills.  If you have 100 barrels of wheat at 33 per cent. moisture the worth of that is 51/- per barrel.  That works out at £255.  When dry, it represents 16 per cent. moisture and the worth is 92/6 per barrel.  That equals £462 10s.  Is that not a very large amount of profit for the miller? I say it is.</P>
    <P>I had occasion during the time of the last Government to see a certain corn merchant who was very anxious to get facilities to put up a drier. He wanted no help from the Government or anybody else.  He had the cash.  Apparently, the millers would not allow him to put up a drier. I think those fellows should be gone after.  To my mind, middlemen are living very soft at the expense of the farmers.  We hear a lot about the farmers being pampered.  I do not think they are, having regard to the way they have to work and their costs of production.  It is all right to say: &ldquo;Wait for six months.&rdquo;  Would the Minister go to the Credit Corporation, the rate collectors and the shopkeepers and ask them to wait until the farmers can thresh?  I would make a last appeal to the Minister to leave the price of wheat at last year's price for this year.</P>

      <P>In moving this motion, Deputy Beegan referred to the labour content in the harvesting of wheat.  Every Deputy realises that with the introduction of the combine, the labour content is negligible compared to other crops and cannot be compared in any way in the wide world with the growing of potatoes. Many times during the year farm labourers are engaged preparing the ground for potatoes, putting in manure, sowing the seed, raising the drills, and so on and at the end of the year they are engaged in lifting the potatoes and pitting them.  Yet this year we have a considerable reduction in the acreage of potatoes.  To the minds of most people, that has been caused by the fact that people have gone over to wheat as they were saved the expense involved in the labour <Col N="1544" /> content.  Surely the ground left after a potato crop would be far better than the type of land left by the 1,000 acre grower of wheat in four or five counties in proximity to the city?</P>
      <P>Is it not a fact that there are approximately 350,000 farmers and only about 30,000 wheat growers?  Has anyone opposite given any consideration to the troubles the other 320,000 farmers have to contend with in the unfortunate weather conditions this year?  They have not adverted at all to the considerable increase in the cattle population&mdash;this year there are 64,900&mdash;and at the same time we have a drop in root and grain crops of 15,400 acres and the hay acreage is reduced by 47,900 acres.  Is it not a serious matter for those in the dairying areas that they should have to carry heavy stocks of cattle over the year&mdash; and a very long winter it will be to them this year, in the condition land is in and the fact that so much of the hay is of very bad quality?  Is no thought being given to them by those opposite, by the people who shed crocodile tears over the 500 acre man, the 1,000 acre man and even the 100 acre man.</P>
      <P>What guarantee is there that the small farmers will not be required to do in seven or eight years' time what they had to do in past years&mdash;try to put back into the land what was taken out in earlier years?  Has any proof been provided that if this type of farm is continued the situation next year will not be still worse?  There is no one across there who can contend for a moment that we will not have an aggravated number of people abusing the situation next year if that price is allowed to continue?  It is an amazing situation when eight members of the Opposition Party append their names to this motion and that their leaders at no time informed them that there was a Government decision to limit the acreage of wheat.</P>

      <P>This Government is committed for the next two years to accept 270,000 tons of foreign wheat under guarantee, under the agreement which was made by the people who are now shouting in the opposite benches. Is it not a fact that if we had a normal harvest this year we would have to export or otherwise find some market for the excess wheat we would have here of our own production?  Is there any evidence that it was ever the intention of the Party opposite if they were in office for another 20 years, to bring about the day when bread would be made in this country from all Irish wheat?  Has anyone ever said that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few weeks ago, the Party opposite sought time here to refer to the difficulties which wheat growers had to meet this year in trying to get the mills to take their wheat, because of the glut which occurred over a very short period.  Is it not a fact that, were it not for the exploiters, the farmers who normally grow wheat would have been able to secure the drying facilities for their grain and is it not so that in the <Col N="1546" /> course of that debate, be it to their credit, Deputies in the opposite benches complimented the Minister on this side for the way in which he handled that situation?</P>
    <P>At this stage, I do not feel that I have anything further to add on this point.  I represent a constituency roughly half of which would be intimately concerned with this, as it grows a considerable amount of wheat.  My constituents certainly would not require the farmers on the western side of my constituency to subsidise those with the very good land to the extent of £8 an acre while they themselves have to face a longer winter and find that they have lost considerable crops in this unfortunate harvest.  No one on the Opposition side has expressed one word in relation to their difficulties. In these circumstances, it would be very wrong of any Government to permit that type of one-sided agriculture to be carried out&mdash;a situation where the country has not sufficient barley or sufficient oats.  Instead of that, the people who talk about national self-sufficiency are responsible for a situation where there are not enough foodstuffs in the country to maintain the cattle population which it is now carrying, where there is not enough barley to keep the distilleries operating and where it is necessary for this Government to place contracts abroad in order to fill the gaps created by the fact that the price for wheat last year was unreal and that the speculators came in to amass an extraordinary amount of money at the expense of the small, hard-working farmers and at the expense of the taxpayers in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to have a practical knowledge of farming to be interested in the question of wheat-growing.  Those of us in the Labour movement are interested, not because some of us have any practical experience of wheat-growing but because the subsidisation necessary for it has a direct effect on the economy of this country.  The type of bread and the price of bread and the taxation of bread are all tied up in the question whether or not we should grow wheat, whether or not we <Col N="1547" /> should pay such a price that will encourage the farmers to go in for wheat-growing on an extensive scale.  Nobody will disagree with me when I say that the farmers as a people are nobody's fool.  They will grow what in their opinion is most suitable for their land and for their pocket.</P>
      <P>What was the position in 1932? Speaking from memory, an article in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Press</i> carried a figure of 21,000 acres of wheat under cultivation.  In 1932, when the last Government came into power on that occasion, by advertisement and by making the growing of wheat a national issue, and by suggestions that anyone who did not grow wheat was a traitor to the country, the figure was trebled up to 1938.  From 1938 on to 1945, we had either war or rumours of war and I think all Parties agreed with wheat-growing then.  Wheat was essential for the life of this community, growing was made compulsory and we were all anxious that it should be so.  Even when that finished and when wheat could be got in the ordinary world markets at a considerably reduced price as compared with what we could grow it for here, the policy of growing more wheat was still insisted upon, until 1944, when we had a record crop under tillage.  We certainly had a record price paid for it. The &ldquo;get-rich-quick&rdquo; merchants who failed to respond to the demand to grow wheat during the war years later got into land, either by securing it in conacre or in some other way.  We had a wheat crop this year more than sufficient for our entire needs, with the result that, due to a contract or agreement we have, and the necessity to have our wheat turned into flour, we had to purchase a certain amount of foreign wheat to blend with our own. We have an obligation, if it is pushed on us, to take from the pool a certain amount of wheat, and we are left with a huge surplus of wheat on our hands which will be unfit for anything but feeding stuffs, and for which there will be no export market.  That is the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that when the economy of the country becomes so crazy and so <Col N="1548" /> lopsided that when a bad harvest is the best thing for the Government, the whole position of wheat-growing must be reviewed. Had we had an excellent yield, the Government would have to find increased moneys and they could only get that by further taxation.  It is bad economy when you grow something and when the very fact that it grows in abundance only means increased taxation, while the fact that you have a bad harvest means a reduction for the taxpayer.  I would suggest that the action of the Government and the Minister in reducing the guaranteed price was a prudent one and a well-advised one.  Consequently, I am in complete disagreement with the movers of the motion, because I think that the claim that the growing of wheat gave increased employment must be dismissed.  Instead of the old story that used to be thrown up in the Cumann na nGaedheal days of the man and the dog, we have now reached the stage of the man and the combine.  Wheat-growing gives very little employment, except in special circumstances such as we had this year.  Surely, it is not to be suggested that you should grow wheat and hope for rain so that you will have a big employment content in drying it out. That seems to be a funny policy, if it is correct.</P>
    <P>It is also suggested that if wheat were not grown here, we would be in a bad position if war came.  Wars do not spring up overnight and I cannot see for the life of me why sufficient seed wheat could not be retained in this country, and a reserve of wheat left in the country available for tillage when it is required.  It seems strange to me that after growing wheat from 1932 to 1938, we were in no better position to grow wheat from 1938 to 1945 than if we had not grown wheat at all before 1938.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am not a practical farmer, but, looking at it from the point of view of a reserve stock, if we were not growing wheat in those years, and if the good were not taken from the land, we would have more success when the need arose, and when we required fertile land to grow wheat.  We, in the Labour Party, approve of what has <Col N="1549" /> been done by the Government.  We feel that there is only one thing to regret, and that is that the Minister has seen fit to guarantee a price for the next two years.  Perhaps that was done with a view to helping the position created by the disastrous year that has passed.  If it is going to continue to cost this country approximately £8,000,000 a year to grow wheat, then we in the Labour movement will continue to suggest that that money could be better spent in increasing unemployment benefit, widows' and orphans' pensions, and old age pensions.  The Labour Party will certainly not disagree with any action taken by the Government to reduce taxation and to increase and improve our social benefits with the money that, in the past, has been diverted to wheat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Egan Mr. Egan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought after the way in which the recent wheat price announcement of the Minister was received in the country that he would have changed his mind.  I thought the rising flood of indignation and exasperation and the unanimous protests coming from all over, would have caused him to reconsider his decision and so avoid the necessity of proceeding with this motion at all.  He has however apparently ignored all this and has decided to stand his ground.  I have never known the farmers of this country to have been so exasperated about any action taken against their interests as they are about this action of the Minister. They are an eminently reasonable body of men, as the Minister has so lately testified, but they know that no case has been made or can be made for the reduction announced.  They know that the price paid for wheat has been one of the lowest in Europe, the fourth lowest in fact.  They know that Turkey has raised the price from 94/6 to £5 17s. 6d. per barrel.  Despite what the Minister has said about the yield in Turkey, Turkey subsidised wheat exports last year to the amount of £13,000,000.</P>

      <P>The farmers of this country also know that the Austrians <Col N="1550" /> increased the wheat price from 84/- to 87/6 per barrel for wheat bushelling 60 lb.  Of course they also know that the Swiss wheat growers can yodel away to the tune of £7 16s. per barrel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>They also know, they are painfully aware of it, that this has been the worst season in this century so far and they have been put to great extra cost to save what they have been able to save of their harvest and to suffer the complete loss of what they were not able to save.  In view of these facts is it any wonder that the Minister's announcement has been received with general hostility?  Deputies will remember that Bord na Móna found it necessary last September to increase the price of machine turf by 5/- per ton. The reason they gave was that bad weather conditions had increased the cost of harvesting turf.  I put it to the Minister: Did the same conditions not apply to the wheat harvest this year, only in a much more devastating form? I also put it to the Minister, supposing his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, were to say to Bord na Móna that they must bring down the price of machine turf next year by 10/- or 12/- per ton, and suppose Bord na Móna acted on his recommendations and proceeded to make the necessary adjustments in respect to wages, etc., what would happen?  I hope Deputies from rural constituencies, especially from wheat-growing constituencies and more especially Deputies of Clann na Talmhan, who claim to represent the farmers and wheat growers, and who favour the Minister's attitude in this matter will be honest enough to go down to their constituents and tell them: &ldquo;Your price for wheat was too much.  It is our policy to reduce the price drastically, consequently reducing the acreage and finally wiping out wheat altogether.&rdquo;  That will be their policy if they adhere to this attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although our price was one of the lowest in Europe, Britain and the Six Counties were under it, but now we are behind the United Kingdom and <Col N="1551" /> the Six Counties.  This will provide the partitionists in the North with one more argument, an economic argument, against unity.  They will be able to say: &ldquo;Our farmers in the North are getting more for wheat than the farmers south of the Border despite all the talk they have about wheat there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A good deal has been heard here about ranchers and speculators.  I certainly have no sympathy with the rancher who is developing a belated enthusiasm for wheat.  These people would not grow wheat in a national emergency.  Some of them got the wind up last winter about the immediate future of the cattle trade and were prepared to chance their arm with wheat until things had settled down again. Some more of them set their land to these speculators to whom the Minister refers.  The Minister may argue that in order to damp the ardour of these belated wheat-growers it is necessary to lower the price.  Is it fair to victimise the hard-working tillage farmers of this country in order to frighten those people away from wheat?  The Minister may very reasonably ask: what is the alternative?  My answer is that there is a method for ensuring against a surplus of beet without cutting prices, and surely a method can be found to ensure against a surplus of wheat without cutting prices.  I seriously and honestly suggest to the Minister, while I admit there are grave snags and difficulties, that if he and his Department think those difficulties are insurmountable, he should hand over the whole problem of wheat-growing, prices and control to the management of the Irish Sugar Company who have surmounted greater obstacles with a much more difficult crop.</P>
    <P>As regards the Minister's staggering proposition about prices, in addition to his announcement reducing the price of wheat he announced: &ldquo;If you hold your wheat till the 1st December you get half a crown more, if you hold it till the 1st January you get 5/- more.&rdquo; Every farmer in Ireland knows that is impracticable, and I believe the Minister himself thinks it is impracticable. If these people were to thresh their wheat before December the majority <Col N="1552" /> of them have no lofts to store it, and even if they had they would want those lofts for their feeding barley and oats. I can assure the Minister the day is gone when a farmer is going to keep his stacks in the haggard till the 1st January and give an open invitation to every rat in the country to spend the Christmas with him.</P>
    <P>The great importance of wheat to the farmer and to the nation is not sufficiently recognised generally. Whether we like it or not, it has become the great cash crop of the tillage farmer, in fact, the mainstay and hub of tillage.  It has provided capital for mechanisation of which the Minister himself is so fond and which he advocates so enthusiastically.  It has proved the greatest incentive in relation to the land project and without wheat we would be very far behind with mechanisation and very far behind with the land project, because 75 per cent. of the people who applied would not have applied otherwise.</P>
    <P>If the Minister at this late stage has not realised the great importance of wheat to the farmer, not to talk of its importance nationally, he is a far less intelligent man than I have taken him to be or else he is far less in touch with farmers and tillage in this country than he claims to be.  He has expressed more than once his deep sympathy with the farmers.  His latest action against wheat will cause grave doubt as to the sincerity of his expressions of sympathy.  I was only a few days in this House when I heard the Minister refer to what I think was a fair-day meeting which he addressed in Ennis during the last election.  He recalled that Parnell had addressed the farmers at a meeting in the very same spot in 1881.  He recalled that it was there and then that Parnell gave his famous advice to the farmers of Ireland whose holdings and homes were in danger at the time: &ldquo;Keep a firm grip on your holdings.&rdquo;  In view of the Minister's recent action against wheat and consequently against the farmers, I believe that if Parnell were with us to-day his advice to the farmers would be: &ldquo;Keep a firm grip on your livelihood and do not allow yourselves to be driven back to potatoes and salt.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this motion put down by the Opposition is pure hypocrisy.  I sat here listening to what they had to say and I have not heard anything constructive yet.  There are two former Ministers for Agriculture in the House and neither of them has spoken so far.  They should have tried to get in earlier and give the younger Deputies and the people an opportunity of hearing what the leaders of agriculture in Fianna Fáil were thinking about this.  It was definitely stated in this House that when Deputy Moher and Deputy Beegan were speaking they were unaware that it had been arranged, signed, sealed and delivered by the former Government, Fianna Fáil, that wheat-growing would be restricted.  You would think wheat-growing was the be-all and the end-all of farming in this country&mdash;that all the people had to do was to grow as much wheat as they could and they would be successful.  This is one of the worst years in our history so far as the weather is concerned.  There is not enough feeding in the haggards to winter feed the dairyman's cows. There is not enough feeding in his haggards to feed his live stock because everyone is following this will-o'-the-wisp that Fianna Fáil handed out to them last year.</P>
      <P>I realise that there may be some other Deputies who want to speak on this motion but there are a few points which I should like to reply to.  I never knew that Fianna Fáil were so concerned about small farmers until I came into this House.  I consider that Fianna Fáil are the enemies of the small farmers, that they are the destroyers of the small farmers and the butchers of their farms.  The previous speaker mentioned that Parnell, on one occasion, told the people to hold on to their holdings. We had history repeat itself in Fianna Fáil's time when the emergency man was let loose on the country.</P>

When the inter-Party Government was first formed, the biggest business that Clover Meats and Denny's were doing in Waterford was still the slaughter of calves.  After two months of inter-Party Government, calves were fetching £6, £7 and £8 apiece in this country, and not 6/-, 7/- or 8/-, because Deputy Dillon had the pluck and the initiative to go to England and settle a price&mdash;which is something his predecessors did not do.</P>

      <P>I am comparing the record of Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture with the record of his predecessors in office.  If he had followed the line which his predecessors took, he would have continued the grave injury to the agricultural industry which the Fianna Fáil Ministers for Agriculture were inflicting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moher spoke about packed mules and sweated coolies.  I saw some in my time&mdash;and it was not in the past four or five years that I saw them. <Col N="1555" /> However, I will conclude my speech by saying that when Deputy Dillon was made Minister for Agriculture a new phase came about in Irish agriculture. Agriculture was always said to be the primary industry in this country but it was not recognised as the primary industry here.  The position was that industry was subsidised in this country as against agriculture.  However, when Deputy Dillon became Minister, agriculture became the primary industry of this country in every sense of the word.  Deputy Dillon wrung more out of his Government and out of his Party for agriculture than any of his predecessors.</P>
    <P>I deplore the fact that this motion was moved in this House.  Recently, I had to listen to a debate on another motion here which was moved by the same four Deputies&mdash;a motion concerning damp wheat.  At that time, we heard Deputy Carter say that he knew a man who sold wheat for £1 a barrel. We shall have to get Dick Barton or Rip Kirby or somebody from Never-never Land to go out and find that man who sold his wheat for £1 a barrel.</P>
    <P>During this awful season that we have had, the Opposition have tried by every means in their power to confuse our farmers and to create scares.  We have heard stories that there were queues when, in fact, there were not. We heard that the mills were turning away the corn: I was told that myself by a Fianna Fáil back.  However, I went down to the corn mills myself and I discovered that, half an hour earlier, there had been a queue because a train was due at the level crossing.  If I had not made it my business to find out the truth, it would have been in the papers that there were queues outside the mills in Waterford and that they could not get in.</P>
    <P>I have to go back to my constituency and face the farmers there.  I am not afraid to do so.  I was with them last Saturday night and I was with them again last Monday.  I know that they will not be intimidated by any Fianna Fáil hacks or follow their dicta.  I know that they will not be influenced by the activities of Fianna Fáil hacks or by the directions given to Fianna Fáil cumainn to stir up as much dissension <Col N="1556" /> as possible amongst the agricultural community and in the county committees of agriculture.</P>

      <P>No, I am not.  At that time, the designated Minister for Agriculture announced that if the inter-Party Government were elected they would guarantee the price of wheat for five years.  That was during the height of the general election campaign. It is reasonable to assume that very many people were influenced by that promise and that they felt that, as honourable men, the inter-Party Government would give a fair and decent and honourable guaranteed price for wheat.  Again, I do not think I am wronging the Party opposite in making that statement.</P>
      <P>It is rather a coincidence that, on this very day when this motion as regards the price of wheat is being discussed in this House, another motion was moved to pay almost £1,500,000 by way of a bounty to people who never got wet or were out in the wet all this year.  A motion was moved to give these people an <i>ex gratia</i> payment.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary that these two motions should be moved in this House on the same day.  The farmers are going to lose from £2,000,000 to £3,000,000 in the coming year as a result of this Government's policy in the matter of wheat.</P>
      <P>We have heard much talk here about wheat ranchers.  The Minister for Agriculture has staffs throughout the country to give him records.  He mentioned four or five counties around Dublin where there are about 40 persons who ranch.  He said that one man grew 1,000 acres&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Where less than 40 people ranch large acreages of land.  I want to suggest to the Minister there is nothing to prevent anyone here going across to England and, if he can, acquiring thousands of acres of land there whereon he can grow wheat because the law there will not prevent him from growing wheat and he will get a higher price for it than that offered to our farmers by their own Government.  The Minister has all the power of law behind him.  He has a majority behind him in this House and he can pass any law he likes to prevent anyone injuring land through bad husbandry. He should not, however, penalise the 98 per cent. of our farmers who are growing wheat and have been growing wheat for years past.  I am speaking now of the ordinary medium-sized farmer, the man who grows wheat on 5, 10 or 15 per cent. of his arable land because that suits his economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No red herring should be dragged into this debate.  For 20 long years efforts have been made to kill wheat growing.  Down in the Library there is a document which should bring a blush of shame to the cheeks of anyone who reads it.  There is a document down there published by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government at the expense of the taxpayers proving why <Col N="1558" /> wheat should not be grown here. Young Deputies in this House should go down to the Library and read that document.</P>

      <P>I can prove to the Minister that many farmers who grew feeding barley in 1954, with a moisture content of 23 per cent. sold it for £18 per ton.  There are Deputies sitting behind the Minister who went down the country and announced that the price was £18 per ton, that the Minister could not afford to give any more for it and that the pig feeders could not afford to give any more for it.  He is suggesting that next year he will guarantee a price of £20 per ton for feeding barley.  I wish him <Col N="1559" /> well with it.  I hope he will get it because I do not believe it will be economic to grow feeding barley, or any barley, at £20 a ton.</P>
      <P>I want to see feeding stuffs as cheap as anyone else does here but the people who utilise their land to grow wheat, feeding barley or anything else are entitled to a fair return for their labours.  I am talking of the ordinary small farmer of ten, 15 and 35 acres. These are the backbone of the country. I have no interest in those who would ranch wheat and we on this side of the House will be behind the Minister if he takes steps to give a fair price for wheat and to eliminate these people. The Minister for Lands can eliminate them in 48 hours if he wants to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is his wont, the Minister has produced a document here to prove his rotten case.  I pity him coming in here to-night to defend such a rotten case. He is in an awkward spot and his colleagues should have stood behind him and behind the agricultural community in this very critical year through which our farmers have passed.  They are entitled to grow any kind of crop they like on their lands. The Labour Party have joined the ranks of the anti-wheat growers.  I am sure Deputy Larkin and the other members of the Labour Party could tell the history of this country when tens of thousands of their forebears died of hunger a little over 100 years ago because our farmers were forced by an alien Government to export the wheat they had grown.  It comes badly from the Labour Party that they should back up Fine Gael, the ranchers' party, who have always been opposed to tillage and wheat-growing.  Even at this late hour I hope the Government will change its mind, accept this motion and reconsider the matter in the light of next year's crop.  That is all that is asked.  They boast about guaranteeing the price for two years. Circumstances in the world may change so much inside two years that the Minister may find himself compelled to double that price.  He guaranteed the price six months ago during the election campaign.  Every farmer, every worker engaged in the harvesting <Col N="1560" /> of wheat, dependent on the mills for his employment, or even engaged in the lofts little thought, when voting for the inter-Party Government, that the very first guarantee would be a guarantee to reduce the price by £5 per ton for the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only three or four minutes according to the agreement, but I just want to put a few facts on record.  Let me give first the price of Irish wheat compared with foreign wheat, having regard to the figures given a few minutes ago by Deputy Allen, Irish wheat this year is costing at the present price 100/- a barrel on the mill floor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may say &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo;.  Let him ask my predecessor sitting over there if he will not accept that that is the correct figure.  If he does not accept it, then I will pass across this document from his own Department, a document which was issued when he was Minister for Finance.  The present price of No. 1 Manitoba on the mill floor is 78/9.  The present price of Australian is 71/3. Those are the present prices.  When these prices are in operation next year it will mean that the Irish farmer is being given over present prices 11/3 per barrel more than the price at which Manitoba can be brought in and approximately 18/- per barrel more than Australian.  Those are the equivalent factual figures given in the various memoranda which were prepared in the time of my predecessor. They are the present-day prices, not the minimum prices which were laid down under the International Wheat Agreement which was signed by the previous Government.  The price of one dollar fifty-five, payable under the International Wheat Agreement would be an even greater disparity, something like 7/- or 7/3 a barrel.  Let us get down to facts.  We had here this year as a result of the policy of the previous Government 490,000 acres of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an unseasonable harvest which we regret, and the evidence of the regret and the concern of this Government at the unseasonable harvest was shown by the way in which the Minister for Agriculture immediately changed the moisture content of the wheat and made arrangements for the purchase of unmillable wheat, action which nobody thought he would be able to take.  Had it not been for the harvest the position would clearly have been that we would have had a surplus of wheat of which we would have been unable to dispose except at a considerable loss.  What the previous Government said they wanted was 300,000 tons of dry native wheat; it was only for 300,000 tons that they were going to make storage arrangements available.  The 300,000 tons were not to be a minimum production but a maximum one, because that was all they had storage arrangements available for.  Is it not hypocritical that the Deputies on the other side of the House should now try to play a different tune?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to this debate since it commenced.  I have been listening to debates in this House for 25 years and I have always thought it was a great pity, as I do now, that wheat should be made a political question. It is a great pity indeed that the Parties opposite cannot drop the politics and look on this as a safety cash crop for the farmer.  We must remember that wheat is a very important crop for the farmers of this country.  It has varied over the past few years, but I think it has been a constant income of between £10,000,000 and £12,000,000 for the farmers&mdash;a substantial amount of money.  It is a great pity that friends of the farmers on all sides of the House&mdash;and I suppose everybody wants to see the farmer as happy as possible&mdash;could not look on this question in a reasonable way without any prejudices based on the past or anything like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not dwell on the points made about the necessity to grow wheat for security reasons.  There is a good deal in that argument but it has been fully developed.  What I do want to impress on the Deputies is that these prejudices <Col N="1562" /> have been going on for many, many years.  Deputy Allen referred here to a leaflet or a pamphlet issued in 1932 by Cumann na nGaedheal, which set out to prove that wheat could not be grown in this country.  The attitude of Fine Gael has not changed very much.  When the present Minister for Agriculture first became Minister in 1948, he was only a few days in office when he issued an advertisement to the newspapers appealing in the springtime to the farmers to grow more barley, oats and potatoes and that he would guarantee a market for these commodities.  He never mentioned wheat.  He never mentioned beet.  He told the farmers to grow more oats, more potatoes, more barley, and then, underneath that in big letters he said: &ldquo;Let us show them.&rdquo;  I do not know who &ldquo;us&rdquo; meant or who &ldquo;them&rdquo; were, but it appears that everybody accepted the fact that &ldquo;us&rdquo; was Fine Gael, the anti-wheat growers, and that &ldquo;them&rdquo; were Fianna Fáil, the wheat growers. We know the history of that year. After that guarantee of prices for barley, oats and potatoes, when these crops came on the market there was no market for them.</P>
    <P>We are told now that there is an alternative to wheat-growing, that farmers should turn to the growing of oats, barley and potatoes, and that there will be a market for them.  Let us hope there is more substance now in the Minister's promises than there was in 1948, because in 1948 were it not for the East-Donegal by-election there would have been no guaranteed price for oats.  Everybody remembers some of the pronouncements of the Minister for Agriculture in the past.  He said he would not be got dead in a field of wheat.  We know all these quotations from the Minister for Agriculture in the past and we accordingly know that we have a Minister prejudiced against wheat-growing and who was able to persuade the Fine Gael Party to follow him.  Of course, the Labour Party followed the Fine Gael Party.  The prejudice of the Labour Party was shown by Deputy Kyne, who left us in no doubt as to whether or not he was behind this motion.  He pointed out that we were paying out of the taxpayers' money £8,000,000 annually in <Col N="1563" /> subsidies on wheat, bread and flour.  He assumed that all that was due to wheat-growing in Ireland.  Of course that was done in order to serve a purpose.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned with that but I should like to point out that the subsidy is not entirely due to Irish wheat. Let us accept the figures just given by the Minister for Finance, and I am sure he made as good a case as he could against the motion we are now considering.  Even on his figures the growing of Irish wheat would be responsible only for half of the £8,000,000 and if there was no wheat at all grown in this country half of the sum would be necessary to provide bread at its present price.  But the overlooking of that is part of the prejudices of the Parties supporting the Minister for Agriculture in opposing the motion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne also said there was no labour required for wheat-growing, that all that was necessary was a man and his combine in the same way as the man and his dog were all that was necessary long ago on the grass.  Is not that again a very biased statement? Surely, nobody can suggest that no work is necessary before the combine goes into a field of wheat to harvest it. Surely everybody knows that the field has to be ploughed and that somebody must harrow it and spray it to kill the weeds.  There are various other operations to be gone through before the wheat is produced ready for the combine and it is unfair to talk about this crop in terms of the man and his combine. As I have pointed out the combine is only part of the operations of sowing wheat.  We must also remember that the combine only applies to a very small part of the crop.  A greater part of the crop is reaped by other methods &mdash;by the reaper and binder, by the mowing machine and as the Minister for Defence said, by the scythe in many cases, and very well done by the scythe, too, as he pointed out.</P>
    <P>These are all instances of the prejudices on the other side of the House against wheat-growing and we are not surprised at all if the Labour Party members go into the division lobby <Col N="1564" /> against this motion.  If we look upon wheat as a cash crop&mdash;and it is a very stable cash crop&mdash;our hope should be to get an economic price for the farmers.  The point is to find out what that economic price should be.  There should be no talk in that of world prices.  What difference is it to the farmer what prices obtain in other parts of the world?  He will make up his economy on what it costs him to grow wheat.</P>
    <P>I do not see why he should compare his costs with those of farmers in America and Denmark.  What we want to decide is an economic price for farmers here.  When I was Minister for Agriculture I always maintained that point of view.  In the growing of wheat, we sometimes gain and we sometimes lose.  During the war we gained by having wheat produced here at a cheaper price than we could import it. Now we are losing on it because we could import wheat at the moment cheaper than we could produce it at home.  But in a few years' time maybe we could make on it again.  As far as the farmer is concerned, and as far as an economic price is concerned, it makes no difference to the farmer what the world price is.  Quoting world prices will not help the problem before us of getting the farmer to grow wheat at a fair price.</P>
    <P>I suppose the information is interesting and useful to us but it should not influence us in our decision.  I saw some publication or I saw in writing, quite recently, the price of the barrel of wheat since 1932 up to the present time, giving the agricultural wage.  It was rather remarkable how the barrel of wheat was almost always about the same as the weekly wage.  The top price for this year's wheat is 82/6 but the agricultural wage is 84/- which is very close but the Government Order is to reduce that price, it is to take 12/6 off it.  It brings the barrel of wheat down to £3 10s.  There is no justification for it as far as the farmer's economy is concerned.  The farmer will not pay less rates, less wages, or less for his fertilisers.  That is admitted by everybody and there is no necessity to argue that point.  He may have to pay more.  There is no case as far as <Col N="1565" /> the farmer is concerned for bringing down that price.  If it has remained, as I say, all the time in or about that level of a week's wage, there is no case for bringing it down at the moment.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by some of the speakers to what the Fianna Fáil Government had decided upon.  That was read out here.  I do not want to go into it again in detail.  Deputy Aiken dealt with that.  I do want to deal with one aspect of it, that is, that there was no secrecy whatever.  As a matter of fact&mdash;I cannot produce it now, but I can produce it maybe to-morrow&mdash;it was in our election literature.  Here is the Official Report, Volume 146, No. 10, column 1250, of the 6th July of this year on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach.  Deputy de Valera, speaking in that debate, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Taoiseach has touched upon the difficulty that follows from the policy of guaranteed agricultural prices.  He indicates that this year something like 90 per cent. of our wheat requirements will be homegrown; I did not get quite as high a figure as that from the information supplied to me.  That that does constitute a problem we were fully aware.  Even with the lesser percentage which I understood was likely to result it was constituting a problem, and we were facing it by having a definite policy in that regard. We felt we should aim at having at least two-thirds of our wheat requirements produced here.  There would be a certain amount of fluctuation upwards and downwards from that but that would roughly be the aim which would best serve the national interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Three hundred thousand tons of dried wheat are, I think, as near as can be to two-thirds of our requirements.  Deputy de Valera, speaking here on the Taoiseach's Estimate, when he was in opposition, made that statement when there was no necessity for him to divulge this secret that the Minister, Mr. Dillon, made so much about and with his usual buffoonery amused his followers over there.  There was no necessity to divulge the secret, but Deputy de Valera took it in his stride <Col N="1566" /> and gave it without any hesitation whatever.  So all this talk about secrecy is all gone, and if the eight innocent Deputies that were referred to put down this motion without knowing what they were walking into&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can understand the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party making up their minds that wheat-growing does not fit in with their policy.  It is the Fianna Fáil policy and therefore they should get rid of it. If, however, they had any sympathy with the farmers who suffered so much during this last harvest, they should have made up their minds: &ldquo;Well, not this year, give them a chance&rdquo; or, if they even wanted to indicate their prejudice, their hostility, to wheat-growing, they could announce a token reduction of about 1/- a barrel.  This reduction of 12/6 per barrel, which amounts to £5 per acre, is a drastic reduction.  I think that word describes it very mildly.  It is enough indeed to kill wheat-growing and certainly would kill wheat-growing if farmers had an alternative crop to turn to.  Of course, I know that cynical people say: &ldquo;What can he do?  He has no other crop to turn to.&rdquo;  That is very poor consolation indeed for a man who is up against it and feels that wheat-growing is no longer attractive to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point to which I would like to refer.  The Order does seek to give some reward to the farmer <Col N="1568" /> who harvests his crop carefully but I think everybody admits that the 1st December is a ridiculous date as far as that is concerned.  If you want to hit at the ranchers and the speculators, personally, I would be all with that, if any solution can be found.  A solution has been suggested, to let the Land Commission deal with it.  If no other solution can be found, I would say &ldquo;go ahead&rdquo; but, if you want to let them off on the low price, they must combine, they must market their wheat immediately and there is no necessity to wait until 1st December in order to give a decent ordinary farmer a better price.  The half-crown would not be sufficient.  It should be something more than that.  The Minister should amend this Order and make it a token reduction.  Make it a large reduction up to the middle of October to get at the rancher and speculator but, from the middle of October, if it was only a token reduction, he might not meet with so much opposition.  This year, it was very unwise and very unfair to interfere with the price at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is entitled: &ldquo;An Act to amend the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts, 1939 to 1953&rdquo;.  Since 1924 there has been legislation enabling the Minister for Industry and Commerce to provide guarantees for loans to assist in industrial development both <Col N="1573" /> for new industries and for established concerns wishing to expand their activities where the granting of guarantees was calculated to promote employment.  The legislation also provided for the actual grant of loans for similar purposes although in fact this power has never been used.</P>
    <P>As a preliminary to the guaranteeing or granting of any loan under the Trade Loans Acts it is necessary to consult an Advisory Committee and the sanction of the Minister for Finance is also required before facilities can be granted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The first legislative provision was made in the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1924, which provided that guarantees or loans might be granted to companies and public authorities for the purpose of meeting expenditure on buildings, plant and machinery and other fixed assets.  The operation of this Act was limited to one year, but by a series of amending Acts from 1925 to 1932, inclusive, the Minister's powers were continued.</P>
    <P>In 1933 the scope of the trade loans scheme was extended by the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act of that year which enabled loans to be guaranteed or granted for the provision of working capital in addition to the acquisition of fixed assets.  At the same time individuals, as distinct from companies, became eligible for trade loan facilities.</P>
    <P>The duration of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1933, was limited to five years and on its expiry the Minister's powers in regard to trade loans were renewed for another five years by the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1939, which also fixed £1,000,000 as the total of guarantees and loans which might be granted under that Act.  These powers were renewed for further periods of five years in 1944 and 1949.</P>
    <P>The Trade Loans (Guarantee) (Amendment) Act, 1953, increased to £1,500,000 the total of guarantees and loans which might be granted and also removed the limitation of the period during which grants or guarantees might be given.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> Of the £1,500,000 provided under the Acts of 1939 and 1953 the Minister has given his guarantee or has indicated his willingness to give such guarantee to the extent of £1,241,000 and further applications in respect of substantial amounts are under consideration. Inquiries are constantly being received regarding the provision of financial assistance for industry by way of trade loan guarantees, and I am satisfied, therefore, that it is desirable, at this stage, to increase the existing limit of £1,500,000.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is, therefore, to increase by £1,000,000 the aggregate capital amount of loans which may be granted or guaranteed.</P>
    <P>It is very desirable that some machinery should continue to exist to enable me, with a view to the promotion of employment, to afford financial assistance for industrial development which might not in the ordinary way appeal to the banks or to other financial institutions, including the Industrial Credit Company, Limited. The advantage of the trade loans (guarantee) system, as compared with ordinary commercial banking facilities, is that it provides a fixed long term period of repayment for which industrialists can budget in their costings. Banks normally require loans to be repaid over a short period, usually less than five years, while the Industrial Credit Company affords financial assistance to industry mostly in cases of large amounts where public issues can be arranged.</P>
    <P>Under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts from 1924 to 1953 guarantees were given in the case of 117 undertakings amounting in the aggregate to £2,191,411.  In addition, guarantees have been promised to the extent of £202,000 in six cases in which certain legal and financial arrangements have yet to be completed by the firms concerned. In the case of 71 undertakings the loans totalling £761,411 were fully repaid by the borrowers while 19 undertakings, two of them public authorities, are actively operating at present with the assistance of guarantees totalling £827,500.  In the case of 27 undertakings involving guarantees totalling £602,740 it was necessary to <Col N="1575" /> appoint receivers and some of these companies ceased to operate.  Repayments to the Exchequer in cases where receivers were appointed amounted to £157,500.  Total losses to the Exchequer were £443,786, including interest.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill, as already indicated, is to increase by £1,000,000 to £2,500,000 the aggregate capital amount of loans which may be granted or guaranteed.  I trust that the House will see its way to approve the Bill as an agreed measure.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take the remaining stages now.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee and reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Local Government Bill, 1954&mdash; Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 33.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned yesterday, I was putting the suggestion to the Minister that he might accept the amendment or at least inform us that he was prepared to consider it carefully and deal with it later on the Report Stage.  Briefly, the purpose of the amendment is to empower the elected representatives to alter the names of streets or places. Power is given under existing Acts for them to initiate proposals, but the power to change the names of streets relies on a plebiscite being taken and the regulations made under the 1946 Act provided that a majority of four-sevenths of the ratepayers in a particular street must vote in favour of the change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, I am advised that the plebiscite is strictly limited to the ratepayers.  You may have a situation in a city or urban area where, while there might be a large number of residents in the particular street willing <Col N="1576" /> to agree to the change, because they are not clearly designated as ratepayers it is not possible to make a change.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree, on careful consideration of the matter, that local authorities&mdash;urban councils, councils of boroughs, etc.&mdash;do not lightly wish to alter the names of streets; but I think they should be afforded an opportunity of paying tribute by calling the principal streets of the cities or towns after people who have given their lives for this country.</P>
    <P>We have a particular case in the City of Dublin where, on more than one occasion, efforts have been made by representatives of the organisations who fought for the liberty of our country to get the name of one of our principal streets changed, without avail.  For some unknown reason, the majority of the rated occupiers in that particular street were not prepared to let the tribute be paid.  I refer to a street leading from oue of our main railway stations, a street leading from Amiens Street up to O'Connell Street &mdash;Talbot Street.  I think it will be remembered that a man famous in the struggle for independence gave his life for our country in that street.  There is a memorial to his name in the form of a plaque in that street, but the street bears the name of Talbot Street, not the name of Seán Tracy Street. This street, I understand, was named as far back as 1821.  It was named Talbot Street after a gentleman who bore the names Charles Chetwynd Talbot, 3rd Earl of Talbot, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland from 1817 to 1821.  It previously bore the name of Cope Street, North.  Evidently the authorities at that time had some method of changing the name.  I submit that the local authority in this case, the representatives of this city, should in a reasonable way be afforded an opportunity to change the name of that particular street.</P>
    <P>In addition, I would make the general case.  In our city we can by resolution call new highways and byways after people who served this nation.  We had numerous cases of narrow residential streets, consisting of 20, 30 or 40 houses, connecting with no main highways, and we have been compelled <Col N="1577" /> when wishing to honour the city, by calling a highway after someone who has served the nation, to put his name on a small street such as I have described. I do not think that there would be any intention on the part of local authorities in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or any town or city in the country, to enter into an immediate race to change the names of all their streets but I do think that the local authority should have this power subject to the consent of the Minister.  If the proposal, in any particular instance, appears to be frivolous the Minister would be there as a protection.  In addition, the amendment proposes that residents in the street would have the right of appeal because the amendment provides that where four-sevenths of the ratepayers in a street object to changing the name of the street, they may appeal to the Minister.  I put it to the Minister, and I hope he will listen to our appeal in this matter, that he should not take away from the elected representatives of the people in this Bill power and authority to record, in some permanent form, their recognition of the sacrifices of those who served the nation.  Certainly in this particular case I think our amendment can almost stand or fall on the plea that under the present laws, and the regulations arising from these laws, even though each and every member of the Dublin Corporation or each and every member of this House feels that it would be right and proper to rename Talbot Street, Seán Tracy Street, it cannot be done because of the fact that two, three, four or half-a-dozen ratepayers can defy the wishes of the elected representatives, not only in the corporation but even in this House unless this provision is changed.</P>
    <P>This situation possibly exists in other cities in the country and I think it is one that should be remedied.  I believe that it is proposed to restore within a very short time to public representatives on the local level some authority.  At the present moment public representatives on corporations, county councils, etc., have the right to strike rates, the right to take money off the ratepayers, but they have not the right to honour people who were not <Col N="1578" /> only prepared to, but who actually did, sacrifice their lives for this country. Surely it is a small thing to ask the Minister to agree to this amendment. I am aware that members, both on this side of the House and the other, would possibly have much more right than I to raise this matter because they are people who were personally acquainted with the man whose name each and every member of the corporation desires to honour in this fashion.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment and to afford us this opportunity or, if not, to bring in an amendment on similar terms himself on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a lot of sympathy with the movers of this amendment.  I often think that our present system of conferring Christian names on human beings is wrong.  We have it at the christening functions in which the unfortunates concerned have no say whatsoever. I am told, by people who remember, that after World War I, veterans who fought at the famous battle at Ypres who wished to commemorate the heroic sacrifices of their friends, christened their children with names such as John Ypres Smith.  The unfortunate children concerned have the name &ldquo;Ypres&rdquo; wrapped round their necks still and they can never get rid of it.  I think that if these children had some say in the matter they would certainly never have permitted a famous battle such as that of Ypres to be commenorated in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose under this section to give the ratepayers of a street some say in the naming of it.  I propose giving the occupiers of small dwellings a say in the naming of it, in other words, to bring them in at the christening of their own homes and to give them an opportunity of having some say in what the name of the location of their home is going to be.  I can visualise Dublin Corporation with a Fianna Fáil majority deciding to call some of their new streets, say, Briscoe Street. Immediately afterwards we may have a Labour Corporation coming in and deciding to rename the street by calling it Larkin Street.  Then, possibly, <Col N="1579" /> Fine Gael will come along if they get a majority and decide to rename it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The purpose of the amendment is merely to enable the Dublin Corporation to have the same facilities in regard to the provision of buildings in the nature of community halls, and so on, as those which are at present available for the county councils, thus enabling the county councils to make grants to voluntary bodies from time to time for the provision of certain amenities.  There has been a great deal of difficulty in Dublin from that point of view and I wonder could the Minister consider extending these facilities to Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no doubt that under Section 73 of the 1941 Act it was the intention to assist rural <Col N="1580" /> Ireland and rural Ireland only.  We are aware of the fact that in county boroughs and towns we have sufficient facilities and I would suggest that the Deputy would be cutting completely across Section 73 of the 1941 Act by having this amendment accepted.  I am very sorry I cannot see my way to accept it but I would be prepared to consider the matter between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that at the time of the passing of the 1941 Act there was probably no necessity for it in Dublin, but Dublin has grown tremendously in the last ten or 15 years and one of the problems in Dublin, particularly in the newly built areas, is the provision of some kind of community centres which are lacking. It is really a very urgent problem now. The general policy of the corporation and the Department of Local Government&mdash;a policy which I think was a wise one at the time and one to which we all probably subscribed&mdash;was that the first essential was the provision of houses and that all the money available should be devoted to that purpose, and the development of community life could follow afterwards.  By and large while there was a strong argument for that at the time, the result of that policy has not been a particularly sound one in that we have failed to develop that kind of civic spirit and community life in the newly built areas which we might have been able to develop had we provided some kind of community centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment in the newly built areas there are practically no facilities for ordinary community life or community centres.  That means that the young people are forced to go into the city which is not particularly good for the development of the area and, in addition, the cost of the amenities is increased considerably if they have to expend, say, 8d. to 10d. to come into the city to a hall.  But a far greater reason than that is that they are forced away from their own surroundings right into the city.  The provision of halls has become an urgent problem in those areas.  I am speaking now of areas such as Drimnagh, Crumlin, Ballyfermot, <Col N="1581" /> Cabra and so on.  Some members of the Corporation are very keen to have the provisions of Section 73 of the 1941 Act extended to the city if at all possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I have to find myself in complete disagreement with the suggestion behind this amendment. We will be dealing with another amendment to Section 54 which would give the local authority the right to advance money on loan, and would meet the situation as we understand it in the corporation.  The difference as regards the provisions in Section 73 of the 1941 Act is that they were designed for the purpose of according facilities in undeveloped areas, rural Ireland, where they had no great facilities such as cinemas or halls of any kind and where the population was naturally small in number.  We know there is a need for the facility of what we might call parochial halls but, particularly in the City of Dublin, they have to be under some agreed form of control.  The corporation could not itself erect hundreds of small halls all over the city and take the responsibility for looking after them. The argument Deputy MacBride has used would be better used in connection with the amendment to Section 54.  I would say that, subject to Deputy Larkin's expressing a view, it would be better for us to have the powers we ask for in the amendment to Section 54.</P>

      <P>May I fortify the <Col N="1582" /> Minister's mind on this point?  The whole purpose of Section 73 was to correct the drift from rural Ireland to the towns and cities.  One of the contentions on that subject has always been that a material cause of the drift was the lack of recreational facilities in rural Ireland.  If the Minister proceeds to widen the section to give facilities in the cities and towns, I think the section might as well never have been there at all.</P>

      <P>I do not mean to be discourteous to Deputy MacBride.  If I had said last night that I would consider the matter, it would have saved an hour of the time of this House but I refrained from giving such an undertaking. I do not wish to be discourteous to Deputy MacBride because I appreciate the motives behind his amendment.  However, at this stage, perhaps I should explain that this Section 53 arises as the result of the reception of a deputation from Fóras Éireann by the then Parliamentary Secretary, now the present Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Corish, on the 15th June, 1950.  As a result of a deputation which he received on that date, this section has been inserted. Fóras Éireann is a body which was set up partly to assist rural communities in the provision of parish halls.  It got £22,000 from the Carnegie Trustees and distributed the moneys in the years 1949-1950 by way of grant or loan to 12 rural communities for the <Col N="1583" /> building of halls.  This assistance, unfortunately, ceased in 1950.  The deputation from the body represented that the provision in the 1941 Act under which a hall could be provided by the local authority did not stimulate local interest, and one can appreciate why it did not.  In the first place, local interest depended on the local authority's providing the hall.  The local authorities fought shy of providing halls because they were afraid of the cost of maintenance and the cost of running them.  It was then suggested by Fóras Éireann that assistance should be given to rural communities by way of grant to assist them in procuring a hall and to stimulate local enterprise and local interest.  Really, it is as a result of that deputation that this section was inserted in this particular Bill&mdash;and the House will appreciate why.</P>
      <P>In August, 1952, the Arts Council proposed that approximately £30,000 a year should be made available by the Government for the provision of halls in rural areas in which dramatic performances or concerts could be given and exhibitions of various kinds held.  That particular proposal contemplated the building of 300 such halls in ten years.  My predecessor held that the scheme was fantastic and I must say I agree.  The Government, at a meeting on the 8th November, 1952, decided that the proposal should not be approved&mdash;and, again, I must say I agree.  That is the position and I am sure Deputy MacBride will appreciate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things that are forgotten in an amendment of this nature is who is to pay for amenities of this nature.  It is bad enough when one has to deal with necessary amenities: they are costly and it is difficult to find the money for them.  However, when it comes to another type of amenity, it must be realised that it will have to be paid for by the community in one form or another.  In this particular regard, I think you could hardly ask the Minister to take a provision of this nature just as it is stated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the <Col N="1584" /> idea behind Deputy MacBride's amendment is one which will find ready support from all sections of the House. Whether or not Deputy MacBride's amendment would have greater or lesser merit than the amendment to which Deputy Briscoe referred is a matter for debate.  However, what I want to say is that if the Minister rejects this amendment, I hope he will not reject is for the reasons given by Deputy Sheldon.  In my view, it would be entirely wrong that we should approach legislation in this House along the lines outlined by Deputy Sheldon.  The view that because a particular thing was introduced for the benefit of rural areas it should be considered as an automatic exclusion of similar facilities for areas such as those spoken of by Deputy MacBride would, I think, be an entirely wrong approach.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>In the three areas together, there is a bigger population than in Drogheda.  I think there is very nearly as large a population in the three areas together as there is in Limerick City.  It does seem fantastic that, in the year 1954, you find a population of 40,000 or 50,000 persons without even one community hall where they can get together and hold meetings, whist drives or other recreational facilities of that sort.  That is the position.  Deputy MacBride knows it, Deputy Briscoe knows it and I know it. I do not intend to discuss Deputy Briscoe's amendment at this stage but, since a comparison has been drawn between the two amendments, Deputy Briscoe's amendment&mdash;which is supported also by Deputy Larkin and <Col N="1585" /> Deputy A. Byrne&mdash;does seem to me to be rather a fairer approach to the problem in that it deals with the manner in which the proposed erection of halls of this sort would be financed. As between the two amendments, I would rather incline in favour of the next amendment dealing with this matter.  In any event, I hope the Minister will consider one amendment or the other or, if not the amendments as worded, something similar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I should like to say something on it before withdrawing it.  The Minister has been so patient that I do not want to add to his troubles by way of delays here. However, there are a couple of things that have been said that I should like to refer to.  In the first place, Deputy de Valera said he did not regard the provision of halls in Dublin as necessary amenities.  That is a completely erroneous view.  In my opinion, and I think I know as much about the City of Dublin as Deputy de Valera, the increase in juvenile delinquency is largely due to the fact that we have failed to provide local amenities for the young people and the residents generally in the newly built-up areas and the young people, therefore, are forced into the city because of that lack.  However, I do not want to digress too long on that aspect of it. The Minister introduced his little irrelevancy by saying that the last Government had turned down a proposal by the Arts Council to build 300 halls in ten years and that he entirely approved of the last Government's decision to turn down that proposal. Now I think that was a retrograde step.  The provision of 300 halls would have been a valuable asset to the community generally.  One of the causes of rural depopulation is the lack of such halls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Col N="1586" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that, but 30 halls in the condition in which the country is at the moment are only a drop in the ocean; I would much prefer to see 300 built.  Lastly, I think the Minister dealt with this amendment as if it was an amendment to Section 53.  It was not intended as an amendment to the existing section but rather as a new section.  However, in view of the fact that Deputies representing the Dublin Corporation have an amendment dealing with the same matter we can consider the whole question on that amendment and I will, therefore, withdraw mine.</P>

I may mention, however, the fact that halls have been built at Ballyduff, near Lismore; at Tubbercurry; at Ardara; at Mooncoin, County Donegal; at Lettermacaward in County Donegal; at Kincasslagh in County Donegal.  I am afraid to mention too many in Donegal because the Deputy may become suspicious.</P>

      <P>In line 29, before &ldquo;to&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a loan&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is about time a country Deputy got in, considering all the dispute there has been about Dublin City.  It is time the countryman's point of view was put. If we intend to stop the flight to Dublin and the other big towns, it is time the country got a look in.  My colleague, Deputy de Valera, with whom I profoundly disagree in his approach to this matter, needs a little enlightenment.  I want to give him certain facts.</P>
      <P>First of all, when the Carnegie Trust made its funds available there was such a rush for the funds that they were used up in a very short time.  If a similar fund was opened to-morrow morning, the moneys would be used and used to good advantage.  Country people have as much right to dance as city people.  They have as much right to go to a hall.  They have as much right to have amusements as the people in the city.  If it is logical to make a case for Crumlin to have a hall, and all these other places, will anyone say that anyone in the Dáil will stop a dance being held there?  Is there anything wrong in having a dance in such a hall?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I live within four miles of one of these Carnegie halls.  It is a model.  It is in Collinstown, County Westmeath; Collinstown is a small village with a couple of hundred people.  Those people collected £500 and planked the money down to show the trustees they were in earnest.  They got a loan of £1,000 free of interest and they got a grant.  I have the facts here from one of the most active men in County <Col N="1588" /> Meath, one of the men most active in taking advantage of the Carnegie Trust funds.  I will not give his name and I will not delay the House by reading all that he has to say.  He has been responsible for the erection of a number of these halls.  Here is how the financial side of it works: (1) there is a free grant of £1,000 and a loan of £1,500 free of interest to small villages or rural communities with a population of 750 or under; (2) there is a free grant of £1,000 and a loan of £3,000 free of interest to large villages with a population of over 750, the loan to be repaid in seven yearly instalments and the first instalment to be paid one year after the completion of the hall.  A local committee must be formed for the purpose of collecting funds by means of whist drives, dances, etc.  I will not go into any more detail.</P>
    <P>Let me enumerate now the uses to which Collinstown Hall is put.  We have an agricultural committee and lectures in agriculture are given in that hall.  So are lectures in horticulture. We have a vocational committee in Westmeath and every year there are a number of lectures under the auspices of the R.D.S.  I invite Deputy de Valera to come down to some of these lectures, and I will show him a packed hall.  There are more than half a dozen such lectures every year.  Furthermore, there are vocational classes held during the winter months under the local centre at Castlepollard.  Even if dances are held in between, what harm is there in that?  Is not that an amenity?  If there was no hall in Collinstown the people would go into Mullingar.  They have as much right to dance in Collinstown as the people in Mullingar have to dance in Mullingar.  Has not the State as much right to contribute and the local council as much right to advance public funds as they had when they erected the county hall in Mullingar?  Why not establish the same principle as the Carnegie Trust Fund to help out the local people? Villages with small populations of 250, or so, have not the amenities that the people in the cities and towns have.  They have no electricity.  Very <Col N="1589" /> often they have neither water nor sewerage.  I suppose that will come in time.  I am not blaming anyone for that lack.  They have no steamrolled roads such as they have in Crumlin and other places.  Their county roads are full of pot-holes.</P>

      <P>I am speaking the truth.  The Minister knows it himself. Every Deputy knows it.  Yet, when we come to provide some amenity in order to keep the people in the rural areas and arrest the flight from the land we are met with all manner of resistance. I think such moneys would be very well spent.  There is a slight error in my amendment.  The amendment I would have the Minister accept is: &ldquo;The county council may make a grant or a loan, or both.&rdquo;  I put in &ldquo;or both&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I intended.  I appeal to the Minister, in the first place, and to the House, to accept this.  If the same action is taken as I have seen taken in Meath and Westmeath, and if it is applied in the same way throughout rural Ireland, with the same provisions and the same set of rules as Fóras Éireann has, then you will bring a new outlook to the people and make life worth while in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kennedy and with his countryman approach.  It is the approach which some of us have been trying to make here for the past three weeks.  Like Deputy Kennedy, I am honest enough to admit that I have become bogged down by the legal fraternity who know nothing about the country.  I agree entirely with Deputy Kennedy's natural approach to this problem. There may be a fair tioscán of halls in Donegal, but there are not many of them in Cork.  In the counties where our roads have potholes we need them too.  As I said, the views expressed by Deputy Kennedy on this matter are agreeable with my own and I think the Minister should look <Col N="1590" /> into them.  Whatever amenities they may have in the large towns and cities we do not begrudge them, but I say that we are entitled to a fairer share of amenities in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is not the people's fault that they have not got them.  The people must be given a chance.  If there were provision by way of grant or loan or both it would undoubtedly mean a lot. There is provision in another section of this Bill whereby county councils have the right to give a grant for the building of halls but, as a member of Cork County Council, I would say that of the 46 members there would be 35 or 36 sudden deaths if I stood up at a meeting and proposed that a grant be given for these things.  Let us face it from the natural viewpoint and in that way try to help the people of rural Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Kennedy, who made slightly disparaging remarks about the people in Crumlin, that these people have little or no amenities.  Apart from that I am whole-heartedly behind the amendment, but I do not see why there should be any conflict between the interests of the city and the country in these matters.  It does appear to me a sensible thing that if financial facilities are being made available for the building of halls, county councils should be able to give these facilities by way of loan.  I can see, as Deputy Desmond does, that county councils might find themselves faced with sudden vacancies if proposals were brought occasionally for the giving of grants for the building of halls.  It is much more likely that we would have halls built if councils were able to give loans.  I am glad the Minister has brought in this section which, I think, would be improved by the amendment.  It would enable the working out of a more comprehensive scheme for the building of halls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I was touched by what Deputy Desmond had to say about the poor unfortunates living down in rural Ireland, but under the Act of 1941 the local authorities were permitted to build halls in rural Ireland in order to encourage people to remain on the land.  Deputy <Col N="1591" /> Kennedy is a member of a local authority.  He has been since 1941, and in that time not one solitary hall has been built by the local authority of which he is a member.  They have not lifted their finger to retain the people on the land.  Yet, by this amendment, he now asks me to give the local authorities permission to give loans for the building of halls.  I can see now how useless the section of the 1941 Act has proved, and I have amended that by saying: &ldquo;Look here, we will not ask local authorities to build halls but we will give local authorities the power to give free grants towards the building of halls.&rdquo;  I think I have gone a long distance, but Deputy Kennedy asks me to go further, although he did nothing himself as a member of a county council to avail of the facilities of the 1941 Act.</P>
      <P>We are inclined to forget that if we give a loan it must be repaid.  We seem to forget that the people from whom we are seeking the loan are themselves depending on loans which they themselves must repay.  We are inclined to forget that if a local authority is giving a loan the first thing they will require is security.</P>

The local authority might be much more lenient if the committee failed to function.

They dare not.  In connection with a loan it may be possible to make regulations.  The Minister is taking quite a lot of power to make regulations which will govern the issue of loans when the local difficulties would not arise.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1941 Act the county council could allow a local area under its control to build, to supply them with furniture and other facilities but then there was a question of who managed or controlled the hall.  In other words, it would be a hall belonging to the council and they would rent it out.  The Minister, in the section he is introducing in this Bill, wants to go a little bit further and he says: &ldquo;I am now giving you powers to make grants.&rdquo;  In the argument that has developed the Minister talked about the risk attaching to the ownership of the particular hall when it is completed or built if the money is not repaid, if portion of it or all of it is by way of loan, and then he talked of the possibility of getting similar conditions by an underwriter.  The local authority might find it less costly to give a very small grant and to facilitate with a loan than by giving a grant because, if <Col N="1594" /> you want to give a grant that will enable the structure to be built, in relation to the cost of that unit, it will have to be a reasonably sized grant and this grant would be multiplied, as the Minister realises, over every parish or every small parish.</P>
      <P>What is the trouble about ownership? The Dublin Corporation have discussed this matter.  A local council or county council may authorise a loan even without a grant to a local group for a specific purpose under terms and conditions.  They do not have to hand over title until the money is fully repaid.  Surely the wisdom of legal luminaries attached to local authorities can ensure that the local committee will only be a caretaker committee until they have paid off the loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>They have that power under the 1941 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talked about the difficulty that would arise about ownership afterwards.  Provision can be made beforehand.  At any time, as Deputy Sheldon says, a properly drawn up direction can issue by way of regulation or directive from the Minister to each local authority. Deputy Kennedy's remarks should not be misunderstood.  He was making a comparison between the situation in rural Ireland as compared with the facilities and amenities already existing in urban areas or in a city like Dublin.  He is not finding fault or wishing to take them away.  The Minister ought to accept this amendment. He can make certain regulations. He can limit, if he likes, the proportion of the cost of a building that should be by way of grant and can provide that there should be a maximum.  Then, the local authority also want power and we want the power.  We do not want to issue loans.  Responsible authorities who wish to build parochial halls, who have approached us, want a loan and they do not even want it free of interest, but they want us to give it at a reasonably low rate of interest. These things should be left to the local authorities to decide, depending upon the need, the cost of the particular structure and the terms and <Col N="1595" /> conditions under which the loan can be paid off.  Deputy Kennedy read out the terms and conditions attaching to the Carnegie Loan.  They do not necessarily have to be the same. There is no reason why repayments should be over a longer period than the five years attaching to the loan of the Carnegie Trust.  The Minister should accept the principle, and as Deputy Sheldon rightly says, hammer out the terms and conditions on which it can be operated from the point of view of protection to the authority which gives the loan with regard to ownership of the property, the property not being transferred from them until the loan is completely paid; giving the authority a right to go up to a certain maximum by way of grant and the balance by loan; that they can decide the matter in relation to the particular local need and the local conditions, the circumstances of the people in the area, their ability to meet certain charges; and to fix also a nominal rate of interest, if they so desire.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The county council may purchase in fee simple or for any <Col N="1596" /> less estate or interest or take on lease for any term any land for and including a building to be provided under the section and for that purpose Part V of the Public Assistance Act, 1939 (No. 27 of 1939), shall apply as if such land were being acquired for the purposes of the powers and duties of a public assistance authority under that Act.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There are three different things here.  The amendment by Deputy MacBride which was withdrawn related to an entirely different item altogether from what is referred to in amendment No. 44.  That amendment seeks to put in a new section to allow the Dublin Corporation to make loans&mdash;not to give grants.  Deputy Kennedy's amendment is designed to allow a county council, in its wisdom, to give either a grant or a loan, or both, under terms and conditions suitable to the particular circumstances.</P>

      <P>To add at the end of the section the following sub-sections (as sub-sections to be added to Section 73 of the Act of 1941):&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  The county council may, for the purposes of this section, borrow in the same manner as they may borrow for the purpose of defraying expenses under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, 1878 to 1953.</P>
      <P>(6)  Money borrowed pursuant to this section may be lent to the county council by means of an issue from the local loans fund as if such loan constituted a local loan within the meaning of the Local Loans Fund Acts, 1935 to 1953, and was authorised by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to enable a local authority to borrow for the purpose of making grants towards the provision of parish halls.  I think I have already said that on an earlier section.  The borrowing power is the same as that for local authorities assisting in the provision of swimming facilities as provided in Section 54 and the borrowing will be subject to the limitation of twice the valuation of the county council's area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  As I explained on amendment No. 37, the purpose of the section in the 1941 Act was merely to enable local authorities in a rural area to provide facilities for certain amenities to residents of these rural areas. The Deputy wishes me to extend these facilities to county boroughs.  If the local committee in a county borough are trustworthy they can always raise the money themselves through a bank or otherwise.  If they are not trustworthy, the local authority should not <Col N="1606" /> make moneys available to them by way of loan.  As Deputy Kennedy said we are anxious to retain the people on the land of this country.  We are anxious to retain them in rural Ireland.  It was for that purpose the section was inserted in the 1941 Act. I am merely trying to implement the section of the 1941 Act by the present section.  I am sorry I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say this.  I said it already in relation to Deputy Sheldon.  I am very sorry that the Minister approached the amendment on the basis on which he did because I think his arguments are fallacious.  The Minister reads the amendment in relation to Dublin City by saying that if the people are trustworthy people they can raise loans from the bank or elsewhere.  I cannot follow the reasoning.  Would it not be just as correct to say in relation to rural areas that if the people are trustworthy they can raise loans this way or that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I have said already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that already, but he is basing his objection to this amendment on the differentiation between the city dweller and the rural dweller.  I quite appreciate that when the previous Act was under discussion, it was intended to add to the facilities of rural areas and to do that for the purpose of keeping people on the land.  I wish to point out that you do not in any way nullify or negative that objective by giving equal facilities to city areas.  It must be remembered that, even since 1941, there has been colossal building in Dublin City, and there are vast areas&mdash;they were mentioned by previous speakers, Drimnagh, Crumlin, Kimmage, Ballyfermot, Cabra and other areas&mdash;where you have a huge population. These people were taken out from the centre of the city where these facilities we are discussing, while not readily available to them at least were more readily available than they are now.  Those people were taken out and in some cases they were put three, four, five, six and seven miles from <Col N="1607" /> the centre of the city.  The plea which is being made is that, in relation to those areas, machinery should exist to assist local committees or approved persons, as Deputy Briscoe has mentioned, if they are prepared to undertake the task of building parochial halls or community centres.  I feel that that is worth considering.  Remember, we are not looking for authority to give the ratepayers' money away freely.  I believe that is an important distinction between the amendment being discussed now and the earlier amendment.  We are not looking for any authority from the Oireachtas to dissipate the ratepayers' money in any way.  All we are doing is looking for authority to utilise moneys raised by means of a loan repayable to the local authority.</P>
      <P>The Minister or other speakers may make the argument&mdash;it has been made &mdash;&ldquo;Surely these people can get loans from the bank if they are trustworthy.&rdquo; They can, but if authority were given to the Dublin Corporation to make these loans the corporation would have discretion as to the rate of interest, perhaps not generally on loans but on considering each individual case.  Those of us who represent the new housing areas in Dublin know very well that 1 per cent. or even a ½ or a ¼ per cent. may make a considerable difference to the plans of local committees in deciding whether or not they will undertake the task of building these halls.</P>
      <P>I want to say this to the Minister and I feel bound to say it.  It was only during the present week&mdash;on Tuesday of this week&mdash;that I attended a meeting of an association in the Crumlin-Kimmage-Drimnagh area where for years they have been urging, through representatives in the Dáil and on the corporation, that something like this be done to assist them in building parochial halls.  I feel it is a good thing to encourage that kind of civic interest in these new housing areas as well as in other areas throughout the city.  By adopting a proposal such as this, in this form or in another form, the Minister will be giving some encouragement to these people, at no cost to the ratepayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> Consequently, I was very glad to hear the Minister say earlier that he would consider this matter seriously. I hope that the fact that the discussion on the amendment has been segregated will not segregate the Minister's good intentions in the matter.</P>

      <P>I suppose the Minister is at liberty to say that.  The fact remains that the area I have the honour to represent is in a very bad way for social amenities.  In Ballyfermot, West Finglas, Artane and such places, there is no place where you can have a meeting except in some of the local houses.  That is very undesirable. Otherwise, for a meeting of an association or for any other matter, they have to come in to a hall in the city.  There is no library or hall of any description. Only yesterday, two deputations were in with me from one area, stating there was not a hall there although they have 40,000 of a population.  Surely that area is worthy of consideration for a parochial hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asked why the people could not raise the money themselves. These unfortunate people have just gone out to new houses and have to <Col N="1609" /> pay rent for them and pay for furniture. Even for the children and for the good of the nation as a whole, it is essential to have these local halls.  Any encouragement we can give from this House to provide such halls and give them the same concessions as are given to the people of rural Ireland will be worthwhile, so I strongly urge on the Minister to consider that matter.</P>

It is a serious and acute problem in the newly build areas in Dublin. Voluntary committees and organisations have been doing Trojan work in trying to provide amenities.  It has been a great anxiety to the clergy in these areas that there are no amenities available and that the young people are driven out in the evenings into the city to get some form of social life or amusement.  I appeal to the Minister to alter his decision, as the taking of the two amendments together or separately should not affect the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, it is very seldom that you get Deputies of all Parties agreeing here on the necessity for a measure. I think the Deputies from Dublin City and particularly those who represent these areas, irrespective of their Parties, are agreed on the necessity for such a provision.  The Minister said it should be easy to raise a loan, that people should be sufficiently responsible and creditworthy to be able to raise it.  Strange as it may seem, it is probably more difficult in Dublin in these new areas to do that than it is in the country.  These are virtually new cities.  The people who move into them do not know each other and have not much opportunity to do so, as they have only just established their roots in the area.  It is very hard, first of all, to get a suitable local committee, and secondly, it is hard to get this local committee to raise money.  I would appeal to the Minister to agree to consider this proposal. It is a proposal that does not impose any burden on the rest of the country, a proposal on which all the members of Dublin Corporation, and of the House, are agreed.  The Minister did, <Col N="1610" /> I think, promise rather rashly that he would consider the previous amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like briefly to add my voice to that of other Deputies who have urged the Minister to accept this amendment.  There is really a very large social principle involved. We, in the Dublin Corporation have, in the past few years, erected a very large number of houses, but in our efforts to keep down the expenditure of public moneys, I think we have not provided the amenities, in the way of community halls or similar buildings, for the various areas.  It is of the utmost importance to provide these amenities, as every social worker in Dublin, of any sort, would agree that it is necessary to encourage the provision of halls which are properly managed in order to provide recreation for the young people, and for the citizens generally.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride's statement that it is more difficult to raise money in the city areas is perfectly true, especially in areas like Ballyfermot. The people have only just come out to live there&mdash;I almost said that they barely knew the name of the place but they certainly knew nothing about the lack of these facilities until they arrived there.  They owe no loyalty to the district and they are not as conscious as, say, people in more established districts such as Dún Laoghaire or Blackrock are of being inhabitants of the area.  It would be almost impossible for them to raise money.  At any rate, by the time these persons have come through the net of Dublin Corporation inquiries as to their suitability for re-housing&mdash;in the majority of cases they are unable to afford any type of contribution themselves&mdash;I am sure most of them would not impress a bank manager as people who would be able to pay much money to him if the hall did not pay its way.  I would ask the Minister to consider this amendment. It is really a very important matter.</P>

      <P>Even though this amendment has been discussed from the point of view of Dublin, I appreciate the initiative of those who introduced it, and also the fact that they worded it so as to give it general application to all county boroughs. We all know that the county boroughs have undertaken big housing schemes in the suburban areas and that the people who have gone into those areas have to incur many initial expenses attached to their occupation of these new buildings and transport to the centre of the city.  I think it would be desirable that they would have a civic centre in their own district, or parish area, but owing to the fact that new schools, new churches in many cases, and other obligations, have fallen on the local clergy and the people of these districts, they have no resources from which they could build a hall, which is a necessity, so that, when the people go out, they will not be attracted to the big cinemas and dance halls in the centre of the city. I think that if the Minister could see his way to accept this amendment it would be of great advantage to the county boroughs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <P>I do not intend to go into the merits of this but I think Deputy MacBride's earlier amendment has caused a certain amount of confusion here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Still it is no harm to say this.  When this matter came before us to-day, with a proposal to attach Section 73 of the 1941 Act, the idea was basically to get the county councils or the local authorities to assist and, if that new section had been accepted, it would have meant getting them to build halls.  The objection made to that by Deputy Sheldon and Deputy Desmond was that you would not get that done effectively, and the comments I made as regards county councils were fairly justifiable.  It is a totally different matter here, it is not asking the local authority to do this; it is asking for a certain facility, and there is a very important difference. In the first place, it is restricted to the area which is going to benefit, and <Col N="1612" /> which has the immediate interest.  In the second case, it is a proposal to issue a loan, which will be paid back, and this seems to me to be the most equitable way of dealing with it.  If the Minister will pardon me putting it this way&mdash;I know he is considering other amendments and he will consider this&mdash; I would like to urge the point of view put by Deputy Desmond and Deputy Sheldon, and others, that the grant is not going to get very far.  The provisions in Section 73 did not get very far, though I can imagine the feelings of anybody trying to get from Parliament here powers to make grants, and that kind of thing, at their own expense. Let us realise that we can be very generous at times in this Parliament, yet it might all boil down to eyewash. We are not at all generous when it comes to a question of what the county councils will have to spend mandatorily, though the county councils have not much choice in levying rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county councils, and the local area of charge, have simply to bear the burden.  We are very generous here, ordering the burden, and then we turn round and say: &ldquo;You can spend more if you like.&rdquo;  Of course that type of legislation boils down, in fact, to so much eyewash, as witness the Minister's own remarks on Section 73. Here we are dealing with something essentially different, and I am constrained to make these remarks because I feel, that quite unwittingly, the original introduction of this matter, through Deputy MacBride's amendment, which was totally different in concept, more or less bedevilled the issue.  All we are asking here is that the county councils or the urban councils, mentioned specifically in this amendment, should be able to make a loan to reputable people.  I am not going to quarrel if the Minister puts in some condition to ensure that there is a reasonable probability of the terms of the loan being adhered to, that reputable people are selected, and so forth, and the burden can be placed on the local authority to see that is so.  It would be a very good procedure, a very responsible procedure, if a local body or some local persons of standing came and applied for a loan and there were conditions <Col N="1613" /> there that made it reasonably sure that loans would be repaid.  Anyway there would be some security in the hall itself.  Those are matters of detail that can be arranged.  If a loan is granted you have this threefold arrangement: (a) if the loan is available and if the people are serious about the project, they will avail of it; (b) the local authority are likely to grant a loan because they know it will be repaid; and (c) the matter can be satisfactorily dealt with in the ordinary course of business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  I might also add that the condition of part of the halls there which are available occasionally to the public leaves something to be desired.  The condition of the floor in the main part of the Rathmines Town Hall is certainly a matter that might be attended to.  However, I want to deal with the wording of this amendment.  I take it that when the Minister comes to deal with it he will chop it around completely if he accepts it.  There is a very good reason why it should be chopped around.  An attempt was made by Deputy Briscoe to define the expression &ldquo;approved person&rdquo;, but the expression &ldquo;local council&rdquo;, which was not defined, is entirely wrong.  The expression &ldquo;local <Col N="1614" /> council&rdquo; in the second line of the amendment does not mean the same thing as in the Act of 1941.  If you define &ldquo;an approved person&rdquo; as a parish priest or somebody like that or a committee representative of the district, a difficulty arises.  How can you have a local council related to a parish hall?  To my mind a parish hall is a certain part of an area represented by a local council in the accepted sense.  In this particular amendment the two are joined together.  I feel the whole thing would have to be chopped around but I take it that will be done if the Minister accepts the amendment.</P>
      <P>Again there is the question of the rate of interest.  In the case of Dublin the rate of interest is under the control of the Dublin Corporation but there are certain other borough councils who have not control of the rate of interest.  The idea behind this is one to which I think every representative of a city area or a county borough area has subscribed here to-night but the amendment itself seems to me to have been very badly drafted and to require considerable alteration, in fact, to be completely redrafted if the Minister is going to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to support this amendment and I hope the Minister will see his way to accept it.  I presume the draft will be made right by those who are well versed in that procedure.  However, we all know what we are talking about in the local councils.  The need for these facilities in Dublin, without even going out to the new areas, is very great.  In my own area there is a tremendous lack of anything in the nature of a parochial hall.  A few that did exist in years past have been demolished in connection with housing and other developments. There is an urgent need for such facilities.  I have known several cases in recent months where even meetings not comprising a dozen people could not get accommodation in the centre of the city or in hotels. This amendment is not asking to place any burden on either the taxpayer or the ratepayer.  I am sure the corporation will take all the necessary steps and ensure that any money they may <Col N="1615" /> give out will be well safeguarded and will come back to them.  If the Minister would adopt this new section for Dublin&mdash;and I am sure a similar position exists in other county boroughs&mdash; he would be doing one of the best things he could do in this Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Either the Parliamentary Secretary does not understand what is in this or I do not understand him.  The amendment provides for the issue of a loan to an approved person or a local council.  The local council is very clearly defined in Section 72 of the Local Government Act, 1941.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but the definition can be extended.  The section reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where the inhabitants of a locality in a county health district have, either before or after the commencement of this section, established a council, committee, or other body, whether corporate or unincorporated, for furthering the general social and economic interests of such inhabitants, the council of the county in which such county health district is situate may, on the application of such body, by resolution declare that such body shall be an approved local council for the purposes of this Part of this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  The power to make a declaration under this section shall be a reserved function for the purposes of the County Management Act, 1940.</P>
      <P>(3)  In this Part of this Act, the expression &lsquo;approved local council&rsquo; means a body in respect of which a declaration under this section has been made and every reference to a county council made in relation to an approved local council shall be construed as a reference to the particular council of a county which made the declaration under this section relating to such approved local council.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing to prevent that being <Col N="1616" /> taken over and it is the general idea that is the important thing.  The expression &ldquo;approved person&rdquo; is really good enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Parliamentary Secretary now.  In that case it would be a very simple matter to adapt the description under Section 72, by simply making it the borough council and city manager.  It might be better to adapt it a little more than that.  I do not think it goes quite to the substance of the amendment or the substance of what is sought to be done here.  The whole point is to enable a local authority, whether it is rural or urban, to make loans to suitable persons under suitable conditions for these purposes.</P>

    <P>(4)  Section 76 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930 (No. 27 of 1930) is hereby amended by the deletion in sub-section (1) of &ldquo;and for the passing of which not less than two-thirds of the members of the council shall have voted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister say that he is prepared to accept this.  It is a very simple amendment.  This Bill provides that local authorities may now levy up to 3d. for decorations, and so forth, by means of a simple majority.  I am not asking for permission to raise the levy in Dublin up to 3d. but, even for the purpose of raising the maximum allowed of 1d. we have to have two-thirds of the members present.  Now, on occasions, it is difficult to get the number specified and we want to make our position the same as that of other local authorities where this matter is merely a decision of a majority of the council.  It is as simple as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay very long with this.  Deputy Briscoe made the very same suggestion on the County Management (Amendment) Bill, 1953, in February last, and a member of the Dublin Corporation, who was also a member at that time of the Deputy's own Party, opposed it. At column 1145 of Volume 144 of the Official Report the then Deputy Colm Gallagher said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I think that when we are dealing with public money or increasing the rates the members should be there.  That is what they were elected for.  Nobody asked them to go forward.  They fought hard to be elected to do a job of work and when it comes to increasing the rates they should attend.  There are 45 members of the Dublin Corporation and it requires 30 to make such an increase.  It would be a reflection on the City of Dublin if we could not get 30 members to attend a meeting to consider such an increase in the rates.  I think this suggestion would be a retrograde step and I <Col N="1618" /> regret that I must disagree with Deputy Briscoe in regard to it.  The members of the corporation are there to do a job of work and, when it is proposed to increase the rates even by one penny, it is only right that they should be there to do the job they were elected for.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister has made an even bigger <i>faux pas</i> than I made on the previous amendment.  He is quoting Deputy Colm Gallagher, as he then was, in relation to the striking of rates.  I put this amendment down purely for the purpose of having power to raise 1d. for the decoration of our streets in certain circumstances and the Minister argues as if we were discussing an actual increase in rates. The Minister is giving local authorities power by a simple majority to raise up to 3d. in the £ for decoration purposes. I am asking the Minister to give us the same right up to our limit of 1d.  I am not discussing rates.  It is no use quoting someone dealing with the question of an increase in rates.  Surely this is a very simple matter.  We may be suddenly called on to decorate our streets for a new form of An Tostal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;An bhfuil a fhios aige gur mhol Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng go gcaithfí ocht míle púnt as an gCiste Forbartha Náisiúnta ar obair áirithe mhara in Inis Thoir, Arainn, gur ghlac an Taoiseach leis an moladh san Earrach i mbliana, go ndearna innealltóirí athshuirbhéaracht ar thograí as an oileán seo agus gur mholadar a gcéad tairiscint a chur ar ceal, agus, ina hionad, aon mhíle déag púnt a chaitheamh ar fhad a chur as an gcéibh; agus má tá, an abróidh sé an bhfuil glactha leis an tairiscint seo fós, agus, mura bhfuil, cén uair a ceadófar í,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>agus fuaireas an freagra seo leanas:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Is eol dom gur mar atá ráite sa cheist atá an scéal.  Maidir leis an togra chun faid a chur leis an gcéibh ag Inis Thoir, a moladh mar mhalairt ar an togra a ceadaíodh ar dtúis, tá breithniú á dhéanamh air go fóill <Col N="1621" /> agus caithfear a chinneadh fós an togra é atá oiriúnach lena chur faoi bhráid an Taoisigh i gcomhréir leis an nós imeachta a ghabhas leis an gCiste Forbartha Náisiúnta (Cionroinnt na Gaeltachta).  Tuigfear ámh go bhfuil difríocht bhunúsach idir an dá thogra.  Muir-obair nua a thógáil, áit nach raibh aon mhuir-obair cheana, a bhí i gceist sa togra a ceadaíodh; feabhas a chur ar mhuir-obair roimhe atá ann cheana féin atá i gceist i dtogra na céibhe.  Ar an ábhar sin, caithfear an cheist a bhreithniú féachaint ar chirte an costas a ghabhfadh le faidiú na céibhe d'íoc as an ngnáth-chiste le haghaidh muir-oibreacha le cabhair an ghnáth-ranníoca ón Údarás Áitiúil. O thárla gur mar sin atá an scéal, ba dheacair a rá go cinnte, faoi láthair, an gceadófar, nó cén uair a ceadófar, an togra áirithe atá i gceist.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>San am céanna cuireadh tograí isteach chun muir-oibreacha áirithe a dhéanamh in Inis Meáin agus Inis Thoir de na hoileáin Árann.  Cuireadh trí cinn isteach i leith Inis Meáin&mdash; péire acu a bhain leis an áit is mó atá i bhfeidhm, sé sin, An Fánán nó an tSlip mar tugtar air.  Piocadh amach an ceann ba thúisce a caithfí a dhéanamh agus cuireadh an obair ar bun.  Tháinig an Comhrialtas i réim, agus chinneadar an dara thogra i dtaobh an tSlip a chur ag obair in éindigh leis an gcéad céim.</P>
    <P>Chuir mé féin na trí tograí i leith Inis Thoir in ord fiúntais do réir tuairim mhuinntir an oileáin.  Mhol na hinnealltóirí £8,000 a chaitheadh ar an gceann a bhí san tríú áit.  Glacadh leis seo agus ceadaíodh an t-airgead dó.  Chuir mise ina aghaidh mar dúirt na hoileánaigh liom nár bhféidir an áit seo a thaobhú le bád ach an lá a mbhéadh an fharraige ina clár le ciúineas.  Bhí doimhneacht uisce ann ach sin a raibh, agus ba í sin an buntáiste a tharraing na hinnealltóirí ann.  Ní raibh siadsan ag breithniú na dtograí ach ó thaobh na hinnealltóireachta dhe agus b'fhurasta dóibh dearmad a dhéanamh ar na gnéithe eile den cheist.  Fuaireadar amach go mb'fhiú suim bheag airgid a chaitheadh ar a feabhsú, ach go gcaithfí tús áite a thabhairt don phríomh-áit agus an t-airgead mór a chaitheadh ansin. <Col N="1622" /> Rinneadar athshuirbhéaracht ar an dá áit seo agus cuireadh ar a n-eolas iad lena linn faoi chuile thaobh eile den cheist.  De bharr na hathshuirbhéar-achta mholadar go gcaithfí £11,000 ar fhaidiú na céibhe.  Ceadófaí an togra seo arna mholadh mar sin chomh réidh is a ceadaíodh an céad mholadh, ach h-athraíodh an Rialtas idir an dá linn.</P>

      <P>Bhí sé san Earrach agus ba cheart go mbeadh eolas maith ag an Aire faoi sin.  Nach bhfuil a fhios aige gur ceadaíodh £8,000 as an gCiste Forbartha Náisiúnta d'obair áirithe san Earrach?  Tá na páipéir ag an Aire.  Níl siad agamsa.</P>

      <P>Fan nóiméad. Tá mé ag rá leis an Aire gur ceadaíodh £8,000 agus gur mé féin a chur ar aghaidh é.  An dtuigeann an tAire é sin?  Mé féin a chur ar aghaidh é agus mé féin a stop é.</P>

      <P>Fan anois. Teastaíonn uaim leanúint orm ar an bpointe sin.  Mise ba ciontach leis na hinnealltóirí do chur ar ais arís&mdash;agus fuair na hinnealltóirí amach go raibh an ceart agamsa agus go mbeadh botún mór ghá dhéanamh an obair a ceapadh sa chéad dul síos a chur ar aghaidh. Ag an bpointe seo, ba mhaith liom a rá gur ceadaíodh £8,000 ar dtús agus ansin mhol na hinnealltóirí go gcaithfí £11,000 ar an gcéibh&mdash;an obair is géire atá ag teastáil san Oileáin.  Tá mé ag rá leis an Aire go gceadófaí an moladh sin chomh moch agus chomh tapaidh agus chomh sásúil agus a ceadaíodh an chéad mholadh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anois, is an cor cam atá ar an scéal gur obair as an nua an chéad togra agus nach bhfuil sa dara ceann ach feabhas a chur ar rud éicínt atá ann cheana, agus tá sé le tuiscint ó fhreagra an Aire nach bhfuil aon togra um oibreacha ioncháilithe faoin gCiste Forbartha Náisiúnta ach rudaí as an <Col N="1623" /> nua ar fad.  Tá an leithscéal seo chomh sleamhain leis an Slip in Inis Meáin. Nach breá gur ceadaíodh agus gur tosaíodh an obair in Inis Meáin as airgead an Chiste chéanna cé gur féidir an rud ceanann céanna a rá ina thaobh. Agus cén chaoi an dtig leis an Aire a rá nach obair as an nua í céad troigh de chéibh nua a thógáil, bíodh sé greamaithe nó ná bíodh de sheanchéibh. Ar ndóigh chaithfeadh sé a bheith greamaithe de rud éicínt.</P>
    <P>Dar leis an Aire caithfidh Inis Thoir a dhul ar ais go dtí an sean-chóras mhuir-oibreacha, is é sin, go gcaithfidh an t-údarás áitiúil ranníoc a dhéanamh agus an obair a chothú.  Más mar seo a bheas an chéibh nua in Inis Thoir beidh muintir an oileáin sin ag fanacht leis go dtiocfaidh an lá inné ar ais.</P>

      <NameTxt>Pádraig Ó Domhnaill</NameTxt>
      <P>Tú féin ba chiontach leis an moill.  Bhí muintir an Oileáin ag fanúint le blianta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Gearóid Mac Pharthaláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Aontaím leis an Aire faoi sin: bhí muinntir an Oileáin ag fanacht fada go leor.  Bhris an sean-chóras síos, agus a shlíocht air &mdash;fágadh na rudaí seo gan pingin a sholáthar dóibh agus mar sin a bheas má féachtar lena ndéanamh arís ar an mbealach sin.</P>
      <P>Bhí sé de ádh ar Inis Meáin gur tosaíodh an obair ansin sul ar hathraíodh an rialtas.  Caithfidh muintir Inis Thoir a bheith foighdeach go dtiocfaidh an t-am nuair a bainfear feidhm arís as an gCiste Forbartha Náisiúnta chun na críocha ar bunaíodh é ina gcomhair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl mé sásta an rud seo a ligint leis an Aire.  Cuirfidh mé d'ialach ar a admháil nach bhfuil an ceart aige a rá gur rud é seo nach raibh aon chaint faoi go dtí go dtáinig an rialtas seo in oifig.  Tuigeann an Aire an scéal go maith.  Tá súil agam go dtuigeann sé an gearán atá ann&mdash;agus im-thuairmse tuigeann sé í&mdash;agus nach bhfuil ach leath-scéal bacach á dhéanamh aige. Nuair a bhí mise im Rúnaí Pharlaiminte is minic a chuir an tAire, agus é ina Theachta, ceisteanna chugam faoi slipeanna agus céibheanna i dTír Chonaill. Bhí mé sásta gach cabhair ab fhéidir liom a thabhairt dó i gcónaí agus bhí <Col N="1624" /> cabhair le fáil fréisín ó Oifig na hOibreacha Poiblí agus ón údarás áitiúil.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire anois gan ábhar grinn a dhéanamh de mhuintir Inis Thoir, gan ceap magaidh a dhéanamh dhíobh.  Tá siad ansin san Iarthar, suite ar oilean beag ar an aigean Atlantach.  Muna dtagann an tAire de chabhair ar na daoine sin, ní bhfuighe siad an rud atá ag teastáil uathu le blianta fada.  Bunaíodh an Ciste seo chun oibreacha mar seo a chur ar aghaidh&mdash;agus tá sé seo san Acht&mdash;oibreacha mar seo nach ndéanfaí ar aon tslí eile.  Tá mé a rá leis an Aire anois nach ndéanfar an obair seo in Inis Thoir mura ndéanfar é as an gCiste Forbartha Náisiúnta&mdash;agus sin é an cháilíocht atá ag an obair seo cabhair a fháil as an gCiste seo.  Má sheasann an tAire ar an leithscéal bacach a thug sé dom sa bhfreagra inné, níl sé ach ag déanamh ceap magaidh de mhuintir Inis Thoir.</P>

      <NameTxt>Pádraig Ó Domhnaill</NameTxt>
      <P>Faoi scéim an Chiste Fhorbartha Náisiúnta, ní foláir sonraí beachta a chur faoi bhráid an Taoisigh maidir le gach togra a mbítear ag lorg ceaduithe ina leith.</P>
      <P>Cuireadh sonraí beachta maidir le muir-obair nua a thógáil ag Corr-Áit, Inis Thoir, faoi bhráid an Taoisigh agus cheadaigh sé caiteachas £8,000 ina leith mí Eanáir seo caite.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bhí cead an Taoisigh tugtha le h-aghaidh scéim Chorr-Áit do hiarradh ar Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng an cheist a bhreithniú arís féachaint an bhféadfaí tús áite a thabhairt do scéim eile&mdash;scéim chun fad a chur leis an gcéibh ag Inis Thoir.</P>
      <P>Rinne Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí suirbhéireacht ar an oileán arís agus dúradar ina dhiaidh sin go mbeidís sásta tús áite a thabhairt don scéim chun fad a chur leis an gcéibh.  Chuireadar tuarascáil agus pleananna i dtaobh na hoibre sin go dtí Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng ar an 31ú Bealtaine, 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní leor moladh Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí, ámh, chun gur féidir togra na céibhe a chur i gcrích.  Sarab fhéidir é sin a dhéanamh níor mhór cead an Taoisigh a bheith ar fáil le haghaidh <Col N="1625" /> na hoibre agus níor mhór iarratas, maraon le sonraí beachta, a chur go dtí an Taoiseach ag lorg an cheaduithe sin.  Fé mar adúirt mé sa bhfreagra a thugas inné, caithfear a chinneadh fós an togra é atá oiriúnach lena chur faoi bhráid an Taoisigh faoi scéim an Chiste Fhorbartha Náisiúnta.  Is gnó é don Choiste Eadar-Roinne atá ag gabháil le hOifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng an cheist sin a scrúdú i gcomhairle leis an Roinn Airgeadais. Sin é an dlí agus tá a fhios ag an <Col N="1626" /> Teachta gurb shin é an dlí.  Níl leithscéal ar bith ann.</P>
