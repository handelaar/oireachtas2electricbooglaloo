    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he has seen a report in a provincial newspaper of a speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture in which he is reported as having said that if a change of Government had not taken place a heavy cattle tax would now be in operation which would have completely and for all time killed our cattle export trade, and, if so, if he will state if there is any record in any Department of any proposal by the previous Government to impose a tax on cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to by the Deputy.  The statement which it attributes to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture appears to be an expression of opinion, based, no doubt, on a statement made in the Seanad by a member of that House who is believed to represent the views of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>There is no record of any decision by the previous Government to impose a tax on cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, would the Parliamentary Secretary refrain from making statements which he knows are not correct?  He said in that speech that if the previous Government had not been put out a heavy cattle tax would now be in operation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (1) the amounts of willows for manufacture into baskets, etc., which were imported into the Republic during the last five years and whether an import duty was charged, and (2) the quantity of finished articles, manufactured from willows, which were imported during the same period and whether an import duty was charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. O'Sullivan) Denis J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistics of imports required by the Deputy are not available.  Imports are brought to account in accordance with the commodity descriptions shown in the Official Import List and willows for manufacture into baskets, etc., or finished articles manufactured from willows are not separately distinguished.</P>
      <P>An examination of a sample of the entry documents in the appropriate categories has shown that the descriptions of goods on such documents are not sufficiently detailed to enable the information required to be extracted by making a special compilation.</P>
      <P>Willows as such are not liable to customs duty.  Willow is regarded as wood for the purpose of any duty on articles of wood, but customs entries for wooden articles do not distinguish articles made from willows from those made from other kinds of wood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing <Col N="423" /> the customs duties most likely to apply to willow articles, as well as those <Col N="424" /> under which liability may possibly arise.</P>

      <P>I assume that the question refers to absence from duty owing to illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Transport Act, 1950, one of the general duties of the board of C.I.E. is to maintain reasonable conditions of employment for its employees. I am informed by the board that no employee is dismissed from the service of the board because of absence owing to illness until the expiry of periods of absence ranging from six months in the case of temporary staff to as much as two and a half years in the case of certain staff who are members of the board's welfare scheme.  Special arrangements are <Col N="425" /> made in the case of absence owing to T.B.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that milk consumers in Caherciveen are being charged 6d. per pint for milk and if he will take steps to have this price substantially reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that a winter price of 6d. per pint is being charged for milk in Caherciveen.  The question of milk prices in areas outside the Dublin and Cork Sale Districts was considered by the Prices Advisory Body in January, 1952.  Many complaints had been received in regard to serious local shortages of milk in various parts of the country and the view had been urged that producers were withdrawing from the business because, it was alleged, the controlled price was an uneconomic one.  The controlled price was 4½d. per pint and representatives of suppliers in eight counties had applied for an increase to 6d. per pint.  Following consideration of the matter the Prices Advisory Body recommended decontrol and this took place from 12th January, 1952. After decontrol there was a general increase in prices but only in a few areas did the price reach the 6d. per pint which producers had been claiming. Complaints regarding shortages are now practically non-existent and it <Col N="426" /> would seem from inquiries which inspectors of my Department have carried out in the past few weeks that while prices vary in different parts of the country they are, in general, better adjusted to the conditions of each locality than they would be if price control were operative.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Irish Shipping, Limited, that it was necessary to dry dock this vessel for urgent repairs after her arrival in Rotterdam from Australia on 19th October last in order to enable her to proceed to Canada to lift a cargo in accordance with her prearranged schedule.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Irish Shipping, Limited, share my concern to ensure that, so far as practicable, repairs to their vessels will be carried out in Irish dockyards.  Circumstances are bound to arise, however, in which repairs will have to be carried out elsewhere than in this country, especially where vessels engaged in the international tramp shipping trade are concerned. These vessels do not, in fact, call regularly at Irish ports.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that this ship was waiting for five days for docking and that the journey to Ireland would be only two and a half days?  Is he not also aware that the <i>Pine</i> is in Belfast, the <i>Oak</i> in an English port, and that the two tugs for the <i>Dun Aengus</i> that could have been built in Cork harbour were built in Cardiff?  What I am concerned about, and I am sure the Minister is also, is the general policy that so many of these ships should be away while other nations have employed tugs, where the vessels could not move under their own power, in bringing them into home waters for repair.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that widens the main question and should perhaps form the subject of a separate question. So far as the vessel in question, the <i>Irish Hazel</i>, is concerned, it arrived at Rotterdam with a cargo of sugar from Queensland.  It was then obliged to call to St. Lawrence to lift a cargo of grain and oil cake between the 15th and 30th November.  It was essential, therefore, that the repairs should be carried out speedily in order to enable the ship to fulfil its scheduled lifting arrangements.  By having the work executed at Rotterdam while the vessel was unloading and afterwards, it was possible to enable the ship to fulfil its schedule of lifting engagements. As a result of the work being done in Rotterdam it was completed within ten days, whereas, I am informed, that if the ship had to be taken back to Cork for repairs, apart from the expense of having it out of action for the time occupied in travelling from Rotterdam to Cork, it would have taken an extra 20 days to do the work at Cork, because only one shift is working there, whereas in Rotterdam the owners of the vessel were able to benefit by the fact that there were three shifts working round the clock.  I might mention, too, that Irish Shipping are most anxious to have the work done in Cork as far as that is practicable for the simple reason that Irish Shipping are paying the losses of the Cork yard.  It is obvious, therefore, that these losses should be kept at a minimum, which is in itself a stimulus to Irish Shipping to place as many of its orders as possible in the Cork yard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, the Minister will have to admit that the ships all seem to be repaired away. Of the ships I have mentioned, one has been repaired in Belfast and the other in an English port.</P>

The approved scheme of harbour improvement works has been completed at Fenit at a cost to the State of about £217,000.  I have received the report of the survey recently carried out at the harbour which indicates that some dredging is necessary, but some more detailed information is still required. The question whether State assistance can be provided towards the cost of the dredging having regard to the very substantial grants already provided for Fenit, is under consideration.  I expect to be able to convey a decision very shortly to the Harbour Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The information available to the Land Commission indicates that there is no considerable area of good arable land in this estate and the balance of opinion is that it is most suitable for development as a forestry centre.  I would point out to the Deputy that the opening of a forest centre offers opportunities to the smallholders to obtain cash employment as a very useful means of supplementing their ordinary earnings.</P>
      <P>Congestion does exist in this area and the Land Commission are taking active steps to relieve it in the usual way.</P>

      <P>So far during the year, 1954-55, 308½ acres of land have been acquired for forestry purposes in West Cork.  Owing to the time-factor involved in negotiating on price and subsequently in clearing title, it is impossible to forecast with any reasonable degree of accuracy what acreage of land will be acquired over any given period.  Agreement on price <Col N="442" /> has, however, been reached in 15 cases totalling 3,115 acres and title investigations are in progress.  Negotiations on price are proceeding on 31 offers totalling 2,647 acres.</P>

      <P>I am advised that, under the law as it stands, the publication, sale or distribution of so-called communistic writings (which are not otherwise unlawful) is no offence and that there would have to be an amendment of the Constitution to make it so.  It appears, moreover, that it would be so difficult as to be practically impossible to arrive at a clear definition of communistic publications that would be generally acceptable and to frame an amendment of the Constitution to permit of the banning of such publications which would not be likely to do more harm than good.  I am, of course, aware that publications of the type in question have been on sale in this country to a limited extent for many years, but I am not aware that the number of these publications is increasing and I think their sale is negligible.</P>

The price of the home-produced product is, therefore, related to the price of the imported product.  The recent increase in the price on the world market has been reflected in the prices charged here, but it may be taken that the benefit of any reduction in the world prices will also be passed on to feeders here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that this flight took <Col N="450" /> place and I have seen the newspaper article mentioned.</P>
    <P>The three ensigns in question are due for promotion shortly, but, in accordance with Defence Force Regulations, they had to pass a qualifying oral test in Irish before they could be considered eligible for promotion.  It was decided, in the best interests of the service, to send the examining officers to England, rather than recall the ensigns to this country for the test.</P>
    <P>Of the five officers on the plane, two were members of the crew, two were examiners, and the other was on official duty not connected with the test.</P>
    <P>The aircraft landed at Lee-on-Solent at 11.22 a.m. on 23rd October and left there at 2.39 p.m. on the same day. Apart from the running expenses of the plane, which should not be taken into account as this was regarded as a training flight for the crew, the only expense incurred due to the visit was subsistence allowance totalling not more than £3 12s.</P>

It is an advantage for our officers to land at different places if they get the opportunity.  The total cost was £3 something.  We could not wait until they came back to have the examination because it is essential that the examination should take place during their training and there was nothing I could do about it.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that builders' labourers in Clonmel, who are unemployed because of a trade dispute between the contractors and carpenters employed on a housing scheme in the town, have been refused unemployment benefit under Section 17 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and, if so, whether, in view of the fact that the labourers have no connection with the dispute, he will make regulations to prevent a recurrence of such a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the refusal of unemployment benefit in the cases referred to in the question. Benefit was refused in these cases in accordance with the provisions of Section 17 (2) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, under which a person who has lost employment by reason of a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute at the factory, workshop, farm or other premises or place at which he was employed is disqualified for receiving unemployment benefit. These provisions could be altered only by amending legislation.</P>
      <P>Similar provisions have operated from the inception of compulsory insurance against unemployment in this country.  On several occasions the operation of the provisions has been considered in consultation with associations of employers and workers, but it has not been found possible to devise satisfactory alternative provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, that is the case, that workers who have no hand, act or part in the creating of the dispute are deprived of unemployment benefit or assistance, when a dispute occurs, but the section is so framed in the 1952 Act that they must suffer in that respect.  That has been the position even since 1920.  I know, and I think most Deputies who have been interested in this problem know, that the last Minister for Social Welfare and his predecessor made determined efforts to try to improve that position but so far no solution seems to be forthcoming from the trade unions, employers or any section. What I propose doing, as a final effort, in consultation with the two trade union congresses, is to try and frame a new section or provide an amendment which will improve a position which, I think all of us will agree, is unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the case to which the Deputy refers, and I have obtained a special report on the matter from the health authority.</P>
      <P>The child involved was not boarded out by a health authority but was placed in the foster home by a private arrangement which was not notified to the health authority as is required by the provisions of the Children Acts, 1908 to 1949.  The health authority concerned has on its staff a whole-time children's officer and it was through her vigilance that the matter was brought to light and pursued to its conclusion.  I consider that the employment by health authorities of suitably qualified women on this type of work is an essential step towards the provision of adequate safeguards for such children, and I have urged that course on health authorities wherever necessary.</P>
      <P>I have been considering amendments of the Children Acts which I hope will soon be introduced and which will remedy certain defects in the present legislation.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the date appearing in the Title, the text of this Bill is identical with the text of the Bill which was introduced in 1953 by my predecessor in office and which had received a Second Reading before the Dáil was dissolved.</P>
      <P>I have also allowed the Explanatory Memorandum which was circulated with the 1953 Bill to stand in its original form.</P>
      <P>A word of explanation may be expected as to why I decided to proceed in this way.  I did so because I think it is the best way of making progress towards the speedy enactment of the Bill.  Deputies who were members of the last Dáil had studied the earlier text; they had made themselves familiar with its various provisions and were ready to air their views on the merits and shortcomings of the Bill as it then stood.  There are obvious advantages to all concerned in taking, as our starting point in this Dáil, the point at which the discussion on the 1953 Bill was abandoned in the last Dáil.  These advantages extend also to those organisations of workers and employers which have made themselves familiar with the 1953 proposals and know where and in what respects the proposals fall short of their wishes.</P>
      <P>I do not wish anything that I have said to give the impression that I agree unreservedly with all the provisions of the 1953 text.  I agree that, in general, it provides a satisfactory remedy for the more serious defects in the existing factory code, and that no fundamental change in the general structure of the Bill is necessary.  I have some amendments in mind and I had contemplated giving an indication of these when circulating the Explanatory Memorandum with the Bill but I think it best to reserve judgment on these amendments until I have had the benefit of whatever discussion we may have on this Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>An Explanatory Memorandum has been circulated with the Bill but I think that it would be helpful to our discussion if I were to devote a little time to giving a general explanation of the purposes and aims of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> Among the enactments taken over by the Irish Government from the English administration was a large body of legislation dealing with the health, safety and welfare of industrial workers.  This body of legislation is known commonly by the general name, &ldquo;The Factories Acts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ideas of what are healthy and comfortable working conditions are gradually changing and, as a consequence, different portions of the Factories Acts have become out of date.  The Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, repealed and re-enacted with extensive modifications those parts of the Factories Acts which settled the hours for which workers might be employed.  It left undisturbed those provisions which dealt with working conditions in factories. These latter provisions are those which will be amended by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The main enactment dealing with working conditions in factories at present is the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901.  That Act has been amended and extended by a number of Acts, which are listed in the First Schedule of the Bill.  Part of the purpose of the Bill is to consolidate in one measure all that the law has to say on the subject of working conditions in factories.</P>
    <P>An adequate summary of the law, as it now stands, is contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.</P>
    <P>I think the best way of giving a picture of how the law would stand after the passage of the Bill is for me to take the Bill part by part and highlight the changes which the Bill introduces.</P>
    <P>Part I contains the normal sections relating to commencement, definitions, expenses, etc.  &ldquo;Factory&rdquo; is defined in Section 3.  Existing law makes a distinction between textile factory, non-textile factory, workshop and men's workshop.  This distinction had a certain relevance to the control of working hours of women and young persons (a control now transferred to the Conditions of Employment Act) and also led to different treatment for the different classes of workplaces. That distinction is gone in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> It is to be noted that the definition of &ldquo;factory&rdquo; in Section 3 is not relied upon in applying the law to such places as docks, building works, etc.  These places are given separate treatment in Part VIII.  I will come to them later.</P>
    <P>Part II contains the precautions to be taken as standard at all factories for safeguarding the health of workers. Extra precautions for certain places are prescribed elsewhere in the Bill. As compared with existing law the provisions as to cleanliness are made more precise and are written in greater detail, the space requirement for each worker is increased from 250 to 400 cubic feet, a figure for temperature of work-rooms is mentioned and an obligation to provide proper lighting is added.  Special mention may be made of the new provision in Section 19 giving power to the Minister to require the medical supervision of a factory.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted in relation to this part that one effect of the Bill will be to transfer from the local authority to the Minister the duty of enforcing the health provisions in workshops.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the safety of machinery and premises.  The earlier sections in this part relate to the important subject of the fencing of machinery.  Here the law will be tightened up and extended somewhat. For instance, not only must the dangerous parts of a machine be fenced but articles being processed on a machine must also be fenced if their motion constitutes a danger to the worker.</P>
    <P>In this part of the Bill in particular will be noted considerable extensions of existing law.  Some of the provisions are completely new as, for example, the sections requiring the proper training and supervision of young persons working dangerous machines, requiring precautions to be taken against explosive atmospheres, requiring for air and steam receivers safeguards comparable to those required for steam boilers and requiring the institution of special safety arrangements in factories where the accident history is bad.  Other sections in this part have the effect of <Col N="472" /> extending to factories generally provisions at present applying only (under regulations) to limited classes of factories.  In this category would be Sections 33 and 34 dealing with lifting apparatus of all kinds.  Yet other sections in this part cover the same ground as existing law but incorporate extensions of one kind or another. The sections dealing with fire precautions are applied to factories with fewer workers than before.</P>
    <P>The main effect of Part IV of the Bill is to make universal the duty of providing drinking water, washing facilities, etc.  At present this duty rests only on the occupiers of certain types of factories mentioned in regulations.</P>
    <P>Part V treats of special additional precautions to be taken in factories of certain kinds.  Many of the sections are taken from existing law, including the power to make special regulations requiring occupiers of premises where trades are carried on which are particularly dangerous to the health or safety of the workers to take such additional precautions for their safety and welfare as may be prescribed.  The sections about protection against injury to eyes, about lifting weights and about taking samples are new. New also is the control which can be exercised over underground or basement factories.  Underground bakehouses have been tolerated for a long time, but they must go within three years of the start of the new law.</P>
    <P>There is no great change made by Part VI, which relates to the notification and investigation of accidents and occurrences of industrial diseases.  The existing title of &ldquo;certifying surgeon&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;certifying doctor&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Part VII introduces a noteworthy change in the protection of youth in industry.  After the Bill becomes law no person under 18 years can take up industrial employment unless he has been certified fit for his employment by the official doctor.  After his entry he must be re-examined by a doctor each year until he reaches 18 years.  At present only those under 16 need be examined on entry and there is no provision about annual re-examination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> The provisions contained in Part VIII appear to be very elaborate but they deal with two very difficult subjects, namely, (a) premises where there is more than one factory or premises where only part is used as a factory and (b) places where industrial activity is carried on but which not being factories in the ordinary sense and not having defined and limited premises cannot be expected to conform to all the rules applicable to factories proper. Sections 79 and 80 deal with the first subject, by setting out which of the Bill's obligations fall to be discharged by the occupier of the factory premises and which by the owner of the building in which the factory is located.  In remaining sections is set out the extent to which the various provisions of the Bill will apply to electrical stations, institutions, docks, wharves, quays, warehouses, ships in dock, building operations and works of engineering construction.  The application of any factory law to works of engineering construction is entirely new.  The application to the other activities represents a considerable extension on the present scope of application, particularly in the case of building activity.</P>
    <P>Part IX repeats with some slight modifications the existing controls on outwork.  An existing ban on giving out work to places where there is infectious disease is not repeated in the Bill, as it is no longer necessary here in view of other provisions in modern public health law.</P>
    <P>Part X contains the necessary provisions about the appointment and powers of inspectors and of certifying surgeons, and the powers and expenses of officers of the sanitary authority.  In relation to the sanitary authority I should mention that it will have the direct duty of enforcing the provisions in the Bill relating to sanitary conveniences and fire precautions, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce can step in to ensure enforcement should the sanitary authority fail to discharge its obligations. The same duty of enforcement rests on the sanitary authority at present, but a duty which they had in relation to the cleanliness, etc., of workshops will be taken over by the <Col N="474" /> Minister.  I have mentioned already that basement bakehouses must cease to exist after three years.  At present they can carry on with the approval of the local authority.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Part XI calls for comment beyond mentioning that prosecutions will be taken at the suit of the Minister.  Under existing law they can be taken at the suit of an inspector, but it is more in keeping with Irish practice to have all these things done in the name of a Minister of State rather than in the name of an official.  In any event, it represents no change from current administrative practice.</P>
    <P>Part XII confirms that the Factories Acts will apply to factories belonging to the State as well as to factories in private ownership.</P>
    <P>The last part&mdash;Part XIII&mdash;repeats from existing law the obligation which rests on factory occupiers, of giving notice of their occupation of premises, of posting up an extract of the law, etc.  Section 122 is interesting in that it imposes on employed persons a legal duty of using and not abusing the safety and health arrangements which their employers are compelled to make for them.  The Factory Acts will no longer have any application to quarries.  A separate measure is being prepared to provide for the safety, health and welfare of quarry workers, but in case there should be any hitch in enacting such law power is taken in Section 125 of applying to quarries the protective measures of existing Mining Acts.</P>
    <P>In preparing the Bill a close examination has been made of relevant conventions and recommendations adopted by the International Labour Office and of recommendations contained in the Report of the Commission on Youth Unemployment.  I am hopeful that the passage of the Bill will enable Ireland to make a still better showing in the international field, by enabling her to show compliance with some further chapters of the international code of regulations promulgated by the International Labour Office.  With regard to the Commission on Youth Unemployment, I find that with the enactment of the Bill we will have gone a long way towards adopting the <Col N="475" /> recommendations made by that commission on such matters relating to working conditions as are relevant to a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>It only remains for me to say that when the 1953 Bill was before the House a number of amendments had been tabled for consideration at the Committee Stage.  As you know, the Committee Stage had not been reached before the Dáil was dissolved.  Deputies can rest assured, however, that amendments then tabled, together with other amendments which had been suggested in representations made to my Department, will all be very carefully examined.  Interested organisations and individual industrialists who had already suggested amendments to the 1953 Bill can also be assured that it is not necessary to repeat their suggestions and that I will have regard to them all in preparing for the Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It might, however, be desirable for me at this point to refer in a general way to those amendments which were designed to extend the scope of the measure to include office workers.  I know that many Deputies feel that something should be done to give protection to office workers in the matter of the cleanliness, temperature, lighting and general safety of the places where they work, and it has been urged that this protection could be given them by a simple extension of the Factories Bill to office premises. I have gone into that matter very thoroughly and I am satisfied that this Bill is not the place for legislating for office workers.  I am, however, convinced that the time for remedial action in this respect is long overdue and I have directed that a speedy examination be made as to the type of protection which should be afforded to office workers and as to the statutory provisions which would be necessary to give effect to that protection.  I shall, of course, welcome and undertake to consider carefully any suggestions under this heading which Deputies or other interested parties may wish to submit to my Department. I would suggest, therefore, that our present discussion might be limited to <Col N="476" /> matters affecting the welfare and protection of factory workers and I am satisfied that this is the best way of making solid progress towards a rapid solution of both problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, this Bill is identical with that which was introduced here last year on my motion.  It is identical even to the drafting errors and misprints, which is somewhat surprising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>After the Bill got its Second Reading last year, a number of amendments were circulated&mdash;some in my name as Minister on the suggestion of the parliamentary draftsman, others consequent on the discussion we had on the Second Reading.  When the Dáil was dissolved and it was clear that the Bill would have to be reintroduced, I gave directions in the Department that the new text was to be prepared incorporating all the official amendments which had been circulated before the dissolution.  Presumably the Minister decided to cancel that order and to direct that the Bill should come in unchanged.  I can understand that he might have had a certain amount of embarrassment in incorporating the amendments circulated in my name and not incorporating the amendments circulated in his own. That may be the real reason, but it does not make a great deal of difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us what he has in mind regarding the Committee Stage.  Obviously, the drafting amendments which had originally appeared in my name will have to be circulated again and if there are any other amendments of substance I think the Dáil should see them soon and that there should be a reasonable interval between their circulation and the taking of the Committee Stage.  It was my original intention that there should be a substantial interval between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage, to give the trade organisations representing employers and workers ample time to make their representations regarding the Bill. <Col N="477" /> There probably is not the same need for a protracted interval now, since everyone knew the Bill was coming and most of the trade associations have already given it consideration and have suggested the amendments they thought necessary.  I said here last year that we should not try to rush this Bill, that it is 50 years since we have had factories legislation applying throughout the country and it may be another 50 years before we have any extension to this Bill and, therefore, that we should take our time and make sure we make a good job of it.  That is one reason why I think the Minister should facilitate us by circulating his proposed amendments early, thereby giving us an opportunity of considering them in relation to the text of the Bill and in relation to any representations which may be made to us by individuals who have fault to find with its provisions.</P>
    <P>The only amendment which was not more than a matter of detail or drafting which was circulated in the previous Dáil was that dealing with the establishment of a consultative committee.  One amendment related to a consultative committee and stood in my name and another amendment was put down by a number of Deputies including the present Minister.  I accepted the case made on the Second Reading debate last year by Deputy Larkin in favour of establishing a committee of that kind&mdash;a committee representing both parties in industry&mdash; which would be in contact with the departmental administration of the Factories Act and available for consultation in regard to the making of regulations under it and which could bring to the attention of the officers concerned in the Department any defects in the enforcement arrangements.</P>
    <P>I did not favour the type of amendment which appeared in the name of some members of the Labour Party, in which the functions of the committee were specified, because in my view any detailed definition of functions tends to have a limiting effect.  I felt it was wiser, in the establishment of such a committee, to give it general functions in relation to the administration <Col N="478" /> of the Act and consultation with the Minister thereon.  Whatever the Minister may have in mind in regard to the establishment of a consultative committee&mdash;and I presume he intends to adopt that suggestion&mdash;I should like him to circulate the amendment early.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister took the right decision that the extension of the Factories Act to cover office workers is undesirable.  Some aspects of the problem affecting office workers are similar to those affecting factory workers but, on the whole, there is a different problem there.  When this matter was under discussion before, I indicated that I was somewhat apprehensive of the possible effects of hasty legislation upon the employment of office workers.  I think I am correct in saying that the International Labour Office had the question of legislation affecting the conditions of employment of office workers under review and was preparing a report in anticipation of a discussion at an international conference on the drafting of a convention.  I do not know if that report has been completed or if any documents have been circulated by the International Labour Office in that regard.  If such documents were circulated it would be desirable to have a very full regard to them and to keep whatever legislative proposals we may consider in regard to office workers in accord with the International Labour Office recommendations.  They bring to the consideration of these matters a great deal of experience and knowledge and, by following their guidance, we can avoid mistakes which might have serious repercussions upon that class of worker here.</P>
    <P>I hope that if the Minister has seriously contemplated the introduction of legislation regarding office workers, as he has stated, he will be able at a fairly early date to make known the general form that legislation may take.  It is always undesirable that there should be any element of uncertainty in a matter of that kind. The drafting of the legislation may take some time.  I have no desire to rush it because of the possible mistakes that might result.  I hope the Minister will take an early opportunity of giving <Col N="479" /> a general indication of the type and scope of that legislation so that nobody would be hesitate about engaging in any business enterprise for fear he might run himself into unanticipated expenditure.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Dáil need delay the Minister in getting the Second Reading of this Bill.  It is not often that we get an opportunity of discussing a Bill which was drafted by a member of a former Government, now in opposition, and resubmitted to the Dáil by his successor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not very easy to make a fresh speech on the second occasion on which a Bill has been submitted for Second Reading.  However, there are one or two comments that might be made.  The first is in regard to the desirability of ensuring that we have no further delay in the passage of the Bill to the Statute Book.  It is correct, as the Minister has said, that we have had this present legislation with us now for over 50 years with very little change&mdash;and, in the meantime, the world moves on.  It is time we adapted our legislation in regard to the welfare and safety of workers to modern standards.  From that aspect, we can appreciate the Minister's point of view that it would help to avoid delay by resubmitting the original Bill &mdash;as, in the main, the Bill is not very controversial&mdash;and, in the course of debate in the House, getting a Bill satisfactory to all Parties.</P>
      <P>This is the first piece of Irish legislation which seeks to deal in a comprehensive way with the welfare and safety of workers in factories.  Almost word for word, the Bill is a replica of the British Act.  We have the further peculiarity now, as has been pointed out, that the present Bill is a replica of a Bill which was introduced by the Minister's predecessor.  I hope we will break the sequence of this similarity so that it will not go on indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point of similarity that we should prefer to see emphasised is a closer adherence to the recommendations of the International Labour Office.  It is much more desirable that <Col N="480" /> we should, as Deputy Lemass indicated, follow the advice and guidance of a very experienced and expert body rather than follow in a very close manner the part already taken by our sister House across the water, desirable though that may be.</P>
    <P>One of the points which will require very close consideration during the Committee Stage is the question of the desirability of having some advisory committee provided for in the new Bill.  This is one of the matters on which most definite advice and guidance is given by the International Labour Office not merely in regard to the form of a general provision for an advisory body but also in regard to very specific indications of the powers and responsibilities of such a body.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that when we speak of an advisory committee its function is not merely to advise the Minister in respect of his powers under the Act or the regulations he is called upon to make nor is it even in respect of the inspectorial branch of his Department: there is a wider aspect of the matter, that is, the undertaking of the enlightenment and education not only of workers but also of employers and the public generally in modern standards of industrial safety and the welfare of the working people.  That requires not alone the activities of a Government Department.  It requires the activities of the Minister and his departmental advisers, the representatives of the workers and of the employers and in addition, in many cases, of the local authorities, together with the utilisation of all the modern methods that are adopted for educational purposes whether by way of lectures, the radio, films, exhibitions, and so forth.  Quite clearly, an advisory committee of that kind can do very effective work.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we propose to lay very strong stress on the need for close co-operation between the inspectorial branch of the Minister's Department and not merely the workers' organisation but also the employers' organisation in so far as they represent what is best in the minds of employers from the point of view of the safety of the workers.  The good employer has just <Col N="481" /> as strong an objection to the bad employer as the trade union has and we feel it would make for more effective inspection and would be of considerable assistance to the inspectors, if it were possible to associate at top level such an advisory council with the chief inspector and his assistant, and then, moving down the various rungs of the ladder, in turn associate at the level of industry or the individual enterprise a representative of the workers and the employers in the actual carrying out of the regulations which may be made by this House.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that there is a need to encourage and assist the workers themselves in taking full advantage of any protection that may be afforded to them by this House whether it is by way of regulation or equipment and the very fact that in the Bill itself we recognise that workers on occasion may even harm or destroy equipment specially provided for their welfare and that we have to make provision against that, does show that there is that factor lacking.  One way of getting that done is to establish the direct interest and concern of the workers in the application and the enforcement of those regulations and to encourage in them a sense of responsibility towards seeing that the regulations are carried out in their own particular workplace by the employer.  The co-operation of the workers should be sought, and whatever special equipment is made available should be regarded not so much as the employer's property but property put there by the legislature for the protection of the workers.  All that can be done through the medium of the advisory council working through committees or delegations, depending on the size of the enterprise, right down to the industry.</P>
    <P>That is why I would stress that if we are thinking in terms of this Bill having been pictured to some extent against the background of recent British legislation and if we have regard to the stature and standing of the International Labour Office, we should follow the guidance of the International Labour Office in its broadest aspect and where it can be <Col N="482" /> of most benefit in making this legislation effective.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points on which I would like to touch briefly. While the Minister indicated that he is up against difficulty with regard to extending this Bill to deal with officers in commercial employment, I am still not fully satisfied in the matter.  I recognise that there are different features to deal with which may require special legislation, but I do think that even within the compass of the present Bill there are certain features particularly relating to health and welfare which might well have been introduced in a preliminary manner by way of regulation if it was only merely to test the ground and gain experience for the drafting of fuller legislation.</P>
    <P>We are aware that however anxious the Minister may be&mdash;whether it be the present Minister or his predecessor &mdash;to deal with this question of the welfare and health of office employees, he does find difficulty in squeezing Bills of this character into the legislative schedule.  The very fact that, as we know, the present Bill has been more or less under consideration since before the war, and that it has been mainly in draft as far back as 1947, shows that it is not too easy to gain the necessary attention from the Oireachtas to secure the passing of this legislation. I personally have a feeling that no matter how anxious the responsible Minister may be, whoever he is, there will be considerable delay before we see legislation designed to deal with the question of the welfare, health and safety of commercial employees coming before this House.</P>
    <P>Rather than have that delay take place, I think we might have ventured a little bit in the present instance and at least tried to apply some provisions of the present Bill to office employees. It could quite easily have been done without giving rise to many problems. In many ways there is almost a greater urgency in respect of certain office employees as regards welfare and health than there is in respect of workers engaged in ordinary factories and workshops.  Some of the conditions <Col N="483" /> are abominable and the very fact that this type of employee has a lower standard of trade union organisation, and, therefore, trade union protection, than is enjoyed by industrial workers, means there is all the greater need to have them given the protection of legislation through appropriate measures being passed.</P>
    <P>There has been reference before in regard to the question of penalties, whether it is desirable to provide for heavy penalties under the Act, knowing that the courts will not have regard to the maximum, but, on the other hand, realising that if we increase the maximum there will be reluctance to find the prosecution proved.  However, I do think we should have regard to the fact that if we are taking factory legislation seriously we do to some extent undermine our own approach to the matter when workers read, as they read in our newspapers every day, where employers are brought up for serious contravention of the regulations, contraventions which in certain cases have resulted in accidents or in other cases might have led to very serious accidents, that purely nominal fines of 5/-, 10/-or 15/- are imposed.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the newspaper report does not carry the full details of the proceedings, or the evidence on either side, but if we believe that it is essential, for example, adequately to protect dangerous machinery, how can we induce workers to believe that we are taking that matter seriously when the employer is prosecuted for failing to comply with regulations and, as so often is the case, a purely nominal fine of a few shillings is imposed on the employer?  The worker reads that report&mdash;maybe he is employed in that undertaking and he sees what has happened to his employer for a gross breach of the Act; perhaps he goes out of his workplace, rides home on his bicycle without any light and finds he has to pay as big a fine as his employer for not having a lamp on his bicycle.</P>
    <P>It is not really a question of the penalty on the employer concerned because in my opinion any penalty we would think of putting into legislation <Col N="484" /> in this House would still be so relatively small in relation to the normal financial resources of employers that it would not make very much difference. It seems to me the publicity and the recording of a conviction are the more important factors.  Nevertheless it does have the effect on the workers of lowering the whole status of factory legislation when a case comes before the court in respect of a breach of the regulations and it is dealt with in the same way as a case of a boy or girl summoned for not having a lamp on a bicycle.  That is one aspect of the matter we should look at.</P>
    <P>Following the last reading I noticed one particular aspect in which the Minister should go further and that is with regard to Section 83 dealing with the position of dockers.  The section provides that certain parts of the Act will apply but I notice with regard to Part IV that only the section of Part IV dealing with welfare will apply in the case of dockers.  In Part IV there are other factors such as the provision of first aid, supplies of drinking water, washing facilities, accommodation for clothing, etc.  At the moment I am not quite clear whether the intention of the Bill, as it now stands, is to limit the application of Section 83 only to that part of Part IV which deals with welfare or that somewhere else in the Bill it is possible to extend to dockers such measures as the supply of drinking water, washing facilities, accommodation for clothing and so on which are being provided for other types of worker.  I do not see any reason why these facilities should not be extended to dockers who need these facilities just the same as other workers if not more so.  It may be argued that because of the situation of the docks and quays this is more a matter for the local authorities.  These facilities which are set down in Part IV should be extended to cover the dockers.</P>
    <P>Finally, in his introductory speech the Minister touched upon the question of the initiation of prosecutions.  As I understand it, previously the power to initiate a prosecution did, in fact, lie with the inspectors.  The present Bill provides it will lie with the Minister. <Col N="485" /> While that may be bringing the Bill into line with the general legislative proposals in other Acts, I think we should examine the matter a little closer because to some extent the position has been that, under existing legislation, inspectors have been given a certain amount of autonomy and freedom from the overriding control of the Department under which they work.</P>
    <P>It can well be that an inspector may find that there have been breaches of the Act in his opinion and he may desire to prosecute, but if the decision to initiate the prosecution has got to be, as it is, determined by the Department or the officials, there will be an intolerable delay.  Various factors will start to impinge upon that decision and the matter may possibly end up with a decision not to prosecute or there may be so much delay that the inspector becomes disheartened.</P>
    <P>At the moment I think we should not make a change but work as we did before, leaving the power to initiate prosecutions with the inspectors subject to the other provisions I mentioned of a closer association of the workers and employers and trade organisations with the inspectorial branch in an advisory capacity.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the difficulty of trying to submit complaints to the inspectorial branch and being unable to follow them up to see what was the result.  To-day, I had to ask for the services of an inspector within ten miles of the city in a new concern which was started up and where, according to the reports I have, the workers have been working a 12 hour day without any toilet accommodation or drinking water and in a very badly dust-laden atmosphere.  There is no trade union organisation there.  What may happen now after I have submitted the complaint I do not know.  I have no doubt that the inspectors will do their job and, possibly, investigate the matter, but if there is no prosecution it is difficult to explain to the workers concerned what was the outcome. I think this matter was raised before.  There should be some provision whereby a responsible trade <Col N="486" /> organisation, whether a trade union or an organisation of workers and employers, when they submit a report and request an investigation, should be able to obtain further information to learn whether or not their complaint was well founded and whether adequate and satisfactory steps were being taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill will be welcomed not only by the employees of the various factories concerned but also by the employers.  There is nothing more distressing to the employees and the employers of a factory than an accident of any kind&mdash;especially a fatal accident.  Therefore, I have no doubt that the employers will be quite prepared to meet their commitments as far as the protection of the workers is concerned.</P>
      <P>However, Deputy Larkin referred to the question of the employers providing all the necessary safeguards for the workers and where they failed to do so the enforcement of the penalties contained in the Bill but I have, perhaps, had a different experience to Deputy Larkin.  I have had the experience of the workers themselves removing the safeguards which were placed there by their employers for their safety.  You are facing a very difficult task when you are talking about enforcing the penalties on the employer for not providing safeguards but what are you going to do with the employee who removes these safeguards where they are provided?  I think that is a matter that should be looked into.  It is a very serious matter where an employee is injured by reason of the negligence of his employer but I think it is a much more serious case when an employee is injured as a result of the removal of the safety devices provided as a safeguard for his protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that we need worry too much about the fact that this Bill is in some respects a copy of Acts which have operated across the water. I think we should be quite prepared to copy and accept the very best that is contained in the legislation of any country if it provides for up-to-date safeguards for a worker.  Therefore, I do not think that we should hang our <Col N="487" /> heads because we happen to follow an example of a nation that has, I suppose, anything up to 200 years of industrial experience behind it.  I am sure if the Bill was examined very carefully you would find sections therein which could be traced to countries other than the country mentioned. From that point of view, I think we need not worry too much about the similarity of this legislation to English legislation.</P>
    <P>However, there is one point which occurs to me and that is the question of the inspection of the factory.  I hope that when the Bill does operate that the hordes of inspectors that used to haunt the minds of Deputy Morrissey and the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, in the past will not begin to operate in these factories. I know&mdash;I can speak from experience &mdash;of cases where you had perhaps two inspectors&mdash;and I have known an occasion when at least three inspectors &mdash;entered a factory.  That type of inspection is not very helpful; it is inclined to interfere with the work of an established concern.  I am all in favour of seeing that all the safeguards and protection that should be afforded to workers are afforded and if there are any industrial concerns that are not meeting the requirements of the Bill or of the Act when it will become an Act&mdash;then, by all means let the inspectors do their work.  But it ought to be easy to arrange some system whereby the question of a number of inspectors entering the factory on the one day will be obviated.  I do not think it would be very difficult to ensure that a particular inspector in respect of a particular type of factory would be the only inspector who would go in there on a particular day.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to take notice of the reference which I have made to the removal of the safeguards for workers by the workers because I think it is a serious aspect of factory protection and it is a desirable thing if an employer installs this type of equipment that it should be left there; and if an accident is brought about by the removal in any circumstances of a piece of safety equipment by a worker, <Col N="488" /> the Bill should be capable of providing for action against such a person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been and industrial worker myself for a number of years before entering public life, I feel it incumbent on me to participate for a brief moment in this debate.</P>
      <P>As intimated in the explanatory note accompanying the text of this Bill, the purpose of it is to provide for the welfare and safety of industrial workers and to ensure that they will enjoy reasonable comfort when engaged in their different occupations.  I welcome this Bill very much and I think the people who will be affected by it will also welcome it.  We all realise that it is one of the functions of a Government to legislate for the different sections of the community with regard to social welfare and health especially, but I consider that this Bill will go a long way towards removing many of the obstacles which have been placed in the way of the comfort of the workers in general and that it will make them more productive and co-operative as a result.  When people are reasonably comfortable in their work they are able to give a better return to their employers and that is one reason why I think the employers themselves will welcome this Bill because even though they are bound in common justice and decency to provide proper facilities for their employees they themselves will benefit ultimately when they consider that they are getting a better return from the people they employ.</P>
      <P>There is an important section in Part IV to which I would like to refer. It is Section 53, sub-section (1) and it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be provided and maintained for the use of employed persons adequate and suitable accommodation for clothing not worn during working hours and such arrangements as are reasonably practicable, or where a standard is prescribed, such arrangements as are specified in the relevant regulations, shall be made for drying such clothing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wet clothes are a constant source of danger to the health of the people&mdash;<Col N="489" /> we all realise that, and I compliment the Minister on making this very necessary provision in this Bill.  I can assure him it will be very welcome among the workers.</P>
    <P>Section 13, sub-section (2) deals with ventilation.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Health, may, by regulations, prescribe a standard of adequate ventilation for factories or for any class or description of factory or parts thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ventilation is good in its proper place but in some industrial premises there is far too much ventilation when we consider bad roofs, bad windows, defective walls and draughty doors.  I think the Minister will agree with me when I say that these dangers in premises are very detrimental to people's health and stringent steps should be taken to enforce existing and proposed legislation concerning the elimination of these dangers.</P>
    <P>It is a very exhaustive Bill and I do not intend to say much more about it.  I suppose more comment will be made during the Committee Stage.  I repeat that I welcome it as a step forward towards the ideal environment in which a worker may give of his best.</P>
    <P>I suppose some employers may quibble or protest against all these measures when they consider the extra expense it may entail, but I am sure the Minister will give them ample time to put their premises in order.  They will co-operate wholeheartedly, I think, when they realise that good working conditions begets contentment and that contentment begets good workmanship which in turn begets increased production.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill and its introduction shows that he has the interests of the people and especially the workers at heart.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the Labour Party on this Bill is very much similar to what it was when Deputy Lemass introduced his Factories Bill last year.  We do not agree with all <Col N="490" /> that is in the Bill, in so far as we do not accept it as going far enough in some particular sections and we intend to improve the measure by suitable amendments at the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to talk at all on a Bill such as this on the Second Reading beyond generally indicating the line we intend to follow when it comes to Committee Stage.  Whether this is the Bill of the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Bill of the present Minister does not make any difference in so far as we welcome it because it certainly is an improvement, as the last Bill was, on the old Act.  It needed improving; it was out of date and as Deputy Larkin says, this is the first Irish legislation, and in view of our experience since the industrial revival, let us hope it will be comprehensive, full, and as far as possible in the interests of both workers and managements themselves in promoting good working conditions and I would say good relations between the workers and employers.  I would like to take advantage of the Second Reading to draw the Minister's attention to what we feel&mdash;certainly in the small rural towns that have become industrialised&mdash;that there are, as we are aware, as the Minister is aware, and as the former Minister is aware, certain out-dated buildings which were turned into factories.  The managements have, to the best of their ability, endeavoured to comply with the regulations but in some instances no effort at all has been made to improve the conditions that were primitive at the start, and over the years&mdash;quite a number of years now&mdash;no following-up improvement has taken place such as could have taken place by using the reserves that these companies built up.</P>
      <P>The trade union people who are interested find a great deal of difficulty in contacting the inspectorial staff of the Minister's Department.  How they visit, how frequently or when they are going to visit factories, we have no knowledge.  We read of, or hear from our workers that an inspector visited such a factory on such a date.  Other industries that needed a visit or needed inspection in the same areas appear to be ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> I would welcome a much more frequent inspection and above all things I would welcome some co-operation between the workers' organisations and the inspectorial staff when they do visit an area.  I believe we could indicate to these inspectors the things that we think worthy of investigation. It is not an attempt to tell them what they should do but an effort to co-operate with them in drawing attention to what we believe are dangers or sources of danger to the people employed there.</P>
    <P>I know of a particular case of one industrial town where a certain machine has been worked for the past six or seven years.  That firm has been inspected many times&mdash;how many times I could not say&mdash;but it was not until two or three months ago when the machine had torn the right arm off a boy that certain elementary precautions in the way of safeguards were enforced on the firm by taking them into the law courts.  Had we been consulted by the inspector prior to that, we could have told him of near misses where our workers just escaped injury but we had to wait until somebody was mutilated for life before the inspectorial staff carried out a duty that they should have very well carried out long before.  No matter how we work on this Bill, no matter what regulations we put in, unless they are enforced, it is going to be a waste of time when it becomes an Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin spoke of the Labour Party's desire to have consultative councils set up not only at the top but in each individual factory, representing both the management and the workers. With co-operation between these and the inspectorial staff of the Department of Industry and Commerce, we could indicate to the Minister perhaps special regulations that could not necessarily be put in a Bill such as this but which would apply to particular or localised industries, and which would be necessary for the good management and the working of the factory.</P>
    <P>We will at the appropriate stage, I hope, endeavour to put the points we have in mind in print, in the form of <Col N="492" /> amendments, and, with the help of the Opposition&mdash;because I think this Bill is non-controversial as far as the political side is concerned&mdash;endeavour to get the utmost out of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inevitable that legislation of this nature must have its most fruitful period in the Dáil on Committee Stage.  I find myself in accord with Deputy Kyne.  This Bill is undoubtedly a substantial step in the right direction, but there are many facets which appear to me as being rather limited in their scope and not sufficiently wide in their effect.</P>
      <P>We are initiating here for the first time a measure that might be described as a comprehensive effort to co-ordinate and codify a certain type of factory legislation that has been in being&mdash;for the most part, taken-over legislation and regulations that may in the main have been culled from some other source.  It is an attempt&mdash;and, in fairness, let it be said, a praiseworthy attempt&mdash;to initiate an Irish code in relation to factories.  Maybe I have an insatiable desire that something which has the characteristic Irish stamp should carry it on the possible highest level.  I would rather see this Bill err on the side of providing ideal conditions for the workers with regard to building and spacing than to see it fall short.</P>
      <P>There are many facets of factory legislation that this Bill is not going to touch.  One of the things that I find from experience of dealing with many industrial concerns&mdash;and I have inspected hundreds of factories in this country&mdash;is the tremendous element of noise and disorder that is occasioned by outmoded buildings or by wrong suspensions, or wrong spacing of machinery that it could be and should be an effective part of our legislation to eliminate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that once we are making a step in that direction at all, we should try to arrive at a minimum standard which would tend in the ultimate analysis to make for the optimum standard.  There is no doubt that very large and serious changes are necessary to improve the lot of the industrial worker.  It may well be said that to <Col N="493" /> some of the industries in this country this Bill means nothing because the standards which they have already set themselves are infinitely higher than the standard which this Bill creates. Unfortunately, that is not true of many industries that have been created in hasty circumstances, or in unsuitable buildings in a situation of urgency.  I feel that the legislation itself is going to serve no purpose if the Minister cannot give it some assurance that there is going to be constant, effective and rational supervision in relation to the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We know perfectly well&mdash;if we are prepared to take our tongues out of our cheeks and talk honestly&mdash;that there are many factories in this country that have never been inspected and that there are many industries where, in general, conditions may be satisfactory but where complaints in regard to petty things have never been investigated or eliminated. In the case of the industrial worker class, the things which agitate their minds very actively are the primary comforts to which they are entitled&mdash; adequate accommodation in relation to drinking water, toilets, rest space or cloakrooms or adequate protection for garments they may have to leave aside during working hours.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the provision for adequate custody of the bicycles, which they have to utilise in coming or going to work.  These little things are matters which are usually neglected but, if proper attention were paid to them, they would make for a better approach by the worker towards his employer.</P>
    <P>Will this Bill be just another milestone in the volume of legislation or will it be, in fact, effectively enforced to ensure at least a minimum standard for all factories throughout the length and breadth of the land?  I hope it will be effectively enforced and in that belief I say to the Minister in an earnest way: &ldquo;Good luck and God speed to this measure.&rdquo;  It is a measure which I think calls for substantial amendment, not in the sense of amendment of principle but amendment of detail, and broadening of the <Col N="494" /> technique of control.  There is no doubt that there are certain facets of this Bill which must commend themselves in general to everybody in this House.  I am very glad to see provision for more stringent enforcement of regulations governing ventilation and dust-extractor equipment, in relation to factories.  I am glad to see that somebody has at least conceded the necessity for a greater cubic space per head for industrial workers than was previously conceded.  There is nothing, I think, more conducive to trouble than overcrowding of industrial workers in small spaces, particularly where the type of work involves of necessity large dust content or large gaseous displacements.</P>
    <P>We have got to face realities and I think that this Bill is a reasonable contribution and a worthwhile step towards the necessity of ensuring that our industrial workers are employed in conditions that are at least comparable, if not better, than those afforded industrial workers in any of the neighbouring countries whose conditions we know.  It is difficult on the Second Reading Stage to get down to the problem of a Factories Bill, but we can say that, in common with all sides of the House, we look upon this Bill as an advance in the right direction.  I do not feel that any worthwhile employer or industrialist will have any objection at all to this measure because the measure will be a platform on which substantial goodwill can be established between the executive of any industry and its employees.  It is inevitable that where you have a drive towards re-industrialising the country, the State should lay down minimum conditions.</P>
    <P>I think it was always the ambition of the former Minister for Industry and Commerce that we would arrive at a situation where there could be at least a minimum standard laid down in relation to factories.  His successor, as a very experienced and substantial trade unionist himself, as a man with very wide industrial contacts, should be able even to enlarge on the conception that was heretofore in the Factories Bill.  Let us do the job as well as we can; I would rather err on <Col N="495" /> the side of the worker than fall short of the standards we should set.  I believe myself that it is in the ultimate interests of the industrialist to ensure adequate and reasonable protective precautions in relation to all dangerous machinery because we know full well that the impact of heavy rates of insurance, heavy protection against accident, is a very considerable overhead in industry.  It is in the interests of the industrialist to ensure that the first cost will not be the least cost and if he takes the precaution of adequately protecting his machinery, he is at least minimising to his own benefit the consequences of carelessness in this respect.</P>
    <P>I am very much inclined to the view expressed by Deputy Larkin that in the ultimate punishment, there is not a sufficiently serious view of infringements of the code as it now exists, in relation to the adequate protection of machinery.  There is not a sufficiently serious view taken by the courts.  I do feel that we should aim at a basic minimum in relation to factory standards, breaches of which could lead to consequences as serious for the employer as other types of breaches might lead to for the employees.  We face in this Bill, I would say, a fairly solidly united House in which there will be a spontaneous desire to try to get the best possible type of Bill out of the Committee Stage.  In that spirit I would say to the Minister, with his experience in relation to industrial workers and in relation to the problems of industrial workers generally, to give the House in amendments which he will submit, the benefit of the known ambitions and aims of reasonable groups of industrial workers in relation to the standards necessary for their factories.  I feel in relation to this Bill that if we can arrive at a proper basis of legislation we will get a spontaneity of goodwill as between the employer and employee that will make for a peaceful co-operative expansive policy within industry in this State, and that our factories will ultimately tend to become places in which the worker is happy to work and the employer is anxious to and desirous of keeping the factory in such a condition <Col N="496" /> in relation to its physical appearance, the protection of its machinery, the problems of dust eradication, proper ventilation and adequate accommodation that he will be prepared to keep it at the very highest level in the knowledge that what is good for his factory and good for his employees will ultimately mean good business for himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister was well advised in introducing this Bill in the same order and condition in which he got it from his predecessor, if only for the reason that that should speed its passage to the Statute Book.  The Minister has indicated that he proposes to introduce some amendments on the Committee Stage.  In that connection, I join with Deputy Lemass in appealing to him to let us have an early indication, if possible, of what those amendments will be.  Many of us here and many organisations of employers and employees believe there are certain things in this Bill which might usefully be taken out of it while, at the same time, there are certain things missing from the Bill that might usefully be incorporated in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the Bill as an advance.  It is a step forward so far as workers and employers in industry are concerned. I am, however, disappointed that there is no provision made in relation to staffs working in offices.  The Minister has indicated, and it has been confirmed by Deputy Lemass, that he has been advised that this is not a measure which might usefully be utilised to legislate in relation to conditions of work for office workers.  I am not altogether convinced of that and I would ask the Minister to have another look at the Bill and to consider going so far as providing in this measure something in the nature of minimum standards of hygiene in relation to offices.  Those of us who have been close to this aspect of industry generally are only too well aware of the conditions that exist in offices. There is overcrowding; there is bad ventilation and bad lighting.  I think statistics, certainly those of some of the medical officers of health attached to local authorities, indicate that the <Col N="497" /> prevalence of tuberculosis is higher amongst office workers than it is in relation to any other type of worker. I am prepared, however, to accept the assurance of the Minister and Deputy Lemass that this is not the best Bill under which to legislate in that regard, but I appeal to the Minister to have another look at it and, if possible, to incorporate some provisions which will lay down at least minimum standards in relation to offices.  Later it should be possible to present more comprehensive legislation in order to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>The most pungent criticism levelled against the Factory Acts is in relation to the carrying out of inspections. Deputy Traynor had some complaint to make in that direction also, though his complaint is somewhat opposed to mine; he complained of too many inspectors visiting the factories on the one day.  No doubt that complaint is well founded, but it is our experience that the workers feel they are not getting adequate protection even within the limited scope of the existing Acts because they believe inspections are not made frequently enough.  As another speaker said here, there is a feeling in some cases that factories are never inspected at all.  Workers come along and complain to their organisations that when the factory inspector does visit he is taken on a more or less managerial conducted tour of the factory; they feel&mdash;I think quite rightly so&mdash;that they should be given an opportunity of assisting the inspector in the discharge of his duties.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is considering the setting up of this advisory council to assist employers and employees he should also consider the setting up of local advisory committees, particularly in the more concentrated industrial areas, to function with the local inspector and assist him in the carrying out of his duties.  I am sorry that offices are outside the scope of the Bill.  I am sorry, too, that certain premises have been deliberately excluded in Section 3; the phraseology there seems to deliberately exclude such places as the locomotive sheds and garages of our national transport system.  Specific reference is made to <Col N="498" /> premises in which cleaning, washing and running repairs are carried out.  I see no reason why such places as railway locomotive sheds and garages should be deliberately excluded from the scope of this Bill and I appeal to the Minister to reconsider that particular exclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a very necessary measure and it is one which, when enacted, will bring a very great measure of happiness and a certain feeling of security to many workers. Looking through the Bill I was struck by Section 74 of Part VI in which it is provided that the medical practitioner shall notify the Minister in relation to industrial diseases.  I bethought myself of an experience I had with some employees who were considering the taking out of an insurance policy to enable them to reap certain benefits, if they were incapacitated through illness, which would bring their wages up to a reasonable figure taken in conjunction with National Health Insurance or social welfare benefits.  I was handling the matter myself and I discovered that certain industrial diseases are excluded from most of these insurance policies and in order to cover certain industrial diseases it is necessary to take out a separate policy.  Such a policy involves a considerable expenditure. Indeed, in the specific instance I have given the point was reached where it became questionable as to whether or not the management and workers would proceed with such insurance. The Minister would be well advised to consider the case of persons who are in danger of contracting diseases by virtue of the industry in which they are engaged.  I know that in Section 56 provision is made whereby the Minister can insist on the employer providing special or additional benefits and that he can also make an Order whereby the workers or management may be required to make a contribution jointly or severally.  This is a very good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider expediting that matter because there are many industries in which there are dangers of industrial disease.  For instance, in the milling industry there <Col N="499" /> is a danger of various skin diseases. That is the industry to which I refer. The Minister should get his Department to investigate the whole matter and see that dangers of diseases are suitably insured against in the case of the workers who might contract them because social welfare benefits and health benefits will not leave the worker in a position to look after his family.  If there is danger by virtue of his occupation the State should see that insurance is taken out against financial loss in respect of this danger.</P>

      <P>This is the third week of the present session in the Dáil.  It is quite evident that this is the most important matter that the House has discussed.  It is a pleasure to realise that we can discuss a very important matter affecting the lives of the workers in industry with full understanding that both sides of the House are discussing it with a view to getting the best possible system we can.</P>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Kyne, I would stress the importance of inspection. Section 17 says that an inspector can bring in a county medical officer of health or health inspector.  Up to the present, conditions in some of the factories or workshops in some of the rural areas have been scandalous.  I often wondered if the inspectors ever called there.  Having been told on some occasions that they did, I often wondered what duties an inspector was supposed to perform.  It is most disgraceful that such conditions as obtained in some factories could exist. Despite the protests of workers and of their unions no system of improvement had emanated from any quarter.  I hope, please God, that by the introduction of this Bill we are entering into a new era when there will be better understanding in industry.  As many speakers have mentioned, this legislation, as well as being important for the worker, is also important for the employer so that a spirit of co-operation may be developed in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a good Bill.  It is a Bill that <Col N="500" /> we want and it is a Bill that we want in operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the principle of factory and workshop legislation has long been accepted by the House, this Bill becomes very largely a Committee Stage Bill and many of the matters which have been raised here could probably have been raised more appropriately on the Committee Stage since they relate to the details of the measure now before the House and not to the general principles enshrined in our factory and workshop legislation. No doubt, many of the points which have been raised will reappear on the Committee Stage and some of the points which have been raised will probably be covered by amendments.</P>
      <P>I gather from what has been said in the course of the debate that the House is anxious to see the ministerial amendments first so as to enable Deputies to know what matters are being covered by these amendments. If that is the wish of the House, I will make sure that the ministerial amendments are circulated in sufficient time to enable Deputies to move further amendments, if that is desired.</P>
      <P>I took the course of reintroducing this Bill in its present form because I thought it was the sensible thing to do, because I thought it was the most expeditious way of dealing with the matter, because I felt it was easier for those who had taken a keen interest in the Bill to rediscuss a Bill with which they were familiar rather than that I should distort the pattern of the Bill by injecting amendments into it at this stage.  We know the Bill up to the end of the Second Stage and if there is going to be a change in pattern let it be a change in pattern with which we will all be familiar and a change in pattern which, I hope, we will all help to make.  It is because I felt&mdash;and experience has justified my view&mdash;that the reintroduction of this Bill in its old form would probably accelerate discussion here that I adopted that line of procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some matters have been raised on this Bill which are more appropriate to a Committee Stage discussion but there are some that have been raised which <Col N="501" /> might be said to be somewhat larger issues.  Even if some of them relate to a Committee Stage discussion, it may be well to try to clear these matters with the Deputies concerned.  I am quite willing, if it is generally agreed, to leave the Committee Stage over for, say, three weeks.  I will do my best to have the official amendments circulated within a fortnight's time and, if Deputies wish, they can put in amendments in the other week.  If, at the end of that period, they feel they would like a longer period to deal with amendments, we can quite easily arrange that and defer the Committee Stage to a later date.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised in the course of this discussion of the application of this Bill to office workers.  I would like to have made the Bill applicable to office workers but to do so would first involve withdrawal of the Bill because the present title would not suit the Bill if it were made applicable to those who work in offices.  In any case, even if I got to the stage of withdrawing the Bill and making it applicable to those who work in offices, I do not think in the long run we would have got very far because my inquiries in the Department convinced me that there was not any substantial amount of documentation there on the problems of office workers and that, if we were to get into the field of legislating for office workers, a goodly amount of research would have to be done in that field.</P>
    <P>I then endeavoured to ascertain what the International Labour Office position was.  I ascertained that there has been no report yet by the International Labour Office in respect of office workers.  They have had this matter under consideration for nearly three years.  That shows that it is not just an open and shut question; it is one that has taken a highly skilled technical organisation like the International Labour Office nearly three years to consider and, so far, we have not got a report from the International Labour Office.  That is a factor which Deputies ought to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Lemass that if we are going to write into our legislative <Col N="502" /> code a basic document like a Factories Bill and a basic document like a Bill protecting office workers we ought to get the best possible Bill we can.  Here I do not travel the same road as Deputy Larkin as to the origin of this Bill.  I think this Bill, frankly, is very largely patterned on what the British did in some fields.  The British may have embodied in some of their legislation recommendations which came from the International Labour Office but, quite frankly, I approach the whole problem of a Factories Bill or, for that matter, any other Bill, from this angle, that I would like to pick the best brains in the world and find out the best possible way of doing a thing.  We should not be parochial or excessively nationalistic in our legislation or in our solutions for problems, nor should we reject a widely accepted method if it is an intelligent one, in preference to some less efficient method which happens to have an author who lives or was born in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the field of postal, telegraph and telephonic communications, there are international methods and regulations; in the air field, there are international regulations for air transport; in shipping, there are international regulations accepted by very many countries; in the field of mining there are international regulations also.  If we wish to find the best way to protect the interests of workers in, say, a textile factory and if we find that somewhere in the world there is a better way of doing so than has occurred to ourselves, quite frankly I would take the world solution&mdash;subject to the test that it is efficient and supplies a solution to the problem in our own country.  Therefore, while this Bill may have been fashioned on the basis of legislation previously in operation, I do not find any fault with it on that score, nor would I find any fault if it were a sensible way devised in some Scandinavian country&mdash;subject all the time to the test that it suits the particular job we want to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to an advisory committee.  On the Committee Stage of the Bill which was before the <Col N="503" /> last Dáil, I submitted an amendment designed to secure the establishment of an advisory committee and Deputy Lemass, then Minister, also gave directions for such a committee to be established.  I think we are in agreement on that principle.  The only question at issue is whether we should catalogue the functions of the committee in detail or give them broad functions assigned to them by the Minister either permanently or from time to time and allow the committee to do its work in that field.  On the Committee Stage I will certainly bring in an amendment to establish an advisory committee and I hope the proposal will be acceptable to the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin referred to the inadequate fines imposed by the courts for offences against the Factories Acts. I agree with him that those fines are utterly inadequate and in no way mark the disapproval of a breach of the law but it is difficult to see what you can do by legislation.  The temptation is to impose a minimum fine, but one wonders whether that will give the requisite result.  Rather than impose the minimum fine, which offends against the tastes of district justices, they may allow a person scot-free and the second position would really be worse than the first.  Where the legislature intends employers to conform to certain standards of health safeguards and where there are transgressions by the employer, I think district justices should take note of that and mark their disapproval by adequate fines in relation to the offence.  Some of the fines imposed have been trifling ones, such as one would impose on a young boy or girl for cycling without a light ten minutes after lighting-up time.  It must be borne in mind that what may be to-day just a breach of some protection clause in a Factories Act may to-morrow be an inquest.  An offence in not providing adequate protection could, if the element of luck were absent, result in an inquest on the injured worker.</P>
    <P>There is some force, however, in the contention that the method of dealing with offences through the courts is not <Col N="504" /> the ideal one in the long run. Admittedly, it is one way of dealing with the problem of transgressions against the law.  It has been the accepted pattern, but we ought to take the view that it is not the only method. By increasing our inspectorate staff, which I think is inadequate at the moment, and by gearing up that staff to ensure compliance with factory legislation, we might obviate the necessity for prosecutions.  At all events, there is something to be said for the point of view that public opinion, by taking a serious view of these transgressions, would make it clear that they were not looked upon as simple offences but were regarded as neglect by the employer of his obvious duty to safeguard the interests and material well-being of those whom he employed.  I do not think I can deal with this by raising the fines.  So long as a minimum fine is not imposed, it might well be that by reliance on the fine method to some extent and by the dissemination of information and propaganda through the advisory committee, the protective standard may be raised in a way that the fine itself could not achieve.</P>
    <P>Deputy Traynor asked about workers deliberately removing the safeguards provided.  Apparently, he did not advert to Section 122, which provides that workers who deliberately abuse the safeguards or remove them or do not take cognisance of them are guilty of an offence; and Section 98 provides penalties in such cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan raised the question of industrial diseases and asked that some provision be made for workers who contract diseases peculiar to the industry in which they are employed. Such provisions never had a place in a Factories and Workshops Bill.  The Workmen's Compensation Act, which is administered by the Department of Social Welfare, is the Act which deals with industrial diseases.  Provision is made there for scheduling them.  Where a person suffers a disability as a result of contracting an industrial disease, there is provision for compensation under that Act.  I must, therefore, suggest to the Deputy that he find his remedy through an amendment of that Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" /> Deputies Kyne and Larkin raised the question of inspection of factories and the difficulty of ascertaining whether inspections, which trade unions had asked should be carried out, in fact had been carried out.  In particular, Deputy Larkin asked that trade unions, being responsible bodies, should know the result of the inquiries which had been set on foot in the first instance by the trade union and which had been completed by the inspector who will function under this Bill.  I do not think that can be legislated for suitably in a Bill of this kind.  I agree that there is need for greater co-operation between trade unions, on the one hand, who are anxious to see the provisions of this Act applied in full and, on the other hand, the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce who are responsible for ensuring that the Act is complied with so far as their authorities go.  I will consider, when the Bill is through both Houses of the Oireachtas, what can be done to devise some responsible method of co-ordination and some responsible and sensible liaison arrangement between trade unions and an inspectorate staff with a view to ensuring that that co-operation will be of a fruitful character and that it will produce perhaps a better and more sensible approach to our factory inspection arrangements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne raised the question of the inadequate protection afforded in some factories.  Indeed, I could quite underwrite some of the things he said. There are some, not many, factories where the standard of protection is not adequate and where there is some considerable difficulty in getting the owners to comply even with the requirements of a factory Act introduced 53 years ago.  I hope that this new Bill and the approbation which it has got in this House will bring home to these people, if not voluntarily at least through the powers of this Bill, how essential it is that adequate safeguards should be provided for workers in factories and that proper factories should, in fact, be erected or provided by reconstruction to ensure that those who are destined to spend the best <Col N="506" /> part of their lives in factories will do so under the best possible conditions.</P>
    <P>I thought, in connection with this Bill, that I would insert a clause providing either for the appointment of a safety committee in a factory which employed a certain number of workers or a kind of a safety delegate.  It may be possible to do that on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  In that way, you could tie in the work of the safety committee in a factory with the inspection by the officer of the Department.</P>
    <P>If these two are regarded as having complementary functions, I think it would be possible to obviate the necessity for many prosecutions because the irregularities would be brought to the notice of the owners or management on the spot by the safety committee and presumably these defects would be attended to before the inspector arrived.  If there were any contention on the matter, the safety delegate who would be looking after the workers would have an opportunity of telling the visiting inspector of the difficulties in the hope that they would be removed by the intervention of the inspector.  However, that is something which I shall have examined between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not regard this Bill as a political Bill.  It does not matter to me who puts this Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The most important thing, to my mind, is that it is put on the Statute Book and written into our code of legislation.  It is long overdue. Tributes to its progressiveness have been paid by speakers from all sides of the House.  I hope that, in the course of the debate on the Committee Stage, we shall get the same co-operation as has been manifested on this Second Reading debate and which was manifested also on the Second Reading debate which took place here prior to the dissolution of the last Dáil.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will be welcomed by trade unions.  Certainly, it has long been sought for by them.  I hope also it will be welcomed by good employers who will see in it an effort to provide certain minimum and reasonable standards of protection for the physical <Col N="507" /> well-being of the workers employed in their factories.</P>
    <P>So far as the Committee Stage is concerned, I shall look at amendments in a reasonable and certainly in a non-Party way.  If it should be the desire of the House, I would be quite willing to send this Bill to a Special Committee of the House to have it dealt with there.  If that course is not acceptable then we can have the discussions here in the House.  Perhaps Deputy Lemass would indicate which course he would favour?</P>

    <Title>Cork Fever Hospital (Amendment) Bill, 1954&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. O'Higgins) Thomas Francis (Jnr.) O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of the Bill is to revise a decision taken in 1935 which was fully justified by the circumstances existing then but which has been made out of date by subsequent developments.</P>
      <P>There is on Richmond Hill, in Cork City, an old fever hospital which is administered by a committee of management which includes representatives of the Cork Corporation and the Cork County Council.  The Cork Fever Hospital Act, 1935, provided for the replacement of this hospital by a new hospital for infectious diseases, the cost of which would be met mainly from sweepstakes funds.  The Act provided that the Cork Corporation would look after the building of the hospital and that, when it was finished, a new Cork Fever Hospital Board would take it over and manage it.  The old hospital would, at the same time, be closed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> The new Cork Fever Hospital Board was to be comprised initially of five representatives of the Cork Corporation, five of the Cork County Council and five other persons elected by the committee of management of the old hospital.  As the last-mentioned group of members ceased to hold office through death, resignation, or otherwise, they would be replaced by representatives of the two local authorities mentioned.  In time, therefore, the board would have been entirely a local authority.  The staff of the existing hospital was to have been taken over by the new board on the same conditions as they previously enjoyed.</P>
    <P>A site for the new hospital was selected at Gurranebraher, near Cork, and, in 1940, site development was commenced.  This was completed in 1944 but, due to conditions arising from the emergency, progress on the erection of the hospital was delayed.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the incidence of infectious diseases was declining to a great extent and, by the time that work could commence again on the hospital, this decline had become so regular and so marked that it was clear that fresh thinking was called for as to whether a new infectious diseases hospital in Cork was wanted at all.  As example, the number of cases of diphtheria in Cork City and County fell from 186 in 1935 to 22 in 1950 and the number of typhoid cases fell in the same period from 57 to one.</P>
    <P>In the light of figures such as these, a general review of the need for hospital beds in Cork led to the conclusion that the expected future cases of infectious diseases could be looked after in existing institutions and that the Gurranebraher Hospital would not be needed for such cases.  It was agreed with the Cork Corporation that it could be used to better advantage as an orthopaedic hospital.  An amendment of the 1935 Act is necessary to permit the hospital to be put to this use and it is proposed by the present Bill to make the necessary change.</P>
    <P>In view of the changed function of the new hospital, it is now proposed that it will not be administered by a special new board but will be taken over by the South Cork Board of <Col N="509" /> Public Assistance, consisting of members of the Cork Corporation and the Cork County Council which already administers St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork City and district hospitals in Bandon, Kinsale, Macroom, Midleton and Youghal.  The board of assistance and the committee managing the existing hospital agree with this.</P>
    <P>The paid officers working in the old hospital will become officers of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance, and will have the same tenure of office and rights as they would have had under the new fever hospital board, in accordance with the Act passed in 1935.  As the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948 considerably altered the law on the matter, some additional provisions are added relating to the pension rights of the transferred officers.</P>
    <P>The new hospital at Gurranebraher will fulfil a very vital need in the hospital services of the Cork area.  The incidence of orthopaedic ailments is remarkably high, and there is at present insufficient hospital accommodation for their treatment in the southern area. It is expected that the 133 beds in the new hospital will be adequate for this purpose.  The new regional sanatorium at Sarsfieldscourt is nearing completion. It had been the intention originally to provide accommodation for orthopaedic cases in a section of this building, but with the change of plan in relation to Gurranebraher, this is not now necessary.</P>
    <P>When the regional sanatorium at Sarsfieldscourt is opened, the hospital at Mallow, which is at present used for the treatment of tuberculosis, will revert to its original intended use as a general hospital for the north of the county.  This legislation will not affect the reversion in any way.</P>
    <P>The policy underlying the present Bill is acceptable to the interested local bodies.  Its purpose is to permit more efficient use being made of a hospital which will be a substantial addition to the facilities in the southern area, and I recommend the Bill to the House for a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>Now that the need for keeping up their institution for treating fevers has <Col N="510" /> ceased, the committee in charge of the Richmond Hill Hospital have willingly given their assent to the transfer of the full responsibility for the hospital treatment of these diseases to the local authority.  I think it is only right that when commending the Bill to the House, I should acknowledge their public spirited action, and pay tribute to all the members of the committee for their long and faithful service rendered to the people of Cork.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of the Bill is to continue the Rent Acts in operation for a further year pending the enactment of whatever legislation may be necessary as a result of the recommendations <Col N="511" /> in the Report on Rent Control presented to my predecessor by the Rents and Leaseholds Commission.  At present the main recommendations in the report (including recommendations for the continuance and extension of the present controls) are being considered at Government level.  When the Government have made decisions on the major issues, the drafting of the amending legislation can be proceeded with.</P>
      <P>I think that the period of one year for which the Acts are being extended is not too long having regard to the importance of the recommendations and the technical difficulties of this kind of legislation.  In fact, it may prove to be too short.  There will be no avoidable delay in pressing the matter forward, however.  And if, in the meantime, it becomes necessary to legislate for some particularly urgent problem&mdash;as it did earlier this year during my predecessor's term of office &mdash;I shall not hesitate to bring in an amending Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is on the lines of the Continuation Bills which have been passed in previous years by the House.  I think the necessity for it will be recognised by all Parties and I ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Produce (Meat) (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1954&mdash; Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill proposes to amend in certain respects three groups of Acts relating to meat and meat products&mdash;the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts, the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts.  In addition, it proposes to incorporate in permanent <Col N="512" /> legislation some existing provisions under Emergency Powers Orders.</P>
      <P>The Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts, 1930 to 1938, were designed to improve the general standard of the carcase meat and offals exported.  Premises at which cattle, sheep and pigs are slaughtered for export have to conform to certain standards before they may be registered under the Fresh Meat Acts, and all animals slaughtered thereat have to be subjected to ante-mortem and postmortem veterinary examination by veterinary examiners appointed by the Minister for Agriculture.  It is proposed in the present Bill (Section 2) to continue permanently the existing power to register slaughtering premises on a provisional basis under the Fresh Meat Acts.  Originally, provisional registration might be granted only within 12 months of the passing of the 1930 Act, the period being extended to 18 months under the 1931 Act.  The purpose then was to give time to the proprietors of premises which did not fully meet all the requirements of the 1930 Act to improve their premises up to the necessary full standard.  At the time of the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 1941, when exports of live stock had to cease and exports in carcase form only were possible a number of slaughtering premises not ordinarily engaged in the meat export trade had to be registered to engage in that trade.  The power to grant provisional registration was accordingly reintroduced by an Emergency Powers Order. It is desirable that power to grant provisional registration should continue to be available to meet contingencies in the future.  The power will also be useful in connection with efforts to improve standards at premises in the light of modern developments in the meat industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the emergency when the canned beef export trade developed it became necessary to permit beefcanning firms who were not themselves the proprietors of registered slaughtering premises, but whose cattle were slaughtered at registered premises for them, to export the offals from the <Col N="513" /> cattle slaughtered for such canning. The Fresh Meat Acts were accordingly amended by an Emergency Powers Order to enable special export licences under these Acts to be granted to firms holding manufacturing licences for meat-canning under the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts.  The Emergency Powers Order also provided for the grant of special licences for the export of livers in a benign condition which were suitable for use for pharmaceutical purposes but which could not be permitted for export for edible purposes (these livers have been distinctively dyed before export to ensure against their use for edible purposes). It is now proposed to incorporate the provisions of the Order in question in permanent legislation (Section 3 of the Bill).</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides (Section 8) for the salvaging, under supervision, of livers in a benign condition which should ordinarily be denatured.  During the emergency a trade developed in such livers which although unsuitable for human consumption were fit for use for pharmaceutical purposes.  Provision was made by an Emergency Powers Order for the salvaging of these livers under suitable supervision and this arrangement is now being put on a permanent basis.  As already indicated these livers are distinctively dyed before export to ensure against their use for edible purposes.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the Bill that the fees payable by carcase meat exporters in respect of the veterinary examination of the animals slaughtered by them for export may be altered by statutory regulations.  The fees at present payable (cattle 1/- per head, sheep 1½d. per head and pigs 3d. per head) are specified in the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930, and as matters stand they cannot be altered in any way.  The Pigs and Bacon Acts provide for charging of a veterinary examination fee not exceeding 6d. per pig in respect of pigs slaughtered at bacon factories and a fee of 5d. per pig has been charged under this authority since 1936.  It is now proposed (Sections 4 and 6 of the Bill) that under both sets of Acts the rates <Col N="514" /> of fee may in future be fixed by statutory regulations made by the Minister which will have to be approved by each House of the Oireachtas before becoming operative. The Oireachtas will accordingly have an opportunity of considering any proposed alterations in the fees before the alterations come into effect.</P>
    <P>A manufacturing licence under the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts is required in respect of the manufacture of canned meat products and certain other meat preparations.  It is necessary from time to time on technical and other grounds to amplify, or alter otherwise, the conditions attached to such licences but at present this can only be done by revoking the existing licence in each case after a month's notice.  It is proposed in the Bill (Section 5) to take power to alter the conditions attached to a manufacturing licence by serving notice of the alteration on the licence holders; this power to modify the licence conditions in a less cumbersome manner is required to meet changes decided upon in consultation with the meat canners generally or necessitated by the requirements of importing countries.  Any change would, of course, apply to all manufacturing licences and would not be confined to the licence held by a particular canner.</P>
    <P>It was provided by Emergency Powers Order in 1943 that certain classes of casualty pigs, viz., pigs that had been purchased by a bacon curer but died on the way to the factory or that died, otherwise than by slaughter, after arrival at a factory, would qualify for compensation out of the insurance fund under the Pigs and Bacon Acts. It is now proposed to include this technical amendment of the Acts in permanent legislation.</P>

      <P>In page 3, to add to Section 6 the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> (2)  Every direction under this section shall be by Order and the Order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the Order is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 21 days on which that House has sat after the Order has been laid before it, the Order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under the Order.</P>
    <P>At the Committee Stage, Deputy M. E. Dockrell moved an amendment to delete paragraph (b) of sub-section (5) (2).  His reasons for moving the amendment may, I think, be summarised by saying that if the Irish Red Cross Society is permitted to operate an ambulance service for hire as Section 5 (2) (b) of the Bill would allow, it would very adversely affect, if not indeed ruin, a private ambulance company which has given an ample and satisfactory 24-hour service for over 20 years.  He considered that it would be very wrong to allow a State-subsidised body to interfere with a private enterprise in that way.  The amendment was withdrawn on my undertaking to re-examine the matter with a view to seeing whether I would be able to ensure that the Irish Red Cross Society will not enter into unfair competition with private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed with the case made by Deputy Dockrell.  I am grateful to him for raising the matter in the specific way in which he did and I sympathise very much with the views which he expressed on behalf of the private ambulance company in question.  At the same time I would like to re-state the position from the point of view of the Irish Red Cross Society.  On the Second Stage, I dealt fully with the reasons why it was proposed to allow the society to operate an ambulance service and to make charges for such service.  As I mentioned at the Committee Stage, the only reason why the society is unable to operate such a service at present is because of a High Court interpretation of a law of the Oireachtas.  Any other society such as the St. John <Col N="516" /> Ambulance Brigade or the Knights of Malta is quite free to run such a service, and it can be argued that it is unjust to maintain such a discrimination against the Irish Red Cross Society only.</P>
    <P>In favour of permitting the society to operate such a service I would also like to say that it is not, and indeed it never has been, the aim of the Irish Red Cross Society to run ambulances on a profit-making basis.  This was exemplified when in the course of the High Court proceedings in 1945, it was pointed out that in the period of about four years ended on the 30th April, 1945, the society received £5,500 for hiring charges but expended £8,100 in respect of the running, maintenance, etc., of the ambulances.</P>
    <P>Manned as it is by purely voluntary workers the society's ambulance service could not be anything in the nature of a full-time service.  It has only a total of 18 ambulances, four of which are located in Dublin.  The society considers that it cannot, therefore, ever become a serious threat to any commercial firm operating a full-time service.</P>
    <P>I have now fully reconsidered this whole question.  Indeed, I may say that I considered it to be of such importance that I submitted it to the Government for their decision.  It has been decided to retain Section 5 of the Bill as it stands at present but to issue directions under Section 6 to prevent the society entering into competition with private enterprise.  It is intended that those directions will be on the following lines:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The society shall not ply for hire of its ambulances.  It shall not by advertisement, circular, or in any other way offer the services of its ambulances on hire.  Ambulances will be used on hire only on request and then subject to the following conditions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Generally speaking those responsible for authorising the use of the society's ambulances will permit an ambulance to be used for hire only where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  they are satisfied that efforts have been made on the <Col N="517" /> patient's behalf to obtain a commercial ambulance but have been unsuccessful, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the patient's medical adviser certifies that the patient's condition is so dangerous that he cannot wait until a commercial ambulance arrives.</P>
    <P>(2)  A Red Cross ambulance may, however, without question be sent, on request, to convey victims of accidents to hospital.</P>
    <P>(3)  If any charge is made for the use of an ambulance in the circumstances already mentioned, it shall not be lower than the comparable rate for commercial ambulances.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where the attendance of the society's ambulances is requested by the promoters of sports fixtures, race meetings, etc., to stand by in case of accident they may be permitted to do so and any gift or donation proffered by the promoters of such events in consideration of such attendance may be accepted by the society.</P>
    <P>(5)  Nothing in these directions shall be construed as preventing the society from using its ambulances free of charge where it considers that the humanitarian principles which govern all of its activities demand such action.</P>
    <P>As an added safeguard so far as this House is concerned it is proposed that any directions under Section 6 will be by way of an Order which must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and be capable of annulment by resolution within 21 days.  The amendment which I have now moved provides accordingly.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for the way he has interpreted the wishes which I expressed on the last occasion and I think that this amendment should meet the desires of those who are interested in seeing that private enterprise is not interfered with and at the same time seeing that the humanitarian work which the Irish Red Cross does&mdash;or indeed any other society of <Col N="518" /> like nature&mdash;is not interfered with or hampered.  I think the Minister's amendment meets the situation very well indeed and I am quite content to leave the carrying-out of this in his hands and in the hands of any subsequent Ministers who will be called on to decide as between a firm and any of the voluntary societies.</P>

      <P>That the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1954, made by the Minister for Education, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, be confirmed.</P>
      <P>This is a scheme the details of which have been agreed to as a result of conversations under the conciliation and arbitration scheme which is in existence for secondary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first pension scheme for secondary teachers was introduced in 1929.  This scheme provided for the payment of a pension on retirement at age of 60 years, or earlier through disability, to secondary teachers who paid a fixed contribution of 4 per cent. of annual salary to the pension fund.  No retirement gratuities of any kind were payable, though a person leaving the scheme before becoming eligible for a pension could obtain a refund of his contributions and where a teacher died while in membership his next-of-kin became entitled to a death gratuity consisting of a refund of contributions with the addition of 3 per cent. compound interest.  The scheme continued to be operated with minor amendments, but without any drastic revision until 1951, when an amendment scheme was introduced providing for the payment of retirement and disablement gratuities and for the payment of a marriage gratuity to women teachers retiring on marriage.  In view of the additional <Col N="519" /> benefits provided, the contribution paid by the teachers was increased to 5 per cent. of annual salary.  The amendment scheme introduced in 1952 ironed out certain kinks in the 1951 scheme.</P>
    <P>The present scheme is brought before you to give effect to certain agreements reached with the teachers under the conciliation machinery at present in operation and to give effect to a decision of the former Government made in August, 1952, to make a grant, <i>ex gratia,</i> to teachers, both national and secondary, who were on pension on the 1st January, 1950.  The required amendment to the national teachers' superannuation schemes has already received the approval of the Oireachtas, and I am now seeking to put the decision into effect in relation to secondary teachers.  In regard to the <i>ex gratia</i> grant, it was provided that it be paid in three annual instalments.  The first instalment was paid to secondary teachers in November last but, as such a long time has elapsed since the decision was taken, I propose to pay the remaining instalments in one lump.</P>
    <P>Apart from the <i>ex gratia</i> grant the scheme now offered makes provision as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  That the pensionable salary of certain members who retire or die after 12th March, 1952, shall be the salary enjoyed on the date of retirement or death.</P>
    <P>2.  Where a person with a pension under the secondary schemes enters other pensionable services in which credit is allowed for secondary service, his pension under the secondary schemes shall cease.</P>
    <P>3.  That a person who has received a lump sum or an <i>ex gratia</i> grant or other gratuity under the primary superannuation schemes shall not be entitled to receive credit for his primary service again for purposes of benefits under the secondary superannuation schemes.  (This provision secures that a person will not be in receipt of pension rights or gratuities under two different schemes for one particular period of service.)</P>
    <P>4.  Authority for deeming service <Col N="520" /> in the Defence Forces during the emergency to be approved teaching service and pensionable service.</P>
    <P>It contains a relaxation of certain conditions of payment of marriage gratuities to women members, and, in the case of a member who was hitherto not entitled to pensionable credit for pre-1929 service, he may now receive credit at the rate of one-hundredth of pensionable salary for each completed year of such service.  The scheme also contains some minor provisions with retrospective effect to meet cases of hardship.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Minister will agree to the insertion of these words.  I take it that, when the commissioners notify the owner of a certain piece of property, he should not be allowed to make any alterations or to undertake any excavations, without supervision by the Board of Works.  It is quite possible that damage might be done to the structure by irresponsible persons. I wish to put no undue curb on his activities in protecting his own interests, but if these national monuments are considered of sufficient importance to be taken over by the Board of Works, every precaution should be taken, from the moment they are taken over or notice is served, to preserve the structure properly.  I do not see any particular reason why the Board of Works should not take cognisance of any action that may be taken by way of alteration or excavation by the owner.  I think it is quite a reasonable amendment.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking on this motion last week, I indicated the objections which I saw to the motion, if put into effect.  I indicated to Deputy Sheldon that I believed his presentation of the motion was based, perhaps, in the main, on what was done in another place.  I suggested then to the House that one of the main reasons for that Estimates Committee was, in my view, that the Estimates were not as a whole discussed in full on the floor of the House as they are discussed in this House, and that I thought it would be highly undesirable for this House to adopt any step which might lead, as a logical conclusion, at a later time to a curtailment of the discussion on the Estimates.  I referred then&mdash; I did not know whether correctly or not when Deputy Sheldon challenged me&mdash; to the fact that the Estimates there were not discussed in committee.  As a matter of fact, I have since then taken the figures.  In 1952, out of 199 Estimates there presented, only 62 were discussed in the House; 137 were voted without discussion.  In 1953, only 64 out of 191 were discussed.  In 1954 only 63 out of 191 were discussed and 128 were voted without any discussion, so I think Deputy Sheldon will have to admit that what I stated then was a fact, that it is their practice there not to discuss the Estimates in full as is our practice here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this year, there were special considerations in the circumstances of the change of Government and the general election. I have no doubt whatever that <Col N="525" /> Deputy Sheldon, when he is replying, will suggest that the two things do not follow logically.  I want to put it very strongly to the House that they do, that if we were not to discuss our Estimates in detail here, then there would be a case for discussing them somewhere else.  I would prefer the system by virtue of which they are discussed in detail on the floor of this House.</P>
      <P>I want to pass from that and to indicate again, as I indicated the other night, that this Estimates Committee has got to work in one of three ways &mdash;either before the Estimates come on, before the money is spent or after the money is spent.  If it is going to operate in the first way, and if that is the intention, then I think it will put an additional clog in the machinery of the various Departments.  I think the position is quite sufficiently safeguarded in that respect already by the arrangement that exists by virtue of which the Estimates are submitted to the Department of Finance and the subsequent spending by the spending Department is submitted to the Department of Finance for sanction by it. If, on the other hand, the Estimates Committee is going to investigate after the money is spent, I think it will not do the job as well as the Committee of Public Accounts.  In fact, it will rather detract from the very great value of that committee which the committee derives primarily from its all-Party complexion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts has done a great deal of valuable work here over the years and I think on all sides of the House we would regret that anything would be done that would in any way impair its usefulness. It is an objection, as the Deputy has suggested, that it does not do its work until a very long time after expenditure has taken place, but that is a state of affairs in regard to which something might be done.  It is a matter in regard to which my mind would be far more open.  I think that the effect of the appointment of such a committee would be, in the one case, that it would merely follow the Party line in the Dáil or, alternatively, that it would do the job in the same way as <Col N="526" /> the Public Accounts Committee would do it, but not nearly so well.  After all, if that discussion at an Estimates Committee takes place before the money is spent, one must remember that the Estimates are put forward by the Minister concerned, he having justified them to himself, justified them to the Department of Finance, and, therefore, put them forward as part of Government policy.  Clearly, therefore, the Government of the day will be concerned with these Estimates as they have been framed.  In fact, as I have ascertained from various inquiries I have made, that does arise to a very large extent in the House of Commons, on whose procedure the Deputy asks us to base the proposal that he puts forward here.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether he intends that the members of the Estimates Committee should have available to them any substantial skilled staff or not.  If he does, it will probably mean that far from there being an economy, there would be far more expenditure on the Civil Service.  If he does not, I think he will find very quickly that the committee will be without a steering guidance.  In fact one of the things on which the Public Accounts Committee turns as a pivot, for example, is that there is the Comptroller and Auditor-General there who submits a report and on whose report the Public Accounts Committee in fact cogitates.</P>
    <P>I hesitate to put it forward as an argument against the committee, because I think some people might be delighted that such would happen but there might be very well the suggestion that the existence of an Estimates Committee would, in fact, detract from the power of the Department of Finance.  People might feel that when the Estimates Committee was there, it was not necessary to retain the existing powers in this House.  If that were so, I should resent any such suggestion which is an argument against the committee, one frankly which I hesitate to use because I think many Deputies feel rather differently on that score than I or any occupant of this office would feel at the present moment.  As far as I can understand Deputy Sheldon, he was making his <Col N="527" /> case around parliamentary control.  I think that this is not the right way to get parliamentary control.  The way to get parliamentary control is to have the Estimates and the policy enshrined in those Estimates considered by this House as a whole and to have the check of the Comptroller and Auditor-General that we have now, in so far as he verifies the issues from the Central Fund, and in the manner in which all revenue must flow into the one fund and must issue from it in accordance with the Estimates as passed by this House, plus the Public Accounts Committee to consider such irregularities as the Comptroller and Auditor-General may find.</P>
    <P>I think that has been not merely the experience here but also the experience in the other place on which the Deputy would wish us to model this committee.  It certainly was the experience of no less a person than Sir Frank Tribe, the present Comptroller and Auditor-General, when he gave his advice on the subject not so long ago.  I do not think there is any better method of parliamentary control than that the Estimates should be discussed here, that there should be a person set above the Government, as is the Comptroller and Auditor-General, whose duty it is to see that the directions of this House are carried out, and whose salary is paid out of the Central Fund for the specific purpose of making him independent as judges are independent; and, over and above all that, an all-Party committee, in which Parties as such do not play any part, on public accounts.  I think that is a much more efficacious system of parliamentary control and one which is much more likely to give parliamentary control greater reality. I am afraid that, far from increasing parliamentary control, this committee would have the reverse effect and would provide the basis for the suggestion in future that it was not necessary to discuss the Estimates on the floor of this House because, since they were discussed in the Estimates Committee, that was all that was necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> I must confess also, that I got the impression, perhaps it was not the impression Deputy Sheldon wished to convey, reading over his speech advocating the motion the other night that one of the reasons prompting him was that Deputies might under this suggested committee get a look at the &ldquo;insides,&rdquo; so to speak, of governmental working.  I do not think it is necessary that such a committee should be established for that purpose; neither do I think that it is desirable that such a committee should be set up for that purpose.  To advocate such a committee for that reason, if I am not misinterpreting the Deputy, would be tantamount to suggesting another cog in the existing machinery.  Candidly, I was expecting that the Deputy would make his case purely on the grounds of economy, and I was disappointed that he did not do so because I would have liked to have underlined any remarks he might make about economy.</P>
    <P>In the field of economy, we must take any step that appears to us likely to produce results.  Large scale economies are only obtainable as a matter of policy.  But, even apart from policy, there are fields in which such economies might be desirable.  As I said the other night, I admit quite frankly that after five months on this side of the curtain I am not yet prepared to make up my mind as to the best method of obtaining administrative economies in the public service as apart from economies in relation to policy.  I think a case could be made along certain lines more in the direction of greater freedom than towards imposing more clogs or controls.  This is a matter that requires very, very careful consideration indeed.  It is a matter which, when I have finished my own consideration of it, I propose to discuss with others.  It is clearly a matter in which the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor - General should be sought.  Indeed, I think it is a matter in which the advice of the Committee on Public Accounts should be sought should there be any suggested change in administrative procedure.  But I think it will be along those lines that we will secure the greatest improvements and administrative <Col N="529" /> economies and not along the lines of an Estimates Committee.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I differ from the Deputy when he sneers at the operation of what is known as O. &amp; M. or outside consultants.  I think both outside consultants and O. &amp; M. each has its own place in the reorganisation of the administrative machine.  I think that each in its own sphere has already produced some improvement in a comparatively short time.  Outside consultants are perhaps more likely to produce results where the business being done is somewhat akin to commercial business.  The O. &amp; M. section of the Department of Finance, or of any Department, is more likely to produce results where it is purely a matter of Civil Service machinery as apart from some of the more technical tasks which have from time to time to be undertaken by the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>As I say, my mind on that subject is still very open indeed.  I will require considerably longer experience on this side of the curtain before I make up my mind fully in that respect. Until I do make up my mind in that respect I must accept a suggestion which I thought when I was over there, and think even more so now that I am over here, would not produce economies but would rather produce more rambling inquiries and might very easily ultimately prove the basis in future of taking something away from the detailed discussion of the Estimates on the floor of this House that we have hitherto enjoyed and, in that way, provide a reason for the taking away from Deputies of privileges which they have at present, even though that may not be the aim of the mover of this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the Minister for Finance, representing the Executive, and having regard to his serious responsibilities, should be particularly interested in this matter and should view it to a considerable extent from the angle of enabling him to have his responsibilities and those of the Government carried out satisfactorily and in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understandable, having regard to the delays which occur in securing <Col N="530" /> decisions, for which the Department of Finance and the Minister are generally blamed, that a good deal of the Minister's remarks should deal with the question of clogging the machinery further and tending to hold up necessary decisions.  It seems to me that there is another perhaps even more fundamental and essential point of view, that is, that it is the Dáil which is the body which controls expenditure. If the Dáil in its wisdom thinks fit to adopt the suggestion of Deputy Sheldon or any other procedure which would seem to the Dáil to help to review the Estimates, as he says, to bring those of us who have no administrative experience into closer touch with the work of the Departments, to enable us if we are sufficiently conscientious and wish to apply ourselves to the work, as Deputy Sheldon has done for so many years on the Public Accounts Committee, it should lead to good results.  If we had the ordinary common-sense view of how things ought to be done in order that the most efficient and economic results may be obtained and the best value received for the taxpayers' money, I cannot see why the adoption of Deputy Sheldon's suggestion should not lead to good results.  I can see that there are arguments against it.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House, when in office, while seeing the difficulties, in particular that the Department of Finance might feel that they were being crabbed and that the time of officials would be unnecessarily taken up if they had to come before such a committee, nevertheless, felt that we could accept in principle the Deputy's proposal.  The former Minister for Finance, with slight amendments, put the proposal before this House, substantially the same as it now appears over Deputy Sheldon's name on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>While we must all agree that it is in the Dáil that the final decision must be taken with regard to expenditure, and that nothing should be done to curb or limit the freest and fullest discussion on matters of expenditure, there is a good deal of substance in Deputy Sheldon's argument that the tendency in the Dáil is that larger <Col N="531" /> questions of policy occupy the time allotted to discussions on Estimates.</P>
    <P>My experience would incline me to agree with Deputy Sheldon that, apart from the position that arises when the Government brings in proposals and the Opposition criticises them in the ordinary political fashion, the larger questions of policy are the main subject of discussion on the Estimates.  As the Deputy pointed out in his opening speech, the administration of the Department in the preceding year&mdash; something from which we can learn lessons but which, nevertheless, is finished and done with&mdash;is what mainly occupies the Dáil in the discussions on the Estimates.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Sheldon's committee, if the Minister and the Government saw fit to adopt it, need be the last word, but private members of the Dáil would feel, as he has emphasised, that they had an opportunity of getting into closer touch with the actual work of Departments and of learning the difficulties that Ministers and Governments have.  They would also appreciate the difficulty of even strong Governments with determined Ministers in making changes where there are vested interests and where bureaucratic machinery has been set up and very large schemes have been put into operation.</P>
    <P>While the committee suggested by the Deputy might not give all the results he hopes for, it would give an opportunity for a body of Deputies to examine the expenditure in a rather more up-to-date way than occurs in the case of the Public Accounts Committee. As Deputy Sheldon has pointed out, that committee only starts work on the Appropriation Accounts long after the financial year in which the expenditures has taken place has concluded. The fact that it may start its work within the succeeding 12 months may be an advantage.  Time was when it was two or three years behind.  Nevertheless, one has the feeling on that committee that the effective decisions have been taken and since the committee is precluded from discussing questions of policy&mdash;which Deputy Sheldon's <Col N="532" /> committee would not attempt to discuss either&mdash;and once the Department of Finance has sanctioned the expenditure the Committee of Public Accounts cannot question that expenditure, it will be seen that the functions of the committee are rather limited.  The fact that it is there and can at any time question any item of expenditure and ask for information and that the Comptroller and Auditor-General is there to assist the chairman, makes it very valuable.</P>
    <P>I think what Deputy Sheldon is looking for is a scheme whereby the work of that committee, instead of being <i>post facto</i>, would be brought in line with current expenditure.  In connection with items such as large schemes which are in operation, like social services, subsidies, and so on, which involve very great expenditure and when once established have to continue&mdash;so long as they are on the statutes the payments have to be made and the policy accepted&mdash;I really believe that it would be of advantage that a body of sensible Deputies should look in, so to speak, on the various Departments. They could not examine perhaps more than one or two branches of the larger Departments in a single session.</P>
    <P>In the neighbouring country, for example, such a committee made a report on the question of forestry.  I read the report.  While many Deputies would have been dissatisfied with it because, as frequently happens, nothing very concrete in the way of a recommendation for better working emerged, a body of members in that particular case who were specially qualified to deal with forestry reviewed the forestry organisation generally and asked questions regarding the felling and removal of timber, and so on.  They went into points that were not trespassing in any way on the general policy but were directed to seeing whether better methods and procedure could not produce the same results at lower cost.</P>
    <P>The latest report of this committee that I have seen deals with the regional organisation of departments. That has not a great interest for us here, but Deputies would be keenly interested in it in view of our discussions <Col N="533" /> about the extent to which the public might be facilitated by decentralisation or regionalisation of some of the work of Government Departments. These are simply examples of the work this committee has carried out in Britain.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister, if he had not been able to accept the proposal of Deputy Sheldon <i>in toto</i>, was not able to offer us an alternative.  When his Party was in opposition, members of the Party frequently put down amendments to the Second Readings of important measures, that the measure should be referred first to a Dáil Committee&mdash;showing that they had no feeling that on matters of important legislation they were in any way taking away from the powers of the Dáil by suggesting that these important measures should be referred to special committees.  At a later stage, when the present Government was in office before, there was some reference&mdash;I have heard nothing about it recently&mdash; to the setting up of a committee on the lines of the Public Accounts Committee to scrutinise the work of the State boards, which, of course, are not as much under Dáil control as the Government Departments which come up for discussion in the Estimates.  The fact that such a proposal was made by the Taoiseach and other important Ministers and that they referred to it on more than one occasion, shows that they felt the Dáil could usefully appoint committees to examine important questions of public expenditure.</P>

      <P>I might preface my remarks by saying that I do not think this motion, if accepted, would serve any useful purpose or enable this House to function any more effectively than it is functioning at the present.  I had the advantage, owing to the fact that Deputy Sheldon's speech was made last week, of being able to read the report of it carefully. He set out, as reported in column 404 of the Debates, the two purposes which he felt it might serve.  He said that it would enable the Dáil &ldquo;to function a bit more expressly than it can under present conditions&rdquo; and, secondly, he <Col N="534" /> said: &ldquo;I believe that at present there is a gap, and a very wide gap, in the Dáil's knowledge and the Dáil's interest.&rdquo; As I have said already, I do not think this proposal would enable the Dáil to function better; and I propose to deal in some detail later on with the suggestion that it might close the gap in the Dáil's knowledge.</P>
      <P>I might start by referring to the Public Accounts Committee, of which Deputy Sheldon has been a well-known member and has been chairman for some time.  In the course of his remarks he referred twice to that committee. In column 404 he said: &ldquo;It has been borne in on me time and time again that something more was needed to ensure economy.&rdquo;  Then the purpose of his motion is to ensure economy, a very laudable objective, in which we can all support him.  At column 410 he said: &ldquo;I think, however, that &lsquo;committee of public expenditure&rsquo; gives a clearer idea of the intention of the committee; that is, to inquire into public expenditure and ensure that for every 20/- spent value is received for every £1 spent and that no more pounds are spent than are absolutely necessary.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with the manner in which it was reported, as I understand the Deputy's idea very well.  What the Deputy has in mind, I take it, is that the Dáil&mdash;as the Dáil is the body to impose taxation&mdash;would try to ensure by some method that we would get full value for every £1 spent.  I have read through the reports of the Public Accounts Committee&mdash;I have looked through them over a long period and I have been acquainted with them to some extent.  I think the committee functioned reasonably well up to the war, that is to say, up to about 1939. In the early years, particularly from the period 1922 onwards, it may have been possible for the committee to do a great deal more work of a constructive nature than has been possible in recent years&mdash;the reason being that civil servants here perhaps did not understand <Col N="535" /> quite so well as they do now our method of controlling public expenditure, which is based on the British method.</P>
      <P>I feel, however, that in recent years little, if anything, has come from the Public Accounts Committee.  I say that with all respect to the Deputy who has proposed this motion and who has been chairman of that committee.  I wonder if it has ever occurred to Deputy Sheldon, while he has been chairman, that in relation to its work, that is, the manner in which the Appropriation Accounts are presented to the committee, there was a possibility of a little economy?</P>

      <P>I did not know it had been suggested this year.  It has often occurred to me that this evidence to the Public Accounts Committee, being based on pre-war values of money, is completely out of date. There have been all kinds of suggestions. I am delighted to hear that Deputy Sheldon, prior to putting down this motion, did get around to that point.</P>
      <P>I would like to make one remark about the Deputy putting down the motion.  The Deputy, during the years 1951 to 1954 when Government expenditure was increased very greatly, in general supported the Government of the day.  I would suggest that as a serious criticism of the Deputy's approach to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will, but I hope that we will have a <Col N="536" /> better record in relation to public expenditure than the preceding Government. I would like to get down to what I think is the centrepiece of the Deputy's point about this motion.  In col. 408 of the Report, the Deputy said: &ldquo;One of the great difficulties of the present moment is the growth of public business.&rdquo;  In the past, before the State started intruding to a very great extent on the business of the community, the particular methods that were applied for the control of public expenditure were suitable for a stately and slow moving progress.  I agree with the Deputy: there is a great deal of new public business which is mainly not the traditional type of business that the State carried out.  It has very little to do with the traditional items of law and order, education, defence, and so forth.  It has a great deal to do with a new approach in public matters&mdash;a new approach of the public mind to what the State should do for the people.  In that connection I think, with all respect to the Deputy&mdash;and it applies to the remarks of Deputy Derrig where he said that the question of the State boards is of importance&mdash;that the question of State boards is of much more importance.  Deputy Derrig suggested that the Government which was in this country from 1948 to 1951, although they made a number of pronouncements about the subject, did nothing whatever about the matter.  Might I refer, in that connection, to the speech made by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, in Seanad Éireann on the 2nd March, 1950?  That speech sets out the difficulties.</P>
      <P>It sets out the serious problem of how you are to control the very large expenditure of State and semi-State companies and boards.  I believe that problem should be attacked first.  That is a much more serious problem than the problem which the Deputy has set out to attempt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  We might be in agreement about it.  However, I should like to refer the Deputy to Deputy McGilligan's remarks on that occasion setting out the difficulties in relation to it.  It is a problem <Col N="537" /> not alone in this country but in other countries also and it has been the subject of a great deal of discussion without any satisfactory solution having yet been found to it.  I am sure that, like all human problems, there is a fairly satisfactory solution.  These semi-State companies and boards, not alone here but elsewhere, have grown rather rapidly to a very great size and it creates a problem which will take some little while to solve but, with respect to this motion, I think it is a problem which should be tackled first.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that this House is unreasonable in the manner in which it controls public expenditure.  On the whole, having regard to the necessary composition of the House, I think the House has a reasonable method of approaching the Estimates Volume each year.  In England, of course, they do it differently.  The Deputy said so in his interruptions during the speech of the Minister for Finance.  With all respect, I am inclined to think the Deputy does not quite understand the full implications of his own motion.  It reminds me a little bit of the fact that, in the last century, there was a feeling, I think in this country, that problems were solved by making a good speech in Parliament.  There was the feeling that you did something against the people whom you were opposing by making a good speech in Parliament.  More recently, I have had the impression that there is among certain people the idea that when you set up a new company or open a new office you solve some problem.  We have now reached the stage where you set up a new committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe the Deputy's new committee will enable Deputies to get that insight into the running of the State to which he referred in his speech.  He said, as reported at column 411 of the Official Report of Wednesday, 3rd November, 1954: &ldquo;One very important point is that it would give Deputies an insight into the running of the State.&rdquo;  Deputy Derrig made a somewhat similar point when&mdash;I hope I do not misquote him&mdash; he said that those of us who have not administrative experience might learn <Col N="538" /> something about the running of the State.  If Deputy Derrig, after 20 years of office, has not administrative experience, I do not know who in this country can acquire it, or how.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation. Perhaps I should have phrased my sentence more accurately.  I meant those members of Dáil Éireann who have not had administrative experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to misquote the Deputy.  I appreciate what he meant.  Might I say, however, that there would be general agreement that it takes from seven to ten years for a trained person, working every day at his desk, to acquire a reasonable knowledge of the methods of controlling expenditure?  I cannot understand, then, how Deputy Sheldon could hope that a committee of this House&mdash; no matter how it might sit or how keen the members might be in their application to their duty&mdash;could control expenditure and could get an insight as to how the State machine works.  In that connection, I should like to refer to something that has already been referred to this evening, that is, the firms of consultants who, I am glad to say, were brought into certain of the Government's Departments to have a look at their methods.  It was found, on the whole, I think&mdash;I emphasise the words &ldquo;I think&rdquo;&mdash;that they made valuable suggestions about how routine work might be organised, but they did not seem to appreciate the nature of the work of the higher civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say that, on the whole, I think the State here has been too inclined to set up new bodies, new authorities, new companies and new committees?  Having been, perhaps, so critical of the Deputy's motion, I should not like to end without making a constructive comment.  It is very undesirable that anybody should criticise a motion exclusively in a destructive way.  I think there is a problem and that what is really involved in that problem is a change in the approach to the work of the State.  Now that the State has got such an enormously <Col N="539" /> greater volume of work of a business nature to do, let us see whether it would not be possible to adopt, to a greater extent, business methods.  In that connection I think a beginning was made when the Organisation and Methods Office was established in the Department of Finance.  I think some or some particular part of a machine like that might provide a solution to this problem.  I do not think a committee of the sort the Deputy has suggested will, in addition to the Public Accounts Committee&mdash;for the reasons which were given by the Minister for Finance that the people who have already prepared the Estimates are committed to them and, in that connection, I have noticed that it applies to local authorities as well as to the Central Government&mdash;find favour with the various people who are connected with the work and unless such a committee of this House, which necessarily has not expert knowledge, can get cooperation I do not think it would get very far.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the wording of the Estimates Volume.  On the whole, I am inclined to think the most difficult Estimate in the Estimates Volume from that point of view is the Estimate for the Department of Lands. There are references there to Land Acts and most complicated matters. Any person who asked the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Lands for a copy of the blue note on the Department of Lands would be given it, I am quite certain, by him and that would explain the nature of these apparently difficult matters.  In the main you have the halving of the annuities, you have the contribution to the costs fund, you have the contribution to the price under the 1923 Act and you have improvement of estates.  That, I think, covers the most difficult of all the Estimates. Other Estimates are quite straightforward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bulk of the Estimate for primary education consists of the salaries of national teachers and there is nothing difficult about it.  It is certainly a matter of policy as to whether the salaries of national teachers shall be one thing or another.  On the whole, <Col N="540" /> although one is disappointed at times by the nature of the discussion in this House, that is to say, that it should at times be exclusively a political discussion, I cannot see how any committee of this kind could provide for better control of Government expenditure, and for that reason I am opposed to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this motion principally because I see in it a danger which the Minister for Finance thought might exist.  It is a motion which I would have thought that any Party in opposition would treat with extreme caution because, while accepting fully, and I do accept fully, Deputy Sheldon's motives in proposing this motion, if such a committee were set up the logical outcome must be that ordinary Deputies in this House would have their opportunities for free and full discussion on the Estimates seriously curbed.</P>
      <P>I want to put this problem to Deputy Sheldon.  If that is not the result, what purpose is going to be achieved by the setting up of a committee such as is suggested by him? I take it if this committee were set up it would be the desire of the House, of Deputy Sheldon and of every other Deputy participating in the setting up of such a committee, to see to it that the Estimates were submitted in the first place to that committee for exhaustive inquiry and that the committee should settle down seriously to its work and make recommendations. Deputy Sheldon appears to be shaking his head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly am.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me call his attention to the terms of his motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be appointed, as soon as may be after the commencement of every Session, a Select Committee, to be called &lsquo;The Committee of Public Expenditure&rsquo;, to examine such of the Estimates presented to the Dáil in accordance with Standing Order No. 117 as may seem fit to the committee and to report what, if any, economies consistent with the policy implied in those Estimates may be effected therein.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> What is the position?  The Estimates must be prepared.  I have put it to Deputy Sheldon that my reading of this motion would be that once the Estimates are prepared, published and possibly formally presented to the Dáil, the next move would be to refer one or more of them to this committee.  That is what the motion implies, I think.  In fact, I believe it goes much further than a mere implication.  That is the demand inherent in this motion.  If it is not, then what is the alteration which Deputy Sheldon is proposing? If it is not proposed to submit the Estimates to this committee for examination, then the position is that the Dáil will discuss the Estimates first, presumably in as detailed and as exhaustive a manner as they have discussed them heretofore, will come to a decision on each individual Estimate and will by a vote of the House or by agreement in the House authorise the Minister to proceed on foot of the Estimate which has been introduced.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Sheldon will reconsider the first portion of his motion, he will see that it will have no validity or effect at all if the method which is followed at the moment is to be carried out, if there is a discussion here and a decision taken on the Estimates.  It is because of that that I assume that Deputy Sheldon's idea was that before there could be a discussion in the House the Estimates should be considered by this committee.  If the second position obtains then I think there would be a very real danger and a very immediate danger that discussion in this House would be by-passed and that the right of Deputies, particularly Deputies in opposition, to discuss the Estimates in detail, to say practically whatever they want to say with regard to particular Departments on the Estimates, would certainly be curbed and cramped.  If that does not happen, the committee that is suggested by Deputy Sheldon would seem to me, if it were set up, to have no function whatever to perform.</P>
    <P>I freely admit to Deputy Sheldon that by reason of his occupancy of the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee&mdash;for <Col N="542" /> nearly a dozen years, I think it is now&mdash;he is possibly in a better position than I am to adduce definite arguments for or against the motion which he has set down here.  But let us consider the possible workings of a committee such as this.  Deputy Sheldon stipulates as one of the essentials for the working of this committee that no member of the Government and no Parliamentary Secretary should be a member of it.  Bear in mind that the first portion of the motion sets it as a duty of the committee to recommend economies consistent with policy implied in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>I think all of us here know that people can very often be mistaken about implications.  Since I sat in here this evening Deputy Sheldon has corrected more than one speaker because of wrong implications which they have taken from words of his.  Deputy Derrig corrected the last speaker on the same grounds.  But Deputy Sheldon's committee is to exist in an atmosphere of implication.  It is this committee, without the assistance of any member of the Government and without the assistance of any Parliamentary Secretary, that is to determine what is the policy implied in a particular Estimate.  That may not be very easy.  If the committee reach the correct conclusions with regard to policy they are then, if they are doing their duty seriously, going to recommend economies consistent with the policy which they find implied in the Estimates. If their implications are wrong then, I take it, it will be agreed by Deputy Sheldon&mdash;and if this committee were in operation it would subsequently be agreed by the House&mdash;that their decisions or recommendations will have no validity.  All that a Minister in charge of a Department needs to do in order to say that such and such a recommendation of this committee cannot be accepted is to say the implication drawn by the committee with regard to the policy of his Department was incorrect.  Assuming it is found by the committee, if it were to be established, that a particular Department by the framing of its Estimates is endeavouring to establish an order of priority with regard to particular expenditure, what is going to be the <Col N="543" /> reaction of the committee?  It is the Government that will decide on the order of priority.  The committee in its desire for economy may decide this scheme or that scheme could not and should not be deferred.  You cannot say that that is inconsistent with the policy implied in the Estimate.  Nevertheless, the committee will have to function without the assistance of a member of the Government and without the assistance of a Parliamentary Secretary to explain what is the Government's attitude with regard to priorities in expenditure.</P>
    <P>I would say this to Deputy Sheldon. If there is any value in the establishment of a committee of this sort&mdash;it may very well be that there would be&mdash; whatever value there is in it would to my mind be very greatly diminished by precluding members of the Government or Parliamentary Secretaries from being members of it.  To my mind the proper approach, assuming that a committee of this sort were to be established, would be to insist that at least the Minister for Finance or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, for instance, would <i>ex officio</i> be members of the committee and would be charged with the duty before the committee of explaining Government policy in relation to each particular Estimate.  I think the better way would be that on the consideration of whatever Estimates are before the committee you would have the particular Minister or Parliamentary Secretary concerned to explain Government policy and any order of priority or anything of that sort which might possibly exist.</P>
    <P>As I said when I started, my principal reason for opposing this motion is that I believe it would necessarily interfere with the rights of Deputies.  I am surprised that Deputy Derrig, speaking for the Opposition Party, should give this motion his blessing because, undoubtedly, if this committee were set up the people who would principally suffer and who would be restricted in their approach to discussions in this House would be Deputies on the Opposition Benches.  Deputy Derrig agreed that nothing should be done to <Col N="544" /> curb full and free discussion in the Dáil.  I do not know whether Deputy Derrig will agree with me in this.  I think it is the logical outcome of the establishment of a committee of this sort to restrict discussion in the Dáil. Either that or you will have a hearing before the committee and a re-hearing of everything that went on before the committee when you come into the Dáil to discuss Estimates.  If you are going to have a rehash of all that went on before a committee such as this, then Deputy Derrig will probably agree with me that the necessity for such a committee is not apparent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig saw certain merits in the motion.  I was surprised, since he had apparently decided to support the motion, at the nature of the argument he used in support of it.  He said he saw value in this motion&mdash;I hope he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;because committees of this sort could question expenditure and ask for information. Deputy Derrig has been in this House very much longer than I have been in it but I know&mdash;I think every Deputy here knows&mdash;that in the discussion of any Estimate in the House every single member who talks and everyone who contributes to the discussion may, if he wishes, question the general expenditure proposed in the Estimate or question particular items of expenditure referred to in the Estimate.  In addition to that, every person who contributes to a discussion on an Estimate is entitled to ask the Minister for information.  He need not wait until the discussion on the Estimate to do that.  He can put down a question for any meeting of the Dáil to elicit any information he wants to get.  Yet, Deputy Derrig sees value in this motion because a committee of this sort would enable the members of the committee to question expenditure and ask for information.</P>
    <P>I do not see that those arguments of themselves are sufficient to justify support for a motion of this sort. Deputy Sheldon seems to be in some doubt as to precisely what value the committee would be.  He has, I think, secured agreement from most people who have spoken in so far as he has in mind the possibility that a committee of this sort would assist in finding <Col N="545" /> economies but, as the last speaker pointed out, Deputy Sheldon, when he spoke on this motion, did not advance that as the main argument in favour of the motion.</P>
    <P>He advanced as his main argument in favour of the motion that a committee of this sort would ensure that for every £ spent 20/- worth of value would be given.  I do not think that a committee such as is suggested now, if it is going to operate at all, if it is going to examine Estimates at the Estimates stage, is a committee which can determine that for every £ spent 20/-worth of value will be given.  It would seem to me&mdash;I talk, of course, subject to correction in this because I have not any experience of it&mdash;that a committee in the nature of the Public Accounts Committee would discharge that function with greater precision than a committee sitting before the expense has been authorised by this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheldon also advanced as an argument in favour of this committee that it would help Deputies to get an insight into the working of Government Departments.  It might do that but I think that most Deputies who discharge their ordinary work on behalf of constituents as Deputies get a very clear insight into the working of Government Departments.  In addition to that, each Minister comes along annually and renders an account of the working of his Department when he is presenting the Estimates.</P>
    <P>I do not feel that that argument of Deputy Sheldon's is sufficient to warrant support for this motion.  I do not believe that anything that has been said either by Deputy Sheldon or Deputy Derrig in any way minimises the danger to which the Minister for Finance has adverted&mdash;the danger that if a committee of this sort were established, eventually the rights of Deputies to discuss Estimates fully in this House might be interfered with.</P>

      <P>Before I begin replying to the debate, I would like to draw the attention of the House to a mistake in the Official Report at column 407.  I am afraid I feel rather bitter about it because of the particular mistake made.  I am quoted as saying that &ldquo;there is, for instance, the difficulty in discussing <Col N="546" /> the accounts on the Estimate of any Department&mdash;the fact that the Committee on Finance dealing with it is limited to the affairs of that particular Department, in other words, what is called <i>virement</i>&rdquo;.  What I, of course, said was, &ldquo;a vertical inquiry&rdquo;.  If I had been reported as saying any other word beginning with a &ldquo;v&rdquo; I would not mind so much, but as Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts I take a very poor view of the word being used in such a context.  Any member of the House who has been on the Public Accounts Committee will appreciate in full my feelings on this subject.  May I go further and say that I do not see any point in putting an English word in italics?  However, because it has appeared in print, I wanted to begin by drawing attention to it in case any Deputy might be under a misapprehension.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Virement&rdquo; was a most unhappy choice.  I must confess that I have no misapprehension at all as to how much blame lies at my own door for the course of this debate.  As Deputies will appreciate, this motion came up at a rather unexpected hour and I must confess that my notes on the subject were not to hand, and I had to speak under that difficulty.  I have only one consolation and that is that the Minister's case against the motion was very much worse than my case for the motion.  Almost everything he said rested on a very obvious misconception of the facts.  As far as Deputy O'Higgins is concerned, may I say that I think his trouble is that he could not see the wood for the trees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the Minister's statement was either trees or wood.  The Minister rested his case very largely on the failure of the Estimates Committee in the British Parliament and he instanced the fact that it had failed up to 1946&mdash;actually from 1939 to 1946, it was not an Estimates <Col N="547" /> Committee but was supplanted by a Committee on National Expenditure.  I did not touch on this in opening this particular motion because I had referred to it at length on previous occasions.  The plain fact is that the British practice is founded very much at present on experience of the Committee on National Expenditure.  The Minister is quite right in saying that certainly an Estimates Committee that concerns itself with discussion on Estimates in place of discussions in Parliament is a useless committee.  That is exactly what the British discovered. Up to 1939 the British Estimates Committee went on the lines the Minister suggested; now, because of the experience over the war years with the Committee on National Expenditure, there is a different approach and since 1946 the British Estimates Committee has used the different approach.  It does not consider those Estimates which the House of Commons leaves to one side.  The Minister suggested that he has information that I have not got. He may have, and if so I should be glad to know what it is.  May I mention some of the particular inquiries which the British Estimates Committee made in the last couple of years?  They have brought in 21 reports.  Of those reports, only one could in any way be construed on the face of its title alone as being in replacement of a debate by the British House of Commons and that is the one which deals with the Post Office.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Agricultural research&rdquo;, &ldquo;regional organisation of Government Departments&rdquo;, &ldquo;Grants-in-Aid&rdquo;&mdash;the whole point of the British Estimates Committee is that it <Col N="548" /> makes the type of inquiry that the British House of Commons cannot make and which the Dáil cannot make. That is, as I said already, a horizontal inquiry covering several Departments.</P>
      <P>I went out of my way, I thought, to stress in my not too clear&mdash;I admit&mdash; opening remarks that my chief reason for changing the title back to the original Committee on Public Expenditure rather than Estimates was to try to avoid more discussion on the Estimates.  Any argument raised against it on the basis that a committee of the Dáil is going to steal away the prerogatives of the Dáil and the members thereof is the greatest nonsense. No committee of this House is going to do that: it could not possibly happen and any argument based on that is a complete fallacy.  The House could react very quickly indeed if any such thing happened.  The Minister might have found a fairly good case, if I may say so, in what was hinted by the Parliamentary Secretary, I think, on the question of ministerial responsibility. On that, I may say, I fully agree with the Minister that by far the greater part of the increases and decreases in public expenditure are due to policy decisions.  But granting that, with an expenditure of £108,000,000, even the bit that is left outside policy decisions is surely worth inquiring into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stressed over and over again that what I want is a parliamentary inquiry into the efficiency of the Civil Service.  The Parliamentary Secretary was rather good on that.  He pointed out that it took from seven to ten years to become fully versed in the appreciation of public expenditure or to know very much about it.  This House is elected to make the laws for this country, and so far no one has suggested that everyone ought to study or be called to the Bar before he is competent to make the laws of the country, but the Parliamentary Secretary considers that none of us elected Deputies knows anything about business or efficiency unless we have studied from seven to ten years.  Some people might think that he had a case, but it is not a parliamentary case.  If we are competent to make laws we are <Col N="549" /> competent surely to inquire into the efficiency of Government Departments.</P>
    <P>I find myself somewhat embarrassed in attempting to argue against a case which rests so much on a misconception of the facts.  The Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and, I think, Deputy O'Higgins, inquired as to what stage in the preparation of Estimates this committee would begin its work &mdash;before, during or after; but as I have tried to point out, there is no question of its interfering in that way with Estimates.  There is no question of before, during or after, except that &ldquo;during&rdquo; might be the operative word.  Over and over again I have tried to point out that the purpose of an Estimates Committee is not to interfere with specific items in an Estimate as presented.  I mentioned that the preparation of Estimates is a continuous process, and that what I want to see is a parliamentary inquiry and parliamentary control over the efficiency of the Civil Service, if you like, in the preparation of the Estimates.</P>
    <P>As to Deputy O'Higgins's suggestion, that members of the Government or Parliamentary Secretaries ought to be on the committee, the only purpose of that is to prevent any question of policy arising in the committee.  I will say this&mdash;it was, I think, mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;that it would be one essential that such a committee would work in harmony with the State Departments.  It will also be an essential that it should work in harmony with the Government.  A committee which attempted to interfere with policy, decisions would stultify itself.  It just could not get anywhere. A committee which fell foul of Government Departments to the point that a bitter row would result, would stultify itself.  Co-operation would be essential. in both cases.  I do not see why that co-operation could not be found.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that debates in this House deal with details of Estimates is possibly true, if one thinks only of the details as presented in the Book of Estimates; but no debate can deal with detail in the sense in which I mean detail.  This detail is, for instance, presented to the Public Accounts Committee, and that committee <Col N="550" /> has before it witnesses from the Departments.  By tradition&mdash;I do not know whether the tradition could be upset, although the committee certainly has power to upset it if they with&mdash;the usual witness is the accounting officer, but there is nothing to stop the committee asking for other witnesses if they wish.  That, in itself, means that the members of the committee can, by question and answer, backwards and forwards thresh the matter out.</P>
    <P>That is not possible in this House on Estimates.  For one thing, the Civil Service have not got a voice in this House, and even if one could assume that a Minister would know exactly every detail of his Department, which I think is asking a great deal indeed of any human being, it would not be possible to run a debate on an Estimate here on the basis of everyone in the House firing questions at the Minister, and tripping him up in his replies, and querying him further and further, nor could documents be put in question.  If we are to assume that everything is for the best in this best of all possible Civil Services, well and good.  I am not suggesting that it is not; I am suggesting that we do not know whether it is or not.</P>
    <P>Various speakers took quotations from what I said to show that what I was really looking for was economy, and then there was the contradiction that I was not looking for economy but for something else.  I will admit this: economy is one of the things which is desirable, and which a committee of this type should inquire after, but I must confess that I am personally more concerned with the aspect of parliamentary control.  I mentioned in my opening speech the growth of public business, and the Parliamentary Secretary I think, rather misunderstood me in that regard.  He went off on the subject of semi-State bodies, and how much more important they were, because they were under less control.</P>
    <P>That is very true, but the State now enters into the life of the ordinary man in the street from so many angles, and it is such a complex matter that any detail is, I think, impossible in this House, and a committee sitting with <Col N="551" /> expert witnesses before it from the Departments, could be very reassuring to the ordinary man in the street, that his representatives had some control over what is affecting his life.  Naturally the committee could not interfere in policy&mdash;I have already dealt with that &mdash;but it is of very great interest to the man in the street as a taxpayer to know &mdash;if I may repeat a cliché&mdash;that 20/-value is got for every £ of his money spent.  At the moment he has no such reassurance.</P>
    <P>There is no Deputy in this House, with all due respect to Deputy O'Higgins, who can discover, by going in to make inquiries on behalf of his constituents in Government Departments, how a Department works, and if Deputy O'Higgins has been able to do that, I take off my hat to him.</P>
    <P>I did suggest when I was making my opening remarks one or two types of inquiries that might be made.  The British Estimates Committee has inquired into various things.  Most of them are not the type of inquiry that we possibly would make here&mdash;the services are very different&mdash;but they have made some, for instance, into O. and M., and the Parliamentary Secretary apparently thinks that just because we have O. and M., everything is all right. He talked about my sneering at O. and M.  On the contrary, I am all for O. and M. but what I want to know is now far has O. and M. been pursued&mdash;at what level?  My impression is that it only operates at very low levels&mdash;probably very desirable&mdash;but surely the Department of Finance would be delighted if a Parliamentary Committee would pat it on the back and say: &ldquo;Now you are on the right lines; go ahead.  We will strengthen your hand if you want it strengthened so far as O. and M. is concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I must confess that I am a little taken aback that the Minister for Finance should resist a committee which I think could be of very great assistance to the Minister and to the Department.  As he has said, his be-all and end-all in life is saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to expenditure.  Surely if there is a Parliamentary Committee which is <Col N="552" /> backing him up, and giving him very good reasons why he should say &ldquo;no,&rdquo; he should be all for it.  There is only one possible reason I can see why the Government or the Minister should resist the setting up of this committee, so far as securing economy in expenditure is concerned, and that is the possible doubt that, if economies are secured, the Government rather than the committee will get the kudos.  I do not think that should weigh with the Government at all.  Parliamentary committees never get any kudos for anything they do, so far as I know.  The Government is always in the best position to look for the pat on the back, and very rightly so, because the parliamentary committee of itself, cannot do anything.  The Public Account's Committee cannot order the Department of Finance or any Department to do anything or take any course of action; it can only draw the attention of the House to a possible solution of a difficulty, and it is only by implication that the Public Accounts committee succeeds in getting its way.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Finance or any Department wishes to resist the Public Accounts Committee, the Public Accounts Committee can only depend on this House to back it up vis-à-vis the Department of Finance, which in effect, means the Minister for Finance. The Public Accounts Committee has not a leg to stand on, if the Minister wishes to resist it to the utmost but, in practice, that is not what happens The suggestions of the committee are usually, I will say, followed in a reasonable way.  The Minister did interest me very much when he suggested, as a possible alternative to an Estimates Committee, some alteration in the ambit of the Public Accounts Committee.  There is, I think, a possible line of approach there.  As he said, in England it was suggested that there should be one committee, a committee on public expenditure, which would cover the ground covered by the Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee.  That was indeed, a suggestion by officers of the House of Commons but I am not sure that the grounds for turning it down were just those the Minister for Finance advanced.  As it really has not <Col N="553" /> anything to do with the discussion here at the moment I am not pursuing it but I think it is a rather weak ground.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the Estimates Committee would in some way be a political committee is one which I think carries no weight either.  The Public Accounts Committee consists of representatives of various Parties in the Dáil.  My proposal is that the Committee on Public Expenditure should be formed in the same way, that is, from a proportion of the Parties in this House and I see no reason why Party politics should rear its ugly head in one committee more than another.  I think the remarks of the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy O'Higgins arise from a misconception of the functions of an Estimates Committee.  If an Estimates Committee pursues the type of inquiry I have outlined, Party politics cannot possibly enter into the matter at all.</P>
    <P>So far I have covered most of the points raised in this debate.  May I make this suggestion?  The Minister has been inclined to suggest that the Estimates Committee in Great Britain has not produced any very startling results.  There may possibly be something in that.  The same could be said of the Public Accounts Committee here, but I want to remind the Dáil of the fact that, when a judge goes on circuit or appears anywhere to hold a court and there are no criminal cases before the court, it is customary for the judge to compliment the Garda Síochána on the peace of their district. I have never seen a case yet where the Gardaí had a long criminal list that the judge complimented them on their efficiency in tracking down malefactors.</P>
    <P>The Public Accounts Committee is in exactly the same position, and so would an Estimates Committee, as the police force.  You cannot judge the efficacy of a parliamentary committee by the number of cases that they produce, by the number of stringent reports they make, the numbers of raps they give to departmental knuckles.  The Public Accounts Committee acts very much through its deterrent force, through its mere existence.  The fact <Col N="554" /> that there is a parliamentary committee which may inquire into anything which happens to be wrong with the accounts has been proved time and again to be a very effective way to secure that the accounts will be correct. I think, in the same way, a Committee of Public Expenditure which would inquire into the efficiency of the Civil Service, should it never produce a report which pointed to a particular Department or section of a Department as being inefficient, could have a very good deterrent effect.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is too much to ask the House to envisage a situation where there could be inefficiency in a Department and to discover to-morrow morning that a Committee on Public Expenditure had been set up by the House to inquire into the efficiency of all sections of that Department, without the Department setting out immediately to put its house in order.  I think that in that way&mdash;you may call it a negative way&mdash;the committee would be a very useful thing.  It would encourage internal checks on efficiency.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that a committee of this type, to produce any effect at all, would have to work in harmony with the Departments just as the Public Accounts Committee acts.  As members of the Public Accounts Committee realise, very often little things crop up on which the committee might report in a very stringent and adverse way, but it generally inclines rather to pull its punches.  It is not because it has any fears of its opinion but because it can work best if there is harmony between it and the Departments, particularly the Department of Finance.  In the same way, if the Public Expenditure Committee is to do its duty of inquiring into the efficiency of the Civil Service, it would have to work in harmony with the Department, otherwise the blinds would very quickly be pulled down and an inter-departmental committee would be left with very little evidence on which to base its decision.</P>
    <P>Another essential would be the goodwill of the Government.  As Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, policy is debarred from consideration of the committee.  Of course, the dividing line where policy begins and ends is <Col N="555" /> always difficult to establish.  A committee which was fighting with the Government of the day as to what was policy and what was not, would stultify itself and could never produce anything useful, so that an essential factor in the working of the Committee of Public Expenditure would be the goodwill of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister is opposing the setting up of a committee, but I think the grounds on which he has registered his opposition are completely false.  His statement sounds to me very like a speech made by the present Minister for Agriculture when he was Deputy Dillon on the last occasion on which I raised this matter, a speech which I took at the time to be a sort of <i>tour de force</i>&mdash;a sort of feeling that there was a vacuum in which he felt he had to say something.  He talked quite a lot of balderdash.  He said that such a committee would interfere with the prerogatives of Parliament, a thing which I pointed out to be demonstrably false. The Minister's speech in reply to my opening statement sounded terribly like the speech of Deputy Dillon on that occasion.  Whatever the reason may be, the Minister has indicated that he is not willing to accept this proposal.  He has hinted that some other approach may be made.  If his mind runs on the lines that some adjustment might be made in the ambit that the Public Accounts Committee covers, I would be prepared to go a long way to meet him.  May I suggest that it would be very useful if it could be arranged that where the Public Accounts Committee has doubts as to the efficiency of any Department or section of a Department as disclosed by the accounts, that the committee may pursue its inquiries right up to the present rather than, as now, stopping at the end of the financial year into which the committee is inquiring.  Useful work could then be done.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is thinking of business audits and efficiency audits by outside bodies, I cannot agree with him at all.  My own impression, in so far as I can learn anything about them at all, is that such audits carried out by experts from outside appear to me, <Col N="556" /> first of all, to take place in the wrong Departments; and, secondly, they seem to me to produce very little result for the money spent.  Again, as with the Public Accounts Committee, and as it would be with a Committee on Public Expenditure, I admit it is not possible to judge precisely by the apparent effect.  The long-term effect may go much further.  But I am not fond of something which is not parliamentary. I still take my stand on the fact that I am a parliamentarian first, last and all the time, and it is parliamentary control I wish to see: such control may not be as efficient as some other type of control from outside; but any control from outside is merely bureaucracy under another name, and I do not want to see that.</P>
    <P>However, if the Minister is still considering the matter&mdash;I shall not go so far as one of his supporters and suggest that it will take him five years in which to make up his mind&mdash;I will be very happy eventually to hear the results of his further inquiries.  As far as the present motion is concerned, I have indicated that an essential factor in the efficient working of a committee engaged on Estimates would be the sympathy, support and approval of the Government and the Department of Finance.  If that is not forthcoming at the moment I do not see that I can serve any useful purpose in doing anything at this stage other than withdrawing, with the permission of the House, the motion in my name.</P>

      <P>I move :&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in view of the steep increase in rates on agricultural land, the high cost of labour and the reduction in live stock prices, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that a substantial increase should be made by the Government in the present agricultural grant for the further relief of rates on agricultural land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I first put down this motion about a year ago conditions were entirely different from what they are to-day.  Had I been able to prophesy at that time what conditions would be <Col N="557" /> like to-day I would perhaps have felt inclined to give this motion much wider scope because I would have had to take into consideration conditions as they present themselves to us in the agricultural industry as it stands and refer to the immense destruction that has been caused to crops all over the country due to the inclemency of the weather.  I do not intend to cover that ground now.</P>
    <P>Every year at about this time the Dáil is asked to consider a Bill entitled Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill.  I think about this time 12 months we discussed such a measure. It is the object of that measure to provide for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  First of all, we have the primary allowance on agricultural land; at one time we got a supplementary allowance.  Now we are getting an employment allowance.</P>
    <P>Let me say at the outset that politics should be entirely divorced from the question of rates.  All over this country vast sums of money are being spent every year.  I do not impute malice to either local government officials or public representatives, but there is definitely an unfair levy of taxation in relation to agricultural land.  Let us examine this question of the agricultural industry.  Taking the broad view of it let us consider for a moment our national income.  The total income derived from the land is about one-third of the national income; the amount of rates collected from the land represents 75 per cent. of the total amount of rates.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the agricultural industry is being treated unfairly.  We all remember last year, when this Bill was being re-enacted, the Minister for Local Government at that time proposed to make some alterations.  He succeeded in dropping the supplementary allowance and substituting an employment allowance.  First of all, in May, 1953, he circularised the county councils that a £13 allowance was to be made for every man employed on an agricultural holding.  That did not meet with the approval of the country.  A couple of by-elections took place subsequently and on the results of these by-elections the Minister changed his mind and increased <Col N="558" /> the agricultural allowance to £17.  At that time, 1953, when we were discussing this measure, the change was vigorously opposed by many members who now occupy ministerial positions in the present Government.  I remember Deputy Dillon, on the First Stage of that Bill, in 1953, asking the Minister for Local Government was that the Bill that would deprive the farmers of £250,000.  Later in the debate figures were produced by men who now occupy ministerial positions, showing the disastrous results that would accrue from any changes in that Bill, from the dropping of the supplementary grant and its replacement by the employment allowance.  One Deputy who is now a Minister went to the trouble of giving a list of the losses that might be suffered by each county.  I think he gave the whole Twenty-Six Counties and showed the loss each county would suffer by the substitution of the employment grant for the supplementary allowance.  He estimated that the losses would cost the country something in the neighbourhood of £220,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I know that any words I say to-night in support of this motion are not falling on deaf ears.  I know that the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, when he spoke on this measure a year ago said that the farmers were being treated very badly and that he was here to defend the farmers and to get an increase of this agricultural grant.  I also know that the present Minister for Finance, when he spoke on this Bill last year, said that a grave injustice was being done to the agricultural community by depriving them of £220,000, to which they should be entitled.  Therefore I know my words are not falling on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>It has been said in this House by a former Minister for Finance that taxation rests very lightly on the land. I do not agree with that.  Very few Deputies on the Government side of the House will agree with that statement. That phrase was used against the Fianna Fail Party during the election, at every crossroad, at every church gate, to show that it was the intention&mdash;if it was not the expressed intention it was the implied intention of the Minister for Finance at that <Col N="559" /> time to impose some form of taxation on the land when he said that taxation rests lightly on the land.  The statement must have induced the former Minister for Local Government to interfere to such an extent in the grants for relief of rates on agricultural land that he made an attempt to deprive the farmers of this country in 1953 of something in the neighbourhood of £400,000 by the employment allowance.</P>
    <P>The tendency in this country since we got native Government is to shift the burden of taxation from Central Government to local government. I happen to be a member of a local authority in Roscommon.  I know that local authorities are responsible for quite a lot of expenditure which must be found from the rates but which should be financed by the Central Government.  We are now responsible for supplementary housing grants, for supplementary blind pensions, to a certain extent for the financing of vocational education, for expenditure under the Diseases of Animals Act and the Milk and Dairies Act, for the erection of courthouses and for the impact which will come on the rates in the coming year for the implementation of the various provisions of the Health Act.</P>
    <P>For that reason I think it is now time that the Government should step into the breach and increase these grants because, bad as we now are, the rates will become such an intolerable burden that the farmers will be unable to pay them.</P>
    <P>In discussing the measure in 1953, various items were suggested which might to some extent relieve the rates on agricultural land.  It was suggested that an allowance should be made for the employment of female labour on the land.  That is quite reasonable, because quite a number of females are employed on the land and do very good work.  They should be included in the category of workers in respect of whom there is relief of rates. Relief should also be given in respect of part-time workers on the land.  The fact that an employee of a farmer may leave his employment after the first few months of the year <Col N="560" /> and that the farmer has to employ another man militates harshly against the farmer, who has to forfeit the allowance.  That is a hardship which should be rectified.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that in a few short years rates have jumped abnormally. I did not realise that the rates had stepped up so quickly during my time in public life until I made inquiries in County Roscommon and discovered that in the year 1945-46 the rate in the £ was 14/8 and gradually increased every year until, in 1954-55, the rate is 34/4 in the £, an increase in eight years of something in the neighbourhood of 135 per cent.  With the able assistance of Deputy McQuillan we may look forward to a reduction in rates in the coming year.</P>

      <P>There are 36 county councillors and we have got eight seats.  The employment allowances to which I have referred will not give the results anticipated by the former Minister for Local Government.  To-day the number employed on the land is much less than it was many years ago.  In 1953, there has been a drop of 17,000 people compared with 1952.  As time goes on, with the drift from the land, it is quite obvious that the agricultural grant will be ineffective.  No <Col N="561" /> good results will accure to the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I put down this motion believing that my words will not fall on deaf ears.  I was present in the House when members of the Opposition who are now members of the Government very harshly criticised the 1953 Relief of Rates on Agricultural Land Bill and very openly said that the agricultural community was being deprived of certain concessions which they should get.  I am afraid I cannot look forward with optimism to the position of agriculture in the coming spring or coming years.  The farmers have got a setback this year from which they may not recover for five or ten years.  Due to the flooding, not alone are there losses just now but I can see that in the springtime there will be a considerable drop in live stock.  At the present time there is a drop in the prices of all classes of live stock.  Certain classes of cattle cannot be sold but there are other classes which cannot be got for love or money.  Pigs are recovering slightly from a bad slump some months ago. They are recovering now due to the scarcity.  Many people went out of pig breeding and now there is a scarcity and prices have gone up. Sheep have declined; our poultry population has declined; so I cannot see any prospect for the agricultural population, due to the bad season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, I ask the Minister and the Government and every Deputy here to support me in seeking to give to the agricultural community some hope and encouragement in this, one of its darkest hóurs.  I say that a substantial grant should be given this year.  Failing that, we should revert to the position obtaining prior to 1953 and should rehash the Act and bring in the primary allowance, the secondary allowance and the employment allowance. I believe that I am pushing an open door.  I would be terribly surprised if the Minister or any member of his Party opposed this motion. When the Bill was before the House in 1953, even the present Tánaiste objected to its provisions being changed.  While he did not say the farmers should get cash grants, he said <Col N="562" /> money might properly be spent for the relief of rates on agricultural land in another way, and he suggested grants for the purchase of artificial manures. At that time, all the leaders of the different Parties comprising the present Government were favourably disposed to an increase in this grant.  I expect something wonderful from the Minister's lips when he stands to speak on this motion.  For that reason, I am optimistic and hopeful that I or my Party may have achieved something by putting down this motion.</P>
    <P>Later on, when the Relief of Rates on Agricultural Land Bill comes to the House, I believe the Minister might be considering some amendments to it which would be of benefit to the agricultural community.  I am not in any way forestalling the Minister or attempting to do so.  If those are his intentions I wish to be helpful and cooperative. I would be terribly surprised if I do not get the sympathy of all rural Deputies who represent the agricultural community, no matter to what Party they belong.</P>

      <P>Before I proceed to deal in detail with the proposition put forward by Deputy Beirne, it would be advisable to give a very brief history of the progress of legislation benefiting the agricultural community and to make it quite clear that the Fianna Fáil Party did a great deal during their term of office to relieve farmers from part of their rates.  I do not want to go into great detail but to recite the brief historical facts.  In 1925, the agricultural grant for the relief of rates was a sum of £1,200,000.  In 1931, that sum was increased by £750,000 by the then Cumann na nGaedheal Government.</P>

      <P>I could not.  I am indicating that a contribution was made consistently and continuously during the whole period of the Fianna Fáil Government.  Of course, taxation increased also under this and every other Government.  If the Minister for Local Government is going on the basis that is was wrong for taxation to increase at all in that period, we would have a different kind of debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister listens to me he will realise I am not trying to start a debate on the total burden of taxation but merely giving an indication of how much the farmers have benefited.  In 1933, the agricultural relief was added to by the sum of £250,000 per year, but for the first time the principle was adopted that there should be some kind of special concession to holdings of under £10 valuation and on the first £10 valuation of larger holdings.  By that means some aid was given to the smaller farmers and to those possessing uneconomic holdings. In 1933, the total contribution amounted to £2,200,000, which, of course, included the original statutory sum of, I think, £599,000, first applied by a British Act of Parliament some time in the 19th century&mdash;in 1898, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1939, another Act was passed and the principle of the three allowances was inaugurated&mdash;a primary allowance on the first £20 valuation, a secondary allowance on the whole of the first £20 valuation, if any, over that; and then the principle of giving an employment allowance was also started for the first time.  It was a rather cumbersome system and it was difficult for county councils to work out, but the results <Col N="564" /> were that in that particular year the contribution in the form of primary allowance was £1,200,000; for the employment allowance £350,000 was provided; and for the remainder, that is to say, any part of the valuation for which there had been no relief in the first two allowances, there was the sum of nearly £300,000.  Then, as time went on, it became evident that still more assistance should be given.  In 1946 there was passed the Act upon which the Agricultural Grant had been given until 1953.  In the 1946 Act, as the House well knows, there was an allowance of three-fifths on the first £20 valuation. On the valuations above £20 there was an allowance of one-fifth.  Then employment allowance was increased and £6 10s. was given per workman per annum or, roughly, 10s. in the £ on valuations above £20.  As a result of that Act, by the financial year 1948-49 the total contribution for the relief of rates to the agricultural community was £3,720,000.  Then, in 1953, in order to encourage employment on the land and in order to make some gesture towards the solution of the problem of people leaving the land at a very rapid rate&mdash; which they have been doing ever since the war&mdash;the Act was amended.  The supplementary allowance was eliminated and the allowance for employment was increased from £6 10s. to £17. The result of that could be seen in the Estimates for 1954-55 in which the total contribution will be £5,330,000&mdash;an increase of £310,000 over the previous year and a record figure.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the fact that, during the whole of that period, the rates rose but then taxation rose during the whole of the period also. If one considers the amount of the grant in relation to the value of agricultural production or the amount of agricultural production one can say quite definitely that some really serious contribution was made by the Fianna Fáil Government in order to assist farmers with the burden of the rates they had to pay.  I am not arguing that the burden of rates is not heavy at the present time.  I am well aware that taxation, both local and national, has quite obviously reached <Col N="565" /> a very high level.  Not only in this country but in all those countries of a modern type where there are extensive social services and extensive health services, people complain about the level of taxation.  I am merely saying that a considerable amount was done by the Fianna Fáil Party to contribute to the relief of agricultural rates.  The Fianna Fáil Party, above all, did their utmost to increase the proportion of the grant made available for the small farming community and the uneconomic landholders.  I should add, in connection with any debate on the subject of the burden of taxation on the agricultural community, that a great many other contributions were made by the Fianna Fáil Government to aid the farming community in one form or another&mdash;by means of grants or schemes of various kinds.  I could mention a number of schemes which must at least be considered in any debate in relation to the relief of agricultural rates.  If the relief of agricultural rates is considered by itself, any debate on the subject is useless.  One at least has to mention in the same context the other services made available to the farming community in the past 20 years.  Farmers may complain that they are not sufficient&mdash;that more should have been done.  I think that at least the honest farmer will recognise that a good deal has been accomplished and that, therefore, the contribution to the agricultural rates must be regarded in the context of the general schemes made available to farmers.</P>
    <P>I could mention the subsidies for the production of butter which were commenced by the Fianna Fáil Government when the butter industry was collapsing in 1932 and which have been in operation in one form or another since that date.  It was a source of immense help to the small farmers in the creamery areas.  I could mention the institution of unemployment allowances in the winter months for the sons of small farmers which bring in a regular cash contribution and which Deputy Beirne should compare with the relief of rates to small farmers.  He would find that in many households on <Col N="566" /> ten or 15 acres the amount available either for minor relief scheme work or unemployment allowances&mdash;the actual amount coming into the house&mdash;would make a good figure in comparison with the relief of rates afforded a farmer on his holding and that to mention one without mentioning the other is useless in the circumstances.  The farming community have benefited from housing schemes and Gaeltacht schemes.  There have been grants for land reclamation, for farm buildings and for rural improvement schemes which have been adopted to a limited extent by a number of farmers throughout the country for the improvement of their roads.  There have also been a number of other schemes specially devoted to the Gaeltacht area for the encouragement of local industries, and so forth.  Then, Deputy Beirne could hardly consider the question of the contribution to the rates here without at least adverting in some degree to the whole of the land division which has taken place since the Fianna Fáil Land Acts enabled land to be divided on a far more extensive basis.  Again, if one compares the relief of rates for agricultural land with the benefit conferred on those who have been fortunate enough to secure land under the Fianna Fáil Land Acts, in many cases the increase in the holding would very greatly outweigh in value any contribution to the rates.  The whole of these benefits must be considered together.  The employment afforded on Bord na Móna bogs adjacent to smallholdings has, again, been of benefit to small farmers. For the larger farmers there have been other Fianna Fáil schemes&mdash;a guaranteed price for wheat, arrangements whereby Grain Importers have taken barley in recent years off the farmers' hands at some reasonable price, the extension of the Sugar Company's work by the inauguration of new factories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a Supplementary Estimate in respect of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  In spite of all the benefits that have been conferred, I agree with Deputy Beirne, and I am sure all members of the Fianna Fáil Party agree that we would like to do something more for the agricultural community.  We are aware that agricultural production has not yet increased as much as we would like and although the record figure of a 5.9 per cent. increase above the agricultural production of 1938 was reached in the last year of Fianna Fáil administration, unlike Deputy Dillon we do not like to boast about it.  We do not wish to suggest that all is well for the farming community because of that increase. Deputy Dillon based his statistics on two of the worst weather years in our history&mdash;1946 and 1947&mdash; and boasted when agricultural production went up in 1948 as though the increase were a miracle of his own devising.  When agricultural production reached the 1945 level he boasted still more.  I trust that in this and <Col N="568" /> other debates we in Fianna Fáil will not play ducks and drakes with statistics.  We will not blame Deputy Dillon next year for the results of the present year's bad weather&mdash;playing, in reverse, the same game he played upon Fianna Fáil when he boasted of the increase in production that took place one year after two years, as I have said, of extremely bad weather.</P>
      <P>As I said, while there was a very helpful and a very pleasant increase in production in 1953, there is still stagnation. There is now a greater necessity for farmers to co-operate in their production in future years now that competition is beginning on an ever-increasing scale.  It is obvious that farmers, even with smaller farms, must, somehow or other, invest in machinery, and that it would be costly for them to do so.  It is also obvious that far more working capital will have to be employed in agriculture if we are to compete with other countries on the markets available to us abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Beirne mentioned, the number of persons working in agriculture is constantly decreasing.  He gave a figure which referred to the last year of the Fianna Fáil Government, but I suppose Deputy Beirne is aware of the fact that the number of men on the land decreased steadily during the whole of the inter-Party Government's term of office, and that all the sentimental and fulsome fulminations in his Party about keeping people on the land apparently had not the slightest effect in practice when members of his Party formed part of the Coalition Government from 1948 to 1951.  If I remember rightly something like 50,000 males left the land during that period of the inter-Party Government's term of office, and they went on leaving it in our period of government afterwards.  It is a symptom which is apparent all over the world; there is nothing peculiar about it.  In Great Britain, where the production in agriculture has gone up enormously, the number of agricultural workers has gone back to the 1939 figure although production has increased there by something like 40 per cent. over 1939.  Of course, when Deputy Beirne was on the hustings he was accusing us of being responsible <Col N="569" /> for the people leaving the land, and when he got into office and they continued to leave the land he and his Party were very quite when it came to their action of forming part of the Government.  I merely mention that because we all get very tired of people who blow hot and cold, blow hot when they are down the country, and remain silent and mouselike when they come up and have to be responsible for acts of the Government of which they form part.</P>
    <P>Some of us wonder what the purpose is behind this discussion.  At one time Deputy Blowick, in 1948, made the most solemn promise that he would never join any Coalition.  We heard rumours that there was some difficulty in persuading Deputy Blowick to join the present Coalition and some of us may speculate as to whether there is some sinister purpose in moving this resolution and of the purpose it serves and whether or not they are trying to crack the which in some way in order to provide greater influence within the ranks of the Coalition Government.  We do not know whether this is the firing of the first shot or whether it is simply chancing an arm in the hope that something might turn up at the end of it all.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil must decide whether or not we will vote with Deputy Beirne and his Party on this Resolution.  From one point of view we regard the Resolution as typical of the irresponsible statements made by members of Fine Gael who promised to provide increased services without saying where they are going to get the money from.  They promised to reduce taxation and increase benefits, promised to reduce prices and at the same time not to impose taxation for subsidies.  From one point of view we might wonder; we might say: &ldquo;We will have none of this motion.&rdquo;  It is the typical sort of thing we had to face during the whole of the election, people going down into country districts and promising farmers relief from their rates, promising farmers higher prices and going into the towns and promising the people lower prices for their produce, higher subsidies for their produce and in the fond belief that the urban sections of the community <Col N="570" /> and the rural section would remain completely isolated from each other and that it was quite possible to promise one thing to one section and another thing to another section and to get away with it.  I must admit the members of the present Government seem to have been for the moment rather successful in that they managed to defeat Fianna Fáil at the election. But when we get a motion of this kind we are doubtful how to treat it, whether to vote against it simply on the ground that we must establish some kind of honourable principle in debating statistical and economic matters in this House, that if people are going to propose increased reliefs from taxation on the one hand they must say now and succinctly where they are going to get the money.</P>
    <P>We might take that attitude, but having debated this amongst ouselves we decided that we will support Deputy Beirne in this motion, and we will support him because we may induce a sense of responsibility in the present Government in regard to their whole attitude to financial matters.  We will try to make them live up to their statements that taxation was grossly unnecessary, that the taxes were merely not imposed to pay for current supply services, that they were imposed in a deliberate attempt to try to make the people pay more in order that they could enjoy their life rather less than they would under a Coalition Government, that there were hidden surpluses of every description from which they might get relief, from which the whole community could be relieved.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, therefore, we will try again to see if we can find in the coffers of Finance all these undisclosed surpluses and all these economies that were going to be made. We will have great pleasure in supporting Deputy Beirne in this motion if he presses it to a division.  We will be very interested to see whether Deputy Beirne, knowing that he will have the Fianna Fáil Party behind him, will now press his motion to a division.  We shall then see and verify what is the sincerity of all that he has said, whether he is really sincere or whether he is trying to please the fractionalised <Col N="571" /> and dismal Clann na Talmhan clubs that still exist down the country in his Party, which has now shrunk to very small dimensions.  We intend to do this because we have some reason for supporting Deputy Beirne.  In expressing the hope that something will be found for these agricultural reliefs we might perhaps quote some of the statements of recent date made in regard to money available for all these various purposes.  Perhaps we might first quote one of the members of Deputy Beirne's Party, Deputy Donnellan, who, speaking in Ballina and reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 9th June, 1952, made this astonishing statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...If there is a change of Government we will put in a Minister for Finance who will remit £1,000,000 for each minute of a ten-minute talk in the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely we can remit all the rates if that statement is true.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask Deputy Beirne what he thinks of Deputy Donnellan's statement in regard to remitting £1,000,000 for each minute of a ten-minute talk in the Dáil.  It would take some computation&mdash;no doubt the authorities who would administer the proceedings in the Dáil could make the calculation&mdash;but I think it would mean a complete remittance of taxation central and local, which is a thing which we would all welcome.</P>
    <P>Then we had a Fine Gael advertisement which was published in the <i>Evening Mail</i> of the 14th May, 1954, in which it was stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Here are the prices in each of the two years.  How much extra do these cost you every week.  Every one of these increases is due to deliberate Government action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, the cost of living went up here and in a great many other countries from 25 per cent. to 28 per cent. from 1950 to 1953.  If the increases were due to Government action here, they must have been due to some expenditure by the Government which had the effect of increasing these prices.  We are still waiting to have the price of everything reduced to the <Col N="572" /> 1951 level.  It should be possible to make more money available for Deputy Beirne's scheme for the relief of agricultural rates.</P>
    <P>Then we had Deputy Corish, the present Minister for Social Welfare, who was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the 30th April, 1954, as saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The first point in the election programme of the Labour Party was the reduction of food prices and the use of subsidies on essential articles of food to achieve this object.  Labour was very definitely committed to this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps, Deputy Beirne could convince the Minister for Social Welfare that instead of spending these sums which we are waiting to have spent on increased subsidies, they might be transferred, perhaps, towards the relief of agricultural rates, and that these sums we are waiting to see spent on subsidies to reduce prices to the 1951 level might, perhaps, by means of the forceful action of the Clann na Talmhan section of the Government be diverted towards the purpose of relieving farmers in regard to their rates. Deputy Beirne, no doubt, has the ability to do that.  Perhaps, he could convey immediately, through the Minister for Lands, to the other members of the Government that we are all waiting to see those subsidies enacted in the Dáil, and it might be well that if instead the Government remitted the rates for the farmers.</P>
    <P>We had Deputy McGilligan in his broadcast reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 8th May, 1954&mdash;and this should make things easy for Deputy Beirne&mdash; saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A distinct change of policy was required, however, and a new outlook on the part of Ministers was demanded if the reduction of £20,000,000 and upwards, desirable in everybody's interest was to be achieved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was referring to the national expenditure. It may be that before Deputy McGilligan succeeds in getting a reduction of £20,000,000 Deputy Beirne might save something from the wreck and achieve a further contribution <Col N="573" /> to agricultural rates because if they are going to reduce expenditure by £20,000,000 Deputy Beirne may find himself in a difficult position in regard to the implementation of this resolution.</P>
    <P>I could go on quoting <i>ad lib</i> but I think it would be rather boring for the House as so many statements were made.</P>

      <P>I now come to the masterpiece of all these statements made at the time of the election&mdash;that made by my colleague in Westmeath-Longford, Deputy MacEoin.  I beg Deputy Beirne to listen most intently to this, because herein lies the source of his ultimate hopes.  Deputy MacEoin the present Minister for Defence, as reported in the <i>Sligo Champion</i>&mdash;he never contradicted the statement&mdash;on the 20th March, 1954, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Fine Gael, if returned to office, would take steps to see to it that the Central Fund would undertake responsibility for all future expenditure and for some of the existing expenditure which was at present being met by the local rates.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We will give Deputy MacEoin all the time he wants to start implementing contributions to the local rates from the Central Fund for all new local government expenditure. I am not a betting man.  I do not often bet but I am willing to make a bet that if there are any other further services to be inaugurated which form part of the local authorities administration <Col N="574" /> at least some of the expenditure would be shared by the local authority.  Deputy MacEoin's promise was completely unusual and made without any scruple or any serious intention whatever.</P>
      <P>I have not the quotation here, but Deputy McGilligan has not contradicted the statement I made recently in which I reminded him of the speech he made during the general election in which he said that he thought that a great part of the central Government services in the Department of Local Government could be diverted to the local authorities and that the local authorities by doing part of the work of the central Government would save the central Government administrative expenditure.</P>
      <P>We have before us at the moment and about to come into committee a Local Government Bill which in every line of it maintains and ensures a continuance to the present Minister for Local Government complete and absolute control of all the operations of the local authorities.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan implied in his speech that a sufficient reduction could be made in the cost of local government to make a noticeable and visible decrease in taxation&mdash;not £300,000, not £500,000 but something that would make a difference that work could be transferred to the local authorities and without any increase in staff they would continue to perform that work and the rates would remain the same.  We are waiting to see that happening.  I am merely mentioning it in the context of this Resolution and in explaining why we are going to support Deputy Beirne if he presses it to a division.  We would like to see where these economies that were spoken of are coming from.  If the money is available&mdash;and it has been said to be available&mdash;it should be available for the relief of taxation.  Whereas the lower and middle income groups deserve reliefs and whereas people in the urban districts deserve relief, if all the money which, according to statements by members of the Government during the election, would be available is forthcoming, there should be some contribution towards increased production, towards the difficulties of the present year resulting in decreased farm production, in order to enable the farming community to have some working capital next year so that they may recommence their operations with some hope and optimism.  We are going to vote for this motion because we would <Col N="577" /> like to see if the Government can now produce the finance that will be required in order to continue the work of Fianna Fáil in enlarging the scope of relief of rates for the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>I hope I have made my position absolutely clear&mdash;that in the ordinary way, we in this Party, would prefer Resolutions which make it quite clear that the person proposing the Resolution has some conception of where the money is to come from, but we would like to go into the Division Lobbies with Deputy Beirne just in order to try the Government, in order to see where they may find their finances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for Local Government has finished I will proceed.  There are many farmers who, due to this year's severe weather, are in a very serious plight.  They have seen the results of their labours done away with in very many cases and it would be up to any Government in the present year to come to the assistance of these badly-hit farmers.  There was one thing that did strike me when Deputy Beirne was speaking and that was his confidence that the motion would be accepted by the Minister.  I do not know why it is that he felt so confident.  We agree that a reduction of rates for farmers is something that would be beneficial to the farming <Col N="579" /> community.  I agree thoroughly with Deputy Beirne when he says that the prices of cattle have fallen very much over the last few months.  I agree also with him when he states that the drop in pig prices has caused serious losses to the small farmers.  I agree, therefore, that he has made a case for a reduction or a relief of rates for farmers; that agrees with my own experience this year of the heavy losses incurred due to factors which are outside the farmers' control and I must say&mdash;agreeing with the Minister&mdash;out-side the Government's control.  But there are factors operating this year which are within the Government's control.  What have they done about the prices of pigs?  What have they done in regard to the increase in the prices of animal feeding stuffs?  This year the Government is going to save at the expenses of the farmers on the wheat subsidy, because they are allowing the prices of mill offals, bran and pollard, to skyrocket, and the purpose of allowing that is to reduce the subsidies that the Government in the coming year will have to pay for wheat. Of course, the people who will pay for the increase in the prices of these animal feeding stuffs are the farmers. That is something the Government has control over.</P>
      <P>To get back to some of Deputy Beirne's statements&mdash;he seemed to be very confident and I wonder why?  Was it that he got some inkling from the Minister that proposals in line with the terms of his motion were under consideration by the Government?  He may have got the green light in that respect but even if he did not he would be justified in his bright outlook and in concluding that the present Government which includes a Minister from his own Party would look favourably on this motion because I have here some extracts from speeches made by Deputies who now form the Government. These extracts are taken from speeches by those Deputies&mdash;some of them are Ministers now&mdash;and on these alone he would be justified in expecting that the terms of his motion would be operated by the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all we have the Taoiseach, <Col N="580" /> who was then Deputy Costello.  I do not know where he spoke but he was reported by the <i>Sligo Champion</i> on 1st May, 1954 and his words were:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With certain safeguards the raw materials of the agricultural industry should be freed from taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the main raw materials of the agricultural industry is the land of Ireland, and when he said that the raw materials of the agricultural industry would be free from taxation, I took it that he meant the land of Ireland would be free from taxation.</P>

      <P>My next attempt may be better.  It is that from the then Deputy MacEoin, the present Minister for Defence, that if Fine Gael were returned to office they would take steps to see to it that the Central Fund would undertake responsibility for all future expenditure, and for some of the existing expenditure which was at present being met by the rates.  If the content of that statement were put into operation, it would help to relieve the ratepayers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement was reported&mdash;I do not know where it was made&mdash;in the <i>Sligo Champion</i> of 20/3/54.  A further statement by Deputy Dillon, who, of course, is interested in the land of Ireland, and in the farmers, was: the removal of all taxes and restrictions on the raw material of agriculture.  Again I take it that we are all agreed that the land of Ireland is one of the raw materials of the farming industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave at Dún Laoghaire, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 7/5/54, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We ask for support that taxation may be reduced, and some easement <Col N="581" /> granted in the burdens which weigh so heavily on the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree that taxation weighs on city people as well as on country people, but amongst country people the main cry is the rates.  I take it that Deputy Cosgrave was not catering for the palates of the city people, and that he meant and had in mind the interests of the community as a whole, and that when he referred to reduction in taxation, he was going to apply these reductions to the farmers, as well as to the city people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello is reported in the <i>Sligo Independent</i> of 1-5-54 as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was no reason why taxes should not be got down while at the same time improved services were provided.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is where I would advise Deputy Beirne to get in as quickly as he can, and to get as much as he can, because if expenditure is going to be reduced, as promised by the present Taoiseach, the first man in will be the first served, because the chances of getting rates reduced, if a wholesale slashing of expenditure is to take place, will be very slight indeed.</P>
    <P>Another statement by the Taoiseach in his broadcast was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We shall honour every commitment to the farmer and provide him with a guaranteed price for wheat during not less than five years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to the first part of that statement: &ldquo;We shall honour every commitment to the farmer.&rdquo;  I wonder if he had before him a list of the commitments which were being made in his name by Deputies up and down the country during that election campaign.  They were many and varied, but they all had the same tone &mdash;&ldquo;taxes can and must and will come down.  We will see to that.&rdquo;  As Deputy Childers pointed out, a statement by Deputy Donnellan, the Parliamentary Secretary, was that they would put in a Minister for Finance who would see to it that taxation would come down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the mover of this motion, the seconder, and also the other Deputy whose name is signed on the motion itself, are serious and genuine in their efforts to improve conditions for the farming community, and as far as they are concerned, they look upon the suggestion in this motion as being the best way to accomplish that aim.  So far as they are concerned, there is no specific figure asked for in this motion. The words used are that a substantial increase should be made by the Government in the present agricultural grant for the relief of rates.  The word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; could mean anything; each Deputy is entitled to his own interpretation of &ldquo;substantial&rdquo;.  There is no doubt that the wording of the motion leaves the Government a loophole to escape from a very embarrassing situation.  It is quite easy for the Government to deny the demand made in this motion as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather sorry that in the course of the discussion so much play was made of the promises from both sides in the course of the election.  I feel that this discussion was not devoted to the relief of rates at all but that Deputies were relieving their own feelings over certain remarks they made in the last election campaign. I suppose it is inevitable that the different Parties should try to get as much political kudos as possible out of <Col N="584" /> the efforts of their own Parties to improve conditions generally throughout the country.  I was rather disappointed at the contribution of Deputy Childers when he referred to the tremendous work done by the previous Government in the field of land division, to the fact that substantial relief had been given to the small farmers and that several people had received new holdings of land from the Land Commission during the Fianna Fáil régime.  Of course the situation is that the number of new economic holdings created between 1931 and 1949 was 12,000.  If we compare that figure with the number of holdings established during the British régime between the years 1912 and 1919, we find that they established 50,000 holdings in that short period, so that we have nothing to crow about in connection with the relief given to the farming community in so far as holdings of land are concerned.</P>
    <P>The motion as it stands is to my mind rather unsatisfactory.  It embraces equally the really large holder in this country and puts him on the same terms and gives him the same advantages, as the small, even the uneconomic, holder.  If we relate this motion to the over-all picture in this country, we shall see it would be very unjust to give the same terms and the same relief to all the different sections of the farming community.  We have 380,000 agricultural holdings and of these, 280,000 are under £20 valuation. If we break that down a little further, we find that the 280,000 holdings have an average valuation of a little over £7. On the other hand, we have 11,600 holdings with an average valuation of almost £200.  If we take the poor law valuation of the two groups this comparison emerges.  We have 220,000 holdings of land in Ireland with a total over-all valuation of £1,900,000 and we have 11,600 holdings with an over-all valuation of £2,250,000.  We have now the position that the 11,600 holdings are more valuable to the extent of half a million pounds than the land in the possession of the 220,000 other holders.  Under this motion, there will be no difference whatever in connection with the two groups.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> A close examination of the whole problem should be made before the Government embarks, in a blind way, on trying to help the agricultural community as a whole.  If we take these holdings that I described as under £20 valuation, we find the average valuation is in the region of 6/6 per acre, whereas the average valuation in the other group of 11,600 holdings is in the region of 16/- per acre, so that each acre in the group of the higher valuations, is worth two and a half acres of the holdings that come under the £20 valuation.</P>
    <P>On that basis, I think that it is ridiculous for Deputy Childers and other speakers to suggest that what is described as the flight from the land is a natural procedure.  He suggested that what was happening here in Ireland with regard to boys and girls leaving the land was something that was happening all over the world.  He pointed out that in Britain fewer people were living on the land, that more work was now being done by machinery.  It is completely unrealistic to suggest that the two situations can be compared at all.  In the majority of holdings, especially in western areas, which have very small valuations and very poor land, it is a matter of hard necessity.  The sons and daughters of these small-holders must emigrate, and it is ridiculous to suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that it is ridiculous that a Deputy, and especially a Deputy with the experience of Deputy Childers, should suggest that this driving-out of the rural population and the depriving them of the land is a natural trend, just as it is a natural trend in England and other European countries.  Deputies must agree that where there are small uneconomic holdings and congestion to the extent that exists to-day it is ridiculous to talk about giving reliefs to the farming community unless we are prepared to get at the root of the trouble.  The root of the trouble is mainly that of uneconomic holdings.  If a practical motion was moved here <Col N="586" /> which might have the effect of impelling the present Minister for Lands to get after his Department in relation to this problem of uneconomic holdings, it would have more useful consequences for the rural community than will the terms of this motion.</P>
      <P>Apart from certain sections of the community which would benefit by this motion, we have a situation to-day wherein, if this motion is accepted, a large number of undesirable aliens who have come into this country in the last 15 years will also benefit.  If money is devoted to the purposes suggested in this motion that money will be raised from taxation on the Irish people in order to help consolidate the position of the non-nationals.  It should be brought home forcibly to Deputies that since 1945 we have allowed over 120,000 acres of the finest land to be sold mostly to undesirable non-nationals.</P>

      <P>I thought it would be in order to suggest to the mover and seconder of this motion that they should ensure that any benefits which might come as a result of this motion will be reserved solely for those who are Irish nationals.  They might at this stage, if it is possible, try to amend the motion to increase the rates on these undesirables instead of reducing them.  That is what I want to achieve and I think I am entitled in that connection to point out that these people will benefit under this motion. It is an extraordinary situation that in the year 1947 alone the amount of money spent by non-nationals on the purchase of real estate and agricultural land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the Chair's ruling.  If the mover of this motion coud even at this stage suggest to the Minister that a different approach be made in relation to the way in which the relief should operate in order to ensure that the desired relief to be afforded to the agricultural community will be given mainly to the smaller farmer and to those who are working their holdings to full capacity, I would have no quarrel with the purpose of this motion.  Some Deputies may suggest that a better way of helping the farming community at the present time, other than the adoption of this motion, would be to increase the moneys allocated under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and to speed up the work under the land project scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that when the Minister for Local Government intervenes in this debate he will give us his views generally. If he finds that this motion in its present form does not exactly meet with his approval, then perhaps he will be able to tell us the means by which he and the Government propose to improve conditions generally for the agricultural community.  As far as I am concerned, I believe that the three Deputies who tabled this motion <Col N="588" /> believe sincerely that it will be of advantage to the agricultural community, which they represent, and since there is no better proposal being submitted by either the Government or the Opposition, I intend to support the motion as it stands, even though I think it could be greatly improved.  At any rate this is an attempt by the three Deputies concerned, whom I shall describe as the ginger group in Clann na Talmhan, to improve the present situation.  I hope their efforts will meet with success.  I hope that this is only one of many attempts which will be made to ginger up the Government in relation to the importance of the agricultural community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion because we have had even in better times than now, when the Deputies opposite were over here, complaints about the burden cast on the ratepayers. We must remember that all Governments have a little habit of slipping over on the ratepayers every new burden.  Anyone who studies the Health Acts will see what has happened. Anybody who studies the rates will see what has happened.  For some years past the Government has received an enormously increased revenue out of the rates.  Everyone knows that a new problem has been created to-day, namely, the problem of parking the car.  In Cork City the city manager has nightmares trying to find room for cars to park.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What has that to do with the relief of rates on agricultural land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The connection is the income that the State has got out of the extra money the farmer has to find to keep the roads in proper condition for the motorist.  You heard him in this House previously arguing that a thing called a petrol tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will not argue a petrol tax on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting up the argument that this greatly increased burden of rates on the farmers during the past few years is caused by the <Col N="589" /> complete change in traffic, the changeover from the horse and butt to the lorry, the necessity for bringing ordinary country roads up to a standard that will bear these loads. The State derives enormously increased revenue, amounting to some millions each year, out of petrol taxation while on the other hand the ratepayer has to find more money to maintain these roads for the motorist. Every gallon of petrol from which the State derives revenue means further deterioration of the roads.  My argument is that here is a way in which that money can be put to the relief of the farmer.  I hope within the next few weeks, before the debate on this motion has concluded, to have replies from the Department of Finance as to the increased income from petrol and other matters of that description, which will show why our rates are increasing year by year.</P>
      <P>I am not dealing with this matter as a political matter.  When I was on the opposite benches I argued the same thing, when we had our own Government in office.  The burden of rates has become intolerable to the rural community.  There is very little use in Deputy McQuillan endeavouring to divide the team.  Let us get first the reduction and then let us see what we will do.  We know that this year farmers have had a very trying time. Questions were asked here by Deputies on the opposite benches as to the steps the Minister for Agriculture would take to relieve the farmers who had suffered very heavy losses.  Those of us who travel to Dublin by rail or road and see the harvest rotting in the fields cannot help but wonder where the rates are to come from.  The burden will have to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the fault of the ratepayers or of their representatives on local bodies that these burdens are so heavy. They are the result of a system that has crept in where you have government by officials for officials and a complete ignoring of the elected representatives on local authorities.  Yesterday I was present at a meeting on health services in Cork.  I discovered that a conference had been called there of officials from the Department of <Col N="590" /> Health, the county medical officers, some medical gentlemen from the voluntary hospitals and the two county managers to decide how much further the ratepayers should be bled by way of contributing to the medical profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to make a convert.  One convert will be a good deal in this work.  I want to emphasise the absolute necessity for an increased agricultural grant this year.  The first condition we find is that the harvest is gone.  That has been admitted on all sides of the House.  Very severe losses have been suffered in the grain harvest.  Farmers who grow feeding barley have had to bear a reduction in price this year which would amount to more than any grant that the State can give them to pay their rates.  Farmers who were guaranteed a price of 80/- per barrel for wheat are at present getting 30/-per barrel for it, and are glad to get even 30/- for it.  That is a reduction of 50/- per barrel in wheat alone, or £20 an acre of a loss to the farmer, even taking him at a ton per acre. I do not expect city Deputies to realise this and that is why I called for a quorum some time ago, in the hope that some of them would come in and we could educate them a little, but I am afraid they have all gone again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I have not changed my opinion.  We see suggestions now about exporting butter and other products to the British market. How can we expect to compete with the British farmer who has no rates to pay?  Are we not entitled to relief in that respect?  Are we not entitled to have that burden lightened?  That is all we are looking for.</P>
      <P>I suggest that a reasonable request is being made here at a period and in a year when, no matter what side of the House we sit on, we know that farmers will find extreme difficulty in getting the money for the rates.  It was only at the last meeting of our county council that we had councillors of all Parties appealing to the rate collectors to go easy in their collection of rates on account of the conditions in which the farmer finds himself.  This is something which should not be looked at from any political angle at all, and, in view of the fact that the motion has been moved by Deputies on the benches opposite, I suggest that all Parties in the House should come together on this issue and show the farmer that they appreciate the effort he has made to increase production this year, and that they appreciate also the unfortunate position in which he now finds himself, due to that effort to increase production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is a Minister to whom I give credit for having a lot of common sense, who travels the country <Col N="594" /> and sees how things are, who knows that the farmers suffered a loss on their barley.  Even the amount of it that was all right and cut well had to be sold at from £4 to £6 a ton less than the price they got last year.  He knows that as well as I do, and he knows also that there is scarcely one farmer who can say that this year he got top price for his wheat.  There is not one farmer who has not paid, on the moisture content of his wheat, what is known in my country as &ldquo;Dillon's pence&rdquo;.  That is their posi-tion&mdash;they have paid heavily and very heavily.  I know one farmer not four miles from my house and the top price he got for his wheat this year was £17 per ton for the best of it.  That farmer had over 27 acres of wheat and he was depending on it to pay his rates and his merchant's bill.  He might succeed in paying his merchant's bill out of it, but I cannot see how he is going to succeed in paying his rates as well.</P>
    <P>These are the difficulties in which these farmers find themselves this year and that is why I suggest that this motion should be treated, not as a motion by any particular Party, but as a motion which should be considered by all Parties, supported and acceded to, because I want to tell the Minister that, unless some steps are taken, and taken immediately, to relieve the burden on the agricultural community, farmers will not have enough next year to purchase even the seeds.</P>

      <P>At Question Time to-day I asked the Taoiseach the following question:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Taoiseach whether he has seen a report in a provincial newspaper of a speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture in which he is reported as having said that if a change of Government had not taken place a heavy cattle tax would now be in operation which would have completely and for all time killed our cattle export trade, and, if so, if he will state if there is any record in <Col N="595" /> any Department of any proposal by the previous Government to impose a tax on cattle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the report in question appeared in the <i>Roscommon Herald</i>.  The following is the reply which the Taoiseach gave:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have seen the report referred to by the Deputy.  The statement which it attributes to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture appears to be an expression of opinion, based, no doubt, on a statement made in the Seanad by a member of that House who is believed to represent the views of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>There is no record of any decision by the previous Government to impose a tax on cattle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was correct when he replied that there is no record of any decision by the previous Government to impose a tax on cattle because, of course, there was never any such proposal made.  However, I want to deal with the reference, in the Taoiseach's reply, to a member of the Seanad who, the Taoiseach says, is believed to represent the views of the Fianna Fáil Party.  That Senator was dealing with a proposal made earlier in the debate by Senator Johnston who made a suggestion that a levy might be made on exported cattle to create a fund out of which other branches of agriculture might be subsidised.  The proposal was turned down immediately in the same debate by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, who was, of course, speaking for the Government.  Some days later, the then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, said at Limerick: &ldquo;The Government have not the slightest intention of imposing a tax on cattle for export.  No such proposals have been considered or are contemplated.&rdquo;  Will the Taoiseach not now agree that the Head of the Government at the time and the then Minister for Finance were the spokesmen for the Government and should be taken as being the spokesmen for the Government&mdash;and not a member of the Seanad?  Is it too much to ask now&mdash; having got from the Taoiseach a statement <Col N="596" /> that &ldquo;There is no record of any decision by the previous Government to impose a tax on cattle&rdquo;&mdash;that we shall hear no more of this, for which there is no foundation?</P>

      <P>I will tell the Minister. I have it here.  I did not bring the volume down with me.  I have not got the exact reference but I copied it. Referring to this proposal, he said: &ldquo;Somebody has ascribed to me a courage which I do not always feel, but it would not be courage&mdash;it would be foolhardiness&mdash;for any person to bring in a proposal of that sort.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Did the Minister for Finance on that occasion not say that the proposal to put a tax on cattle was one that &ldquo;I have not considered yet but I should like time to examine it&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>He said he would like an opportunity to consider the whole question: it was not a tax on cattle but a proposal by Senator Johnston in which he suggested that a levy might be put on cattle&mdash;which were going at a very high price&mdash;in order to subsidise other branches of agriculture.  The then Minister for Finance said he would like to consider that matter but, in his opinion, it would be foolhardiness and therefore, he turned the matter down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was on the 19th June, 1952.  On the 22nd June, 1952&mdash;during the by-election in Limerick&mdash;the then Head of the Government dealt with the subject and said there was never any such intention. Now that the general election is over, I would ask the Government to ensure that statements for which there is no foundation will not be made.  After all, even if a member of the Seanad makes a remark like that&mdash; even if he were in favour of it&mdash;it was the general scheme suggested by Senator Johnston that appealed to Senator Quirke, not the tax on cattle.  Even if he were in favour of the tax, it would not be correct to ascribe that view to the Fianna Fáil Party because of the fact that the then Toiseach and the <Col N="597" /> then Minister for Finance turned it down.  Whatever purpose such statements by members of the present Government may have served during the general election, they have no purpose now.  I would ask the Taoiseach to ensure that such ill-founded statements will not be made.</P>

      <P>Deputy Boland said that I was correct in saying there is no record of any decision by the previous Government to impose a tax on cattle.  That is correct.  I would, however, draw the attention of the Deputy to the fact that, in my reply to-day, I gave a more favourable answer than his question warranted. He asked me &ldquo;if there is any record in any Department of any proposal by the previous Government to impose a tax on cattle.&rdquo;  The words I want to emphasise now in Deputy Boland's question are &ldquo;if there is any record in any Department of any proposal by the previous Government to impose a tax on cattle.&rdquo;  In my reply I said: &ldquo;There is no record of any decision by the previous Government to impose a tax on cattle.&rdquo;  There was, in fact, a proposal.  However, I thought it better not to make public that matter and I gave the reply that there was no decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a proposal. It was made by the Department of Finance when Deputy Boland was a member of the Government, in a memo dated the 17th January, 1944, <Col N="598" /> to put a tax of £2 per head on cattle. That proposal was put forward by the Minister for Finance to the Government. Of course, the Government did not accept it.  Therefore, I said that there was no decision.  I let the Deputy down rather easily&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when I did not say that there was a proposal.  That would have been a sufficient answer. However, now that the Deputy has raised the matter to-day and repeated, perhaps inadvertently a few moments ago, that never was any such proposal made, I may say that a proposal was made by the Minister for Finance to the Deputy's Government on the date I mentioned but it was not accepted by the Government.  Having made that perfectly clear I now want to say that the Constitution of this country guarantees the right of free speech to everybody.</P>

      <P>Persons are free to express their opinions.  They may do so perhaps on insufficient data.  It is the duty of people who do not agree with them to expose that and to demonstrate to the electors or anybody listening to them that the opinions are ill-founded.  That is free speech. Everybody is entitled to his opinion. It may be a wrong opinion.  The statements may be wrong.  However, if it is an opinion on a certain matter&mdash; that if a change of Government had not taken place something would have happened&mdash;a Deputy is entitled to say that because it is his opinion.  That may be his opinion.  It may be still his opinion in spite of what I have said.  Deputies apparently want me to go around looking up reports every day and to say this, that and the other because the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, said one thing and the Minister for Finance said something else, that that must be accepted and put an end to all discussion.  The Deputy is entitled to say if there had not been a change of Government such and such a thing might have taken place.</P>

That is not my job.
