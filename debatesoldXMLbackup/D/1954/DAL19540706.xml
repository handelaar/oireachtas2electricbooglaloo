      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of providing a service between Rossaveal and the Aran Islands was considered some time ago as a possible alternative to the Galway-Aran service.  I understand, however, that the depth of water at Rossaveal is sufficient only for a few hours each side of high tide to accommodate a vessel of the kind needed to cater for the Aran service. I understand that to enable any regular service to be operated safely between Rossaveal and the Aran Islands, <Col N="1167" /> even on a shifting time-table dependent on the tide, would necessitate the provision of navigational facilities and the execution of certain minimum works at Rossaveal at a cost of £60,000-£100,000.  To enable a regular daily service to be operated independent of the tide, it would be necessary to construct a proper harbour with adequate depth alongside the pier and in the approach channel.  Because of the rock bottom at Rossaveal the cost of providing sufficient depth at low water to accommodate a vessel of 8 ft. 6 in. draught would be of the order of £100,000.  The Deputy will appreciate that in the circumstances the provision of the daily return service suggested by him would be altogether impracticable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it necessary to have these deep-water facilities for a motor-boat which would give a daily service?  Is it necessary to spend £60,000 on putting that pier further out into the sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton:</NameTxt>
      <P>To provide a service between Aran and Rossaveal comparable with the services provided between Aran and Galway would necessitate the carrying out of these alterations, especially if transport of the same kind and capacity as operates between Aran and Galway is desired. It is considered that it would be quite impossible to provide the equivalent of the Aran-Galway service with the facilities now available at Rossaveal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is no need whatever to provide exactly the same facilities between Aran and Rossaveal as between Galway and the Aran Islands? There is no need for transport arrangements for cattle, etc., to be made available from Rossaveal to the islands but merely a transport service to carry people and mails back and fourth on a daily basis between Rossaveal and the islands.  That would not necessitate the expenditure suggested by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is asking for detailed information in relation to a recent appointment by Cork County Council which I am not in a position to give him since it is not available in my Department, nor indeed would it be proper for my Department to seek information on some of these points. I can say, however, that this appointment was made following a review by a selection board set up locally of applications received in response to public advertisement.  I am informed also that the name of the successful candidate was circulated to all members of the Cork County Council when the appointment was made and also that it was notified to the secretary of the Waterford County Council.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the Deputy's implication that the normal procedure general to appointments of this nature was not followed.  The only name submitted to my Department was that of the successful candidate and no objecttion was seen to the appointment.  The local authority was so informed on 5th April last.</P>

    <P>The Council met at the request of the Minister for Health at 11 a.m. on 23rd April and on 25th June.  I am also aware that they met of their own volition at 3.30 p.m. on 30th April, on 7th, 10th and 28th of May, and on 11th June, making seven meetings in all since 1st April.</P>
    <P>I regret that I cannot give the names of the members present at each meeting, since this information is recorded only in the council's private records.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. O. Flanagan):</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on Friday last, I had dealt with sub-head E (5)&mdash; International Fisheries Convention&mdash; and had made an observation on sub-head F (1)&mdash;Grants to Boards of Conservators and Local Authorities&mdash;and <Col N="1180" /> had gone on to deal with some of the activities of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara. I had pointed out that this board distributes fish in five centres&mdash;Dublin, Cork, Killybegs, Dingle and Galway&mdash; and was dealing with the question of the inshore boats which had been handicapped in the past because, owing to weather conditions, they cannot fish regularly and keep up supplies. To meet this difficulty, the board has brought into operation three deep-sea fishing boats and they intend to build in the near future two 80-feet motor fishing vessels.  The engines have already been purchased and plans for construction are well advanced.</P>
      <P>The addition to the fishing fleet of increasing numbers of vessels which can spend a few days at a time fishing away from port has given rise to serious difficulties regarding supplies of ice, without which the catch cannot be landed in satisfactory condition.  To meet this growing demand, the board proposes to erect two ice making plants, each with a capacity of about 50 tones a week, from which ice can be supplied to ports where fish is landed, even in relatively small quantities, and kept available in ice stores for use as required.</P>
      <P>The board has brought into successful operation a pilot fish meal plant at Killybegs and its immediate plans include the erection of a further full-scale fish meal plant at a cost of £12,000.  The operation of such production plants to deal with occasional surplus catches and to provide a market for coarse varieties of fish not suitable for the table is well recognised as an essential adjunct to a thriving fishing industry. There is considerable scope for development in this direction, not only by implementation of the plans in mind by the board, but also through the initiative of private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards inland fisheries, the output of salmon and trout in 1953 was of the same order as that for 1952, both being somewhat below average.  The runs of large spring fish were generally disappointing, but this was compensated for, to some extent, by fairly satisfactory grilse runs in most areas. The number of salmon taken by rod and line was greater than in 1952, but <Col N="1181" /> the total weight was somewhat less. This result may be attributed to the reduced captures of large spring fish in the early salmon rivers.  The rod catch of sea trout showed an improvement of 10 per cent. on the previous year's figures.  The total exports of salmon in 1953 were valued at £666,000 as compared with £638,000 in 1952.</P>
    <P>Climatic conditions during the autumn and early winter of 1953 favoured the operation of stripping stations for the artificial propagation of salmon and trout.  Although spawning was somewhat later than in previous years, close on 500,000 salmon ova were distributed to applicants, chiefly angling associations.  The home output of brown trout ova was supplemented by 350,000 imported ova and a total of 1,200,000 was available for distribution.</P>
    <P>Provision for Grants-in-Aid to the Inland Fishery Trust stands at £10,000, an increase of £2,240 over that provided last year.  This body has made great strides in developing the fisheries which have come under its control and I am glad to say that, in its work, it has received full co-operation and enthusiastic support from anglers' clubs throughout the country.  The bulk of the fisheries which have come to the trust are vested in the E.S.B. and the Land Commission, without whose co-operation the progress so far achieved would not have been possible.  It is gratifying to mention that four fisheries suitable for development have been donated to the trust by private owners, whose public spirited action in this matter must be gratefully acknowledged.</P>
    <P>To sum up the position, the total amount which it is desired to provide from public funds for the purpose of the fisheries administration in the current year comes to £295,320.  The gross expenditure provided for in the Estimates now presented to the House comes to £145,320 and the advances for capital purposes proposed to be sought from the Central Fund amount to, as already stated, £150,000.  The receipts or Appropriations-in-Aid expected to come to hand in the Fisheries Vote amount to £37,720, leaving the no <Col N="1182" /> expenditure envisaged on fisheries services at £257,600.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that I am quite new to this office and cannot be expected to display the same results of experience as my predecessor has done in some respects, but I can assure the House that I am willing to receive and note carefully and sympathetically any observations or recommendations Deputies on both sides may have to make in their efforts to improve the fishing industry.</P>

      <P>Ní gá aon fhaitíos a bheith ar an Rúnaí Parlaiminte i dtaobh ceal eolais a bheith aige ar chúrsaí iascaigh.  Fiú amháin dá mbéadh sé in oifig níos mó ná mí amháin, ní dóigh liom go gcuirfeadh aon duine ar an dtaobh seo de Tigh i sáinn é agus níl sé de rún agamsa é sin a dhéanamh inniu. B'fhearr liom ibhfad, dá bhféadfainn é, an Rúnaí Parlaiminte a chur ar an eolas i dtaobh rudaí a thárla fé mo bhráid féin.  B'fhéidir go bhféadfainn roint comhairle a thabhairt dó de bhárr an tréimhse a chaith mé féin fé na dualgaisí chéanna.  Ár ndóigh, tá cunntas iomlán léite amach ag an Rúnaí Parlaiminte, an dul chun cinn atá le tuairisciú aige fé beagnach chuile rud.  Caithfidh sé féin, mar a déanaim féin, an creidiúnt a thabhairt don Bhord Iascaigh Mhara de bhárr cuid mhaith den dul chun cinn sin, go mór mhór chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le h-iascach fairrge. Tá foireann mhaith Stát-Sheirbhísigh sa Roinn freisin agus dualgas díreach orthu sin i dtaobh cúrsaí iascaigh intíre&mdash;agus is maith ann é.  Is maith cleachtach agus stuamdha ar an obair iad agus a shliocht ar sa chunntas atá léite amach ag an Rúnaí Parlaiminte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is iontach go deo an spéis atá dá chur i gcúrsaí iascaigh ó ceannaíodh na trí báid atá fé stiúrú díreach an Bhoird Iascaigh Mhara.  Ár ndóigh, roimhe sin bhíodh na díoltóirí, na hiascairí agus dreamanna eile a bhfuil lámh istigh aca i tionscal an iascaigh, ag cur anuas go minic ar an gComhlachas Iascaigh Mhara&mdash;an tainm a bhí ortha an t-am sin roimh Acht 1952  Ó tháinig an réim nua faoin <Col N="1183" /> Acht, cuireadh dhá dhream ar bun&mdash; an Bord Iascaigh Mhara, an dream a bhfuil an chomhacht feidhmiúcháin aca; agus an Comhlachas Iascaigh Mhara, an dream a bhfuil dualgas comhairlíoch ortha.  Níl ar an gComhlachas ach daoine a bhfuil lámh istigh aca i gné éigin den iascach, bíodh siad in a mion-díoltóirí nó mór-díoltóirí nó ag sailiú éisc nó in a n-iascairí.  Tá cead aca bheith sa Chomhlachas sin nó tá cead ag chuile dream a bhaineas leis an iascaireacht ionadaí a bheith aca ar choiste an Chomhlachais.  Bíonn siad san ag clamhsán i ngeall ar dhaoine a bheith ar an mBord nach slí maireachtála acu an iascaireacht nó aon chuid den iascaireacht.</P>
    <P>'Sé mo thuairim é&mdash;agus 'sé tuairim go leor daoine eile, go mór mhór ar imeallbhord an Iarthair&mdash;gur fearr mar bhord dream ar bith nach bhfuil an iascaireacht nó díol an éisc mar shlí bheatha aca ná daoine a bheadh ag cur cis as an lathaigh dóibh fhéin. Is iomdha sin caint a chuala mé féin, ó na hiascairí bochta san Iarthar, chomh dona is a roinn na díoltóirí céanna leo sul a raibh aon Chomhlachas ann.  Anois ós rud é go bhfuil comhthrom na Féinne dá dhéanamh ar na hiascairí, go mór mhór na hiascairí bochta nach bhfuil i ngar do Bhaile Átha Cliath tá na díoltóirí beagnach ar fad anuas ar an Stát.  Bíonn siad ag cáineadh Roinn an Iascaigh agus an Rialtais, agus bíonn siad ag iarraidh cur i gcéill go bhfuil &ldquo;nationalisation&rdquo; ar bun ar an iascaireacht.</P>
    <P>Bhí se de phribhléid agamsa bheith ar an gcéad cruinniú den Chomhlachas nua agus mhínigh mé ann an scéim a bhí leagtha amach agam chun an tiasc a dháileadh ar fud na tíre níos éifeachtúla ná mar a bhí an scéal go dtí sin.  Ón lá sin anuas thug mé fé deara, sa pháipéar sin atá á chur amach ag an gComhlachas, go rabh siad im aghaidh agus go rabh siad in aghaidh an Bhoird Iascaigh Mhara a chuireadh ar bun.  Cuireadh mo chaint isteach sa bpáipéar agus in ionad an focal &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; a dúirt mé, chuireadar &ldquo;nationalisation&rdquo; isteach.  Chuireadar cogar i <Col N="1184" /> gcluais go leor daoine mór-le-rá sa tír go bhfuil chuile chomhacht dá thabhairt anonn ag an Stáit maidir leis an iascach agus go mór mhór an iascach mhara.  Tá páipéar annso agam go bhfuil scéal tugtha síos ar chaint a rinne Easbog sa Deisceart.  Tá me lánchinnte nach raibh fhios ag an Easbog so fén scéal&mdash;gidh go raibh sé ag caint chomh fírinneach agus a d'fhéad sé&mdash;ach go díreach mar cuireadh isteach in a chluais é.  Do cuireadh ar a n-eolas ceart é i leith na cainte a chur sé dhe, ach ní fhaca mé aon scéal ar an bpáipéar sin ag bréagnú na cainnte.</P>
    <P>Tá me ag caint mar seo leis an Rúnaí Parlaiminte a chur ar a aire in aghaidh na daoine a mbíonn sé de ghaisce acu i gcomhnaí go bhfuil chuile saghas eolais acu ar an iascaireacht.  Pé brigh faoi gairme agus faoi ceárdanna eile, 'sé mo thuairm fhéin gur fearr i bhfad daoine nach bhfuil an t-iascaireacht mar slí bheatha aca a chur ag feidhmiú na gcumhacht atá rithte san Act 1952, agus ina theannta sin dream comhairleach ar nós an Chomhlachais agus ar nós na Roinne a bheith ann le iad spreagadh agus le iad a stopadh go minic nuair bheidh siad ag dul ro-fhada.</P>
    <P>Tá chuile muinighin agamsa as an mBord agus as an bhfoirinn atá aca. Tá trácht air sa chúntas a léigh an Rúnaí Parlaiminte amach.  Tá dul chun cinn déanta i dtaobh na mbád atá ag dul amach; tá dul chun cinn sa mhéid iasc atá curtha ar an margadh; tá dul chun cinn déanta ar an airgead atá le fagháil ag na h-iascairi agus trid is trid is féidir a rá go bhfuil rath ag teacht ar thionscal an iascai.</P>
    <P>Is minic a deirtear agus a scriobhtar comhairle don Roinn, comhairle don Bhord agus comhairle don Dáil atá i n-aghaidh a chéile.  Feicfidh tú litreacha ins na bpaipéiri a rá go bhfuil sé chó ceart againne an oiread iasc a mharbhadh agus a chur ar an margadh le tír ar bith eile i n-iarthar Eorpa agus, ar an lámh eile den scéal, gheobhaidh na h-udaráis comhairle ó na daoine atá i n-ainm a bheith ag cainnt ar son na n-iascairí a rá go bhfuil an iomarca báid dá chur amach. Bionn siad ag cleamhsán faoi ganntanas éisc ar an margadh, faoi an praghas a <Col N="1185" /> bheith ro-árd ar na daoine bochta agus, san am céadna, bionn daoine ag eleamhsán faoi iasc ar bith a leigint isteach thar saile don tír seo.  Bhéadh an Rúnaí Parlaiminte, nó fear ar bith eile a bhéadh 'na áit, ar nós an fhir agus an asail ag iarraidh comhairle 'chuile dhuine a dhéanamh agus sa deireadh thiar thall ní shásodh sé aon duine.  Mar sin, táim ag tabhairt comhairle don Rúnaí Parlaiminte an chainnt seo a thógaint le grainne salainn agus a intinn fhéin a dhéanamh suas tar eis comhairle a ghlacadh le na h-oifigí sa Roinn agus leis an mBord.  Ar ndóigh, bhéadh sé i n-aghaidh nádúra an duine dá dtabharfadh na daoine a bhfuil an t-iascaireacht mar slí maireachtála aca comhairle dó nach mbéadh ar mhaithe leo féin.  Má tá lámh istigh agat feicfidh tú chuige nach ngortófar an lámh istigh má tá neart ar bith agat air.</P>
    <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an ráiteas atá léite ag an Rúnaí Parlaiminte.  Teasbánann sé go bhfuil tús maith déanta ag an Bord nua.

Na h-iascairí a bhfuil báid mhaithe aca, tá siad ag déanamh go maith astu. Ní'l fhios agam an bhfuil aon tsaghas eile oibre i n-Eirinn a bhfuil luach saothair chó maith le fáil as ná mar atá le fáil ag iascairí atá ag obair leis na báid atá dhá soláthair anois.

Bhí cabhlach maith bád iascaireachta in san áit sin agus tá eolas a gcéirde ag iascairí na háite sin agus níorbh aon ionadh é gur thosnaigh an Bord Iascaigh Mhara in áit den tsaghas sin le haghaidh na nua-phróiseanna, fuar-stóráil, cursaí deatachaithe agus mion-éisc a dhéanamh. Ní dóigh liom go bhféadfaidis tosnú in áit níos oiriúnaí ná na Cealla Beaga.  Fé mar a léi mé i gceann de na páipéirí a chuir An Comhlachas Iascaigh Mhara amach, ní fíor gur chuir siad a gcuid uibheacha go léir in san aon chiseán amháin.  Tá sé beartaithe acu, fé mar do léi an Rúnaí Parlaiminte amach, dul chuncinn leis an obair sin ar fuaid an chósta. Is sé mo thuairm féin gurb shin é an fá go bhfuil na mór-díoltóirí anuas ar pholasaí na Roinne agus anois ionnsaíonn siad gach rud a dheineann sí.  Tá paipéir agam annseo&mdash;<i>Irish <Col N="1187" /> Fishing and Fish Trades Gazette</i>&mdash;dár dáta an 3ú Túil, 1954&mdash;agus deir sé:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Obviously the boat-building must have been conducted at a profit or at a loss&mdash;but the report does not indicate which.  It is hard to understand why the board should enter this industry of boat-building, at all, in competition with old-established private firms which enjoy the greatest goodwill in the fishing community.  If it costs the board money to do so, this phase of its operations becomes more incomprehensible still.  Perhaps this riddle will be cleared up in the board's next report, which must now be in an advanced state of preparation.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I say anything of a general character about this Estimate, there are two matters I raised recently with the Parliamentary Secretary.  One of these matters was the export duty of 2d. per lb. imposed on salmon last year.  That, in my opinion, was wrong.  The real trouble is the delay caused in the handling of the fish for export.  As everybody knows, you cannot wrap salmon for export in tissue paper.  The salmon have to be packed in cases.  Of course, the fishermen weigh the salmon and give the actual weight of the fish in the boxes.  When the cases are brought to the customs station the boxes have to be opened again and the fish reweighed in order to get an accurate return.  Therefore, they are held up for so long that they miss the connection for transport to the London market and are then delivered in Dublin in a second or third-class condition. Of course, that is a serious loss to the exporters.  The disputes about the weighing of boxes containing fish when they arrive at the customs station are a serious matter so far as the export trade is concerned.</P>
      <P>The carrying companies are gravely perturbed about the matter.  Naturally they are anxious that merchandise handed to them should be dispatched as efficiently as possible. Naturally, again, when things go wrong it is the transport company that is blamed whereas the transport company has really nothing to do in the matter.  This is a contract between the fishermen on the one hand and the customs officials on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now there is a serious disadvantage arising through the impost of 2d. per lb. on the export of salmon.  I have had no definite intimation as yet from the Government, but I hope that an end will be put to this as speedily as possible.  I do not believe the sum of <Col N="1189" /> money involved is a very large one but the injury done to the quality of the fish delivered to the London market and the loss resulting from that injury falls on the unfortunate fisherman.</P>
    <P>That is the serious aspect of this matter.  I objected to this impost as vigorously as I could when it was introduced.  To-day, I object even more strongly to it because of the complications that follow through the holding up of the fish and the unnecessary handling of the fish, together with disputes about the weight of the particular fish.  It would be a simple matter if one could rush up a consignment of salmon to a customs station under one's arm, put it on the scales and weigh it there and then. Unfortunately, it is not as easy as that.  Fish must not be injured.  If they are manhandled in transport their subsequent marketability is affected on the London market.  Any injury to the dead fish affects the price.  Those who buy high-priced fish are entitled to get it in first-class condition; if they do not get it in first-class condition they will not take it.</P>
    <P>About three weeks ago I put down a question to the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to herrings landed on the coast of Donegal in November, December and January last.  My information is that these herrings were landed at Kincasslagh and were then taken by lorry some 30 or 40 miles to Downings, where they were cleaned, cured and packed.  If that information is correct, why were these herrings taken all the way to Downings for the purpose of packing them there, causing serious injury to the quality of the fish because of unnecessary handling?  What was the purpose?  What was the cost involved by the time the fish were ready for the market?  Of course, when the fish were ready for the market there was apparently no market for them and they have been lying out in the open ever since, a disgrace to the whole organisation that deals with our fisheries.  Surely it should have been possible to find a market for them some place instead of leaving them to decay there.  I am puzzled as to why <Col N="1190" /> this fish could not have been distributed to the trade all over the country.  It is a very sound business motto to &ldquo;cut your losses&rdquo;; it is better to get something rather than to get nothing.  Why were these fish cured at all?  Why were they purchased unless there was a prospect of a market for them?  Was it a mere whim that gave rise to this situation?</P>
    <P>We hear talk here and elsewhere about the fishing industry being potentially the second most important industry in this country.  Yet, down in Donegal there are 1,100 half barrels and 100 barrels lying on the beach at Downings under all sorts of weather for the last six months.  It makes one despair about this industry.  I almost feel ashamed of speaking about it but, having constituents interested in fishing, I cannot completely ignore it, much as I would like to do so.</P>
    <P>The statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary to-day is the usual stereotyped statement that leads nowhere. I will be told, of course, that we are not a fish-eating people.  I would like to know how anybody can eat something that they cannot get. Outside of Dublin, where will one get fish?  The Irish people cannot eat fish because they cannot get it.  Why were these herrings not distributed during the season of Lent all over the country instead of being allowed to rot on the beach at Downings?  I am sure a reasonably good price could have been got for that fish, a price which would have given a profit ultimately.</P>
    <P>The fishing areas around our coasts are becoming denuded of people and in another 20 or 50 years there will not be a solitary working fisherman in one of these areas.  For years one particular area in my constituency had been asking for accommodation for the fishermen for the purpose of landing their catches.  At every general election one, two or three engineers went down to Donegal, probably to catch the votes of these poor unfortunate people.  About a month or six weeks ago a final declaration was made that the cost of the proposed work would be too expensive.  Was it not obvious the very first day that the cost of the work would be too expensive? <Col N="1191" /> Surely it was not necessary to wait until 1954 to inform the unfortunate people of the final decision.</P>
    <P>These men are now without any hope for the future.  There is no shelter for their boats from the north and north west winds.  We are told in April, 1954, that the project is too dear and the Department could not accept it.  Is it any wonder that the young men are flying as quickly as they can to Birmingham, Coventry and Cardiff where they become an asset to the community in which they live?  Is the saving of our own people not worth £100,000 or £200,000?  Money is wasted in other directions, spent in directions in which it is of no use to the community. As a matter of fact in some instances it is demoralising to the community.</P>
    <P>I have spoken before on the development and the marketing of the produce of the fishing industry on a rational basis.  Everybody knows that in the main, outside the City of Dublin, one cannot procure fish in this country.  I suggested before that the Department should secure insulated vans that would take delivery of the fish at the ports and deliver it in the principal towns of the country.  The fish should be taken in that way from the various fishing ports along the west and east coast and delivered throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin:</NameTxt>
      <P>One would think from what is said here that this country was as big as America.  I imagine that half a dozen such vans would be able to do the entire country.  Now, we are told that we have two.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, who I believe was born inland, that he should apply his organising and business ability to the making of a real approach to this matter of providing efficient transport so that the fish can <Col N="1192" /> be delivered in all parts of the country. The fish should be taken from the fishing ports in insulated vans and delivered in the principal towns, and then, in some other way, to the neighbouring small towns and villages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would be a simple and practical way of getting over the present difficulty.  It would also mean getting the people back to the practice of consuming fish.  In order to do that, it will be necessary, I think, to engage in an advertising campaign. There should not be any difficulty about that because at the moment we have two organisations dealing with hotels and catering places.  Use could also be made of the menu cards which are to be found on hotel tables by having some catchy phrase on them such as &ldquo;Eat more fish&rdquo;.  That, I suggest, would be a method of encouraging people to eat more fish.  It would also be necessary to give people the assurance that fresh fish in perfect condition will at times be available for them.  Unless something on these lines is done the position will remain as it is.  There is no use in anybody coming into this House and making statements year after year which lead nowhere. There are districts in my constituency where the fishing industry is dying out. Down through the centuries the predecessors of the people living in those areas to-day made their living out of the industry and, curiously enough, they did that without any Government aid.  During the period when the Congested Districts Board was in existence, it did give them some considerable help.  The position to-day is that the industry is in a state of decay.  The young men will not engage in it and they are right.  What encouragement is there for them?  In Downings, their fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers were able to make a living out of the industry, but what encouragement is there for the men of to-day when they see perhaps 1,000 barrels of herrings rotting on the beach?  The fish is there but it cannot be sold.  In that situation, what is the use of all the blatherskite and hypocrisy there is about the fishing industry being our second largest industry?  It makes one squirm <Col N="1193" /> to have to sit and listen to that.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to do something to correct that situation.  He has the opportunity now of doing something not for himself but for the country, and I hope that he will not fail the country or the people in those areas along the coast in the performance of the task that lies before him.  I wish him every luck in tackling this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I say anything about the fishing industry, I want, first of all, to refer to the condition of the harbours, particularly in the North County Dublin portion of my constituency.  I am only too well aware of the neglect that there has been of our fishing harbours.  It is a matter on which I have been making representations over almost 11 years.  I should like to see the present Parliamentary Secretary getting control not only of the fishing boats but of the harbours as well.  I made representations of this kind to the previous Government and to his predecessor, and I am doing so again on this Estimate.  I believe that it is not only the duty of the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department, and of the board, to supply boats but to look after the harbours as well. Although I have been making representation on these lines for years, I must confess that I have got nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the harbours in my area, I have got promises.  Inspections have also been carried out.  In Loughshinny harbour, we have one of the best fishing fleets in North County Dublin, but the boats can only stay in the harbour during three months of the year.  They have to go to Skerries for the remaining nine months, and, even in the case of that harbour, if a coal boat comes in, the fishing boats have to go out.  In my opinion, if we want to do anything really serious about the fishing industry we will have to give the Parliamentary Secretary charge of the harbours. Otherwise his task is going to be a hopeless one.  His predecessor, Deputy Bartley, did his best for me. He had inspections carried out and he tried to get the harbours improved.  He sent his officers there to see what could be done.  The Dublin County Council is in control of Loughshinny harbour; the <Col N="1194" /> Board of Works is in control of Howth harbour, while the Port and Docks Board is in charge of the harbours at Skerries and Balbriggan.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the Parliamentary Secretary is just a cockle shell in troubled waters.  We may make representations to him across the floor of the House, and then find that he is not in absolute control of the harbours.  My opinion is that nothing really worth while can be done about the fishing industry until the Parliamentary Secretary is given control over the harbours along the coast.  There are a few coal boats going into Balbriggan, and a few to Skerries but nothing to Loughshinny, and just a few to Howth, but if we are to be serious about our fishing industry I believe that this is a very urgent matter and it is a very sad reflection on us that after 11 years I have still to talk about the neglect of our harbours here.  That goes for all Parties in this House.  When you go to meet these fishermen you have nothing for them and they say: &ldquo;You might as well not come here at all: you are only joking,&rdquo; notwithstanding the fact that I was absolutely sincere every time I met these men, but I was frustrated with every representation I made.  I was told that Dublin County Council would give so much, that the Department of Agriculture would give so much more.  There was a row going on before as to whether the boats should go into Loughshinny or whether they should go into Skerries, but now both harbours are in a very bad way and ill-suited to receive fishing boats or anything else such as the landing of fish.  I cannot make that point too strongly because the time to do something practical about it is long overdue.</P>
    <P>We have another harbour at Rush which silted up so badly with blowing sand that boats could not come in there and the fishermen gave up and went to get other jobs.  When they did that, the sand was cleaned out but then there were no fishermen.</P>
    <P>While I am speaking in this strain, I am not saying a word against any Parliamentary Secretary because the only thing wrong was that the official <Col N="1195" /> whether it was the Parliamentary Secretary or the Department of Fisheries that was in charge was in charge only of boats and not of harbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful but it was the only point I wanted to stress and I am delighted to have got an opportunity of stressing it.  I would like to say finally to the Parliamentary Secretary: your job will be hopeless if you do not have more power than you have.  Whether it means legislation or not, I am dealing with the fishing industry and anything I say refers to the fishing industry that I am concerned with in my own constituency.</P>
      <P>With reference to the boats&mdash;we have 50-foot boats for fishing for North County Dublin and the fishermen are anxious to do their best.  They are anxious to take advantage of every opportunity they get for fishing.  They have a number of grievances from time to time.  They would not be human otherwise&mdash;and they want protection. I am all for protection of inshore fishermen.  If we cannot encourage inshore fishermen to do better, to catch more fish and put them on the market at more competitive prices, then the fishing industry as we know it in this country, will completely disappear.  There are a number of families traditionally associated with fishing over hundreds of years and the last speaker made one point with which I thoroughly agree when he said that what has happened our fishing industry is this: that a number of our people have been faced with buying fish that has been tainted and as a result of that&mdash; they were &ldquo;caught&rdquo; once or twice&mdash; they said: &ldquo;We will buy something else&rdquo;.  That is what turned many of our people against purchasing fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way in which that can be <Col N="1196" /> remedied is by ensuring that as well as having fresh fish in Dublin we will be able to provide means of transport to transfer the fish in good condition to the inland towns.  On many occasions I have had numerous complaints about the condition of the fish in such towns because it is not properly handled when it is sent down the country and the people do not like to buy it when it is in a bad state.  I believe the only way to change that is to do as the previous Parliamentary Secretary did &mdash; provide quick freezing and transportation of the fish to be sent to the large inland towns so that it will arrive in proper condition.  Otherwise the fish industry will slowly decline.  Our inshore fishermen have but one market here and if there is a glut in the Dublin market they have no other place to send the fish unless they have a few friends down the country to whom they might chance sending it.</P>
    <P>I am all for private enterprise, but I believe that in order to put the fishing industry back on the map, we have to go a long way beyond private enterprise and call for State enterprise. In doing that, so far as fishing is concerned, I mean ensuring that the fish will be put on the market in inland towns in proper condition and so encourage people to become fish-minded again.  Many of our people think it is a penance to eat fish because it was not supplied in proper condition and they have turned against it.  It was the manner in which it was handled that was responsible for that.  We have to try to get away from that outlook which has grown up over a long number of years because of the manner in which fish had been handled.  While there are many large wholesalers of fish in the country who might be able to do this they feel perhaps that they are doing all right here in Dublin and able to make a living and are reluctant to go beyond that.  Then, the fish that is sent to hospitals and institutions is often tainted and that should not be the case.</P>
    <P>I say here that we want to make our people eat more fish and to do this it will have to be handled properly.  That <Col N="1197" /> means more intervention of State enterprise.  Fishing is a valuable industry to our country: other countries have proved its value and we here in Ireland have, I must say, a very long way to go before we can really say we have a fishing industry.  We are only at the tail of things and we have a long journey to go and in order to achieve our aim the only thing that can be done is to give the Parliamentary Secretary more money and power to carry out his job.</P>
    <P>The previous Parliamentary Secretary started to introduce the quick freezing plant but unfortunately he was not long enough there to carry out the ideas he had to improve the fishing industry.  We have had reports from time to time about the fish-meal factories that have been established in other countries.  Here we are importing fish-meal, and if we can see our way, with the improvement of our inshore fisheries, we could perhaps establish a factory to make fish-meal here.  This would be very welcome to the fishermen of the country and to the people as a whole.  It would be another advance towards trying to produce things in this country that we are in a position to produce and avoid having to pay foreign labour to do what we can do ourselves.</P>
    <P>We are importing a lot of canned fish of all kinds into this country.  I know we have got a long way to go, but if we had a canning industry here we would be able to can some of the fish we require ourselves instead of having to import it and pay foreign labour for doing things we should be in a position to do.</P>
    <P>These are practical things that I have repeatedly referred to in this House during the debate on fisheries. I know these schemes cannot be taken up overnight but I nevertheless feel that we should be further advanced after all the years of native government we have had here.  I must say we have advanced a good deal in giving our people better boats.  I remember 31 years ago when we had small boats fishing from some of the harbours that have 50-foot boats now.  I know the difficulties that the officials of the <Col N="1198" /> Department had in encouraging people to get larger boats.  Now that the people realise the advantage of larger boats they want better harbours to accommodate them and more luck to them.  The natural trend is to encourage our people to go more out to sea and to catch a greater variety of fish.  I want to say to our inshore fishermen that the more varied the supply of fish they land, the better chance they will have of making a living.  Unfortunately, they sometimes land a type of fish of which there is a glut on the Dublin market. Then they have no way of disposing of them unless An Bord Iascaigh Mhara buys them and dumps them, unless they can otherwise dispose of them.  If we had more quick freezing plants or a canning industry we would be in a position to help these people to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>Another grievance which I have often stressed before arises from the condition under which the hire purchase system is operated.  I think that fishermen of good standing should not be obliged to pay down initially so much of the purchase price because that condition is deterring many good fishermen from acquiring boats.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary may say that if a man is worth his salt, he will have sufficient money to enable him to put down the required amount but there are many good fishermen who owing to circumstances over which they have no control, cannot get sufficient money to make the initial deposit even though the fisherman is allowed to pay for the boat as he earns.</P>
    <P>I know that the previous Parliamentary Secretary was very charitably disposed towards these people, and I must say that I have had the same experience with the present Parliamentary Secretary, but I do feel that if a little more leniency were shown or a little more help given to these struggling people it would be a very great help to them.  The complaints I receive come from people whose fathers and grandfathers were fishermen before them.  Through no fault of their own, they are not able to pay the initial deposit required and in that way they are prevented from carrying on an occupation which has been traditional <Col N="1199" /> in their families.  I come from a part of the country where there are a number of islands off the coast and on these islands there was quite a number of fishermen when I was a child.  These people have since left the islands and gone to England and America.  I say that in a locality where you have good fishermen who are anxious to get larger boats they should get every encouragement possible, because, so far as I can see, if the decline in the fishing industry is allowed to go on unchecked, especially having regard to the fact that people down the country are no longer inclined to eat fish, in 20 years' time there will be no fishermen left. Many of them have taken up other occupations.  Any encouragement which we can give them to remain in the fishing industry should not be withheld, and I think we should give the Parliamentary Secretary all the power and all the money he needs to develop the industry to the greatest possible extent.</P>

      <P>I should like to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary the question of the transport of fish in the West of Ireland, and when I say &ldquo;the West,&rdquo; I mean the whole coast line down as far as Kerry.  The position at the moment is, as we know, that C.I.E. has to get 12 hours' notice if they are to provide lorries for fishermen. We know that time or tide waits for no man, and now I think we can say the same of the C.I.E.  They are not prepared to provide a lorry unless they get 12 hours' notice.  I suggest that representations should be made to C.I.E. with a view to getting them to provide more facilities for our fishermen. This is a matter that the Parliamentary Secretary should take up with C.I.E., if fishing in the West is to be made an economic proposition.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to make a note of the points I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a constituency where fishing was formerly a very important industry, I think it would not be right for me to allow this Estimate to pass without making a few brief comments.  First <Col N="1200" /> of all, I am very glad to see in charge of the Department of Fisheries, a man like the present Parliamentary Secretary, a young, active man with energy and push behind him.  I believe that under Deputy Flanagan's control of the Department much benefit will accrue to the fishermen of this country. I have great faith and confidence in him.  He has displayed his energy in this House over the past nine or ten years and represented his own constituents in a very capable way and I believe that if he puts the same vigour into the Department of Fisheries the condition of the average fisherman will be very much better.</P>
      <P>Fishermen have been neglected in the past.  I have had complaints every day from fishermen throughout the West Cork constituency, an area where fishing was always recognised as the second most important industry.  It is indeed very painful to see sons of old fishermen compelled to emigrate to England and other countries while the industry is on the decline and very much on the decline.  Similarly people living on the islands off the West Cork coast&mdash;and I believe this is typical of the position throughout the country&mdash; have no alternative but to emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is rather difficult to rectify that position.  It has been put to me by many fishermen that the main havoc to the industry arises from the presence off our coasts of foreign trawlers.  Off the West Cork coast we have trawlers, from Spain mainly, almost every day of the week.  The three mile limit seems to be no deterrent whatever to them.  It is the general complaint amongst fishermen in many places that these people come close in to the coast without any regard for the three mile limit and take away whatever fish is available.  I think that more power should be given to the Fishery Department to enable them to have vessels capable of dealing with these foreigners going around the coastline.  I raised a question here a few years ago as to the possibility of increasing the three mile limit.  Many fishermen feel that it would be a marked advantage if the limit could be increased to six miles.  That <Col N="1201" /> probably is a major issue as it raises an international question but from information I have received of late, I believe that the limit has been increased in Norway and in one or two other countries.  If that is the position I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to inquire as to the possibility of increasing the limit to six miles in this country.  As I say it would be a marked advantage to fishermen all round our coasts.</P>
    <P>The second obstacle with which the fishermen have to contend is the fact that they are forced to &ldquo;make do&rdquo; with ill-equipped boats.  Unfortunately, most of these men have very little capital and they cannot invest in new boats which are, indeed, very costly. The price of any fair type of boat is in the region of £5,000 or £6,000.  I am very well aware that the Fisheries Board makes loans available for the purchase of such boats but these loans are of little value to many of the fishermen I know&mdash;and I think it would be general throughout the country&mdash;because in order to qualify for one of these loans they have to put down a percentage of the total amount and, into the bargain, they have to get solvent sureties.  Even though these people are very honest and decent and hard-working they find it very difficult, in view of their financial circumstances, to get sureties.  No person would like to go surety in respect of a four-figure sum of money no matter how honest the borrower might be and the House will appreciate the difficulties facing a fisherman who has no other means and whose family would have no other means at their disposal should anything happen.  Consequently, the main cry of the fishermen in that district is that they cannot avail of these loans.</P>

Possibly the Deputy did benefit some of his friends down there by giving them such free loans in respect of the purchase of modern fishing boats.  His seat in West Galway is rather shaky and possibly Deputy Bartley did go out of his way in that matter with a view to being returned to this Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to impress on the present Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O. Flanagan, is the need for reviewing the whole position in so far as the supply of equipment to fishermen of good standing is concerned.  Where a group of decent, honest, hard-working fishermen apply to this Department for a substantial grant and loan to enable them to provide themselves with equipment, and submit a good case, they should be enabled to go out on the waters and compete with foreign trawlers by being given such grants and loans.  It is very difficult for these fishermen to get securities and, in many cases, it is very difficult for them to put together the percentage of money which is required: the minimum percentage would be 10 per cent. of the cost of the equipment.</P>
      <P>I believe the Parliamentary Secretary could devise some system whereby suitable credit facilities would be made available for these fishermen or whereby they would be given a certain length of time, wherein they would have an opportunity of earning something from the boats, before they would be asked to pay the 10 per cent. in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, now, to refer to applications which are made from time to time to the Department in respect of the improvement of piers and slips.  At many points along our coastline, we have very inadequate piers and slips. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;when these applications come before him and when he sees that they are supported by satisfactory <Col N="1205" /> evidence as to the advantages of the work&mdash;to bear in mind the urgency of the matter and to give the applications as sympathetic a hearing as possible. In particular, I want to refer to an agitation which has been going on for the past four or five years in the Schull area of my constituency.  The local fishermen are seeking a grant from the Department of Agriculture for the erection of a breakwater there.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out by these fishermen and by their representatives in this House for the past three or four years, the erection of a breakwater would be of immense benefit to the fishing industry in Schull.  As things are at the moment, the boats are in danger every stormy night.  The fishermen live in the fear that, after a stormy night, there will be no sign of their boats the following morning and that they will be swept out to sea. They made a very strong case in the matter to the former Parliamentary Secretary but with little avail.  I trust their application will receive a more sympathetic hearing from the present Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>There is another important point to which I should like to refer&mdash;it is a a matter which I cannot properly understand&mdash;and that is the reservation of certain fishery rights in this country.  I referred to it some years ago when I spoke on this Vote.  Long stretches of rivers are entirely reserved to certain people.  In some cases these people are of a foreign element.  They are neither Irish in name nor in origin. I cannot see why they should get these rights as the rivers should be free to every man and woman to fish if they wish and if they get a licence to do so.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to examine that question very closely and carefully, because it is amazing to find miles of rivers confined solely to those people and their friends, while Irishmen are not allowed to fish them. It is about time to take away these rights from such people.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to examine the question as closely and as carefully as possible with a view to reviewing the whole position and withdrawing from these people the rights which <Col N="1206" /> they now hold and to which they are not entitled.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has only been in office for a short time and it would be unfair to make any further comments.  As I said at the outset, I represent a constituency where there is a greater percentage of fishermen than in any other constituency and I am quite satisfied with the man who is now in charge of that Department.  I know very well he will do everything he can to ensure that the fishermen of this country will at least get the fair and square deal to which they are justly entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer:</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of speaking in this debate as these Estimates were produced by the previous Parliamentary Secretary.  However, owing to some remarks made by the Parliamentary Secretary, by Deputy Burke and by Deputy Murphy, I cannot let the occasion pass without going back for a moment and giving a kind of résumé of the position in connection with fisheries since I came into this House in 1948.  The position then was &mdash;and what I say cannot be contradicted&mdash;that a fisherman could not get a boat or gear or equipment unless he deposited with the Sea Fisheries Association a sum comparable to 50 per cent. of what he proposed to purchase. When we came into office in 1948, the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, who was in charge of the Fisheries Department, reduced that to 20 per cent and then to 10 per cent. and even 5 per cent., and he made a statement in this House, which he carried out as far as I know in my constituency, that any fisherman who had paid up all his commitments would not be left without a boat or gear provided he could show that he was a good fisherman. That was carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1951 we left office, and when Fianna Fáil came into office that was carried out for a period; but the position when they left office was that no fisherman would get gear and equipment unless he paid 100 per cent. deposit.  Furthermore, there were restrictions imposed on the importation of this equipment into the country.  The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, <Col N="1207" /> in his time, gave definite instructions that any such equipment required by fishermen should be imported free of duty and that there should be no delay in the customs because of the necessity for such equipment.  That was the position after we came into office in 1948 and the position when we left office in 1951.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, before 1948, our inshore fishermen had not suitable boats.  They were old and derelict and ill-equipped. Provision was made by which our inshore fishermen would be provided with boats with which they could go out to sea to some extent.  What did Fianna Fáil do in their term of office? They purchased five German trawlers which were supposed to be secondhand. Manned by Germans, they were brought across the North Sea.  Some of them, I think, were almost wrecked. It is a pity they were not all wrecked; it would be much better if they were. They were brought to Killybegs or some other place on the north-west coast.  I believe they were to be worked from various places on the western sea-board provided Fianna Fáil continued in office, but luckily they did not continue in office.</P>
    <P>We do not want those boats.  We want to make provision for the inshore fishermen.  We want very quickly to make provision by which they will get all the necessary equipment, boats and gear and whatever they want, as was promised by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture, as he is now again with a Parliamentary Secretary.  We want to go back to that and make all the necessary provision for our fishermen so that they will have the best of boats and gear and everything they want on the best terms possible.</P>
    <P>When those German trawlers were purchased we did not really know what they were to do.  They must have cost an immense sum of money.  They are certainly deleterious to the work which our inshore fishermen wish to carry out.  All provision should be made, and I am sure will be made, by this Government and the Department of <Col N="1208" /> Fisheries to ensure that our fishermen will have the best of boats and gear, so that our fishing industry will again reach the position which it once held of being second only to agriculture, if the fish are there.  Some say the fish are not there.  Some say they were there until the Fianna Fáil Government came into office in 1932, because the fishermen were very prosperous up to then.  We can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that those of us who are interested in the fishing industry will give him all the necessary information during his period of office and will do everything possible with all sections of our people so that once again the fishing industry may be made prosperous.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil came into office in 1951 they set up a board called An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I can tell you that there are people on that board who know nothing about fishing.  It is simply a political board like various other boards and we have no confidence in it.  I hope that before this Government is long in power some board will be set up entirely different from that.  If any board is set up at all, I hope the members of it will know something about fishing and will ensure that our fishermen will have the necessary equipment to catch the fish and, when they do catch them, that provision will be made to market them even in the remotest villages and rural areas in this country.  Fish should reach those areas in perfect condition. At present when the fish reaches certain areas it is not possible to get it in fit condition to purchase. There should be something like insulated vans so that when the fish would be caught it would be sent off at once, or C.I.E. should make provision for its transport to different areas.  We are not supposed to be fond of fish, but if it were delivered fresh and in proper condition to the people they would certainly make full use of the commodity delivered.</P>
    <P>I could be talking for the next hour about the whole fishing industry but I do not want to develop the whole position.  I just want to refer to some <Col N="1209" /> things that were said by Deputies; but I can tell you this, Sir, that if the people of this country wish the fishing industry to prosper they must take it out of politics entirely and make all provision necessary for the welfare of our fishermen, not only to equip them well but also for their protection when out on the high seas, giving them the best equipment possible and doing everything then, when they come into land, so that the fish will be delivered to the people in the freshest manner possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the last sentence so capably and efficiently uttered by Deputy Palmer was the most common-sense and practical sentence of the whole debate, when he said that the fishing industry should be taken out of politics completely.  I fully share his views in that.  I do think that mixing the two is regrettable, and has proven so in every industry in which politics take a more important part than the advancement of the industry itself.  I hope and trust that, whatever may have been the past of fisheries, so far as politics and fisheries are concerned from now on, they may be considered completely divorced.  I would give a guarantee on my own behalf, and I am sure can give it to the House on behalf of the Minister, that we will see to it that as far as the fishing industry is concerned it will be kept aloof from politics.</P>

      <P>I am serious in the observation I have made, and I want to give every Deputy and all Parties in this House an assurance that in so far as that important industry is concerned it is going to be kept aloof and away from politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bartley in the course of his speech has paid tribute to the work of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and to the efficiency of the board.  I feel that I have not been in office sufficiently long to examine fully the activities of the board.  I do not know the personnel of the board, except many of them by repute.  I have not had the pleasure <Col N="1210" /> of meeting all the members of the board, but I do hope, now that the Estimate and the busy time in so far as this Department is concerned are passing, to make myself more familiar with the workings of the board so that I may have a thorough grasp of all its activities.  I hope that time will give me an opportunity of meeting the members of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and examining very deeply and thoroughly their activities in every possible respect in so far as the terms of reference of that board are concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House&mdash;and I am sure that Deputy Bartley will accept the guarantee&mdash;that any help that can be given to the fishermen and to the fishing industry in general will be given.  I am not saying that he has not been generous in the past with that help.  I only wanted to take this opportunity of assuring the fishermen and all concerned in the fishing industry that so far as we are concerned if they feel at any time that they have matters connected with their industry about which they desire an interview, through their Deputies or direct themselves to the Minister, in so far as the Minister for Agriculture and I are concerned they will be pushing an open door.  We will always be pleased to meet them, to discuss problems with them; and, furthermore, we shall take very great pleasure in examining very fully and closely the important points of view which they may have to raise.  Not alone will we give a sympathetic hearing, but we will do what we possibly can to further their interests and to be guided by their advice which, I may say, is the practical advice from the industry itself which must come from the fishermen. I give this House a further assurance that if any occasion arises on which, in the interests of the fishing industry, any group of public-spirited citizens desire to put forward their views so far as that industry is concerned, they are a thousand times welcome either to the Minister or myself.  We will be very pleased to meet them.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputy Bartley will agree with me that for the current financial year we have a fairly good programme on hands which will be of <Col N="1211" /> great advantage to the fishing industry. He may recall that, as I endeavoured to point out when introducing this Estimate, it is hoped in the current financial year to provide advances from the Central Fund to a total of £150,000. The chief items to be financed out of this sum are the provision of boats and gear being issued on hire purchase terms.  We are going to spend approximately £75,000 in that respect.  On that may I refer to Deputy Murphy of West Cork, when he queried the question of the purchase of those boats?</P>
    <P>It is true to say that if a fisherman deposits 10 per cent.  of the total cost of the boat he will be sympathetically considered by the board for a boat, but it must be taken into consideration that some of those boats cost from £7,000 to £8,000.  I think that the State is taking a great risk in paying and providing 90 per cent. of the cost, and that the board is reasonable in its request when 10 per cent. is asked from the fisherman as a deposit.  The State is treating him reasonably in giving him 90 per cent. of the total cost of the boat, gear and equipment.  I may say that I agree fully with Deputy Palmer that the conditions which now prevail are far from the conditions that prevailed prior to 1948 in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express to Deputy Murphy my thanks for the very kind words which he has spoken about me.  I only hope and trust that I will be able to live up to the high expectations of Deputy Murphy in that respect.  I can assure him that I will do what I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin raised a very important point, and I should like to refer to it, with reference to the continuation of the levy on exports of salmon.  Deputy McMenamin also raised this matter in a recent parliamentary question.  I have had some discussions with the Minister, and I can assure Deputy McMenamin that his views received full consideration. The matter is one, however, which involves financial considerations, and it <Col N="1212" /> is proposed to submit it for the consideration of the Government at an early date.  That is the position in so far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke also of a consignment of cured herring which is at present at Downings and he said, if I remember correctly, that that consignment had been there for approximately six months.  It might be well for me to remark at this stage that I have been only a month in office, so that this consignment must have been there for five months before I took office.  Whatever state of affairs exists at present in relation to that consignment, we are taking every care to ensure that it will not happen again, and I am satisfied that the officers of the Department and the management of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are leaving nothing undone to see that that consignment is disposed of with the least possible loss.  I have asked continuously what progress has been made with regard to its disposal and I am satisfied from the information placed at my disposal by the officers of the Department that everything humanly possible is being done to dispose of it.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies that, so far as we are concerned, everything possible will be done to have a market for that consignment.  It is only right to remark that the herrings at Downings must be cured at some particular point and Downings is regarded as the most suitable point.  The Deputy has said that the fish was taken from Kincasslagh to Downings.  That may be so.</P>
    <P>There is a very special problem, as the Deputy probably knows, at Glengad and to make the harbour at Glengad suitable and satisfactory would cost in the region of £500,000. That is something which must give us thought.  However, plans are awaited from the Donegal County Council for an alternative scheme and it might be well if the Deputy and other Deputies concerned got on to the Donegal County Council and asked for an expediting of whatever plans are being prepared in the engineer's department of a less expensive type.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked for the sale value of the herrings in question.  That figure is a figure of approximately <Col N="1213" /> £3,000, but it is well to mention that there is no demand in the home market for such cured herring.  It is well that should be placed on record, but he may rest assured that everything possible is being done to dispose of them and I will keep in close touch with the management of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to ensure that they are kept alive to the necessity of disposing of them with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke made a reference&mdash; and I suppose there is a lot in it&mdash;to the state of repair of fishing harbours. It must be borne in mind that that responsibility rests on the local authorities and that county councils have full power and authority in the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the breakwater at Schull.  I recently met a deputation of the fishermen led by the parish priest of Schull and I was impressed by the case they put forward, which was backed by the Deputy's recommendation.  I have been informed that, within the past few days, the engineers of the Office of Public Works, at the request of the officers of this Department, have been carrying out a survey in relation to the representations put forward by the deputation and the parish priest whom I met at the offices of the Department last week.  I can assure Deputy Murphy and the interested fishermen of Schull who put up a very good case for the provision of a breakwater in that area that no time will be lost in having the matter fully, carefully and sympathetically examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan of Galway referred to the transport of fish by C.I.E. and I was rather surprised by the observations he made.  If he will be good enough to give me instances of such treatment by C.I.E., I shall have the matter investigated with the least possible delay.  I can assure him it will be looked into and, when it has been, I will communicate with him directly with regard to it.  I am grateful to him for drawing my attention to the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke also referred to the imports of fish and said he was amazed <Col N="1214" /> by the amount of fish imported.  It may be interesting for Deputy Burke to know that we export a greater value of fish than we import.  I have interesting figures here which show that our imports of fish total £616,629 and our exports, including our exports of salmon, eels, shellfish and other fish, £884,963, showing a balance in favour of our fish exports of £268,334, which I regard as very gratifying.</P>

      <P>It is a very gratifying figure and I am very pleased that we are in the position of having such a balance in favour of our exports.</P>
      <P>With regard to inland fishing, I do not know if my predecessor holds the views I hold on this matter, but I should like to issue a warning to poachers and to ask the support of angling clubs and even the support to a greater extent of the Garda Síochána in putting an end to poaching.  Poaching&mdash;this poisoning and gassing of waters and the other means by which poachers work&mdash;should be looked upon as a more serious offence than it is. The more serious the view a district justice takes of poaching, the nearer he will be to my heart.  Serious steps will have to be taken to end poaching and I trust that angling clubs will be alive to their responsibilities in this respect.  I have seen a number of files and I am going to show no leniency whatever in this matter.  I am not prepared to make any recommendations to the Department of Justice for mitigation of any fines imposed.  I do not see any reason why I should, and I hope that district justices and others in authority will look on it as a very serious matter.  The more severe and the heavier the penalties they impose on poachers, the greater the appreciation they will have from me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to add anything further except in praise of the Inland Fishery Trust.  In the short time I have been associated with this Department, I have been given a very good account <Col N="1215" /> of their work.  I can assure them that they will have my full support and co-operation. I should like again to express thanks to the E.S.B. and to the Land Commission for their co-operative spirit, because without their assistance the progress that has so far been achieved would not have been possible. I would like also to thank those who have made donations in that respect to the Fishery Trust.</P>
    <P>I do apologise to Deputies for not having a fuller and a more accurate grasp of the proceedings of this section of the Department, but I hope by the time I am presenting my next Estimate that I will be more familiar with the activities of this section; and I am sure by the time I am presenting my fifth Estimate I will be fully conversant with their activities.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question?  I have made due observation myself of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has just taken over office and therefore could not be expected to know a great many details about it.  For that reason, I take exception to a statement made by Deputy Palmer.  He took advantage of the Parliamentary Secretary's lack of information&mdash;and I am sure he has got the information from the officers since this statement was made&mdash;and said that a fisherman could not get a boat in 1948 unless he put down 50 per cent. of the cost as a deposit.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary now put it on record whether, in fact, that was the position or not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. T.F. O'Higgins):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £7,687,700 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities, miscellaneous Grants and Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>In common with my colleagues who have moved Estimates in the House in the last week or so, I am to-day introducing an Estimate prepared not by me but by my predecessor in office, for the sums needed by my Department for the current year.  I have too recently taken up office to have had the opportunity of examining fully the services covered by the Estimate.  I intend, therefore, to present the Estimate to the House as it stands, giving merely a brief comment on the working of the main health services during the past year.</P>
      <P>I propose in the first place to review some of the main vital statistics for the previous year.  The figures quoted for 1953 are provisional but figures for earlier years are final.</P>
      <P>The birth rate per 1,000 of the population for 1953 was 21.1 as compared with 21.9 for 1952.</P>
      <P>The marriage rate also fell slightly from 5.4 in 1952 to 5.3 in 1953.</P>
      <P>There was a slight decrease in the death rate from 11.9 per 1,000 population in 1952 to 11.8 in 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The infant mortality rate, at 39 per 1,000 live births, was the lowest yet recorded for this country.  It compares with a figure of 41 for 1952 and an average of 47 for the five years to 1952.  The maternal mortality rate also <Col N="1217" /> improved from 1.4 per 1,000 live births in 1952 to 1.2 in 1953.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to find that the downward trend in the mortality from T.B. has been maintained.  The rate for 1953 &mdash;40 per 100,000 population&mdash;was the lowest yet recorded.  It compares with a rate of 54 per 100,000 population for 1952 and is exactly half the rate for 1950.  That there is still room for improvement is shown by the rates recorded for other countries; in the Netherlands for example, a rate of 16 per 100,000 population and in Denmark a rate of 14 were recorded in recent years.</P>
    <P>The death rate from cancer was 143 per 100,000 population as compared with a similar figure for 1952.  The heavy mortality from cancer emphasises the need for improving to the maximum possible extent the facilities for diagnosing and treating the disease.</P>
    <P>There were 35 deaths from measles as compared with 52 in 1952; 59 deaths from whooping cough as against 86 in 1952; and scarlet fever deaths fell to three, from ten in the previous year. There was also a decline in the deaths from diphtheria from seven in 1952 to three in 1953.  I shall have something further to say about this disease later.</P>
    <P>Deaths from influenza increased from 238 in 1952 to 476 in 1953 and deaths from poliomyelitis from 13 to 33.  Deaths from gastro-enteritis among children under two were also higher than in the previous year, this disease being responsible for 185 deaths in that age-group as compared with 160 in 1952.</P>
    <P>We again had a clear record in regard to smallpox.</P>
    <P>I now propose to review briefly the work done in connection with the statutory health services&mdash;using the term generally&mdash;during the past year.</P>
    <P>Medical assistance services were further improved during the year by the provision of new buildings, to which I shall refer briefly later, and by the improvement of equipment in existing hospitals, etc.  During the year the former fever hospital premises at Cork Street, Dublin, became available for <Col N="1218" /> other purposes and it was decided to use it to accommodate a large number of the ambulant persons in St. Kevin's Hospital.  At the same time the Dublin Board of Assistance, having acquired other premises from the authorities of the Mendicity Institution, was adapting them for use by male casuals who are now housed in portion of St. Kevin's.  The transfer of these persons from St. Kevin's in the near future will contribute substantially to the rehabilitation and improvement of that institution and to the improvement generally of the services which the board provides.  Public assistance authorities throughout the country continued their efforts to provide special accommodation for particular classes as was done by the Dublin Board of Assistance.  Side by side with the more spectacular building programme, the authorities mentioned continued the improvement of the services by providing additional staff where needed.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the very greatly reduced death rate from T.B.  Up to the present time a large part of the effort of the Department of Health and of the local authorities administering the T.B. services has been devoted to providing sufficient beds for sufferers from the pulmonary variety of the disease. An additional 350 beds became available during the past year, mainly at the Western Regional Sanatorium in Galway and in Ardkeen Chest Hospital, Waterford, and so far as can be foreseen the time is now near when a bed will be available almost immediately for every pulmonary patient in need of treatment in a hospital or sanatorium. In future, greater time and attention can be devoted towards the expansion and development of the field services, particularly the tracing of contacts of cases which come to light and the preventive measures represented by tuberculin testing, B.C.G. vaccination, and mass-radiography.  The National B.C.G. Committee and local authorities which operate their own B.C.G. schemes performed over 56,000 vaccinations in the year ended 31st March last.  The National Mass-Radiography Association and the Cork County Council which operates its own mass-radiography <Col N="1219" /> scheme between them X-rayed over 190,000 persons.</P>
    <P>It should not be necessary for me to stress that all diagnostic and treatment facilities for T.B. are freely available to every citizen and that I, my Department and the health authorities are only too anxious to see them availed of to the fullest extent to ensure that treatment is commenced at the earliest possible stage in the development of the disease.</P>
    <P>The scheme of cash allowances for persons suffering from infectious diseases continued during the year.  The primary purpose of the scheme is to encourage people with certain infectious diseases, especially T.B., to undergo the treatment needed for their conditions by relieving them of anxiety as to their own maintenance or the maintenance of their families while they are getting treatment.</P>
    <P>I find that some noteworthy improvements were made in the mental hospital services during the past year.  In several mental hospitals, schemes of reconstruction are in progress, while in other cases planning is actively proceeding. Work started on the provision of 328 extra beds by the Grangegorman Mental Hospital authority.  Overcrowding in mental hospitals is acute in a number of places and it is hoped that the additional patient and staff accommodation which will be available when these works are completed will relieve the problem very substantially.</P>
    <P>The various modern forms of psychiatric treatment are now in general use in district mental hospitals.  The extension in the use of these treatments has been helped by the fact that medical and nursing staffs in the hospitals have been increased considerably in recent years.  The better facilities for the reception of voluntary and temporary patients, and the development of active treatments have given a great impetus to the treatment of mental illness in the early stages, when, of course, the prospects of quick recovery are most favourable.  This is reflected in the increased receptions of voluntary and temporary patients, the numbers of whom have risen roughly three-fold between 1947 and 1953.  The numbers of <Col N="1220" /> discharges of such patients are also very satisfactory.  A gradual advance is also being made in the provision of facilities for occupational and recreational therapy in mental hospitals.  In most of the district mental hospitals, at least 50 per cent. of the patients are provided with suitable employment. Upwards of 70 per cent. take part in the indoor and outdoor recreations available.  Both forms of therapy are found to help considerably towards recovery in many cases.</P>
    <P>Approximately £3,650,000 was paid out by way of grants from the Hospitals' Trust Fund for the building of hospitals during 1953-54.  Among the major hospital works completed during the year were the new fever hospital at Dublin with 280 beds, and the new county hospital at Manorhamilton. Work commenced during the year on a large number of projects.  The most important of these were a new unit at the Meath Hospital to provide 80 beds, a new nurses' home at Mercer's Hospital, Dublin; a new orthopadic hospital at Kilcreen, County Kilkenny; and the provision of 328 extra beds at Grangegorman and Portrane Mental Hospitals.  The work of converting premises at Celbridge to a mental defective institution was also started.</P>
    <P>A number of large hospitals and hospital buildings were at a very advanced stage of construction by the end of March and the majority of them should come into operation during the current financial year.  These include the regional sanatoria at Galway, Cork and Dublin; Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children at Crumlin, Dublin; the new orthopaedic hospital at Gurranebraher, County Cork; St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin; the Limerick Regional Hospital; the new nurses' home at the Mater Hospital, Dublin; the main block of Galway Regional Hospital and the major extensions to the mental defective institutions at Drumcor, County Louth and Lota, County Cork.</P>
    <P>Out of a total of just over 1,000 dispensaries and dispensary depots in the country, local authorities have indicated that they propose to replace approximately 400.  From May, 1952, when grants for the erection of new <Col N="1221" /> dispensaries were first promised, up to the 31st March last, 65 new premises had been provided, and it is hoped that a further 100 will become available during the current financial year.  This rate of progress should see the finish of the dispensary replacement programme within a few years.  Seven county clinics in all have been completed and seven others now in process of building should be finished before the end of the current year.  In three other cases the stage of inviting tenders has been reached, and the planning of the remainder included in the county clinic construction programme is proceeding.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on local authority health services rose from £5,650,000 in 1947-48 to over £11,500,000 in 1953-54.  The Exchequer is now bearing 50 per cent. of the cost of these services.</P>
    <P>The fact that health services are costing the ratepayer and the taxpayer such large sums prompts me to offer some advice at the risk of incurring the displeasure of those who hold that it is wrong that a Minister for Health, a politician and a layman, should usurp such functions.</P>
    <P>I have said earlier that there was no case of smallpox in this country in the last year.  In fact, we have had no native case of it for many years.  I have also given the number of deaths from diphtheria in the last year.  The number of cases of this disease and the number of deaths from it have declined enormously in recent years.  This happy position, competent and widely accepted medical opinion assures us, is attributable to the widespread vaccination against smallpox and immunisation against diphtheria.  The same opinion warns us, however, that we cannot hope that the present freedom from the one disease and relative freedom from the other can continue unless parents continue to see that their children are protected by vaccination and immunisation.  The trouble involved in bringing a child to a doctor to have these procedures carried out is a very small price to pay for the immunities they confer.  The family doctor will be glad to do what is necessary or the health authority will provide the service free for anybody <Col N="1222" /> who wants it.  I would therefore appeal to all parents of young children to make a special point of seeing that all their children get this protection.</P>
    <P>There is probably no adult in this country who has not witnessed the misfortune which can descend on a family through T.B.  It is not a hereditary disease&mdash;anybody in an unprotected state can contact it from close contact with an infected person and we do not always know who is infected and who is not.  Every one of us who has the least suspicion that he may have been unfortunate enough to contact it has the duty of going for a check-up in his own interest and lest he should be the cause of passing it on to his relatives, his colleagues at work, or his friends.  The facilities for such check-up are available to everybody.  In addition, medical science has discovered a means of providing a considerable measure of protection against it&mdash;by B.C.G. vaccination.  If all children and young adults were given such protection, the saving in suffering, in economic distress and in the expenditure of public moneys on the hospital services would, in the course of a relatively few years, be enormous.  I would appeal, therefore, to all Deputies to co-operate fully with health authorities and the voluntary agencies set up to deal with particular aspects of the tuberculosis services in encouraging the public and particularly the parents of children and young adults to avail of the services made available for their protection.</P>
    <P>I indicated at the beginning of my speech that I had not yet had an opportunity of examining the health services fully.  I do not intend, therefore, to make any statement about future policy on numerous important details of those services.  I will, however, say that it is my intention, and the Government's to obtain and maintain in the health services of this country a standard as high as that which applies in other comparable countries. Everybody in the House will be with me in declaring this intention; the means which should be taken towards securing this end are receiving my active consideration at the moment and I hope to be able to deal more <Col N="1223" /> fully with the matter in the course of the discussion which will take place on the Health Bill in this House in the immediate future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody can find fault with the manner in which the Minister has presented his report on the general health services that concern his Department.  I think we can generally compliment ourselves on the fact that for the past number of years efforts have been made to improve the health of our people, to make services available to them and to make our people understand the need for medical attention for the cure and prevention of disease.</P>
      <P>The figures which have been given to us show a drop in the incidence of various types of illnesses and diseases. It is, however, clear that we are far from perfection.  There is still a great deal of uphill work before us in order to bring the present figures, which by comparison with previous years, are satisfactory, near to the figures that have been obtained in other countries.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given a great deal of detail with regard to T.B., its treatment, prevention and early diagnosis and the provision that has been made to assist people financially so that their cure can be hastened and their minds can be at ease during the period of treatment and convalescence.  He also mentioned that even in the last year a substantial number of additional beds has been provided for T.B. cases. We will all agree that money spent by the State and by local authorities in the cure and prevention of T.B. is money well spent and that when we get to the stage where the incidence of T.B. may be regarded as negligible there will be consequent saving and the money now being spent on T.B. patients can be made available for other types of health work and even, if necessary, research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cancer is a problem.  Certain developments have been made recently in connection with this particular disease. One of the problems is the difficulty people have in recognising the disease. Persons suffering from cancer recognise that they are suffering from it only <Col N="1224" /> when it is almost too late.  I happen to be a governor of a cancer hospital in the City of Dublin which is doing extremely good work.  I would suggest to the Minister that his Department should issue a constant reminder, by way of a radio talk, warning the people about this disease and telling them that it would be a good thing for persons to have a check-up once in a while specifically for the purpose of discovering if there is any likelihood of their developing this disease.  One of the great problems is to get people to go for a check.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to get his Department to educate people through whatever services are at his disposal, the local authorities' medical officers, and so forth, not to be so afraid of cancer being found in them.  Unfortunately, in the past, this country suffered from the fact that persons hid that they were suffering from T.B. or cancer, as if it were some crime that they had committed and they did not wish it to be known that it had happened to them.  A great deal of education is necessary if people are to understand that our human beings are frail and that we are prone, through infection or otherwise, to illness or disease, and that the best thing to do is to have immediate medical attention so that, if cure is possible, treatment will be easier and less dangerous to the person concerned.</P>
    <P>Gastro-enteritis is a problem which faces us in Dublin.  I suppose it occurs in other places but in Dublin in particular it is a problem.  Gastro-enteritis is one of the most contagious illnesses that can affect infants and one of the most important things in the treatment of gastro-enteritis is immediate detection and absolute care to prevent the disease spreading.  I do not know what the cause of gastro-enteritis is.  Some people say that it is caused by dirt in food.  We have legislation which more or less compels under penalties cleanliness and hygiene of certain minimum standards in the sale of foodstuffs.  I would like to know that the Minister is following this up.  I know that some time ago there was an outbreak of gastro-enteritis in a city in another country. <Col N="1225" /> For a long while it was gathering force and affecting more and more people. It was discovered that a laundry attached to an institution was not doing its work properly in the disinfection of garments.</P>
    <P>The figures given by the Minister, showing a fall in the incidence of certain illnesses and diseases, are proof positive that we cannot rest at the present stage.  We cannot just say that we have reached a certain expenditure and consequently we will not make further improvements or give further assistance.  We have got to wage war with the only implement we have&mdash;money&mdash;in order to make the necessary attack effective.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about new buildings and new equipment.  He also talked about the developments in connection with St. Kevin's Hospital, Dublin.  Most of us can see the development which has taken place in recent years.  We remember when St. Kevin's was regarded as a workhouse and a union to which hopeless cases were sent to spend their last days there.  To-day, we see St. Kevin's rapidly becoming one of the most modern, up-to-date hospitals where everybody can go and get treatment equal to that which they would get in any hospital anywhere else.  I think that the administrations responsible for this development deserve great credit for having converted a building associated with the workhouse and a union into what it is to-day, a hospital gradually becoming something we can be proud of.  The walls around it are being demolished and extensions are being built.  This is the kind of work which will continue and, if continued, we will reach a stage where we can say that, as a result of Government attention in the provision of health services, the health of the people has been brought to the stage where it will be easier to do other things.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will confirm&mdash;I have not concluded this from anything he said&mdash;that there will be no economies to bring about what might be called a marking of time or a retarding of the development which has taken place.  Mental hospital improvements <Col N="1226" /> are also very important. I should like the Minister to say, if not at this stage then at a later stage. whether any rapid progress has been made to deal with the treatment of young mental defectives and young people who are housed with adults afflicted with this unfortunate illness.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Hospitals' Trust Fund and the manner in which it has helped to contribute towards the building of new hospitals. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government is aware of a particular case which I am now going to quote.  We have hospitals in the City of Dublin with large overdrafts and on these overdrafts they have to pay substantial sums by way of interest. This interest payment is a recognised charge when the deficiency account is being checked up.  I think the Minister might be able to find some way of relieving that situation and reduce the deficiency to the extent of these charges.  I find it difficult to understand why hospitals should have to pay a large sum of money every year by way of interest whilst, at the same time, every care is taken as regards everything else that there should not be waste or unnecessary charges.  I do not know whether we have yet reached the stage where the Minister might be able to get a rough estimate of the total amount of money due by these hospitals, particularly voluntary hospitals, and see whether some method can be adopted by the State to wipe out the overdrafts and so reduce that particular charge.</P>
    <P>There is need for further improvement in our dispensaries.  Improvements have been made and are being made.  There is need for additional clinics.  All these things are bound up with the general health service.  The extent to which our people avail themselves of treatment, examination and care will be a measure of the extent to which such treatment brings a charge upon themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the maternal mortality rate and also to the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births.  I can only speak of the authority of which I am a member. <Col N="1227" /> I wonder to what extent people have been educated in matters concerning the birth of children, the treatment and attention both before and after birth, the problem of mothers going to hospitals for confinement, the numbers that can be taken in and the numbers that should be taken in that are not taken in.  It has been suggested to me&mdash;I have heard the matter discussed&mdash;that every mother who is having her first baby should go to hospital.  Judging by the manner in which the baby is born and the general situation, it can be decided whether that mother, when having her second baby, should go to hospital or whether she can have the baby born at home. Again, the home itself has to be taken into consideration.  It has to be considered whether the woman has the necessary facilities and assistance at home to have a baby born at home.  All these things are of vital importance.  I hope, when the Bill is being discussed to-morrow, that we shall have some opportunity of dealing with that particular aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>I know from my own small experience as a layman on the board of a maternity hospital that these are problems which have confronted our people for a great number of years, and it is only in recent years that any improvement has been made.  One begins to realise that the facilities the masses of our people should have in connection with bringing children into the world are not there to the extent they should.  Every mother having a baby cannot be taken into a maternity home.  We on the Dublin Corporation, in association with the maternity hospitals, have toyed with the idea of providing a certain type of nursing home so that a woman who left hospital early could go to one of these nursing homes for a period before she went home. Attention to the baby at birth and for a few weeks afterwards is of vital importance in the subsequent bringing up of that child.  These are matters upon which we will probably be able to touch on another occasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that in 1947 the cost of the health services of <Col N="1228" /> the State on local authorities was £5,650,000.  That figure rose in the intervening years until in 1953 it reached £11,500,000 and, as the Minister has pointed out, 50 per cent. of that charge falls upon the Exchequer.  That is money that has been very well spent.  Nobody can measure in pounds, shillings and pence the value to a nation of the health of its people.  We have gone a very long way towards, improving the health of our people. Those of us who remember the services that existed some 30 years ago know that we have travelled a long road, but we have not yet reached perfection. The Minister, when mentioning that figure, indicated that we had reached what might be regarded as the maximum expenditure possible; I hope that it will not be taken that we intend to stop this good work because it might be suggested that the cost of making our people a healthy people is too dear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken on numerous occasions on this Estimate for the Department of Health.  There is one matter with which I am primarily concerned, and that is the provision of homes for our old people who are unable to look after themselves. While we have a number of homes in Dublin City and County, chiefly run by religious orders both well and efficiently, there is still a big gap to be filled.  I agree with the last speaker that vast improvements have been made in St. Kevin's and I compliment the executive committee, the previous Minister for Health and his predecessor for the co-operation they gave in carrying out improvements there.  As I said, there still remains a gap to be filled.  The religious orders are not able to meet the demands.  I would like to see proper provision made for caring for our aged people and I would like the Minister to note that point for special consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the increase in this Estimate from 1947 to 1953.  One of the most important factors contributing to the health of our people was the introduction of the T.B. allowance under the 1947 Act.  Deaths from T.B. have been considerably <Col N="1229" /> reduced.  That allowance has proved to be a national investment and the advantages accruing therefrom to posterity will be one hundredfold.  It is obvious that individual enterprise will never be sufficient to solve the health problems of our people and it is equally obvious that those problems can only be solved by State intervention.</P>
    <P>There are numbers of our people to-day in institutions and homes because of neglect at birth.  These people are a continual drain on the resources of local authorities and the State.  Until the State intervenes, no matter what the advice of other people may be and no matter what they may say about it, and tries to remedy that long standing defect in our health services we will never eradicate the present drain on our resources.  We must have proper health measures implemented here.  No matter what one does someone is bound to be hurt, but we should bend all our energies here in the Oireachtas to helping the majority of our people.  By advancing along that road we will ultimately reach the ideal Christian State in which all sections of our people will be looked after in a reasonably Christian way.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the overcrowding in certain hospitals, particularly in mental hospitals.  I happen to know something about them.  I do not think it is right that young children should be sent to these hospitals where they have to mix with adults.  The previous Minister for Health tried to do his best for them by assisting the Order of St. John of God to build additions to its institutions.  Despite the fact that many young children afflicted in this way are sent to these latter institutions, we still have hundreds of children who cannot be admitted to them because of the lack of accommodation, and so they have to be sent to the ordinary mental hospitals.  I think that is a most undesirable practice and gives those youngsters very little chance.  I hope the Minister will be able to do something that will be of some benefit to youngsters who are mentally afflicted.</P>
    <P>As regards dispensaries, I hope that <Col N="1230" /> the Minister will be able to follow up the good work of his predecessor by pressing on local authorities to continue building those of a modern type. A number of them that we have near Dublin lack water and sewerage facilities as well as any proper accommodation for a doctor or nurse to receive and examine patients.  I know of one dispensary which is situate not far from the City of Dublin and it is a disgrace.  That is a matter that should be remedied at the earliest date possible.  Dispensaries in which examination and treatment can be carried out under civilised conditions should be provided at the earliest moment.</P>
    <P>The provision of adequate supplies of pure water is a matter that concerns not only the Minister's Department but the Department of Local Government.  I spoke on this when the Vote for the latter Department was before the House recently.  The position in this respect in parts of County Dublin is very bad.  Quite an amount of illness is caused amongst our people because of the fact that a supply of pure drinking water is not available for them.  In many cases, they have to depend on getting a supply from streams running along the roadside and from wells which are subject to impurities of all kinds.  I have been hammering at this question for a long time in the course of debate and by parliamentary question.  So far it has not been dealt with in a satisfactory way.  I feel that the only solution is by having a co-ordinating body composed of representatives of the local authorities and of the Departments of Health and Local Government.  The problem is one that needs to be dealt with in a thorough way.</P>
    <P>As well as providing a pure water supply for our people in their homes, there is an urgent need to do the same for our schools, especially in rural areas.  It is essential that a supply of pure drinking water should be available at all times for the children attending these schools.  I have done all that I could in the matter.  I have gone so far as to bring samples of water to the county medical officer of health for analysis, samples taken from old wells and streams running by the roadside.  I hope that the Minister <Col N="1231" /> will do all that he can to remedy the present situation.  I know, of course, that he has only taken over office, but I would urge on him to carry on as his predecessor did by trying to improve the health of every section of the people.  The problem is a big one, and he has a long road to travel before reaching perfection in this respect.  I trust that he will deal with all these things objectively.  They are urgent matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to the fact that so far a cure has not been found for cancer.  I think the Minister can be assured that if, at any time, he finds that a doctor or doctors are carrying out what may be regarded as worthwhile research for the eradication of this disease, he will get ready support from all sides of the House if he comes to it looking for money for such a purpose. We are making a good deal of advance at present.  At present, I think we have three hospitals for the treatment of cancer; the Central Cancer Hospital, the one at Northbrook Road, and the one in Hume Street.  The latter two have been pioneers in this work.  I am afraid we have yet a long way to go before we can claim to be able to cure all those who are suffering from the disease. The Minister should not allow anything to stand in his way if he finds that worthwhile research work is being carried out for the treatment of this disease and should give it every support and encouragement.  Work of that kind is a most meritorious work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to the discussion on the Estimate will be brief because most of the things that I had intended to speak on have been very ably dealt with by the Deputies on the opposite benches.  There are one or two points, however, which seem to me to be of importance to which I should refer.  I agree that money spent on improving the health of our people is money that is well spent.  At the same time, I would like to point out that it is more than a coincidence that most of those who require hospital treatment and are not able to pay for themselves come from <Col N="1232" /> the wage-earning class.  I suggest that, in order to improve the position, we should start at the bottom by improving the conditions under which those people work.  Until that is done, I am afraid that the numbers of those going to hospital and requiring treatment will still be very high.</P>
      <P>There is no use in building a hospital no matter how modernly equipped so long as the people in the country districts and in the towns and cities are working under conditions which are not conducive to good health.  I think a start could be made with the Department of Health itself.  Is the Minister aware that the people who are employed in the hospitals in this country have to work far longer hours than anybody who works in any other job?  A few years ago, the Department of Health made an Order&mdash;and a very good one&mdash; reducing the number of hours of nurses in the hospitals to 48 per week or, as it was known, the &ldquo;98-hour fortnight.&rdquo;  I do not know whether it was accidental or not, but the other people in the hospitals were left out of that Order and the result is that we have people doing practically the same type of work as the nurses working 50 or 60 or over 60 hours.  People cannot be expected to retain their good health while living and working in those conditions for very long.  Even the ambulance drivers in country hospitals are, in many cases, working, or if not actually working, are required to be at what they call &ldquo;stand-to&rdquo; for up to 156 hours a week, but they are only paid a normal week's wages as if they were working 48 hours.  The argument may be made that they do not have to work those hours, but it is true in some cases that they have to work practically all those hours and they must be constantly ready to be called out if required.  I think the Department of Health would do very well if they would look into those matters and find out if conditions could be improved&mdash;I am sure in the cities they are better than in the country districts&mdash;in order to give the employees decent hours of work.  If they do that, they will be removing the high incidence of illness among hospital employees.</P>

Do chuala mé leis an Teachta Pádraig de Búrca agus an Teachta atá tar éis suidhe síos anois.</P>
      <P>I was not in time for the Minister's introduction of this Estimate but I followed part of the debate since I came in.  There are a few points in connection with the Department of Health that I would like to place before the Dáil and before the Minister for consideration.</P>
      <P>I have spoken on this before, and I have spoken to Dr. Ryan when he was Minister for Health, and I will now stress it again&mdash;that is the need for reallocating dispensary areas.  In certain parts of the country there have been new housing schemes and they have gone into electoral areas which are very near a doctor's residence but because of an old area going back half-a-century or more the people have to go very long distances for a dispensary doctor.  It is high time this problem was tackled because I have seen great hardships in my own county and I am sure they exist in other counties too.  The same applies to midwives in the area.</P>
      <P>I know a case in my own area&mdash;in the Coole dispensary area&mdash;where, when a midwife is needed, they have to go 12 or 14 miles away to Ratoath.  That area extends up to Finea in the north of the county, and in the village in which I live&mdash;although you can throw a stone from one end of it to the other&mdash;half of it is served by the Coole dispensary while people in the other half have to go four miles for a doctor, even though there is a doctor within 100 yards of them.  I have pointed this out time and again, and it is high time that the Department would tackle this matter.  Only for the charity and goodness of the local doctor when there is a case of sudden illness, these people would not be attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Briscoe refer to the <Col N="1234" /> very good work done at St. Kevin's and we are all aware of that work, and it is certainly a headline for the rest of the country.  There is a fetish among certain people that new buildings must be erected even though the walls and the roof of the old one are good and the amenities are good.  That is wrong. If you can reconstruct a building which is only 70 or 80 years old, why not do it?  The example has been given in St. Kevin's and Loughlinstown, and it could be done in other places.</P>
    <P>I am speaking as a layman, but it is time that we approached medicine from the preventive point of view instead of thinking that everything must be cured with the surgeon's knife.  I do not think the idea behind medicine from the very beginning was the surgeon's knife.  It should be the last resort.  We should use the physicians and the knowledge they have to prevent a disease and prevent, if possible, major surgery.  If we can get hospitals all over the country in which the physicians will use their advanced knowledge in curing disease, we will have accomplished a lot.  This belief that you must have a surgery in every place where there is a hospital erected&mdash;I do not subscribe to it at all.  A lot of good work has been done in many hospitals where they do no surgical work.  Preventive medicine can be applied very much where we have new dispensaries, and I want to congratulate the Department on the design and lay-out of these dispensaries&mdash; those in my constituency are very good &mdash;and when we relate them to the local schools, a lot of work can be done.  I hope that the function contemplated by the Department of Health&mdash;the early examination of children&mdash;will come about very quickly.</P>
    <P>I spent a very pleasant holiday with a relation of mine&mdash;a married man&mdash; in London last summer in the end of September and early October.  I saw, and I heard from this man's wife and himself the great achievements they have made in the treatment of children and preventive medicine. Every month the children in that family are visited and examined and they are fine healthy children.  Some of them were born&mdash;they are fairly advanced&mdash;before the coming into operation of what is known as State <Col N="1235" /> medicine and their mother, who is a friend of mine, has very little trouble and always knows what to do because of the services that are there.  I hope these services come very quickly here and I hope the old dispensary red tickets and white tickets, which were the badges of slavery and poverty, disappear and disappear this year and that instead we will have the family ticket giving the citizens the right to get treatment and prevent disease in their homes.</P>
    <P>My friend, Deputy Burke, talked about new homes for aged people. Again the question of new buildings comes up but there is no need for them.  If the unmarried mothers in the second and third categories were&mdash;as the Department contemplated&mdash;removed altogether from the county homes and put in regional institutions, the county homes can be converted into proper homes for the aged.  I have been a long time on public boards and we took as an example the Nazareth Home in Cork where very good work was done.  Some years ago we contemplated starting one in the Midlands but the good order there said they could do the work as well. They were prevented from doing that good work in relation to the various categories of people who use the county home.  If we could get the segregation that is contemplated as regards unmarried mothers in the first category, and if that is done also in the second and other categories, there is nothing to prevent old people being dealt with more humanely and in a Christian fashion in the county home.  The sooner that work is speeded up the better.</P>
    <P>I think those who know rural Ireland will agree that an old man, whether he be a bachelor or a man who has reared a family and whose wife is dead and who is now living in a tumbledown shack which is ready to collapse, would be far better off if he were in an institution where he could be treated by an order of nuns and where he could get regular meals and a clean bed.  There are dozens of such cases in the country.  To repeat myself <Col N="1236" /> I think if that segregation which is contemplated were carried out in county homes generally we would have better homes.  What has happened in St. Kevin's can happen in Mullingar, Athlone and other places.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke has dealt with the question of mental homes for children. I think the Department are doing a good day's work in that connection and that we can encourage them and say, &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to them in their efforts.  If the collaboration and co-operation of the Department of Local Government can be secured, say, in my county, in the provision of waterworks and sewerage, say, in the case of Delvin, then these mental defectives who are on the waiting list and who are probably already in the mental hospital in Mullingar, can be segregated and accommodated in the institution contemplated in Delvin.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement dealt with the clinics already constructed and the number contemplated.  I should like very much to see that work speeded up as these clinics are very necessary.  I had not time to read the Minister's statement very closely but I should like to know when the sanatorium in Blanchardstown will be ready for occupation.  It would afford great relief and would be the final achievement in dealing with the question of beds for T.B. patients.  An immense amount of work has already been done in the Department in connection with T.B.</P>
    <P>Finally, I endorse everything Deputy Burke said in regard to the treatment of cancer.  A terrific war has been carried on against that dread disease but, unfortunately, it is a war that is not making much progress.  Some progress has been made in regard to the treatment of external cancer, but it is slight.  Every encouragement in the way of provision of funds should be placed at the disposal of the people engaged in that campaign to enable them to carry it on to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies generally for the manner in which they received this Estimate and for the very helpful suggestions which have been made by a <Col N="1237" /> number of Deputies.  I desire to deal with some of these very briefly.  Deputy Briscoe referred to a number of matters and he made the point, in relation to the cancer fear, that it might be useful to consider greater publicity to urge people to seek medical attention and to take all necessary steps in the event of their having any fear at all that they have got, or are likely to get, cancer.  That is a matter, I can assure the Deputy, I shall have examined, but it does occure to me that there is also a certain danger in radio talks or undue publicity of that kind: the danger is that you may cause a scare which would be ill-founded.  Certainly, that did occur in England recently.  When publicity in relation to cancer was indulged in rather freely by the Minister for Health, quite an uncalled-for scare was caused amongst the people.  However, I can assure the Deputy that I will have that suggestion examined.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also mentioned the disease of gastro-enteritis.  There, again, the real cause of the disease has not really been discovered.  There are, apparently, divided opinions as to what causes it.  Undoubtedly, its incidence is reduced by a better and higher standard of hygiene.  I hope that with the education of people generally and the worthwhile work that is being done in the Dublin Corporation maternity and child clinics&mdash;and which I hope to see done elsewhere throughout the country in similar clinics&mdash;there will be a reduction in the incidence of that disease amongst young children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe and some other Deputy mentioned the question of mental defectives.  I should like to assure the House that this is a problem to which I have given some study and consideration even in the short time I have been in charge of the Department. It is a matter that will require considerable examination and, of course, the provision of more facilities than exist at the moment.  The whole matter is being examined at the moment and we hope to be able to embark on a programme which, while it may not completely satisfy the requirements of institutional treatment in relation to mental defectives, will at least, in some way, meet in a short time the problem which these afflicted <Col N="1238" /> people do represent to the State.  I have not before me at the moment the exact details of our immediate proposals in that connection, but the present programme provides for some 1,400 extra beds for mental defectives, of which about 660 should be available by the end of the year.  A further 1,000 or so beds are proposed in a supplementary programme which I have examined.  I already approved of one scheme which will shortly commence in Sligo so that, generally speaking, I can assure the Deputy that that problem is having, and will continue to have, the attention of the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke mentioned the provision of homes for old people.  That, again, is a very real problem.  The care of the aged often cannot be carried out adequately or properly in institutions.  Old people, at the end of their days, do not get in institutional life the kind of comfort and the kind of ease that their age requires. There is considerable examination in the Department as to how best to deal with that problem.  Local authorities are empowered to help different voluntary groups who open or start homes for old people.  I hope to press ahead with provisions of a voluntary kind of that nature because I believe that only in small homes that cater for nine, ten, or perhaps 15 old people the proper kind of care will be provided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke also mentioned the matter of overcrowding in hospitals. That is part of the general problem, and I think most Deputies are aware of it.  He tied it up, particularly, with mental hospitals.  Again, the hospital programme with regard to mental hospitals is having and will continue to have the attention of my Department. A small step forward is being taken at the moment in relation to Grangegorman, but, of course, mental hospital facilities throughout the country are not adequate and must be improved and I hope to see that improvements will take place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe mentioned the question of voluntary hospitals having to pay interest on their deficits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>On overdrafts. That is true.  I think that, some years ago, an effort was made to meet that situation by payment of deficits half-yearly in advance and half-yearly in arrears.  Apparently that proposal did not work out satisfactorily because the problem remains.  I can assure the Deputy that I shall have the question further examined.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy has mentioned the need for a reallocation of dispensary areas.  Again, I can say to the Deputy that the whole question of dispensary facilities is engaging, and will have, my full attention.  We hope to be able to have a general review of the facilities available in dispensary areas and a re-organisation of existing areas carried out in the near future.  The Deputy's remarks will be borne in mind and the worthwhile suggestions he has made will receive consideration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy also asked when the new sanatorium at Blanchardstown is likely to become available.  I can tell him that, on our information at the moment, it should be available towards the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, any suggestions made by Deputies will be examined by my Department and we shall bear in mind the views they expressed here on the Estimate.</P>

    <P>The total provision in respect of the last financial year was £28,440.  This year's Estimate, therefore, shows a net decrease of £1,050.  Most Deputies are aware that the debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate affords an opportunity for discussion on and consideration of Government policy in action during the previous year and consideration of how that policy may be expected to operate during the course of the succeeding year.</P>
    <P>I think it will be obvious to Deputies that, in existing circumstances, it would not be either proper or expedient for me to deal in any great detail with the policy of the previous Administion. That policy has been subjected to considerable discussion over the past few years and to a detailed examination and criticism during the recent general election.</P>
    <P>In the year 1950, when I was head of the Government, I inaugurated a practice in connection with the moving of this Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department by which I made an economic survey of the results of the Government's policy during the preceding year.  I do not think I should be expected now&mdash;nor do I think Deputies would expect it of me&mdash;to give a detailed economic survey of the policy of the last Administration or even a survey of the policy of the present Government.  I hope, however, to resume next year the practice which I inaugurated in the year 1950 and, in order that Deputies may be facilitated in assessing the statistical background to the annual review of Government policy and its results, I have requested the Director of the Central Statistics Office to endeavour to have the Statistical Survey published some weeks before the date on which the debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate will be taken.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to give any general <Col N="1241" /> outline of Government policy or to review the economic background of the last financial year or to indicate economic trends for the future.  I intend to restrict myself to a very brief outline of some of the main aspects of the present economic position.  From time to time it has fallen to my lot to direct public attention to what I conceived to be one of the main obstacles to economic recovery, and that was the lack of public confidence in the capacity of the Government to devise and put into operation its policy.  There was a feeling of insecurity during, perhaps, I might say, the last six years, a feeling that Governments were unstable, a feeling that there would be political changes, and a feeling that the Government had not the time or the opportunity to plan on a long-term basis so as to secure effective financial and economic results from its financial and economic policy.</P>
    <P>I think I am entitled to say that, in present circumstances, public confidence has been restored and that there is a feeling that there is no longer political instability or governmental insecurity. We have emerged from the recent general election with a clear mandate from the people and we have in this House the strength of a clear and strong and stable majority.  I feel that people now are going about their affairs and conducting their businesses free at last from the worry of political insecurity and in the knowledge that a Government has been formed that has strength in this House and strength derived from the mandate of the people to carry on its policy, and that that Government has been given time to examine the position, to consider the economic facts, the economic trends and the financial difficulties and to put into operation its policies on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>We have no illusions about the difficulties confronting us or the nature of the tasks to which we have put our hands, but we do feel that we have now been given strength and stability and that the people have given us time within which to consider the position and to put into operation our policies and to devise them on a long-term basis.  We appreciate the manner in <Col N="1242" /> which the public have received our advent to office and we feel that the public have shown by their attitude that they understand the serious nature of the problems confronting the Government and the difficulties they have to overcome.</P>
    <P>I think it is proper that in this connection I should refer to the statement recently made, the helpful and responsible statement recently made, on behalf of the largest trade union in this country to the effect that in existing circumstances its members would not press for wage increases.  For the success of our policy we require time and, above all, we require the co-operation of every section of the community.  We feel that we will get that to a large extent and we feel that the statement I have referred to is an indication of the strength of the support and co-operation we will get from the public as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have stated that the outline I propose to give this evening will be short and will be confined to two or three main aspects of the economic position. Normally national income statistics would provide a natural starting-off place for such an outline as I propose to give, but, unfortunately, it will be some weeks before the figures of national income for the year 1953 will be available.  However, the indications and the material at our disposal at the moment show that in the year 1953 the national income was of the order of £420,000,000 to £425,000,000, as compared with an unadjusted figure of £404,000,000 for the year 1952.</P>
    <P>Most of the increase in national income during the last year reflected increases in price, and it is probable that in real terms the national income did not increase or increased only to a negligible extent.  Probably one of the reasons for the failure of the national income to expand was that while gross agricultural output increased net agricultural output showed a very slight fall.  That was due to the fact that agricultural input increased and this increased input, to the extent that it took the form of fertilisers and lime, was, of course, a wise investment for the future and in accordance with the policy that we advocated and put into <Col N="1243" /> action during the years 1948-1951; if maintained, it should help to raise agricultural output and real national income in coming years.  In this respect, we have lagged far behind other Western European countries which, since 1948, have increased their real national income in some cases by as much as 50 per cent., compared with a moderate increase of one-sixth in our case.  We have a stationary population and a virtually stationary real national income; it is difficult to disentangle cause and effect, but it is obvious that the deadlock must be broken before any significant progress can be achieved.  We believe that we have a policy that can break and will break that deadlock, a policy based on the wise investment of capital, and I insist in this very brief survey on the necessity for increasing the real amount of national income because that objective forms the basis of our entire policy of reducing taxation and of increasing the real incomes of the people.  By increasing real national income we can secure what we secured before, increased revenues from the same or lesser taxation.</P>
    <P>The two main components of national income are agricultural and industrial production.  In 1953 the volume of gross agricultural output increased by some 3 per cent., a small but welcome expansion, and that expansion is further evidence of the success of the policy inaugurated in 1948.  The volume of gross agricultural output is now about 6 per cent. above the pre-war level.  Any tendency to self-satisfaction on this score must be tempered by the realisation that the general level of agricultural output in Western Europe is 20 per cent. greater than pre-war while in individual countries the percentage increase is much greater.  This Government is convinced that there is considerable scope for further increases in this country, and one of our major tasks will be to help the farmers to secure these increases.</P>
    <P>One of the ways in which Governments can help farmers to increase <Col N="1244" /> agricultural output is by guaranteeing prices, and, particularly in relation to wheat policy, an indication has been given in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture in the last few days by the Minister for Agriculture of our policy in that regard.  But that such a course is not without danger is well exemplified by what is happening in this case of Irish wheat.  The area under wheat this year is estimated very approximately at 460,000 acres.  Yields per acre have been increasing substantially in recent years, but, even discounting any further increase this year, it is estimated that 460,000 acres will in a normal year supply us with up to 90 per cent. of our wheat requirements, a much higher percentage than ever before.</P>
    <P>Dried Irish wheat costs up to £10 a ton more than foreign wheat, and the differential is likely to increase rather than decrease since the tendency is for the price of imported wheat to fall. The total annual excess cost on the basis of 460,000 acres is in the neighbourhood of £4,000,000.  This is the cost to the country of a native wheat policy based on the present guaranteed prices.  The high acreage achieved this year gives rise to other problems, as, for example, the handling, drying and storage of the crop, the suitability of a grist containing 90 per cent.  Irish wheat, and the question of our obligations under the International Wheat Agreement.  A point worth stressing is the fact that in the main it is the large farmers and the people who have taken conacre who have obtained the greatest benefits from the high profits which can be made from Irish wheat. In many cases these high profits have been made by tearing the heart from the land by a policy of quick cash returns. I fully realise that this is a difficult and controversial subject, and I do not wish the Dáil to draw any false conclusions from my reference to the matter.  It is well, however, that we should realise the problems created by the present policy.  These problems will not be solved by ignoring them.</P>
    <P>The problems which face us in the industrial sector are less complex though not necessarily less difficult. Here, too, production has increased, <Col N="1245" /> but all that was done in 1953 was to recover the ground lost in 1952.  Unless industrial production constantly expands no economic progress takes place&mdash;in fact, during every recorded peace-time year except 1952 statistics show such increases in this country. It is, therefore, merely in accordance with previous experience that the production of transportable industrial goods should show the maintenance of such an upward tendency.</P>
    <P>Taking the two years 1952 and 1953 together the rate of progress is the lowest recorded for any two years since the war; and so, while it is comforting to know that industrial production is increasing, it is all too plain that considerable further progress will have to be made if the ratio of industrial employment to the total persons at work is to be increased from our abnormally low figure of 20 per cent. to the average Western European figure of over 30 per cent.  Progress along these lines and the maintenance of a prosperous agriculture are our only hopes of curing the running sores of emigration, unemployment and under-employment.</P>
    <P>Since October last, there has been some improvement in unemployment. Nevertheless, unemployment is still at a disturbingly high level.  In the year 1953 almost one out of every ten insured persons was out of work.  Making all allowances for the extent to which the live register includes persons unemployable or temporarily unemployed, the fact remains that the unemployment percentage is far too high.  While it is perhaps dangerous to oversimplify, and while it is necessary to substitute for the policy of work merely for work's sake a policy of wealth creation, it is nevertheless true to state that the figures of unemployment taken in conjunction with emigration serve as a measure of the success or failure of economic policy in this country.  I can assure Deputies, the House in general, and the country as a whole that the unemployment problem is very much in the mind of the Government, and that our constant object will be to work towards a solution of the problem both by encouraging private enterprise and by <Col N="1246" /> implementing a programme of productive State capital investment.</P>
    <P>In recent months references have been made to the disimprovement which is taking place in our external trade.  This first became noticeable towards the end of last year but has been accentuated in the opening months of this year.  The trade statistics for the first five months of this year show that the import excess was almost £6,000,000 greater than in the corresponding period last year.  Several factors have contributed to this result; the large stocks built up following the outbreak of war in Korea have been exhausted, and in addition, the revival of industrial production after the collapse in the year 1952 required an increasing flow of imported raw materials and semi-finished goods.  The substantial reduction in import prices from their post-Korean peak has come to an end, and the tendency is for import prices to be very slightly higher than last year.  Factors which caused a substantial but temporary increase in the export of certain goods are no longer operative.</P>
    <P>In 1952 and 1953 the balance of payment deficits were small and easily financed.  It is clear that unless present trends are reversed the deficit this year will be substantially greater. The increase in the balance of payments deficit must be considered against the background of all the causal factors, not the least of which in the circumstances of this country is the extent to which the increased deficit is accompanied by a corresponding increase in the rate of domestic capital formation.  It is unfortunately one of the defects of our statistical machinery&mdash;nor are we alone in this&mdash; that information regarding gross capital formation does not become available until some time after the year to which the information relates.  Fortunately, at this stage, the import excess has by no means reached unmanageable proportions, and, while I am not to be taken as assuming the mantle of a prophet in this hazardous field, may I venture the opinion that we are not likely to be faced with any crisis before the end of the year?  Again, as I said in 1951, our balance of payments situation is a problem; it is not a crisis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> The ordinary citizen may find the balance of payments a somewhat abstruse concept.  He is more interested in matters which affect him immediately and directly, such as the price of consumer goods.  We have heard a good deal of talk in recent months about the stabilisation of the consumer price index, but the index has been stabilised at too high a level for people's incomes.  The Government are committed to reducing the cost of living in relation to people's incomes, and this result can be achieved either by reducing prices, or, while maintaining prices, by increasing incomes.  Not the least of the benefits which would result would be the establishment of a firm and lasting base for the revival of personal savings.  It is only when prices are stabilised in relation to incomes that people will really respond to a savings campaign.  Expressed as a percentage of national income, savings are far too low and substantially below the level which can and must be reached, if economic progress is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>This is not an academic matter or a question of thrift for thrift's sake.  It is agreed on all sides that only by increasing productive investment can we hope to break the deadlock of a stationary population, high unemployment and emigration.  While we can draw, in part, on our external assets to finance the increased investment, such a course is dangerous, unless it is supported by a high level of savings which alone can afford a firm and lasting basis for increased capital formation. The Government realise that mere exhortations to save are not enough and they intend to take energetic steps of a practical nature to achieve increased savings at all levels, so that the country may be in a position to finance that policy of wealth creation which alone can provide an expanding economy and really profitable employment for our people.</P>
    <P>As I emphasised at the outset, our aim is and must be to increase real national income, to stabilise prices in relation to incomes, to reduce the burden of taxation, to provide increased incentives to save.  It will be <Col N="1248" /> the Government's aim to ensure that the necessary proportion of the increased investment will be taken by private enterprise.  These are the problems which must and will be faced and solved in the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather amused in listening to the Taoiseach's statement with regard to the uncertainty which was abroad for some years and which affected, in his view apparently, development here.  I think he is projecting into the minds of the outside community, the commercial and industrial community, preoccupations and ideas of his own.  It is natural enough that the head of a Government and also the leader of an Opposition should be rather disturbed by uncertainties such as a small majority in the House, but I do not think there was abroad during the past six years any feeling of instability of Government which would have affected either industrial effort or agricultural effort.  There was a world situation abroad which did have consequences.  The Korean war had consequences and the slump after it had consequences, but what happened here followed a pattern very much the same as that in other countries, as is proved by the statistics of these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, therefore, there is nothing in the point the Taoiseach has made with regard to political instability here.  He is undoubtedly in a much better position from a purely political point of view than he was on the former occasion.  He will have fewer preoccupations about having a constant majority than he would have had if as was the case at one period he had only a small majority of three or four, in the same way as we had.  I might remark in passing that it is very extraordinary that, when the previous Coalition Government were supported by three or four people, these people were admirable, but when the same people supported us, there were hardly any words could be got to indicate how detestable they should be regarded by the community.  I pass then from this point with regard to political instability.  The position is that the Government, the Coalition, if they are <Col N="1249" /> able to get some adjustment of their divergent views, have a majority which will relieve the Taoiseach and members of the Government from anxiety with regard to putting any policy upon which they may be agreed into operation.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the general background of the economic situation here the position is that there was some years ago a situation with what might be called artificial prosperity&mdash;created by the Korean war in the 1950-51. period.  Then there was a depression and if it were shown on a graph the curve would show the depression that existed in 1952 or so, when we happened to be the Government in office just as there was an artificial boom when the present Taoiseach was previously in office.  From that slough, the bottom of that depression there was in 1953 a very definite rise, a rise which was shown in a variety of ways which I have already pointed out in a statement I made when the present Government was being constituted.  It revealed itself in an increase in the real national income, which real national income was depressed in the last two years during which the Coalition were formerly in office.  It showed a definite increase in that year and so far as I know all the indications were that that increase would be continued into the year 1953.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has pointed out we have not yet got the figures for the national income for 1953 and, therefore, we are not able to state definitely that the real national income continued to increase in that year.  I would be greatly surprised if what the Taoiseach has foreshadowed should actually be the fact, viz., that the real national income should begin to level off again.  It seemed to me that the indications were that it would continue to increase.  The Taoiseach has indicated that the cause for his conclusion was that the net increase in agricultural output has not corresponded with the gross increase.</P>
    <P>Everybody here will agree with the Taoiseach that it is desirable that the national income should show an increase in real terms and that everything we can do to bring that result <Col N="1250" /> about should be done by everybody who is interested in the welfare of the country.  The Taoiseach, apparently, has come to the conclusion to which I came, that the chief hope of that is by increasing our agricultural output. There is no doubt that our agricultural output compared with that of other countries is exceptionally low. An examination shows that the way to improve the situation would be to increase the amount of tillage and give to the soil generally the lime and fertilisers it requires.  A good deal of progress had been made in that direction and, as a Government, we were confident that the steps taken were successful up to the point at which we were leaving.  There was a definite prospect that if the methods that had been instituted were continued with vigour they would give very considerable results in coming years.  The Government can be assured that everything it can do to stimulate agriculture and to bring about an increase in agricultural output will be welcomed from this side of the House and that everything we can do to help in that direction will be done.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has touched upon the difficulty that follows from the policy of guaranteed agricultural prices.  He indicates that this year something like 90 per cent. of our wheat requirements will be home-grown; I did not get quite as high a figure as that from the information supplied to me.  That that does constitute a problem we were fully aware.  Even with the lesser percentage which I understood was likely to result it was constituting a problem and we were facing it by having a definite policy in that regard.  We felt we should aim at having at least two-thirds of our wheat requirements produced here.  There would be a certain amount of fluctuation upwards and downwards from that but that would roughly be the aim which would best serve the national interest.</P>
    <P>I feel certain the Government will come to a similar conclusion.  The optimum amount of Irish wheat in grist, and so on, was considered in arriving at our conclusion and I doubt very much if the present Government in considering the matter will come to <Col N="1251" /> a conclusion which will be in any material respect different from that to which we came.  It is important, however, to secure that at least that percentage will be grown in the country and to realise that anything like a reversion to the results that followed the previous policy of the Coalition Government would be nationally unsound. An increase in tillage is necessary to get the best results from our land and to increase our agricultural output, and that must constantly be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>With regard to industry I am glad to think that there is a very different outlook on the part of some of the Parties in the Coalition from that which obtained when I stood in these benches first.  A very definite change has taken place and now it is fully realised that there is no essential conflict between manufacturing industries and agriculture or between our town and our rural populations, that fundamentally, each benefits by the prosperity of the other and that by developing our manufacturing industries we are, in fact, providing in the first place a secure home market&mdash;the securest market we can have&mdash;for the farmer, and providing also for his sons, for the rural population in general, a source of employment.  An increase in employment in industry indicates the degree to which emigration is lessened because there is hardly a doubt that the change in the rural population would have taken place in any case and that if these people did not come from rural areas to our cities they would have gone to cities abroad.</P>
    <P>Our aim ought to be to maintain as far as possible the rural population.  I agree with some of the statements that were made from the Labour Benches recently to the effect that every effort should be made to bring to smaller towns and villages suitable industries. I know our Minister for Industry and Commerce did everything in his time that he could to induce private enterprise to go out into the country areas; there was no special encouragement given from the Government side to those who were establishing industries in the neighbourhood of Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> As far as the smaller cities are concerned our aim was to enable them to be built up so as to be much greater than they are in comparison with the capital city.</P>
    <P>We are also agreed that the tariff protection for our industries, which was constantly under review, is to be maintained.  I do not think that those who are engaged in industries in the country need have any fear as regards that policy being continued.  When we were in office we pointed out that in future tariffs would naturally have to be kept under review.  I was asked a question during the election period as to what our attitude was and I indicated, in terms such as I am using now, that we regarded protection as necessary but that it should, of course, be kept under review so that it would be most effective in protecting our industries and at the same time ensure efficiency so that the goods would be produced as cheaply as possible, thus enabling the consumer to purchase them at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>With regard to the problem of the balance of payments, I think I pointed out when I was on the other side, as the Taoiseach has pointed out now, that a change was taking place and that, whilst in the last two years the balance of payments was something about £9,000,000 each year and was within manageable dimensions, this year it seemed to be changing and seemed to be going up fairly rapidly. I did not think&mdash;nor do I think statistics indicate&mdash;that there is any danger of its getting unmanageable this year; but I would not agree with the Taoiseach in saying that when we had reached £61.6 millions or practically the £62,000,000 we had not reached a stage which might not unfairly be called a critical situation.  The words &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; and &ldquo;critical&rdquo; and &ldquo;alarming&rdquo; have been used, but each one of us might not use these words in precisely the same sense.  Certainly, if we were to go back again to anything like the figure of £60,000,000, I think we would regard it as very, very critical.  The test would be that in two or three years of such deficits we would have exhausted our net external reserves&mdash;a most serious situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> When I was in office I was not able to get anything like a figure for what should be regarded as a sound reserve, the sound reserve that we would be particularly anxious about maintaining and the figure which would be such that if it were not maintained we would regard the situation as dangerous.  I think that about £120,000,000 is regarded as our present net reserves.  If you get a deficit in our international balance of payments that would exhaust that reserve in anything less than a decade, I think you are in a situation which will have to be most carefully watched.  This year if it goes up to £20,000,000, as might be possible, that means only six years; if you had that figure for six years; you would exhaust these reserves.</P>
    <P>One of our troubles has been that these external assets, these external reserves or net reserves, have been built up during the war years.  I think they were mainly built up during the First and Second World Wars.  In those years we were not able to get in the goods that we had been getting in, there was forced abstention on our part; and as a result these external assets were built up.  In normal times it will not be easy to restore these assets if they are once lost.  These assets are essential.  Every country tries to maintain a certain reserve in external assets.  If by the deficit in our payments we exhaust these reserves in a few years, we become a debtor nation fundamentally and we will not be able to restore our creditor position easily again.  Therefore, it is desirable that we should watch our reserves very carefully.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach pointed out, these reserves will be affected by our policy of capital formation.  Common sense would suggest&mdash;and I am sure there is agreement about it&mdash;that we ought to try to put capital into productive enterprises.  Undoubtedly, we will have to put a certain amount of capital into amenity projects, but we must be careful that there is a proper balance between the amount put into amenity projects and that put into productive enterprises.  If we can put our capital into productive enterprises we are on <Col N="1254" /> the safe road, but if we put it into amenity projects mainly the likelihood is that we will exhaust our capital resources, unless we are able to get sufficient home savings to meet the bill.  That was one of the principal economic weaknesses during the period in which we had this very large international deficit of payments.  At the same time, the savings were nil.  In fact, I think there was to a certain extent a dissaving; in other words, we were consuming more than we were producing.  Most people will agree that if we are to have a capital development here we ought to try to provide to the utmost extent for our capital development by equivalent current savings. If we are able to do that we will be in a position in which we will not necessarily have to draw on our external reserves.  But that is not going to be easy.</P>
    <P>Whilst we can all agree with the Taoiseach and with the Government&mdash; I expect that the Taoiseach has given a general indication of Government outlook&mdash;on the aims that we have in mind, ultimately it is the question of means that matters.  It is right to have the proper outlook but everything depends on the means that are to be taken.  That is where we differ. Fundamentally we have a difference with the Government because they have suggested programmes which in our opinion are not compatible.  I know that if we press them now on these points they will have the plausible and ready excuse that they have not yet had time to assess the situation. During the election campaign, however, they spoke not as people completely outside but as people who had experience of Government and who were supposed to know what the position was and did in fact know what the position was.  They suggested that it was only a question of their changing from this side of the House to the other and that everything was going to be changed overnight.  You were going to have less taxation&mdash;which, of course, everybody would like&mdash;and at the same time increased benefits, more subsidies and other things.  It is on the incompatibility of that type of programme that we differ.  We differ, <Col N="1255" /> therefore, not in the ultimate aims, those objects people ought to have in mind who are interested in the welfare of the country, but in the steps, the methods, that are to be taken to achieve those aims.</P>
    <P>This question of subsidies arises.  If you are to decrease prices of essential goods by means of subsidies, the money for the subsidies has to be found and the only way to find it is through taxation, through the revenue that would be got from taxation.  It has been suggested by those opposite that in certain circumstances the same rates of taxation will yield a higher amount.  It remains to be seen whether these circumstances will arise or be brought about.  It would look as if we are going to provide this year nearly £10,000,000 in subsidies.  There was £7.7 millions before we brought in the Budget and added £900,000 to that, making roughly £8.6 millions.</P>
    <P>Now the butter subsidy, I think, is £1,250,000.  That is, £9.8 millions or so, not very far off the £10,000,000 that is being provided this year.  Is it not quite obvious that, if you did not provide these subsidies&mdash;the famous £10,000,000 is coming up again&mdash;we would need £10,000,000 less in taxation? The question will naturally arise for anybody who is anxious about producing the best results in this country: is that the best way?  Is it better to put £10,000,000 on taxation to provide the subsidies?  It is a nice question.  From the point of view of the politician it perhaps looks all right.  You appear to be lowering the price of bread and lowering the price of butter. You are giving it to everybody and you are taking it from everybody. The only point that can be made in connection with it is, are you taking it in the same proportions? If you try to examine and see where exactly the benefit lies, it is not easy to find the dividing line and find whether, in fact, the poorer sections of the community are being benefited.</P>
    <P>A line opposite to that which they are taking at present was taken by the Labour Party when we first introduced subsidies on a large scale to get over what we thought at the time was only a temporary situation.  The Labour <Col N="1256" /> Party at that time and the present Government Parties&mdash;all of them&mdash; went out on the basis that the people had to pay for these through an increased price of tobacco, increased price of drink and so on.  My answer, I remember, was that it was better that the money should be spent on the more essential foods, bread and butter, but I was met by the Labour Party at that time who said that I did not regard a pint for a worker or a pipe of tobacco as necessary.  They are gone to the opposite side now and probably the truth may lie in between.  However, you cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated certain principles, principles in general to which I had no objection.  I was wondering why they were not published generally. It is rather remarkable that they should have been completely omitted from the Press that was supporting the Taoiseach.  One of these principles was that it was very important to get the community to understand that promises of benefits were promises by politicians to take the people's money from them and spend it for them.  I do not know whether that principle will be acted upon by the Taoiseach. In some of the statements that were made when the Coalition Parties came together it would seem that that was conveniently forgotten and that these benefits were supposed to be things which would be conferred by the bounty of the Government on the community without cost to the community. In fact, that, at the same time as these benefits were being conferred, you would have reduced rates of taxation. Under very exceptional circumstances that could happen but I do not think that one can normally plan on the basis that that will happen.  I think you will not have another Korean boom to depend on and you will not have a convenient sum available in Marshall Aid, so that it seems to me, in regard to the problems confronting the Government in dealing with these matters, the basic facts are not the same as they were in the year 1950-51.</P>
    <P>As far as the Taoiseach's statement is concerned, I have said all I want to say.  We are not opposing any of the aims but we have more than reason <Col N="1257" /> to doubt the efficacy of the methods which are indicated by the Coalition programme.  We are content to wait and see.  We have pointed out and the Government by their action have pointed out very effectively that it was not a question of changing from this side of the House over to the other side and it was not a question of doing these things overnight.  The Government have now definitely demonstrated that fact to the country although there was during the election a definite suggestion in the propaganda of the various Parties that these changes would come about at once.</P>

      <P>Some of the statements were quoted here.  Deputy Dunne, for instance.  We had quite a number.  They were of the same type as Deputy Morrissey's statement on a couple of occasions on this side of the House when he said that within 24 hours anybody who wanted to work could be put at work.  It was quite a different story, however, when they got into office.  Of course, if the people are wise enough completely to discount statements of that sort, well and good.  There were at least close on 600,000 of the voters who, evidently, did not believe them.  How many of the others did believe is a matter that we have to wait and see.  I say sincerely that, from the country's point of view, we will be glad if it is possible to burn the candle at both ends and make it grow longer in the burning. That is what, it seems to me, is suggested by the programme that was put forward, as far as practical details are concerned.  If this conjuring feat can be done and it becomes more than a conjuring trick, if it becomes a reality as far as the community is concerned, we will be very happy about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not think the Taoiseach would deal in this statement with fundamental matters.  I thought he would probably take the line that some of the other Ministers took, that they were such a short time in office that they did not know how things stood and that they would require time to see what was going to happen.  I am glad that he <Col N="1258" /> did make these fundamental statements, about which we agree.  Now it becomes a question of seeing how the means will work towards securing the ends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters that I think the Taoiseach should deal with.  The worst thing that can happen the trade of this country is uncertainty as to Government policy.  During the week-end the Minister for Agriculture made a statement regarding what he described as the raw materials of the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>I put down a parliamentary question for him.  I did not realise that he had gone to attend a conference in Paris. The statement made by the Minister for Agriculture was vague and uncertain, but it affects the livelihoods of a lot of people.  He implied that the Government was going to take taxes, tariffs and quotas off the raw materials of the agricultural industry.  Are the Government going to do that or are they not?  A statement one way or the other must be made.  Every worker employed in factories producing these goods and every firm engaged in these trades are at the moment in a position of uncertainty, and uncertainty is deadly to trade progress.</P>
      <P>A couple of Ministers were this week visiting a factory in Newbridge where binder twine, a raw material of the agricultural industry, is made. Is the tariff going to come off binder twine?  Various Deputies now sitting behind the Government attacked the idea of a protective tariff on barbed wire and agricultural fencing.  Are these tariffs going to be retained?  During the course of the recent general election campaign we had a statement from the present Minister for Agriculture regarding agricultural fertilisers which was in part contradicted by the present Taoiseach.  Does the statement last Sunday mean that the question of the quota on agricultural fertilisers is under consideration by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that these questions should be answered and that the people engaged in these trades and the workers employed in the various firms <Col N="1259" /> should know precisely where they stand.  The worst possible situation is to leave a vague impression abroad that the Government may do something without any definite indication of what that something may be.  Every trader in this country who may carry a stock of barbed wire, binder twine or some other agricultural raw material is debating whether the statement of the Minister for Agriculture means that the conditions of trade affecting these goods are to change and the desirability of reducing or minimising their stocks.  That is inevitably the consequence of uncertainty, and it should be the concern of the Government to remove that uncertainty quickly.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke about the importance of increasing agricultural production.  One Parliamentary Secretary has on more than one occasion since the change of Government, stated that the previous Government intended to put an export tax on cattle.  That statement, made by a Parliamentary Secretary subsequent to the change of Government, implies a discovery from official records of an intention on the part of the previous Government to charge an export tax on cattle.  The statement is not true.  I know that the present Minister for Lands made that statement on many occasions during the election campaign.  It was just his usual election nonsense.  I will say this much for him, that he has not repeated it as far as I know since he became a Minister but the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture made the statement more than once and has endeavoured to convey the impression that there was definite information behind it.  The statement is not true.  There is not the slightest shadow of foundation for the statement but its repetition in that way implies it is something that might happen in the foreseeable future with another political change.</P>
    <P>Clearly any acceptance of that view by a large section of producers in the country could even to-day affect the prospects of securing that expansion of agricultural production which is required.  There is an obligation on the Taoiseach to discipline his Ministers <Col N="1260" /> and Parliamentary Secretaries to see that they do not make any reckless and untrue statements of that kind, particularly statements that may be damaging to the trade prospects of particular firms and particular industries.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach during the election campaign gave a very definite indication in regard to the tax on spirits.  He argued that by an alteration in the tax on spirits he could get more revenue for the Government. Will that happen?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance it is true made a statement here which implied that the only change in prices to be expected this year was in the case of butter but on the next week-end the Minister for Industry and Commerce went round the country and made a speech which implied that other reductions in food prices will come in the near future.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Deputies on the Government side says: &ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; but it is necessary to be definite in these matters.  When a Government tries to imply by vague suggestions that things may happen which may mean profits or losses to a multitude of traders, then the conduct of business is bound to be affected.  The one thing a Government must do is to be definite and to say nothing until it can be definite in matters of that kind.  The Minister for Finance has already good reason to learn the possible consequences of public uncertainty in that regard.  The decline in the tax yield from tobacco and beer in the first quarter of this year was due entirely to the statements made by present Ministers during the election campaign, the belief they created that reductions in the taxes on these goods were going to follow a change of Government.  If that uncertainty is not removed, then the tax yield will continue to decline with the turnover of these commodities. I think there has to be now or in the near future a very definite and authoritative statement with which all Ministers are agreed in respect of these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of uncertainly will be unemployment&mdash;unnecessary unemployment, unnecessary trade depression, and the Government must try to minimise the danger of that by confining its public statements of changes to matters that are already decided.  I again ask the Taoiseach to say whether the statement made by the Minister <Col N="1262" /> for Agriculture last Sunday regarding taxes and quotas on the raw materials of agriculture means that the Government has taken any decision in regard to these matters?  If it has taken any decision, what is the decision and what are the commodities affected?  Is there any foundation for the expectation held out by some Ministers of some changes in food prices in the near future and, if so, in respect of what food prices?  I strongly urge upon him and his colleagues not to talk about these matters until they have some-things definite.</P>

One point that I think is deserving of a reply is a point raised by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera, and the other is that made by Deputy Lemass. There is only one point emerging from the speech of Deputy de Valera, Leader of the Opposition, which calls for any reply.  His speech, which was general in tone and substance, was one with which I could agree in most respects, but in regard to his suggestion that there had been, during the course of the election campaign, something in the nature of a guarantee or promise that everything would be changed overnight, I want to enter here on the records of this House a most emphatic denial.  If there was one thing clear and definite during the course of the general election campaign so far as I was concerned it was that I was making no promises.</P>

At no stage did I, or anybody connected with me, give any promise to anybody in the course of the general election campaign; and I want here and now to nail as utterly untrue the suggestions made during the piece of political buffoonery to which this House was subjected by Deputy Lemass during the debate on the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>Everybody knew&mdash;I hope that I can say this without any undue self-esteem&mdash;that if there was to be a change of Government I would be the unfortunate instrument who would bring about that change.  The very fact that that was so was conscious to my mind and apparent in every utterance I made.  I was not so anxious to get into that position that I was prepared to make an irresponsible statement.  I was prepared to stand upon the strict truth and upon the one solid basis that any Government with which I would be associated <Col N="1264" /> would make no promises.  I want to make that clear.  Deputy Lemass can continue with his political buffoonery this year and for the next four years because everybody who listened to me during the course of the general election campaign knows that what I have stated was the fundamental basis upon which any new Government founded on an association of the various Parties comprising an inter-Party Government would be formed.</P>

      <P>This is an interruption by a Deputy who is new to this House.  I hope that in the process of time the Deputy will learn the courtesies of this House.  I refuse to allow Deputy Lemass or any of his back <Col N="1265" /> benchers to draw me.  His ally, the <i>Irish Times</i>, came to his assistance in an endeavour to put me in difficulties by addressing ten questions to me.  I will read a few sentences from that, and only a few.  It was the basis of the famous, ill-timed, ill-advised attack through the medium of the <i>Irish Times</i> editorial the day before the actual election.  I will quote only a few sentences from these answers:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not, therefore, propose to repeat the action of our opponents in 1951, when they made specific promises which they subsequently broke.  They failed to keep their specific promises to maintain subsidies and not to restore certain taxes.  I am prepared to make only one promise&mdash;to provide good government to the best of my ability.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was my statement published by the <i>Irish Times</i> in an effort to put me in political difficulty and secure, so far as they could, that certain votes would not be given to me.  I suppose, when people make promises at political meetings, the electorate think they will get benefits.  The corollary to that is that if one does not make promises one does oneself political damage.  I took that risk, and I took it most deliberately. I took the very definite resolution that in the 12-point programme we made no promise; we merely set out aims.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on the Budget of 1952, the amount of taxation which I then said, and now repeat, was unnecessary, was a sum of something between £8,000,000 and £10,000,000.  I demonstrated that at the time and it was proved to be true in the course of events.</P>

This additional expenditure of £10,000,000 was covered last year and the year before by the same taxes, which I said were £10,000,000 in excess of the 1952 requirements.

      <P>You were financing an additional £10,000,000 by the same taxes that you put on two years ago but which were unnecessary at that time.  It was necessary in the last two years because you increased expenditure by some £10,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass speaks about uncertainty and about the necessity for our giving a clear statement because of uncertainty in trade.  The one remarkable feature of recent weeks, since the change of Government, has been the stability and calm in business and in the community generally because of the change of Government.  Any uncertainty that has been created has been created by speeches of the type and character <Col N="1268" /> that Deputy Lemass has been indulging in in the last few weeks.  He has been indulging in the political buffoonery which we have witnessed here and which did him much more damage than it did us in the country. Unfortunately, they tended to do much damage to the people, but I am glad to say that our people have demonstrated that they have reached the stage of political maturity and judgment and are able to assess, at their proper value, speeches of the type which Deputy Lemass has been indulging in for some time past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said, only a short time ago and on many occasions towards the end of 1953, that our international balance of payments problem had been solved.  According to Deputy MacEntee, the then Minister for Finance, the outstanding problem that he had to solve was to produce correctives in the Budget of 1952 for the deficit in the balance of payments.  It was because of these so-called correctives that were put into that Budget in 1952 by the then Minister for Finance that our people suffered such unnecessary hardships within the last few years.  These were supposed to correct the balance of payments crisis that was referred to by Deputy Lemass and by Deputy MacEntee in 1951.  Deputy Lemass when on this side ran away from that in the discussion on the White Paper on external trade but Deputy MacEntee stuck to his guns.  Deputy Lemass ran away from it and agreed with me.  I then said that there was no crisis but a problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee called it an outstanding problem and said that, because of the deficit in our international balance of payments, it was necessary to introduce the economic correctives that he imposed on the unfortunate people of this country by the Budget of 1952.  What did these correctives constitute towards a solution of that problem?  Ill-considered action and wrong remedies were devised for a non-existent disease and the country has suffered ever since.  Now at the end of all that our people have suffered &mdash;the hardship and the austerity&mdash; and, notwithstanding what Deputy de <Col N="1269" /> Valera has said that hardship and austerity should be necessarily imposed on the people for the purpose of correcting the adverse balance of trade, we now find ourselves in the position this year that we are facing the same problem of an adverse balance of trade though not perhaps of the same magnitude.</P>
    <P>In spite of all that has been done, that is the position that we take over after three years of austerity, three years of unnecessarily high taxation to deal with this so-called crisis in our balance of payments.  We pointed out at the time that what did happen was going to happen, that our agricultural exports were going to increase and to correct the very situation then so much talked of.  We hope to do the same again, to increase agricultural production by our policy on agriculture on our return to office.</P>
    <P>As I have said, any uncertainty there was was created, not by any speeches of the Minister for Agriculture, but by speeches of the type that we have listened to from Deputy Lemass trying to create uncertainty about this, that and the other.</P>

      <P>We will decide in our own way and in our own time.  The truculent remarks of Deputy Lemass are designed for the purpose of creating uncertainty.  The Deputy referred to modern electioneering methods.  I refer to the words from the circular asking for funds to which Deputy Lemass put his signature before the general election.  These modern electioneering methods are the same sort of methods which were adopted by him here to-day suggesting that people were going to lose their jobs.  In the short time which was at my disposal when speaking over Radio Éireann during the election campaign I had to waste very valuable minutes repudiating the suggestions made by <Col N="1270" /> Deputy Lemass that all those people in fertiliser factories and in industries of various kinds were going to lose their jobs.  He was at the same game then as now.</P>
      <P>We are here as the result of the general election.  That game did not work then and it will not work now. We have a serious job to do and we are here to tackle it seriously.  We are here not for the purpose of getting any political kudos or for purposes of our own.  We have a job to do.  We believe that we have a proper policy and that we are going to succeed.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £13,500 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for a Grant to An Chomhairle Ealaíon (No. 9 of 1951).</P>
      <P>The sums provided for An Chomhairle Ealaíon in each of the past three financial years were: 1951-52, £1,100; 1952-53, £10,000 and 1953-54, £20,000. The provision of £20,000 is, on the face of it, the same figure as that for last year, but in actual fact it is £8,600 more because of the fact that there was a proposal by An Chomhairle Ealaíon to purchase the Rotunda buildings, a project which was not proceeded with.  The grant for this year was determined on the basis of the following figures of anticipated expenditure by the council: Salaries, travelling, rent and incidental expenses, £2,350; grants to be made by the council, £15,500 and unallocated balance, £2,150.</P>
      <P>The report and accounts of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, covering the period from the inception of the council on the 4th December, 1951, up to 31st March, 1953, were presented to the Dáil by the Government on the 28th July, 1953, pursuant to Sections 6 (3) and 7 (1) of the Arts Act, 1951.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to the passing of this Bill through all stages to-day, but as this is the last stage of the financial discussions there are a few observations I would like to make.  First of all, I would like to make it quite clear, so far as I am concerned, that I did not accuse the Taoiseach of basing his election campaign on his promise to reduce prices from taxation&mdash;quite the contrary.  In every speech I made, and particularly during the two speeches I made from Radio Eireann, I endeavoured to point out to the electorate that the Taoiseach <Col N="1272" /> was carefully avoiding committing himself to the promises that the back benchers of his Party and the constituency representatives of his Party were making.  There was not a Deputy opposite who does not know that in his constituency specific promises were made that if there was a change of Government there would be an immediate reduction in taxes and prices generally.  The point that I tried to put before the electorate was that while these promises were being made on the basis of individual candidates and Party representatives calling to private houses, the Taoiseach, Mr. Costello, was carefully avoiding committing himself in the same way.</P>
      <P>I described that as a shabby trick upon the people.  Now that the trick has been demonstrated in the Taoiseach's speech here to-day to be precisely what we described it, it is all the shabbier on that account. Here, this afternoon, the Taoiseach has formally repudiated every promise made by every candidate of Fine Gael and the Labour Party during the election. Every undertaking given by every representative of these Parties to the people of this country for the reduction of taxation and prices has been formally and finally repudiated here this evening by the Taoiseach. That is the significance of the Taoiseach's speech here and it is just as well that its significance should be appreciated not merely by the members of this House but by the public generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has refused to answer certain questions of mine regarding the possible effects on trade of certain recent ministerial statements.  He seemed to be blaming me because the Minister for Agriculture went out and made a speech last week-end.  I did not send him out.  Presumably his colleagues in the Government knew he was going out and presumably they knew what he was going to say&mdash;or did they?  The Minister for Agriculture went out and indicated that his policy was to secure the removal of certain taxes, tariffs and quotas. Is that Government policy?  The Taoiseach got annoyed because I asked <Col N="1273" /> him that question.  Am I not entitled to ask the Government what its policy is or to ask the Taoiseach to explain the policy of the Government?  Is the policy of the Government to do what the Minister for Agriculture suggested last week, to remove all taxes, tariffs and quotas on what he described as the raw materials of agriculture?  If the Taoiseach does not know the policy of the Government and consequently cannot answer that question here to-day, if there has to be some reconciling of differences within the Cabinet on that issue, let us be told that but do let us have a statement from the Government on that position within a week or a fortnight before too much damage is done.</P>
    <P>I want to know what is the expectation of the Government regarding the price of tea.  There is not a Deputy opposite who does not know that every tea retailer is at the present time on a quota from his wholesaler and that he cannot get tea on order.  There is a general expectation that the price of tea may go up and a consequent disposition on the part of the wholesalers and retailers to hold on to stocks.  Any uncertainty in that regard can be removed by a definite statement by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a week ago for a statement on policy regarding tea. Again the Minister dealing with that debate evaded the question.  What is the reason for this evasion?  Does not every Deputy in the House know that the Government has to come to some decision in regard to tea in the near future, a decision either to subsidise the price or make some arrangement which will enable the higher cost of replacing present stocks to be met by Tea Importers, Limited?  Is the present position in which tea imports are canalised through Tea Importers, Limited, likely to be continued?  I am <Col N="1275" /> asked these questions myself.  I am sure every other Deputy sitting behind the Government is being asked similar questions and I am wondering if certain Deputies are asking these questions in the Minister's private office and what replies they are getting.  Is it fair that individual Government Deputies should know the Government's mind on these matters which affect the interest of the trade while this information should be kept from the public as a whole?  Is that what Deputy Morrissey is trying to evade?</P>

      <P>If I may deal with the danger that was mentioned by Deputy Lemass of tea prices being increased, I should like to say that in the past, the group that import tea into this country were allowed to purchase 2,000,000 lb. of tea on the London market at 1/2½ a lb., and that tea was permitted to be sold to the trade at 3/2½ a lb.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass came in here at the beginning of this <Col N="1279" /> session and he told us at the outset of his remarks that Deputy Costello had made all sorts of promises before the election.  Then when I proved to him that, on the contrary, Deputy Costello made no promises and that Deputy Lemass and his colleagues had told the people that Deputy Costello was not promising anything, he changed his tune and he said that all the Deputies on this side of the House had been making promises during the election campaign of immediate reductions but although he brought in piles of newspapers, he was able to produce only one quotation to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>I got a whole pile sent to me since.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman:</NameTxt>
      <P>There was only one that he was able to pick out of the whole pile which dealt with the question of an immediate reduction.  The Deputy has had recourse to the old game of setting up ninepins for the purpose of knocking them down and suggesting that the ninepins which he has knocked down were those of his opponents.  The Deputy knows that he is just engaged in a species of shadow boxing.  I do not know in what circles the Deputy is moving at the present moment when he talks about the uncertainty and the anxiety in business circles.  I have some contact with business circles and I meet people in business circles in Dublin almost every day.  I can say that, far from there being any doubt or anxiety&mdash;and I am referring not only to people who are supporters of the Government&mdash;amongst the business community, there is an air of peace and calmness amongst them.  Even businessmen who are strong supporters of Fianna Fáil agree and admit that there is an air of calmness around business dealings at the present moment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was very cocksure that he was going to win a second seat for Fianna Fáil but he has got his answer.  The people of North Galway have assessed him at his correct value.  Deputy Lemass knows very well that what he is trying is a political tactic.  Personally, I think it is a foolish political tactic because I think the people appreciate his true motives and are condemning the Deputy for it.  He is attempting the political tactic of firing off, day after day, machine-gun questions at this Government before they have got an opportunity of settling down, in the hope that some member of the Government may say something around which the Deputy will be able to hang his hat at a later stage.  He is just trying to bounce something across the House.  The Deputy ought to know that we are not going to be taken in, or to fall for that type of tactic.</P>
