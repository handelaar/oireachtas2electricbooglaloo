      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will indicate if it will be possible for merchants in rural areas who install drying plants to obtain the maximum price for dried wheat payable at present only to the millers throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is presumed that the price referred to by the Deputy is the price payable by flour millers for artificially dried wheat purchased from licensed wheat dealers.  It is not proposed to extend the present list of licensed wheat dealers and, therefore, merchants who are not so licensed may not purchase wheat from growers for resale.  Merchants who have drying facilities or propose to provide such facilities are, however, free to negotiate with the flour millers for the drying of wheat on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, as I know the position at the present moment, there are 36 people in this country who can dry wheat.  A good many merchants have applied to those concerned and have been refused drying facilities.  Would the Minister not care to make representations to the millers himself on their behalf? Further, if I might suggest with the changing conditions and combined harvesters being used now every merchant has got to install dryers at considerable expense and it is not economic for them to do so.  They are going to be at a heavy loss unless given the right to get the dry price for wheat as against the green price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent millers entering into an agreement with any merchant in the country and making arrangements to have the wheat dried for them.  As regards the number of dealers who are dryers it is not our intention to increase that number.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but does the Minister appreciate that flour millers have virtually in this country a monopoly and that many merchants up and down the country have made representations to them and have been informed point blank by the Flour Millers' Association that they have control of the matter and do not intend to surrender it?  It is throwing a lot of hardship back on the farmer who is the producer and on the merchant as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go over matters that were raised on the Second Stage last week save to repeat very briefly the objection which I have to this section remaining part of the Bill. As I indicated on the Second Reading, I feel we are legislating in Section 3 retrospectively and that the justification in certain circumstances for retrospective legislation is not here in the circumstances of this case.  I believe that there would be great hardship on the particular tenant in this case if this section was not put through the Dáil, but I think it is wrong for the Dáil merely because a question of hardship <Col N="410" /> is involved to get away from the principle, and in fact abrogate a principle of such vital importance as is involved in this section.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated, I believe the landlord in this particular case has got contractual rights declared to be given to him by the President of the High Court.  I do not agree with the Deputies who spoke last week and who said it was a mere technicality.  It is possible to wave aside every decision of the courts by saying such a decision was given on a mere technicality.  It was not given on a technicality.  It was given on the interpretation of the Act as it stood and as passed by this House.  The fact that it was wrongly passed by this House should not alter the principle involved which is that the courts have declared that an individual &mdash;in this particular case a landlord&mdash; has got certain rights, an ancillary to which will be his right to claim arrears of rent.  We are now taking away those rights from him by this Section 3.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter I want to raise on this section which I think is of equal importance and that is the constitutionality of this particular section. I would ask the Minister to state whether he has been advised by the Attorney-General whether this particular section is, in fact, constitutional. I think this case comes very close indeed to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case known as the Sinn Féin funds case and I would just like very briefly to quote to the Dáil a section from the judgment of the Supreme Court, of Mr. Justice O'Byrne as quoted in the 1950 Irish Reports, page 82.  It reads as follows (referring to Article 43, which refers to the rights of private persons):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It seems to us that the article was intended to enshrine and protect the property rights of the individual citizen of the State and that the rights of the individual are thereby protected, subject to the right of the State, as declared in Clause 2, to regulate the exercise of such rights in accordance with the principles of social justice and to delimit the exercise of such rights so as to reconcile their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> It seems to me quite clear that we are taking away a right of a person in this Bill and we would have to persuade the High Court&mdash;if the constitutionality of this Bill were to come before them&mdash;that the Dáil by so doing was regulating the exercise, in this case, of the landlord's rights in accordance with the principles of social justice and also that we were delimiting in this particular case the landlord's rights to reconcile them in their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>I would be extremely doubtful that it could be held that it is necessary for the exigencies of the common good that the Bill should be passed into law or that it is necessary that these rights are regulated under this particular Bill according to the principles of social justice.  I should like to find out from the Minister whether he has obtained the opinion of the Attorney-General on the constitutionality of this particular section of the Bill as I feel it is very close to the decision of the Supreme Court in the Sinn Féin funds case.  I also repeat the objection which I dealt with at greater length on Second Reading as to the manner in which we are legislating retrospectively to deal with a case of hardship, admittedly, but none the less taking away a legal right from an individual person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand we have no amendment before us.  We are pretty well back on the ground we covered the last day.  On the previous occasion I understood that Deputy Costello based his argument on that of retrospective legislation.  Furthermore, I believe it was generally conceded in the House that in all the circumstances of this case it seemed to be a justifiable case to be dealt with in the way this section proposes to deal with it.  I approached the matter from the point of view of the basis of the decision.  I should like to know, before I go any further, whether any further light or information is available as to the exact nature of that decision or whether the basis on which I approached it before is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the basis is correct I think I would <Col N="412" /> repeat the arguments I made the last day.  In the first place I quite agree that we should lean against retrospective legislation but I do not agree that we are completely bound.  The principle should be a guiding principle and should not be departed from except for a serious reason.  Beyond that I think we are free to provide for contingencies such as have arisen under this Act.  If this were the very first instance on which we were to line that principle, I would have considerable hesitancy about so doing.  But there are numerous instances of legislation in this House from time to time over the last 30 years where there have been enactments with retrospective effect so that we are not introducing any new principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not retrospective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event let us come back to the principle of this.  I am conceding to Deputy Costello as I did before, with some care, because I think the point is one worthy of attention, that retrospective legislation should only be undertaken after great caution. It would require considerable justification. I still feel that you had a position under the 1946 Act where in regard to the rights of property in relation to the rights of landlord and tenant certain tenancies were regulated by statute.  In that case rights of property were dealt with, adjusted and taken away, if you like, in some cases and conferred in others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under that Act the intention was perfectly clear as to what was really intended.  Quite apart from the niceties <Col N="413" /> of legal interpretation, I think no man of common sense reading the Act can say that the intention was other than that which was operated until this decision arose.  On the other hand I see quite clearly that when it is pressed to a matter of close construction the courts of necessity, when the matter comes up before them, must look at the matter in the way of close construction.  Furthermore, they are coerced by such principles as that rights shall not be taken away unless it is clearly expressed that they should be, etc.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances a distinction appears to have been drawn between the words &ldquo;district justice&rdquo; and &ldquo;court&rdquo;.  The intention of the House and the Legislature was perfectly clear. It was clear and agreed upon by everybody here.  It appeared to be so clear and implicit that it was being operated by the District Courts and it was being accepted by other courts for a considerable time.  It was clearly intended that as from 1946 a tenant would be in the position by means of a cheap procedure to go before a district justice and get a provisional order with a minimum of costs securing for him the benefits that the Act proposed to give to him and the tenant, having done that, there were certain provisions for preserving the landlord's right in the matter.  But in the net the intention was clearly that as from 1946 all tenants coming within that category should have the benefit of the provisions of that Act.  I do not think that can be controverted.  What, in fact, happened?</P>
    <P>Certain tenants availed of the procedure of the Act and they got no more than it was intended they should get. The common-sense intention of the Act, if you like, was applied and a number of tenants had their rights as from the date they got their order. Then, of course, a tenant appeals and on the technical point, apparently a point of construction, succeeds.  That case resulted in the tenant finding that he had not these rights as from the time he thought he had and could only enforce such rights as he had under the Act as from the present moment so to <Col N="414" /> speak.  That was something which was not contemplated under the Act.  In those circumstances I think the equities and the merits seem to be with inserting this provision in the Act.</P>
    <P>In a sense there is a certain dilemma before us, something purely formal. The view expressed by Deputy Costello would probably be the more sustainable one, but from the human point of view I think there is a lot to be said for the argument that if you put the tenant back in the position he was intended to be in you will not have done any real injustice to anybody.  It was intended that he should have these benefits and rights as from that date. There is no injustice done to the landlord either because it was intended that he should be in that position, whereas if you leave the matter stand you will find that the tenant is not only deprived of his rights which it was intended he should have for a considerable period, but it may also affect a very large number of tenants.  A very large number could be affected apart from the one individual case.</P>

If there is not, well and good, but, on the whole, you are more or less caught whether it is going to be retrospective for the landlord or retrospective for the tenant and that was the case we tried to make for the section on the past occasion.  About the constitutionality of it in regard to the principle of retrospective legislation I do not know but on the question of taking away a right of property, perhaps there is quite a lot in what Deputy Costello has said.  However, I think it is a matter for the Minister to look into.  This is a specific vested right in an individual and if&mdash;and here is a question which is really one for the legal advisers of the Minister&mdash;it can be shown to be specifically restricted to some individual cases, as Deputy Sweetman suggested across the floor of the House now, I think there is substance in Deputy Costello's point.</P>

      <P>Whether the section is necessary from the point of view of safeguarding against the situation to which I referred in relation to a number of other tenants of preventing retrospective effect&mdash;and even in the individual case that argument can be applied&mdash;on the whole this does need some consideration.</P>
      <P>If you take it that there is a number of cases concerned, then I think the arguments we have made on this side hold and a court would be quite reasonable in its approach and that the arguments that were actually made here would be accepted in court because of the public need.  If, on the other hand, it can be tied down to one individual case then the story might be different but it did seem to me on a cursory reading of the Act&mdash;and let us take Section 2 in conjunction with Section 3&mdash;that it was necessary to effect the general intention of Section 3.  Deputy Costello has referred me to Section 2.  Which part of the section is he referring to as having the effect of closing all other gaps even retrospectively?</P>

      <P>I am speaking about the way the courts would interpret it and it does seem to me on first reading that Section 3 was necessary to complete the picture and that in the absence of Section 3 there was a possibility of interpreting it in the way in which I have said.  However, there is no use in trying to entangle the matter in that way in the House.  On the previous occasion I argued that, taking the general case, the merits were in favour of the tenant, and the House seemed to be of the same opinion.</P>

      <P>That being so this is a justifiable case for retrospective legislation of the sort here.  If Deputy Costello is right in the contention that there is a constitutional point in it, it is very proper that that should be raised and brought to the notice of the Minister but even so it is probably better to put the Bill through as it stands now rather than to delete that section.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Vivion de Valera had been practising at the Bar I would not say what I feel I can say since he is in an another more exalted sphere, that he had not read the Bill before he came into the House.  I think his speech made it clear he had not.  Two entirely different things are visualised under Section 2 and Section 3.  Section 2 is the section retrospectively declaring in more clear terms what I believe the Legislature intended in 1946.  It is undesirable as a <Col N="418" /> principle that we should be retrospective but&mdash;and to this extent I must agree with Deputy de Valera&mdash;it is desirable that that would be a guiding principle and not a rigid rule and the merits clearly, in my view, warrant us in departing from the principle to the extent of Section 2.  As I understand the position&mdash;and certainly the Minister led us to believe that this was the position-there has been so far one case and one case only in which an order has been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been one judgment&mdash;shall I put it that way, because the two judgments were the same&mdash;and one judgment only.  I may say that I concede Section 2 to him entirely, but in Section 3 the Minister is, in fact, setting up the Oireachtas as a court of appeal over the legal courts. There is only the one case, for all practical purposes: we may call it the one case.  The courts have decided that, in that case, the parties to the action &mdash;one <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other-have certain legal rights.  Now that the courts have made that declaration, the Minister comes here and says that he does not like the decision the courts have taken and that he is going to turn it upside down by Section 3.  I am not suggesting that Deputy Boland as Minister for Justice is doing that as a sort of Mephistopheles, but if you analyse it down to bedrock that is exactly what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Deputy Major de Valera was speaking on this subject I think the Parliamentary Secretary prompted him about the retrospective provision in the Mental Treatment Bill which we considered here before Christmas.  I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for having so prompted the Deputy because, in fact, it is a very strong argument in favour of our contention. It will be remembered that in the Mental Treatment Bill we were very careful to leave out of the mental home the person who had successfully contested the interpretation of the Act in the courts.  What we did in that Bill was that we legislated along the lines <Col N="419" /> of Section 2 of this Bill&mdash;and we were very careful to omit any Section 3.</P>
    <P>The Mental Treatment Bill&mdash;to which Deputy Major de Valera made mention at the instance of his colleague &mdash;is the best possible precedent to have Section 3 of this Bill omitted.  I seriously suggest to the Minister that the only effect of Section 3 is to set up the Oireachtas as a court of appeal in an individual case&mdash;taking away contractual rights that have already been declared by the court.  I believe, from my understanding of the Constitution, that so to do may be unconstitutional. I do not know whether or not it will be contested in the particular case but if it is I think we will be in the position that we may find that not only is Section 3 unconstitutional but that the Bill and the safeguards we are trying to get for the 999 other tenants under Section 2 will also go by the board until we can bring in a new Bill again. As I understand it, it will be the entire Bill that will go, not merely the one section, because it is not a Bill that is in parts.  You can deal with parts of a Bill as such but I do not think you can take out a single section and have the rest of the Bill left; that is something that is not worth the candle.</P>
    <P>If the Minister feels that, if he drops Section 3, between this afternoon and the day the Seanad meets and passes this Bill there will be another flood of motions for provisional orders of certiorari&mdash;if that is the Minister's view &mdash;and if, on the Report Stage this evening or to-morrow, he tables an amendment that will prevent new applicants then I am quite prepared to support him because that is an entirely different thing.</P>
    <P>The decision of the court has been given.  That decision has created contractual rights between the parties.  We are setting those rights aside by this section and are, in fact, acting as a court of appeal in a particular case. No matter on what side of the House we may be sitting, I think Deputies will agree that that is not a proper thing for the Oireachtas to do.  The Oireachtas should lay down the general principles-and we are very properly laying down those principles in Section 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging from some of the speeches which we have heard, one would think that I did not bother to find out whether or not this matter was unconstitutional.  I go by the advice I am given and I am assured that it is quite constitutional.  If it went to the court, another opinion might be given; I do not know about that.  I definitely and specifically raised the point as to whether or not it is constitutional and my legal advisers tell me that it is.  The court quashed this order and we are accepting that; we are accepting that that order was bad.  We are telling the district justice to go into the case and make a provisional order with retrospective effect.  Everybody who was in the Dáil and in the Seanad at the time the main Bill was being enacted was well aware that it was our intention that, in this matter, the district justice was to have as much right to apportion the valuation of a premises, or of a room which included some furniture or amenities such as lighting and heating, as he had in respect of an empty room.  Unfortunately we left out the words &ldquo;district justice&rdquo; when dealing with an apartment which had electric <Col N="421" /> light and furniture in it.  I would say that that is a pure technicality.  What about the tenant?  The tenant believed as everyone else believed, that he had a full right to get his rent reduced. Others had got it before him.</P>
      <P>The accumulated rent payable since last April represents very big arrears for a working man.  We have to face the dilemma either of depriving the landlord of something or of depriving the tenant.  As I said last week, on the equities of the case, they are with the tenant.  Others have got the same concession.  It was purely a technicality that deprived them of the rights.  I have thought over the matter in the course of the week-end and I must say that I do not see any reason for putting down an amendment.  I was thinking of an amendment and then I decided that, in all the circumstances, Section 3 should stand.  If the section is unconstitutional there is another place to decide that point.  I am advised that it is constitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree to giving to the tenant the right to go back to the District Court to have a new provisional order made.  What we are doing under Section 2&mdash;and we are all agreed on Section 2&mdash;is that we are allowing tenants, who at the moment have provisional orders, the protection of Section 2.  That section protects them against landlords who could, as a result of this High Court decision, come in and have these provisional orders quashed.</P>
      <P>I would be prepared to agree that the tenant in this particular case should not be in any worse position than all the other tenants who may have provisional orders at the moment which are quashable and which have not been quashed.  I would, therefore, suggest that under Section 3 we would entitle the tenant in this particular case to return to the District Court and have his rent reduced but to knock out the portion in sub-section (2) which says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;the rent to be paid for the premises, as on and from the gale day next following the making of the order which was quashed, shall be the rent fixed by the provisional order or, in <Col N="422" /> the event of an application by the landlord under the said Section 31, by the court on the final determination of the matter under that section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That would give the tenant the right to apply to the district justice and have his rent reduced.  It would not give him the right to have his rent reduced retrospectively, as will be the effect of this section.  It will give the landlord in this particular case the right to claim arrears of rent.</P>
    <P>I can visualise the prospect of the landlord in this case bringing ejectment proceedings for non-payment of rent but I think a court would be extremely lenient in this particular case in putting a stay of execution on the order on payment of the arrears and, I am sure, in very small sums, in view of the hardship in this case.  It would be much better to leave to the courts the granting of a certain amount of leniency rather than we ourselves being lenient to the tenant in what I regard as an unconstitutional way.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, therefore, to accept or at any rate consider an amendment by which the tenant in this particular case would be entitled to apply to the court and have a provisional order made notwithstanding the fact that his provisional order has already been quashed and not to legislate as we are in sub-section (2) to the effect that the rent to be paid will be the rent payable from the gale day next after the quashing of the old provisional order.</P>
    <P>That would be a fair compromise which would not take away the landlord's rights and would not completely negative the tenant's rights.  I do not think it would be unconstitutional.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If this section is passed the landlord still has his right to go to the court and perhaps get a higher rent fixed than was fixed in the provisional order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case extra rent may be fixed but, if extra rent were fixed, he would be entitled to get the arrears of that.  The other suggestion would be far too much because the <Col N="423" /> tenant was definitely under the impression, and so was everybody, until this technical fault was found, that he was entitled to the full reduction he got. The landlord did not avail of the three months.  I understand they examined the Act and found where they were and that that is how the matter arose.  The landlord neglected in the three months to do what he was instructed to do. Then he discovered that he had slipped up.  He looked at the matter and found this technical fault&mdash;that is all it was. He will have the right to go back to the court, the same as the tenant, and claim an increase, if he objects to the rent fixed.  That is meeting it fairly enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>One is whether the section is unconstitutional or not.  As to that, doctors differ and patients die. The Minister has his opinion on it.  We have ours.  It is not merely our opinion, it is the opinion of people whom we consider competent to advise us.  Quite apart from whether it is constitutional or not, the Minister is putting himself in the position of being an appeal court.  The Minister under the Constitution can do that but it is highly undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as hardship is concerned&mdash;if I may use the word&mdash;that can be easily got over if the Minister does not feel that the district justice has sufficient power to grant a stay of execution so as to provide that the arrears will be <Col N="424" /> paid over a period of years by instalments of 1d. or 2d. a week.  It is not the amount that I am concerned about; it is the principle involved. Once you get the principle that this House will act as a court of appeal then, in fact, you are starting to undermine the independence of the judiciary and of the courts.  I do not think the Minister appreciates that that is what he is doing.  That is what he is doing. That is highly undesirable.  We can quite easily get a form of words that would protect the individual from undue hardship and save the principle, if that is what is worrying the Minister. What is worrying the Minister may be that there may be a flood-gate of provisional orders between now and next week, when the Seanad meets. If that is so we could easily get a form of words to prevent that.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned, we take the view very strongly that once you start to put this House in the position of upsetting a particular judgment, you are starting to undermine the independence of the courts.  Once you start along that road you are going on a very slippery slope indeed.</P>

      <P>One of the principles behind this Bill will certainly be accepted by the Fine Gael Party.  As I understand the principle behind the provisions of the Bill, it is to spend considerable sums of money on works of national development.  It has been a cardinal point of our policy to accept that principle.  The budgetary methods adopted by Deputy McGilligan when he was Minister for Finance, including the capital Budget which he introduced here shortly after he became Minister, were designed to ensure that the country would know exactly the amount of capital development each year being undertaken by the State. Those methods were also designed to ensure that the maximum amount of capital development would be undertaken by the State.  I am in complete agreement with any legislative proposals which are designed towards increasing domestic capital investment, and investment where necessary on the part of the State.</P>
      <P>I think there is no doubt, in view of the turn of affairs in the last two and a half years, that it is of great necessity and urgency that works of national development be undertaken by the State.  It is being pressed time and time again by speakers from these benches that the State should undertake works of a capital nature in order to prime the pump, in order to ensure that the resources of the State are developed to the maximum.  When private enterprise cannot undertake these works&mdash;or will not do so, in many instances&mdash;it is the duty of the State to undertake them.  For the last two and a half years we on these benches have been pressing this principle. When the Party of which I am a member was part of a Government, between 1948 and 1951, it carried out that policy by means of the capital investment programme which it expanded so greatly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot help feeling that the effects of the last two and a half years demonstrate the inability of the present Government either to accept fully that policy or to carry it out.  I have not the figures&mdash;I do not know whether they are available&mdash;for domestic <Col N="426" /> capital investment last year; but there is no doubt that in 1952 there was a sharp decline in domestic capital investment in this country.  There is also no doubt that the decline in employment was directly attributable to the decline in domestic capital investment. That is a set of circumstances which we deplore.  Where that type of conditions exists, it is the duty of the State to step in and, if the private sector of the economy is unable to provide the maximum amount of capital development, the State itself should undertake it.  Our objection to the Government's financial policy over the last two and a half years is that by means of its budgetary policy it has cut down, through excessive taxation, on the initiative and the ability of the private sector of the economy to invest in works of a capital nature.  It has dampened down on demand, it has sucked up purchasing power and that has resulted in a slowing down in the whole development of our economy. We, on the other hand, always held the policy that part of the budgetary policy of the Minister for Finance should be to ensure that the private sector of the economy has got initiative and is given the ability to invest as much capital as possible in this country.</P>
    <P>Hand in hand with that policy has been the realisation that no matter what initiative is undertaken by the private sector of the economy there is still not enough capital development undertaken to ensure full employment and maintain the maximum production from our land and our resources.  For that reason, it has been necessary greatly to expand the works of a capital nature undertaken by the central authority.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to compare the tremendous expansion of the State capital programme with, say, 1938-39. In that year a sum of a little over £1,500,000 was expended on works of a capital nature.  Between 1948 and 1951 the capital development programme of the State was expanded three or four fold and the results were there for everyone to see&mdash;the expansion of the economy, the reduction of unemployment, the increase everywhere in purchasing power, which led to more production <Col N="427" /> and a rise in the standard of living.  The trouble in the last two and a half years was the reversal of that programme, the cutting down of the purchasing power and the restriction of spending, which was the result of the two Fianna Fáil Budgets.</P>
    <P>This Bill which is now before the House is an endeavour to remedy the condition which has been brought about by the budgetary policy of the last two and a half years.  For that reason it is to be welcomed.  As I say, we are in complete agreement with the principle of expanding as much as possible the State side of the capital formation in the country, as long as it does not interfere with the private sector of the economy.  I do not think that for many years to come that set of circumstances will come about.  At the present time the State capital investment is complementary to and not contradictory of the capital investment undertaken in the private sector.  Therefore, our opposition to this Bill is not based on the principle of State capital development but is based rather on the manner in which it is proposed to undertake that development under the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I regard this Bill as introducing a fundamentally bad principle into our national finances.  It must be clearly understood what we are doing by the Bill&mdash;we are giving the Minister for Finance £20,000,000 to do what he likes with.  It is true that we are giving him directions as to how he is to spend the £20,000,000, but in fact, he is going to be empowered to choose at his own discretion what are projects of development of a public character, and what are in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Now, I think the principle in this Bill is cutting across all the principles of State finance as we have known it up to the present time, and I do not think that the circumstances at the present time justify such a departure from principle.  At the present time, the Dáil and the country know the general heads of expenditure undertaken by the central authority.  They know the particular items on which there is to be expenditure under the heading of supply services.  They know what particular works of a capital nature are <Col N="428" /> to be undertaken under the provisions of the various Acts which have been passed from time to time in this House. We are now departing from that principle, and we are now giving the Minister for Finance very wide and farreaching powers to spend money, as he thinks fit, without any control and without any previous directive from the Dáil as to how the money should be spent.</P>
    <P>As I say, the exigencies of the present time do not warrant such a grave departure from financial rectitude. I could see no objection at all to amending some of the existing legislation for increasing the demands of the capital Budget, if necessary, so that the money payable under the existing capital investment programme undertaken by the Government should be increased and should be speeded up. Any such proposals to speed up works of national development in order to relieve the unemployment situation at the present time would be welcomed by this side of the House.  The Minister has done no such thing.  Instead, he is asking the Dáil to pass an Act to set up a pool in which it is proposed to put £5,000,000 per annum, and he is asking for authority to spend that money as he thinks fit in the national interest and for works of a public character.</P>
    <P>I can see nothing wrong with the present method by which the finances of our State are directed into the various channels of public development and various works of a national character.  When the Budget comes before the Dáil every year we have a statement of the manner in which the Government propose to spend the sums voted by the Dáil and to spend the sums raised by borrowing.  We are now departing from that principle and we are in fact allowing the Minister to spend £5,000,000 per annum, or £20,000,000 in all, as he thinks fit.  An extension of this principle is merely to vote £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 per annum to the Government each year to spend on works of a public character in the national interest.  Once we have accepted the principle that we just vote money <i>en bloc</i> to the Minister and give him blanket authority to spend it as he likes, there is no reason why the <Col N="429" /> Minister should not come in next year and ask for £10,000,000 or the year after and ask for £30,000,000.  As I say, once having accepted that principle, it will be a simple thing to amend the Bill each year.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the existing method of the payment of money on works of a capital nature should be departed from.  I do accept the necessity of increasing the capital development undertaken by the State.  I do think, however, that the Minister should have come in with amending legislation to the existing Acts under which money is paid on works of a capital nature if such amendments were necessary.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with the necessity of getting over procedural difficulties and with the necessity of spending large sums of money in a hurry when, perhaps, an unexpected pool of unemployment in one particular area comes to the knowledge of the Government; but I do strongly object to passing an Act of this sort which could give rise to a very wrong type of expenditure of public money, which could give rise to political pressure being put on the Minister, and which could give rise to all sorts of malpractices in the administration of a very large sum of money.  No such considerations should be allowed in the expenditure of the capital resources of this country, and the manner in which that has been avoided in the past has been by having machinery by which the Dáil knew beforehand the manner in which the money was to be expended.</P>
    <P>I am not going to suggest that the Government is going to put this £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 into a county in which a by-election is going to be held, but I am suggesting that the public are aware that such a thing could be done, and that such a practice could conceivably arise.  I think it is very wrong to introduce a procedure which could be abused in such a fashion.  I, therefore, suggest that the existing legislation, if it requires amendment, should be amended.</P>
    <P>I want to return very briefly to what I said at the commencement, and that  that I am a firm believer in the necessity of expanding the capital investment <Col N="430" /> undertaken by the State.  I believe it is the means by which we can help to get rid of the very grave unemployment problem that we have at the present time.  I believe that the unemployment problem which we have at the present time is of a magnitude which has been caused by the budgetary methods undertaken by the Government in its last two Budgets, and if this is a Bill to endeavour to rectify the results of the Government's last two Budgets, I welcome it.  I do think, however, that we are introducing a bad principle into our public finances, and I do not think that the Bill should go through in the manner now proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with my colleague, Deputy D. Costello, that this is a bad precedent. I think that the origin of this Bill is due to the fact that the Government found themselves in such an awkward position with regard to unemployment in the country.  They found it necessary to procure money, there and then, to deal with that situation which they themselves had brought about by the policy they had carried out over the last three years.  We on this side have always advocated the expenditure of money on schemes that are of benefit to the nation as a whole, and, in the few years during which the previous Government were in office, they established a state of affairs which it was possible for this Government to have continued.  They could have from year to year budgeted for these capital schemes and the country would have been in a position, as per the Estimates produced annually, to know what these schemes were, and it would have been up to each Department to come into the House with whatever capital schemes they might have and put them before us for debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that we are asked to vote £20,000,000 over a period of four years for the Minister to expend on what he considers necessary in the national interest.  It may be sound economics to spend that money, and, as I say, we are in full agreement with the spending of it, provided it is spent on what we consider to be reasonably constructive schemes, but it seems to <Col N="431" /> me that we are asked to give to one man the power of deciding where the money is to be spent.  I do not think we have got, on the various stages of the Bill so far, any real clarification of what the money is to be spent on.  I have a very strong suspicion that it is going to be spent on Dublin Castle, on the Bray Road, and possibly on the Naas Road as well.  As a country Deputy, I do not feel satisfied that we have had sufficient indication from the acting-Minister as to where and how this money is to be spent.</P>
    <P>In practically every part of rural Ireland, extensions of our water schemes are required and there are very few villages in the main which have an up-to-date water supply.  These are schemes that will have to be put into effect, and I should like an assurance from the Minister that that is one of the projects he has in mind.  I should like to feel also that some of this money will be spent on dealing with a problem which is becoming a source of serious consideration in my constituency, in Wicklow, and, in fact, in all parts of the country&mdash;erosion of our coast.</P>
    <P>The other day, another Deputy and I put down a question asking whether it was proposed to spend money on this problem.  We did not get any definite information from the Minister, and it is fair for me to say that what we did get was the idea that there is a good deal of muddled thinking about this national development fund.  The Minister more or less indicated that it was a matter that was under consideration, but he did not know if the money was going to be spent or not and did not know who would spend it, but I knew that the local authority in my consituency had already made representations, not to his Department but to another, for the expenditure of money in that direction.  I should like to suggest now that it would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>Erosion is an insidious thing which has done irreparable damage in a great many cases before people appreciate that the damage is being done.  The situation has been recognised in other countries as constituting a serious menace, which causes destruction of valuable tracts of land and of valuable <Col N="432" /> property, and I suggest that when the Minister has these funds at his disposal, one of the purposes to which he could put some of the money would be the securing of expert advice which is procurable from America where they have founded a national erosion board on the subject of what could be done to minimise this menace.  If there is a sum of the size of £5,000,000 available, it surely would be worth spending a small amount on saving the land which we are losing every day.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister also to indicate&mdash;the Bill has been in his Department for a considerable time&mdash; what actual schemes are in course of preparation or establishment.  The Minister said the other day that approximately £2,000,000 was to be spent before the end of the financial year.  It should surely be possible for him to indicate how that sum is to be spent, because, as Deputy Costello has so rightly said, we are establishing a precedent here.  The Government are turning away from the ordinary financial arrangements which obtain in most Parliaments and arrogating to themselves the right to spend a large sum of money, and, for their protection, the ratepayers and taxpayers and those who invest their money in this country generally are entitled to have the fullest statement from the Minister as to what he proposes to do.  That is the least he can do for us.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we are in full agreement with the expenditure of money for the development of the country, which is grossly underdeveloped.  It was only during the period of the previous Government that any attempt was made at any solid national development.  The amount expended by the Fianna Fáil Government on capital development each year was less than £500,000, and is it any wonder that we should be rather sceptical about the handing over to a Government formed of members of the Fianna Fáil Party a sum of this size to do more or less as they please with it? The least we are entitled to is a full and comprehensive statement from the Minister as to the schemes he intends to put into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words mainly to reply to Deputy Esmonde's remarks.  Deputy Esmonde has demanded a full and complete statement of how this money is to be expended.  As I see it the main purpose of the National Development Bill is to give the Government a little more latitude in regard to expenditure than they have under the ordinary voted moneys for the different Departments. I think that freedom of action is desirable, and that, just as it is necessary for a local authority to have a sort of contingency fund, it is equally desirable that a small portion of the moneys allocated to the Government for general expenditure should be voted in such a way that they could be applied to any particular national purpose for which they might be required, subject, of course, to certain limitations.  I think it is rather foolish for the spokesmen of the Opposition to be quarrelling with this expenditure.  Is it not desirable that work of national development should be carried out?  Is it not desirable that every effort should be made to improve the condition of our country and provide additional employment? That is what this Bill seeks to do, to carry through work of national development which will make this nation more fruitful and more productive in every possible way, and for that reason I think that the Opposition are unduly critical.</P>
      <P>They were particularly critical on the Second Reading of this Bill when it was described as a &ldquo;slush fund&rdquo; and ridiculed by the leaders of the Fine Gael Party, and it was only the common sense and prudence of the spokesmen of the Labour Party that brought the Fine Gael Party more or less to heel and made them see that there was a practical need for a measure of this kind and that it ought to be a permanent feature of our administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we all know, needs arise in one particular area or another at different times.  Extra unemployment arises in areas, unexpectedly, perhaps, at times, because in the main our chief economic activities are of a seasonal nature. Agriculture is a seasonal industry, turfproduction is seasonal, beet growing <Col N="434" /> and sugar manufacture are seasonal industries, and thus in areas where there is a very high rate of employment at one time of the year you may have considerable unemployment for short periods, and it is necessary that the Government should have a flexible system of dealing with that problem. That is the way I look at the matter; and I think it is ordinary common sense to give the Government the powers which they seek in this Bill to develop the resources of our country to the fullest extent and to utilise to the fullest extent the labour force available within the nation.</P>
    <P>I have just a few points to make in connection with this.  I think that in allocating moneys to the county councils under this Bill there should be a strong recommendation to the local authority to devote the money mainly to the county roads.  Those of us who travel to rural Ireland recognise that there is still a very large mileage of county roads which has not been given a modern tar-bound surface, and with present-day traffic any other surface is completely out of date.  Every effort should be made when there is money available such as this to bring the local county roads up to date.  I feel also that an effort should be made to promote such beneficial bodies as Muintir na Tíre and parish councils by making allocations to them under this Bill to do work of development in the local rural areas where it is only those closely in touch with the area who will be able to ascertain what is the most beneficial work.</P>
    <P>I think it would not be any harm to give to a properly constituted parish council a certain allocation of money to expend in the relief of unemployment, subject, of course, to certain conditions &mdash;possibly the provision of a local contribution, or certainly the proviso that men on the register of unemployed in the area should be given employment as far as the funds are available.  In the same way, I think that any publicspirited local development body which is anxious to improve the particular area should be helped by those funds out of this Bill, subject, of course, always to provisions to safeguard against inefficiency or waste.</P>
    <P>I do not accept at all the view expressed <Col N="435" /> by Deputy Esmonde that the only years in which there was national development work carried out were the three years in which the Coalition Government were in power.  That is an absurd suggestion when we think of the thousands of acres of land that have been planted, the estates that have been divided and improved, the roads and houses provided for our people, the thousands of acres of turf bogs which have been drained, developed, and put into production, and the amount of work that has been done in regard to hydro-electrical development during the years of the Fianna Fáil Government's period of office.  In all fairness, the Opposition Parties ought to recognise that a tremendous amount of national development work has been done over the past 20 years, and I think that the Fianna Fáil Party would be prepared to give credit to the Opposition Parties for anything that they did during their period.  But it is just an absurdity to suggest that the present Government have not at all times been keen on carrying through works of national development.  As a matter of fact, one of the criticisms that have been particularly directed against the present Government has been that they have incurred too much expenditure in works of that kind. We hear strong criticisms of the present Government for spending as they are spending now approximately £40,000,000 in the current year on work of national development.</P>
    <P>I think we can deal with this Bill and consider it in a fair and impartial way without trying to make Party capital as Deputy Esmonde tried to make.  I think this Bill is a measure that will be renewed when its term of operation has expired and that it ought to be a permanent feature of our administration here in this country.  No matter how prosperous this nation may be there will always be a certain number of people unemployed and a certain amount of very useful work of national development to be done which can only be done by the State or by local bodies financed from the Central Fund.  Therefore, I think this Bill should be given a little bit more generous approval by the spokesmen of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>Deputy Declan Costello should, I think, have cleared his speech with the other members of the Fine Gael Party before he came in.  He denounced this Bill as introducing a thoroughly bad principle, and he is opposed to its going through in the manner in which it is proposed.  On three different occasions we have had a discussion on this measure; we have had the Second Reading, the Money Resolution and the detailed discussion on the Committee Stage.  On all these stages the measure received the unanimous approval of the Dáil, including the unanimous approval of those members of the Fine Gael Party who were here.</P>
      <P>The principle upon which this Bill is based is not a new principle. Immediately after the war I, as Minister for Finance at the time, brought in the Transition Development Fund Bill for a sum of £5,000,000.  Under that Bill the same rights were given to the Minister for Finance to spend or not to spend.  That Transition Development Fund Bill when it became law did excellent work in getting housing and development generally under way; it encouraged organisations like the E.S.B. to go ahead with rural electrification.  The E.S.B. was promised that if rural electrification was proceeded with and there was a deficit over and above what they estimated the work would cost, that deficit would be met out of the Transition Development Fund. Local authorities were not able to estimate firmly what any housing scheme would cost.  They did not know how long they would have to wait for lead piping or substitute aluminium piping; indeed, they had many difficulties in estimating the time a scheme would take and the total cost of that scheme and the result was that local authorities tended to postpone housing schemes.  The Transition Development Fund enabled the Minister for Finance, through the Minister for Local Government, to promise them that, if they went ahead, the Transition Development Fund would meet any costs over and above what they estimated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" /> I do not know if I would go as far as Deputy Cogan went when he said this should be a permanent feature of our financial policy and procedure.  In these days when changes occur very rapidly and there are few who can foresee what the economic situation is likely to be for more than a few months ahead, I think it is essential that the Government should have this little bit of control over expenditure without having to come to the Dáil for approval of every item on which it is proposed to spend money.  It is not after all a very big sum in relation to total State expenditure. We are now spending on current and capital account something in the region of £140,000,000 per annum; £5,000,000 is only a very little over 3 per cent. of that amount. What we are asking the Dáil to do is to give the Minister for Finance in the circumstances in which we find ourselves&mdash;circumstances in which we are afraid this country will find itself for the next four years&mdash;the liberty to spend something in the neighbourhood of 3 per cent. of the total State expenditure without having to get prior approval for every item in that 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Very few people can estimate their own expenditure over a year to within 3 per cent.  The man with £500 a year cannot tell to the last £15 exactly how he will spend that £500.  It is pretty good work on the part of the various State Departments that they can estimate as closely as they do expenditure over the following 12 months.  In normal circumstances it might be a satisfactory system to estimate in detail ahead of time and to receive Dáil sanction for every item of Government expenditure but, in our present circumstances, we think the Government should have the right to spend about 3 per cent. of total State expenditure without having to get detailed Dáil sanction ahead of time for every item.  That is not to say that the Government must not get Dáil sanction.  Accounts must be published and the Dáil must be told whether or not the Government has spent this £5,000,000 in the year and the purposes on which it was expended.</P>
    <P>On the Financial Resolution in relation <Col N="438" /> to this measure, I detailed the sums which the Minister for Finance and the Government have approved for expenditure out of this fund to date. Deputy Esmonde was very insistent on getting them to-day and I would refer him to columns 71 and 72, Vol. 144 (1) of the Official Reports dealing with the debate on Wednesday, 10th February. Not a week ago I gave full details of the amounts that were approved for expenditure out of this fund.  I do not propose to go over them again to-day. Anybody who is interested in them can find them by looking up these two columns.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello is a young man and he seems to believe a lot of the Fine Gael propaganda, as he repeats it so often.  He believes it and can recite it in the Dáil with all the appearance of conviction as to its truth.  I do not know where he got the notion that Fine Gael was the father and mother of capital development.  One of the things of which Fianna Fáil are proud is that we actually converted the Fine Gael people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to spend money on capital development.  I remember when the present Leader of Fine Gael was Minister for Local Government and we asked him to engage on a big programme for the provision of houses. That was in 1931 and he said that the Government could not embark on any great housing programme until wages and the cost of materials fell to such a point that houses could be built to let at an economic rent.  If we had waited for these two things to happen we would have been waiting ever since. Deputy Cogan pointed out that, although we had not put an overload of debt upon the country, great capital development had taken place.  Where did the 140,000 houses come out of that were built between 1932 and the time that Fianna Fáil left office in 1948? Was not that capital development? There has not been anything like the same number of houses built in the intervening period.  The most the Coalition Government could do was to provide about 13,000 houses a year and, at that, they were adding fistfuls of <Col N="439" /> national debt on to the backs of the taxpayers.</P>
      <P>We tried to pay our way as we went along.  We tried to get the people to make savings and to give us the taxes out of which we could make grants and loans of various kinds to encourage people to go ahead and develop their resources.  It is no virtue that capital development should be associated with a very big increase in the national debt.  It may be necessary, but it may be wrong.  An increase in the national debt is an increase in the volume of money circulating within the country, and it may be wrong that there should be an increase in the volume of money if already there is in existence a surplus of money, and an increase in the capital development of the country might very well take place with a decrease in the national debt by paying for the increased capital development out of current savings and out of a Budget surplus.</P>
      <P>No one denies that an increase in the volume of money, whether by an increase in the national debt or otherwise, is sometimes a reasonable policy, sometimes a sound procedure.  It is a sound procedure when there is a shortage of money circulating within the country, but it is a poisonous procedure if there is a surplus.  Our criticism of Fine Gael policy is that there they were increasing the national debt, increasing the volume of money, when already there was a surplus of money, which had the effect of inducing a very heavy adverse balance in our international payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with the many points which I think should be replied to.  I recommend the Dáil to give the Government the powers asked for in this Bill.  I feel that it is necessary for any Government to have them during the sort of times we are living in and the sort of times that are likely to exist for the next few years.  We hope that having this contingency fund, if you like to call it that, to call upon we will be able to meet acute unemployment if it shows its head in any particular district or be able to add to the opportunities for employment generally <Col N="440" /> throughout the country if the necessity for that arises.  Notwithstanding the fact that the expenditure on capital development on Government account has doubled in the last couple of years, it was essential that this last year the Government should have a fund of that kind in order to deal with the acute unemployment that occurred in certain areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind Deputy Costello that in the last year in which the Coalition was in power a sum of £24,000,000 was spent on capital development on State account.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was talking about the period of the Coalition as the only period in which there was capital development.  I pointed out what happened before the war, when 140,000 houses were built.  The Coalition Government spent, in the last year of office, a sum of £24,000,000 on State capital account.  In the following year, the first year of office of the Fianna Fáil Government, a sum of about £32,000,000 was spent.  At the time of the introduction of the Budget last year the Minister for Finance estimated that there would be something like £39,000,000 spent on capital development by the State and subsidiary bodies.  That £39,000,000, even though it was double what was spent in 1950, was not sufficient to absorb all the people who were available for work and we had to call upon further sums of money which will be paid out of this National Development Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Declan Costello when he says that the State will have to go on increasing capital expenditure.  I would much prefer to see the energies of our people being absorbed to the full by private capital development.  There are great opportunities for it if our people, as private individuals, would spend their savings in improving their own businesses, whether in town or country.  I hope that in the coming year there will be more private capital development and less necessity for State development <Col N="441" /> works to absorb the energies of our unemployed.  From every point of view it is preferable that such money should be spent by private individuals, but if it is not spent by private individuals, if private individuals do not display the necessary initiative to spend their own money or such money as they can borrow in increasing the capital wealth of the country and in absorbing the unemployed, then the duty devolves on the State to undertake the expenditure, but that is the most expensive way in which the community as a whole can do it.</P>
    <P>I hope that private individuals who have capital will regard this National Development Fund, not as a cure-all for the ills from which we suffer in common with a great number of other countries, but that they will regard it as an assurance from the Government that it will do its utmost to keep production high and to keep the rate of employment as high as is possible in the circumstances of the present time.  With that assurance, I hope that private individuals will spend more of their own money in their own private businesses or co-operate with others in putting sums of money together to start some new productive enterprises for their own immediate profit and for the ultimate benefit of the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>Tairgim go léifear an Bille an dara huair anois. Is Bille é seo a bhaineas le cúrsaí Consalachta i gcoitinne ach tá sé ag teastáil, sa chéad áit, chun críche áirithe.  Teastaíonn sé uainn chun cumhacht a thabhairt don Rialtas a chomhairliú don Uachtarán an Coinbhinsiún Consalachta a rinneamar le Stáit Aontaithe Mheirice, a dhaingniú. Do síníodh an Coinbhinsiún seo chomh fada siar leis an lú Bealtaine, 190.n <Col N="442" /> Is é an gnás ag Rialtas na hÉireandí riamh agus i gcónaí, gan oblagái5, eadarnáisiúnta a ghabháil orthu féin go dtí gur deimhin leo go gcuireann dlí na Éireann ar a gcumas na hoblagáidí sin a chomhlíonadh go héifeachtúil. Chuige sin ní mór scrúdú cúramach a dhéanamh ar dhlí na tíre, mar atá faoi láthair, chun a fháil amach an dtugann sé don Rialtas na cumhachta atá riachtanach.  Sa chás áirithe seo, b'éigean féachaint cá mhéid a chuireann an dlí ar ár gcumas díolúintí agus pribhléidí a thabhairt d'oifigigh Chonsallachta, ar aon dul leo siúd a ráthaíonn an Coinbhinsiún sin leis na Stáit Aontaithe.</P>
      <P>Faoi Airteagal 29 den Bhunreacht is cuid de dhlí na hÉireann an dlí eadarnáisiúnta; ach comhairliodh dom, cé go bhfuil an dlí agus an gnás eadarnáisiúnta bunaithe go maith maidir le pribhléidíagus díolúintí oifigeach Taidhleoireachta, nach bhfuiltear cinnte cad iad na cearta atá ag oifigigh Chonsalachta chun na bpribhléidí agus na ndíolúintí sin.  Ar thaobh amháin, níl aon amhras ann ná gur féidir linn, faoin dlí agus faoin ngnás riaracháin atá i bhfeidhm, mórán, agus b'fhéidir an chuid is mó de na pribhléidí a háirítear sa Choinbhinsiún leis na Stáit Aontaithe a thabhairt d'oifigigh Chonsalachta tíortha eile.  Ar an láimh eile, tá pointí tábhachtacha áirithe a bhfuil amhras ina dtaobh.  Tá an Bille seo á thabhairt isteach chun deireadh a chur leis an amhras sin agus chun a dheimhniú go bhféadfar na hoblagáidí go léir a ghabhamar orainn a chomhlíonadh go héifeachtúil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ach, faoi mar adúirt mé, baineann an Bille, ní hamháin le díolúintí a chur in áirithe d'oifigigh Chonsalachta na Stát Aontaithe, ach d'oifigigh tíortha eile freisin.  Tá sé ceaptha leis an mBille cumhacht a thabhairt dúinn téarmaí aon chonartha den tsórt céanna, a dhéanfaimis feasta le haon tír eile, a chomhlíonadh.  Bhéarfar díolúintí agus pribhléidí d'oifigigh Chonsalachta tíortha eile a thabharfaidh a gcómalairt dúinne.  Is é sin le rá nach dtabharfaidh an Stát, de ghnáth, na pribhléidí agus na díolúintí sin d'ionadaithe Consalachta tíre áirithe mura dtabharfaidh an tír sin a gcothrom de dhíolúintí agus <Col N="443" /> de phribhleídí, sa tír sin, d'oifigigh Chonsalachta na hÉireann.  Sin é an prionsabal atá curtha romhainn sa Bhille seo.</P>
    <P>Tabharfar faoi deara, faoi chlásal 2 den Bhille, nach mbeidh na pribhléidí a bheirtear d'oifigigh Chonsalachta tíortha eile, sna hailt ina dhiaidh sin, ag dul d'oifigigh Chonsalachta aon tíre, mura mbeidh i bhfeidhm, de thuras na huaire, Ordú ón Rialtas, faoin gclásal sin, ag tabhairt feidhme do na forála sin sa tír sin.  Ní dhéanfaidh an Rialtas Ordú den tsórt sin mura rud é, sa chéad dul síos, gur tír Choinbhinsiúin Chonsalachta do réir an Bhille an tír sin, is é sin le rá, tír a bhfuil Coinbhinsiún Consalachta leis i bhfeidhm agus, sa dara dul síos, gur deimhin leis an Rialtas go dtugtar d'oifigigh Chonsalachta na hÉireann sa tír sin cumhachta pribhléidí agus díolúintí mar háirítear sa Bhille seo.  Leagfar faoi bhráid Tithe an Oireachtais gach Ordú a dhéanfaidh an Rialtas faoin gclásal seo.</P>
    <P>Go dtí seo ní dhearnamar ach aon Choinbhinsiún Consalachta amháin&mdash; leis na Stáit Aontaithe.  Cuireadh cóipeanna den Choinbhinsiún sin chun na dTeachtaí.  Leasaíodh an Coinbhinsiún i 1952 trí Phrótocol, a bhain amach Airteagal 18 den Choinbhinsiún agus d'fhág an scéal mar bhí sé idir an dá thír i gcás na nithe lenar bhain an tairteagal sin.  Beidh tuilleadh le rá agam ina thaobh sin ar ball.  Cuireadh cóipeanna den Phrótocol chun na dTeachtaí freisin.</P>
    <P>Baineann clásail 3 agus 4 den Bhille le cumhachta agus dualgais oifigeach Consalachta maidir le heastáit daoine marbha.  Cuirid ar chumas oifigigh Chonsalachta do thír choigríche gníomhú thar ceann náisiúnaigh den tír sin, chun deonadh riaracháin d'fháil nó maoin a ghlacadh.  Beartaíodh ar dtúis, leis na clásail sin, éifeacht a thabhairt d'fhorála Airteagail 18 den Choinbhinsiún leis na Stáit Aontaithe. Tá an tairteagal sin scriosta anois, mar a mhínigh mé cheana.  Is é cúis a bhí leis sin nach raibh Seanad na Stát Aontaithe sásta an Coinbhinsiún a dhaingniú leis an airteagal sin ann. Mheas an Seanad go mba shárú ar na <Col N="444" /> cearta a bhí ag Stáit an Aontais, faoi Bhunreacht Mheirice, na cumhachta a bhí á dtabhairt d'oifigigh Chonsalachta faoin airteagal sin.  Mar sin féin meastar gur maith an rud é clásail 3 agus 4 a choimeád sa Bhille ar dhá chúis.  Cúis a haon, d'fhéadfadh sé go ndéanfaí comhaontú nua le húdaráis na Stát Aontaithe i dtaobh an phointe seo; ach is ceart dom a rá go bhfuil an scéal mar atá iarbhír, agus mar a choinníonn Prótocol 1952 é, sásúil, tríd is tríd, ónar dtaobhna, agus go bhfuil ar chumas ár gConsal sna Stáit Aontaithe, nuair is gá sin, ionadaíocht a dhéanamh go héifeachtúil d'Éireannaigh a bhíonn ag éileamh leasa in eastáit daoine marbha.  Cúis a dó, ós rud é gur féidir feidhm a thabhairt don Choinbhinsiún seo maidir le tír ar bith, d'fhéadfadh na forála seo bheith tairbheach i gcás Coinbhinsiúin Chonsalachta a déanfaí le tír éigin eile seachas na Stáit Aontaithe.</P>
    <P>Faoi chlásal 5 beidh ar oifigigh Chonsalachta a fheidhmeos na cumhachta a thugann clásail 3 agus 4 dóibh, na díolúintí agus na pribhléidí eile atá acu a ligint uathu i ndáil le feidhmiú na gcumhacht sin.  Lena chur i mbeagán focal, má théann siad isteach i gcúirt in Éirinn, ag iarraidh deonadh riaracháin, caithfidh siad géilleadh do dhlínse na cúirte sin.</P>
    <P>Forálann clásal 6 nach cead don Gharda Síochána dul isteach i gConsalacht gan toiliú an oifigigh Chonsalachta i gceannas, ach, mura mbíonn seisean sásta nó má bhíonn sé as láthair, féadfaidh an tAire Gnóthaí Eachtracha toiliú leis an nGarda do dhul ísteach ann.  Is léir nach dtoileoidh an tAire ach amháin i gcásanna an-speisialta agus ar chúiseanna troma.  Is féidir, áfach, cur isteach ar an díolúine a thugann an mhír seo i gcás éigeandála, cuir i gcás, dá mbeadh amhras ann go ndearnadh coir foréigin nó dá dtarlaíodh tine ann, agus freisin i gcás teideal a bheith ag duine dul isteach ag feidhmiú cirt phríobháidigh, cuir i gcás, nuair a bheadh teideal ag an tiarna talún ar áitreabh Consalachta, a bhí á theachtadh ar léas, dul isteach ag iniúchadh an áitribh.  Ní ghabhann an díolúine seo le háitreabh Consalachta mura bhfuil an t-oifigeach Consalachta i gceannas ina <Col N="445" /> náisiúnach den tír darb ionadaí é; mar shampla, ní bheadh an díolúine sin ag gabháil le Consalacht oinigh inar shaoránach Éireannach an Consal.  Mheasas go mbeadh sé ceart na pointí eolais sin a lua toisc a thábhachtaí atá an clásal seo.</P>
    <P>Ní gá mórán a rá i dtaobh na coda eile den Bhille gearr seo.  Tógfaidh mé clásail 7, 8 agus 9 le chéile.  Bheir clásail 7 díolúine phearsanta ó dhliteanas, sibhialta agus coiriúil, i leith gníomhartha a dhéanann oifigigh Chonsalachta ina gcáil oifigiúil, agus a dhéanann fostaithe Consalachta i gcúrsa a ndualgais oifigiúil; bheir clásal 8 díolúine do cháipéisí Consalachta; agus forálann clásal 9 nach féidir a chur d'fhiacha ar oifigigh agus fostaithe Consalachta fianaise a thabhairt ar nithe áirithe.  Comhairlíodh dom gur dócha nach bhfuil sna clásail sin ach léiriú ar an dlí eadarnáisiúnta, ach measadh go mba mhaith an rud é foráil speisialta a dhéanamh ina dtaobh, toisc amhras a bheith ann i leith pointí áirithe.  Go háirithe, do hinseadh dom nach bhfuil sé soiléir go n-admhaíonn an dlí eadarnáisiúnta díolúine phearsanta a bheith ag fostaithe Consalachta (fiú i leith gníomhartha a rinneadh i gcúrsa a ndualgais oifigiúil), ná go n-údaraíonn sé d'oifigeach Consalachta diúltú fianaise a thabhairt i dtaobh a ghnótha oifigiúil.  Ní mór na hamhrais sin a réiteach ionas go bhféadfaimid oblagáidí follasacha an Choinbhinsiúin a chomhlíonadh, agus dá bhrí sin cinneadh ar an scéal a shocrú le reacht.</P>
    <P>Baineann clásail 10 agus 12 le nithe níos teicniúla, gur ghá foráil reachtúil a dhéanamh ina dtaobh chun oblagáidí an Choinbhinsiúin a chomhlíonadh. Faoi chlásal 10 beidh admhála oifigigh Chonsalachta ar sheirbhísí Consalachta saor ó dhleacht stampa.  Tugann clásal 11 teideal d'oifigeach Consalachta brat a thíre a bheith ar crochadh aige ar long Éireannach d'fhostaigh sé le haghaidh a dhualgas Consalachta. Tugann clásal 12 d'oifigigh Chonsalachta cumhachta áirithe maidir le longa raice agus le maoin mhairnéalach marbh.</P>
    <P>Comhairlíodh dom gurbh inmholta clásal 13 a chur sa Bhille chun a thaispeáint go n-admhaíonn dlí na hÉireann, d'éagmais an Achta seo, go bhfuil <Col N="446" /> pribhléidí agus díolúintí áirithe ag oifigigh Chonsalachta.  Mura ndéantaí sin b'fhéidir go gceapfaí nach mbeadh aon díolúintí ag oifigigh Chonsalachta ó thíortha eile chun na hÉireann ach amháin nuair a déanfaí Ordú Rialtais faoi chlásal 2.</P>
    <P>Déanann clásal 14 athghairm ar Alt 4 den <i>Domicile Act</i>, 1861.  Bhí forála san alt sin a bhí ar aon dul, nach mór, leis na forála atá anois i gclásal 3 den Bhille.  Dá bhrí sin is féidir an t-alt sin d'athghairm, sa mhéid go raibh sé i bhfeidhm riamh sa tír seo.</P>
    <P>Ag críochnú an ghearr-chuntais seo ar an mBille dhom, ba mhaith liom pointe amháin a threisiú go speisialta. Tabharfaidh na Teachtaí dá n-aire gurb é bun-chuspóir an Bhille seo díolúintí agus pribhléidí a dheonadh mar mhalairt ar a gcothrom de dhíolúintí agus príbhléidí.  Uime sin is ceart a thábhacht a bhreithniú ní hamháin maidir leis an tír seo, ach maidir leis an gcómalairt díolúintí agus pribhléidí a deonfar d'oifigigh Chonsalachta na hÉireann a bheidh ar seirbhís lasmuigh d'Éirinn. Tá tábhacht mhór ag baint leis na pribhléidí agus na díolúintí a gheibheann Consail Éireannacha ó thíortha eile; agus go háirithe ó na Stáit Aontaithe; mura bhfaighidís iad ní fhéadfadh ár gConsail freastal ar leas na hÉireann i dtíortha eile chomh maith agus chomh héifeachtúil agus a dhéanaid sin.  Is fiú a mheabhrú gurb é atá sa Bhille seo an chómalairt is gá ar na díolúintí a tugtar do Chonsail Éireannacha i dtíortha thar lear.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir ba mhaith liom a rá gur mór an sásamh dom go bhfuilimid, leis an mBille seo, ag réiteach an bhealaigh chun an chéad Choinbhinsiún Consalachta atá déanta againn a dhaingniú&mdash;is é sin, an Coinbhinsiún lenár gcairde maithe Rialtas agus pobal na Stát Aontaithe.  Tugann an Coinbhinsiún sin cruthúnas breise ar an dámh muintearthais atá idir an dá thír.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I venture to prophesy that there will not be very much controversy over this Bill.  I have very little to say on it.  I am glad this Bill has at last come before the Dáil, because it gives us an opportunity of putting into effect the contents of <Col N="447" /> the consular convention entered into between this country and the United States of America.  For that reason, we must welcome this Bill and be glad that it is at last before the House.  We hope it will get a speedy journey through this House and the Seanad.  What I have to say on the Bill can be very briefly put.  The matters I want to refer to are merely matters of detail.</P>
      <P>First, I should like to ask the Minister whether he considers putting into this Bill provisions which are contained in an English Act passed within the past couple of years giving diplomatic immunity to certain representatives of international organisations.  In England, at the present time, certain international organisations, such as U.N.O., of which, of course, we are not a member and it would not apply in our case, have got diplomatic immunity.  I should like the Minister to say if he considers whether it should be necessary that the members of certain international organisations of which we may be members should be accorded the same immunity which we accord to ambassadors and members of the staffs of consulates in this country.</P>
      <P>The other points which I wish to raise on the Bill are purely matters of detail.  The first is in respect of Section 3.  It seems advisable to me that there should be inserted in Section 3 the procedure by which an application would be made to the court under that section by a foreign consul.  At the moment there would be no rules of court which would cover an application under Section 3.  I should like the Minister to consider whether he should insert in Section 3 that such application would be by notice of motion to the judge of the High Court or that it would be unnecessary to serve any person by such notice of motion.  I think it would get over the difficulties which practising lawyers would have when faced with this section as to what procedure they would adopt if the particular facts which this section intends to cover were to come to their notice. I would suggest, therefore, that the method of procedure should be delineated in detail in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> The only other matter I wish to raise on the Bill concerns Section 7, the diplomatic immunity which it is proposed by the section to give consular officers.  At the present time, as I understand it, the diplomatic immunity which flows from the principles of common law and was, in fact, enshrined in an Act as far back as 1708 has, by a series of decisions, been extended not merely to ambassadors but also to people employed in the embassies and to consulates of foreign countries in this country and in Great Britain.  It does include certain people like military attachés and assistant military attachés.  I think it is right that we should give diplomatic immunity to consular officers as well as to the people who under the existing law and the decisions under the existing law have diplomatic immunity.</P>
    <P>There is this one matter, however, which strikes me in this section.  As I understand the law at the present time diplomatic immunity is given to people during the continuance of their office and persons who are subject to diplomatic immunity can, after they cease holding office, be sued for matters for which they would have immunity during their period of office.  It seems to me that under Section 7 we are declaring that consular officers are to be immune from proceedings civil or criminal.  It is certainly not clear at any rate that that immunity is only to extend to the period of time that they are such officers.  I think it should be clarified if that is the state of the law that no greater privilege should be given to consular officers than is given under the existing law to ambassadors and such people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to ask the Minister a question or two to clear up a point that seems to be slightly vague at the present time.  I wonder whether it is made clear in this Bill&mdash;perhaps the Minister might make it clear&mdash;as to whether or not some of the Social Welfare Acts must be applied by these embassies to Irish nationals who may be employed in them?  I should like the Minister to say whether, for instance, the Unemployment Insurance Acts, the National Health Insurance <Col N="449" /> Acts, the Conditions of Employment Act or the Holidays Act, which are Irish laws, must be applied to workers who are employed at any of these foreign embassies.</P>
      <P>A case was recently brought to my notice where there was a difference of opinion as to whether or not an employee in one of these embassies should have his cards stamped.  My interpretation of the law, international or otherwise, would be that the Conditions of Employment Act, the Unemployment Insurance Acts, the National Health Insurance Acts and the Holidays Act must be applied by foreign ambassadors to Irish employees in their particular establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello wanted to find out whether this Bill proposes to give immunity to members of international organisations such as U.N.O. It does not but, as the Deputy is aware, there are certain privileges which can be extended to distinguished strangers coming here&mdash;members of U.N.O. or other organisations&mdash;just as they are extended to diplomats properly accredited to this country, and from time to time such privileges are granted.  Of course, we cannot give them the legal immunity that is given by international law to ambassadors and representatives of foreign States serving in another country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish raised a point which has nothing to do with this Bill.  This Bill deals with the privileges of consular representatives and their staff in the course of their duty and in matters pertaining to their duties.  It has nothing to do with their private lives in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>These are not embassies or legations but consular offices.  The consul may sometimes be an Irishman employed or nominated by a foreign country to look after the interests of their shipping or any of their citizens who may come to our shores.  Even an Irishman, who is on all fours with all other Irishmen in relation to his personal matters, when he is acting as a consul of a foreign country is given certain immunity in relation to his consular acts.</P>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Costello read the particular section which he queried.  Section 7 (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A consular employee shall not be liable in any proceedings, civil or criminal, in respect of acts performed by him within the scope of his employment and in the course of his official duties in so far as those duties are within the functions of a consular officer in international law, unless his Government requests or assents to the proceedings.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Outside that limited range of activities he is, of course, liable to proceedings, both civil and criminal.  If the act he performs is not within the scope of his employment and not in the course of his official duties and the duties within the functions of a consular officer, then that employee is liable in any proceedings before a civil or a criminal court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already explained, the reason this Bill is introduced is to enable us to advise the President to ratify the consular convention that we have made with the United States. We are taking powers here which the Government can, by Order, make effective in relation to certain countries when we are getting reciprocal treatment. We were not too sure whether we had all the powers that were necessary to give fully reciprocal treatment for that given to our consuls in America.  Our consuls in America do very good work in representing our citizens there and looking after their interests and we are anxious that they should continue to enjoy that treatment. This is one reason that we are <Col N="451" /> particularly careful that the Government is fully within its legal rights in granting similar treatment to American consuls here.  The privileges and immunities that are granted to consuls and their agents under Section 3 will only be applied when an agreement is made with another country that similar treatment will be granted to our consular representative there.</P>

However, I promise the Deputy that I will have the matter carefully examined and will consult with the rule-making committee to see whether they are satisfied with this section as it is drafted.

      <P>The Minister said that this particular section provides personal immunity from civil and criminal law for acts done by consular officers in their official capacity and consular <Col N="452" /> employees in the course of their official duties.  Does that mean that if one of these officials were travelling from the Department of External Affairs to his own office and was involved in an accident which happened to be his fault, he would be free from all liability&mdash;that no claim could be made and no prosecution could be entered against this official who had caused an accident?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Not unless his Government requested or assented to it.  The Deputy must remember that this is repeating, in regard to consuls, what is required by international law in relation to diplomatic representatives. It is reciprocal: our representatives abroad get the same immunity.  In the case of a criminal act, the Government appointing the diplomatic or consular representative often agrees to his trial within the State to which he is appointed.</P>

      <P>Since all this international system grew up, there have been many changes according to the changes in the way of life in the world. Take, as an example, the motor car accident to which the Deputy refers. Strictly within the letter of international law, as practised up to the beginning of the 20th century, they could plead immunity.  But, in practice, they do not run a car here on the road unless they have a licence and unless they have an insurance, and all the diplomatic representatives here have agreed with the insurance companies that they will not plead their immunity if they are involved in a motor car accident.  That arrangement is fully satisfactory to everybody: the basis could not be changed except by international agreement.  The international law is there and, actually, the diplomatic and consular representatives here have agreed to waive it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that this is not a new development.  I think the Minister has stated that it has been agreed that immunity with regard to financial liability will not be pleaded. Whether or not there is immunity in respect of a criminal charge, I do not know whether or not the Minister said <Col N="453" /> that these people would not claim immunity in that respect.  If that is the case, it is all right.  However, if the position is that they will not plead immunity merely with regard to their financial liability, I do not think it is good enough.  If these consular officers or their employees got it into their heads that they had a licence to run around this city or any part of this country and that they had immunity from any civil proceedings, then I think it would be dangerous.  It is more or less accepted that it is international law but if that is the law I think some steps should be taken immediately to have it corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to follow up the statements made by Deputy Corish on the point of immunity in respect of an accident.  It has been said that these people have agreed not to plead immunity.  Suppose a consul is appointed here within the next two years and that he happens to knock down a cyclist, a married man with three or four children.  If that man is killed, what good will it do his widow to be told that we have reciprocal arrangements whereby if one of our men in some other part of the world happens to do the same thing no prosecution will be made and no damages will be sought?  I agree with the Minister that there are difficulties; we appreciate that fact.  However, I think there ought to be some guarantee in respect of a person who might be knocked down by a car.  As Deputy Corish says, if a consul or the representative of another country is travelling from one office to another and if the driver of the vehicle is aware that he will not be allowed to drive unless there is full insurance to cover an accident, then something could be said for reciprocal arrangements.  The fact that one of our men in his capacity as a representative of this country in another country is excluded is no satisfaction to a widow and young children if her husband and their father has been killed in such an accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne need not worry.  It does not matter how many changes there are in the diplomatic representation here they will hold to <Col N="454" /> the agreement with insurance companies that they will not plead diplomatic immunity in the case of an accident where damage is caused to some person or to his property when a diplomat or a consul is driving a car. Even though they could not be brought up to court and imprisoned for travelling on the roads, a Government would be asked to recall an individual if he was carrying on like that.  Therefore Deputy Byrne need not have any fear that the citizens of Dublin are not protected if they are hit or knocked down or if their car is smashed by a car driven by one of the foreign representatives or their staff.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Corish's point, while their insurance companies are liable for the damage they cause to third parties, the diplomats themselves cannot be sent to jail for knocking down anybody or killing any person.  This Bill provides that a consular officer cannot be tried for an alleged civil or criminal act in respect of acts performed by him in his official capacity unless his Government requests or assents to it.  The Bill is designed to ensure that, in regard to his consular acts, he is answerable only to his own Government for the work he carries out on their behalf, and he is not answerable to the Irish courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister very fully stated the principle of diplomatic immunity as it applies at the moment.  I know that in this Bill it is proposed to extend it to various consular officers.  In Section 7 we are merely extending the existing recognised diplomatic privilege to consular officers.  Both Deputy Byrne and Deputy Corish have an objection which is not new, an objection which has been raised over years and more or less met over years in international intercourse and representation.  All countries recognise that their diplomats accredited abroad and diplomats accredited to them at home are completely immune from all forms of proceedings, both civil and criminal, unless immunity is waived by the representatives themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the question of liability in relation to a road traffic accident.  There is no obligation on a <Col N="455" /> diplomatic representative here to be insured.  There is no obligation on him to meet any claim for damages in respect of negligence or of careless driving.  If he were insured, his insurance company can never be made liable because the insured, being a diplomat, cannot be sued unless he agrees to those proceedings.  The whole right to recognise the jurisdiction of our courts is exclusively in the diplomatic representative involved.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has met the objection raised by Deputy Corish and Deputy Byrne by inaccurately stating that in those circumstances the diplomat's insurance company would be liable.  The company would not be liable and could not be liable unless the diplomatic representative agreed to permit himself to be sued in our courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what they have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that there have been quite a few cases where that has not been so. There is one particular case that occurred not so long ago where, unfortunately, that was not so.  I am not against the section.  It is a recognised thing and our representatives in Great Britain and on the Continent enjoy exactly the same immunity.  It is a very necessary immunity.  It is very necessary that our diplomats abroad should not be concerned with purely local regulations of one kind or another of which they would not have any knowledge and certainly they should not be subject to the jurisdiction of foreign courts.  Diplomatic privilege is one of the incidental obligations necessarily arising when we accord a welcome to a foreign representative here. We accord to him the same immunity as he would have in his own country, immunity from our laws and the obligations imposed on our citizens here. That is an immunity that we expect to be accorded to our diplomats accredited to the country in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be completely wrong in this &mdash;the Minister will correct me&mdash;but I always thought that diplomatic immunity could be waived by the representative <Col N="456" /> himself.  I always understood that the minister or ambassador who might have offended against our laws, civil or criminal, became amenable to the sanction imposed by the courts if he recognised the jurisdiction of our courts.  I notice in the extension given here to consular officers that the waiving of the immunity must be by the consular officer's Government.  That appears to me to be an extension of the present position.  I would suggest that the Minister might consider later on, or in the Seanad, providing instead of &ldquo;unless his Government requests or assents to the proceedings,&rdquo;&ldquo;unless either he or his Government requests or assents to the proceedings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Frequently we find in the courts in relation to road traffic accidents where a diplomatic car is involved in a collision with another car, possibly being more gravely damaged than the other car, it might be decided to have the question as to who was responsible decided by the courts.  As things are at the moment, I understand the position to be that the diplomat, as the owner, or ostensible owner of the car, waived the immunity and permitted the court then to decide who was liable.  I would suggest to the Minister that instead of confining the right to waive the immunity to the Government, the consular officer should also have the right to waive it if he so wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Consuls and their staffs are only granted immunity in relation to acts and functions carried out by them in the course of their duty.  Apart from that, in their ordinary private capacity, they are liable like every other citizen.  It is different, in international law, in the case of diplomatic representatives who are granted the immunities and privileges of their post. While, in international law, an ambassador could refuse to insure his car, in practice it does not happen.  While, in international law, he can refuse to allow himself to be sued for damage, all the diplomats here have, in fact, insured with insurance companies and have waived their diplomatic immunities in relation to damage caused by them in the course of driving a car. The situation, therefore, is that any <Col N="457" /> citizen damaged by a diplomatic car has the right of action against the insurance company and has the right to recover damage, the diplomat having waived his immunity in relation to that particular action long ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is stating that correctly.  That means that an insurance company would only insure if the insurance company was liable.  Surely that is not a condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;if he agreed that he would waive his immunity and allow the insurance company to be sued.  The diplomat insures with the insurance company so that the insurance company will carry the liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to international law, like every other law it is never static and, with the development of motoring in the modern world, one could not have the same outlook on road accidents as people had one hundred years ago.  Accidents of one kind or another, slight and grave, are of hourly occurrence in a city the size of Dublin, and it would be very foolish for a diplomatic representative not to insure himself.  It would be very foolish for the Government to allow diplomats here to drive around the roads, subject to such constant hazard, without having the citizens of the country protected in case of injury by a diplomatic car.  I can assure the House that the citizens are as safe from injury without compensation in the case of a diplomatic car as they are in the case of a private car.  While the penalties are <Col N="458" /> very full indeed, the State cannot make absolutely certain that someone will not use a car for which he has no insurance or for which he is not insured and knock someone down.  That is a very infrequent occurrence; it happens sometimes when a youngster steals a car, if he knocks someone down it is not his vehicle, he is not covered, and the injured person cannot get compensation.</P>
    <P>By arrangement, diplomats in every country in modern times have agreed to insure themselves so as to give to the citizens of the country the assurance that they would get compensation. That is the situation here.  We have the agreement with the diplomatic corps and they have the agreement with the insurance companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter that might be cleared up on this section.  It is one which I raised on the Second Reading which is relevant especially to this particular section. Have these consular officers any immunity in regard to those employed by them&mdash;clerks, clerk-typists, or even messengers?  Is there any obligation on such officers to apply the Social Welfare Acts?  Is there an obligation on them to affix insurance stamps to employees' cards or to grant the required annual holiday period?  If there is such an obligation and if they default can they be proceeded against for the recovery of sickness or unemployment benefit?  Can one sue them for payment in respect of holidays that have not been granted?  I do not know whether they are immune in respect of these things and perhaps the Minister would clear up the point.  It may be that the Welfare Acts of the countries which these consular officers represent are applied to these employees but at the present time it is not known generally what the position is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear in the Bill.  They are not liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would read sub-section (4) of Section 7 he would see what the situation is:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This section does not exempt a consular officer or consular employee from liability in a civil action arising <Col N="459" /> out of a contract concluded by him in which he did not expressly contract as agent for his Government and in which the other party looked to him personally for performance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the consular officer in his private capacity hired somebody, that particular contract is not covered by immunity.  It is only if the person were employed in the office, employed directly on the work for which the consular office was established, that he could claim immunity.  However, there is the other side to that.  Supposing a consul employs an Irish person to work in the office, that Irishman has the right to see that he gets his holidays, that provision is made for stamping his cards, that the employer will pay so much and the employee the rest, or perhaps the employer will pay the lot.  That is subject to arrangement. There is no compulsion on an Irish person to go to work for a consul, to carry out consular duties for him, unless he is satisfied with the arrangement. I am afraid that if it were not a personal service, if it were a servant, or an employee in the consular office and he did not get the holidays and did not make arrangements when being employed, the consul could not be taken to court in order to enforce the Holidays with Pay Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I think the Minister is not being fair to himself or to the Bill, or to the section that he is asking this House to pass.  Of course the position is that any consular officer &mdash;from Tanganyika or China, from England, France, Belgium or anywhere else&mdash;who employs a gardener here, is under no obligation whatsoever to contribute to that gardener's unemployment insurance, national health insurance or anything like that.  He is under no obligation whatsoever.  The Minister's section here provides as it should provide, because the same right is accorded to our consular officers in other countries, that he shall not be liable in any civil or criminal proceedings for any act or omission here.  That is the law here and abroad.  Why is the Minister trying to cod the House <Col N="460" /> by suggesting in some peculiar way that he would have liability?  He would not be liable&mdash;the Minister knows it and the House knows it.  Why not admit it and let us have an end to it?  Deputy Corish is perfectly right. Practically all of the countries with whom we have diplomatic relations are countries with whom we like to have diplomatic relations and they all will agree with our domestic social requirements and they will stamp cards and will make the contributions that ordinary employers are bound to make; but if they do not, there is nothing we can do about it.  Neither the Minister nor anyone else can do anything about it.  Why not admit that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Higgins is reading more into this Bill than is in it.  The fact is that this Bill will grant to consular officers certain immunities and privileges which are given to diplomatic representatives, but these immunities and privileges are only granted to consular officers in their official capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chinese Consul might have a consular office in O'Connell Street and might have a private residence in the County Meath. If he has a private residence in the County Meath he is not performing his consular services there, and would not come under the immunities granted to him by this Bill as he does when he is performing consular acts in his consular offices in O'Connell Street.  In his consular office in O'Connell Street, he would enjoy immunity, but not on his farm in the County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the position with regard to consuls.  It is different in regard to diplomatic representatives.  They have full and complete immunity for all their acts, and no attempt can be made to distinguish between what would ordinarily be regarded as personal acts and official acts.  They are covered fully and completely and cannot be held responsible in the Irish courts unless they waive their immunity.  I have already told the House that a <Col N="461" /> very sensible arrangement has been made in the case of motor cars. Diplomats here, as regards acts arising in these cases, will waive their immunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, of course, that, while they must have absolute immunity in order to protect themselves, they get around that in another way.  They are commanded by their Governments to obey the laws of the country to which they are accredited.  In that way they would fulfil all these requirements, or at least they are supposed to fulfil them.  They are bound to comply with all these things, for example, the use of stamps and so on.  I take it that, over and above the immunity which they enjoy, they are bound&mdash;in fact it is inherent in their appointment to a friendly country&mdash;to obey the laws of that country, no matter what those laws are, civil and penal.  That is the position as far as I know it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1), page 2, to delete lines 26 and 27 and substitute &ldquo;&lsquo;the prescribed period&rsquo; means the period beginning on 1st January, <Col N="462" /> 1951, and ending on 31st December, 1958&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to extend the period in respect of people who have spent considerable sums of money on building since materials became plentiful, that is, since 1950, so that they may be put in a position to reap some benefit from this Bill when it becomes an Act.  I think that is something which the Minister should take into consideration.  It may be said that it is hard to defend retrospective action, but, seeing that the principal part of all reconstruction and rebuilding work has taken place within the last four or five years, it surely would be harsh treatment for people who had spent considerable sums of money on such work if they were to be deprived of all benefit under this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to extend the period in respect of which this Bill will operate.

      <P>I am sure Deputy Briscoe will honour the words that he spoke here on the Second Reading. Deputy MacCarthy is not here at the moment.  I imagine that he is engaged preparing a speech in favour of the amendment.  The purpose of the amendment&mdash;it goes slightly further though not very much further, than Deputy Briscoe urged on Second Reading&mdash;is <Col N="463" /> to provide, in effect, that roughly for a period of seven years from the time at which the food hygiene regulations came into operation in 1951 business people and others owning buildings who improved their buildings should be entitled to the benefits of the Bill.  I cannot see much objection to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister, I think, agreed in principle with, or felt there was something in what Deputy Briscoe said on the Second Reading, and I am certain that, merely because the amendment is put down by me, the Minister will not find himself in violent opposition to it.  It does not cost the State anything and does not cost the Department of Finance very much.  It merely provides that those who have already improved their premises will be entitled to the benefit of this legislation.  Now, when we are providing some measure of relief for business people improving their premises, I feel that we should extend it to the owners of small shops who spent money on improving their premises, although faced with an increase in valuation, an increase in income-tax and in the outgoings of their business, by reason of having been compelled to spend that money in the past two or three years.  I suggest also that we should not in the future confine it merely to the period ending in 1956, but should extend it to a full period of seven years.  I have no doubt that the good sense of the amendment will appeal to the good sense of Deputy Briscoe who is the foster-father of this amendment and who, I am sure, will not disown his own foster-child.</P>

      <P>I am really amused by the manner in which Deputy O'Higgins attempts to become the custodian of the foundling of which I am now the foster-father.  The Deputy attempts by his amendment to get something by trying, as he says himself, to commit me to a part of his amendment.  The Deputy does not know what he is talking about in this matter, so far as local authority funds are concerned.  It is true that, on Second Reading, I petitioned the Minister to extend the period for qualifying to 1958 and I gave my reasons, the main reason being that <Col N="464" /> because some people might be induced to commence now on rather largescale building schemes which could not be completed by 1956, they should be encouraged to go ahead and get the benefit.  That is as far as I went.  That is a minor part of the amendment, and I am satisfied to accept the Minister's promise, if he will give it, that he will be prepared to consider an extension of the period at a later stage if it is found necessary.</P>
      <P>The sole purpose of the Bill is to induce people at this moment to get on with the doing of work which will give employment, and, if the period is extended too far, there will be a postponement of activity by these people. We do not know how many will take advantage of this when it is passed, but the Minister, I understand, holds the view that the sooner we get private people to engage in these operations, and to take in quickly as many of the unemployed as possible, the better.  If we find that certain difficulties have arisen in respect of particular schemes when the Bill has become an Act, we can bring in amending legislation to extend it, and I propose to ask the Minister if he will give a promise in that form.  I am not going to be walked by a trick into something which I did not advocate at all.  I did not advocate going back to 1951.  I did suggest that there might be some reason to go back to the beginning of the corporation financial year which is April 1st.</P>

      <P>Is Deputy O'Higgins a member of the Dublin Corporation or of any local authority?  Will he stand over an increase in rates on what he calls the already overladen ratepaying population in the form of an additional impost to secure from them a repayment for others who have paid?  The innocence of Deputy O'Higgins is amusing.  He has not got to face the criticism for every penny that goes on the rates and to justify it, but that is what we members of local authorities have to do.  We come here with a full sense of responsibility and at the moment we are quite prepared to praise the Minister and the Government for what they are doing to help local authorities to do their share in bringing relief to unemployed people and removing from the backs of the ratepayers a great deal of the burden which would fall on them as a result of this.  I want Deputy O'Higgins to know that I have answered him clearly, emphatically and without any evasion <Col N="466" /> whatever and that I was not born yesterday.  I am not going to be brought into the Lobby by him to support an amendment which contains part of a suggestion of mine in order that I should unwittingly support something to which I am opposed.</P>

      <P>It is rather interesting to hear Deputy Briscoe of a Tuesday answering Deputy Briscoe of a Thursday, because I was impressed last Wednesday or Thursday evening by the case made by Deputy Briscoe that the Minister's approach to the period set out in this Bill was too tightfisted. Deputy Briscoe said that the Minister is not being fair to business people unless he provides for the next five years, until December, 1958, that this remission should be in force.  I knew, of course, that Deputy Briscoe, with his corporation and public activities, would perhaps be too busy to find time to put down this amendment, and for that reason, in order to assist the Deputy, yesterday morning I tabled this amendment; and I come in here now, having proposed an amendment in the same spirit in which Deputy Briscoe advocated this on the Second Reading, to find the Deputy incensed, indignant, fearfully anxious to answer whom but Deputy Briscoe.  Deputy Briscoe can fight Deputy Briscoe.  I do not know which will win.  I am sure that if Deputy Briscoe could speak with the two tongues, or walk in the same way as he speaks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know that on one famous occasion the word &ldquo;chancer&rdquo; was defined as a person who took chances.  I think the reference was to one of the Deputy's leaders.  However, be that as it may, there is no doubt that ever since those regulations of 1950 came into operation, January, 1951, the demand was made consistently by the Opposition&mdash;and when I say by the Opposition, I mean the Fianna Fáil Party for the first six months of 1951 and this side of the House since&mdash;that some relief in the way of valuation and rates remission should be given to traders who expended money to accord with the law of the land, no one disputing that the law should be such, merely dealing with the situation which obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment does provide that those people would get even at this late hour the remission which those who did not do a thing for the last two and a half years but held their money without spending it, those who <Col N="468" /> were not good citizens, if you like, are to get.  It is reasonable to provide that the people who went through the vicissitudes of having their rates increased and all the rest of it should now get the same measure of relief as those who did nothing.  I cannot understand why Deputy Briscoe is against it. I know that were Deputy Briscoe on this side of the House he would be the first to advocate this minimum bit of justice.  Frankly, I think the Deputy is against it merely because a Deputy on this side of the House proposes it.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give work in the building trade, and I do not think that Deputy O'Higgins is fair to Deputy Briscoe. Last week Deputy Briscoe, myself and others did advocate an extension, but the extension we did advocate was this, that in the case of major construction jobs there might be the possibility that those works would not be completed before the date laid down in the Bill and we did suggest that some way out might be found to cover such major works.  Deputy Briscoe advocated that, but he did not advocate in a general way that an extended period should apply to all works.  He advocated that it should apply to major works where the time given in this Bill might not be long enough; and personally, if the Minister undertakes to see that works of such a nature at the end of this period will be considered favourably I am prepared to take that.</P>

      <P>I want just to say this: I must protest at the insult to my intelligence by Deputy O'Higgins, who said that he put this amendment down in order to help a colleague who was so busy on other matters that he might not have time to put it down.  What I do object to is that in putting it down, apart from the fact that I was so busy on all those public duties, I should be so unintelligent as not to realise that the sting was not in what I suggested and it was nothing more than an attempt to get it in this way.  Would the Deputy not have been better advised, if he really believed in my advocacy, to have put down an amendment for the extended period by itself and left it at that?  He could then have challenged me to support it and add a <Col N="469" /> separate amendment for what he really wants.  I say to Deputy O'Higgins that I would like him to produce in this House any quotation of mine which would bear out the story he told of my attitude.</P>

      <P>I do not want Deputy O'Higgins to go around the country in the next few weeks and suggest what he has attempted to suggest here.  I want him to realise, and it is on record here, that what I did suggest last week was entirely different from what his amendment suggests; and what my colleague, Deputy Cunningham, has just stated is correct.  It was in connection with major operations, major schemes, where the persons contemplating them might feel that they would not be finished in time to qualify and I am quite satisfied, as I have said before, to oppose this amendment and accept the Minister's word if he would give it in the form I have asked, that he would be prepared to reconsider this if we feel that a certain large amount of work might be going on at the expiry of 1956 and might not be completed in the period in which it is asked to be completed by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asked in this amendment to go back in relation to work which is already done and to go forward in regard to work that may be undertaken. <Col N="470" /> I think that Deputies no matter what side of the House they belong to, are entitled here during the course of the Second Reading debate to make suggestions as they think fit.  It is true that a suggestion was made here from this side of the House that perhaps 1956 was on the short side, and a number of very effective arguments were advanced in support of that contention.</P>
      <P>Whatever words Deputy O'Higgins may wish to put into my mouth&mdash;I have not the words I spoke on that occasion before me&mdash;but I distinctly recollect that I said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>You would accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the purpose of the Bill was to encourage employment as quickly as possible and I did not so much object to an extension of the period as the fact that by extending the period one would extend the time in which an employer who might wish to take advantage of this provision in order to give employment would take advantage of it and in that way one would string out the time too far.  I have not changed my mind on that. Three years may not cover every kind of case, but it is a reasonable period. If, as a result of experience gained over the three years, any Deputy can bring forward a case, or a number of cases, to show that for one reason or another work could not be completed inside the time laid down, then I am sure the House and whoever is responsible will listen to him.</P>
      <P>I tried to think of some way in which I could meet this suggestion without going the whole way.  Some Deputies asked why not retain the 1956 for the smaller type of job and decide on 1958 for the larger project.  A line must be drawn somewhere.  One may say everything over £2,000, £3,000 or £4,000 and one job may be either over or under and cause a good deal of irritation because it is either a little more or a little less and is thereby ruled out.  I do not think that is a good solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having examined the matter and discussed it with others, I have no hesitation in saying that having regard to the primary purpose of the measure three years is a reasonable period.  I <Col N="471" /> am sure this House will always be willing at the end of that three years to listen to a case, if a case can be made, for an extension.  Deputy O'Higgins has cited the food regulations as one reason why we should go back and cover work done since 1950-1951.  I see no reason why those who have been obliged to improve their premises as a result of the food regulations should be specially singled out for special treatment. I am not conversant with all the reasons why these food regulations were made, but I am sure they were good reasons.  I have some experience of the sort of problem with which they were designed to deal.  Surely if an individual had premises in which food was being handled for public consumption and those premises were in good condition while the premises of others in competition were not up to the required standard, and if the responsible Minister or Department saw fit to make regulations to induce by one form or another such people to bring their premises up to the required standard, then I do not see why those people should be singled out for special treatment even if that were a practicable proposition.</P>
    <P>I see no case for going back, because that would be entirely in conflict with the purpose for which this Bill was introduced and it would be impossible to know when repairs were, in fact, carried out.  Who could tell whether these improvements were effected in 1950-51, in 1949 or 1946?  It is the practice in relation to measures such as this to make the date the date on which the proposals are published and circulated.  There is an excellent reason for adopting that procedure, and that reason in relation to other measures was no stronger than it is in relation to the measure we are discussing now.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made that we should extend it to 1958.  I think I have dealt effectively with that point.  If I <Col N="472" /> can more successfully reason with my colleagues and convince them, if they have a greater degree of confidence in any assurance that I give them, it is, I suppose, to be expected that they would take my assurance on these matters with much greater ease than will Deputy O'Higgins or any other member of the Opposition.</P>

As the Bill stands at the moment there is an express exclusion of labourers' cottages from the benefits of the Bill, in so far as remission of rates is concerned.  I direct the attention of the House to the fact that if, at the moment, a labourer's cottage tenanted from the local authority is enlarged or improved, the valuation thereof can and will be increased, and there is an express exclusion under this Bill of all such cottages.  In paragraph (d) there is a provision that if a cottage is bought out by a tenant under a cottage purchase scheme and is then enlarged the benefits of the Bill would apply, but my objection is that unless there is such a cottage purchase scheme actually carried out, any tenant of a labourer's cottage who enlarges or improves his cottage will have the valuation increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition under the Labourers Act at the moment no cottage purchase scheme can be approved of by the <Col N="475" /> Minister until the cottage is put into a certain condition of repair and good order, in accordance with the provisions of one of the sections of the 1936 Labourers Act.  That may in certain circumstances mean that if an improvement is carried out, there is nothing to prevent the rateable valuation of that cottage being increased because the improvement has to be carried out before it is owned by the tenant and it is only when the improvement is carried out that the ownership changes from the local authority to the former tenant.  So that the Bill as it stands excludes, very largely speaking, those who occupy labourers' cottages from the benefit of this legislation.  For that reason these amendments have been put down to ensure that any remission we are doling out now at a late hour and with a niggardly hand to certain parties, should also extend to those occupying labourers' cottages in the country.  I have no doubt that this again will be an amendment that will appeal to the good sense of the majority of Deputies, if not, in fact, appeal in such a way as to command their votes.  I should certainly be surprised if the Minister would grudge to the cottage tenants of this country this slight bit of material relief in relation to rates.</P>

      <P>I just want to ask the Minister if the benefit of this Bill applies to the owners of vested cottages.  I think that repairs carried out to cottages in the case Deputy O'Higgins has instanced, prior to sale or prior to the beginning of a purchase scheme, do not affect the rent in any way, but I am interested in ascertaining if the benefit of this Bill applies to cottages where the tenants have negotiated the purchase scheme and where the cottages are vested.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy O'Higgins knows his subject as well as he would, in my view, want to, in order to make his case properly on this amendment from his point of view. There never was, in any of the Housing Acts, provision for relieving houses <Col N="476" /> erected by local authorities of rates. The very excellent reason why no such provision was contained in any of the Housing Acts was of course that the local authority is already contributing very substantially from the rates to the erection and subsidisation of these houses.  The State is also contributing substantially to the subsidisation of these houses.  It was because of that, of course, that in the Housing Acts of the past these local authority buildings were exempted from the operation of any rate relief provision that these measures contain.  Take the ordinary unserviced cottage in rural parts.  The position is that the average loan charges on such cottage would be about £63 per annum.  Of that charge the State pays £31, the local authority pays £19 and the tenant pays £13.  It is in that form that Parliament gave relief to the people for whom the cottages were erected by local bodies rather than in the form in which it gave it to private persons who erected houses.</P>

      <P>Let me deal with the point I am at.  You can question me until the cows come home when I have dealt with that.  The Deputy has asked what is the position if a tenant of an unpurchased cottage were to carry out enlargements or improvements.  Of course, the Deputy should know that the tenant of an unpurchased cottage could not carry out enlargements or improvements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only that but the local authority will refuse a tenant permission to erect even an out-office.  It is not a question of sense; it is a question of experience and I know I am right in what I am saying.  The tenant of an unpurchased cottage has no right to alter or change in any respect the house of which he is a tenant.  That being so, there is no use in making a suggestion that such a tenant is subject to any particular grievance or hardship.  In the case of a tenant who takes advantage of the law as it is and purchases his cottage from the local body&mdash;he is covered and he will get relief of rates in respect of any improvements he effects in the building once he becomes the tenant-purchaser. There is, therefore, no case at all to be made.  As I indicated first of all, the method by which the labourer's cottage and housing operations of local bodies are financed by the State and the ratepayers rules out any justification for bringing these into a measure such as this or into any other measure dealing with housing problems.  In the case of a purchased cottage, I say provision is made so that where tenants carry out improvements or extensions they can get rate relief.  In the case of a tenant who is still living in a labourer's cottage, it is the local body's responsibility.</P>

      <P>Three things appear to me to arise on this section.  There may be repair of the old building, reconstruction work or improvement work carried out while a labourer is the tenant to the local authority.  The Minister says the tenant has no right to do so.  Of course he has not.  But if by some chance&mdash;and there have been cases of this&mdash;a windfall comes to the family and while they are still tenants of the local authority they ask the local rent collector to get in touch with the secretary of the county council to know whether he would object to them putting in a new kitchen.  There is no doubt they would be given permission to do it.  The security for the rent is thereby increased.  The Minister must be living up in the clouds if he thinks that does not take place every other day in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never seen it and I have been on local bodies for years. Of course, Deputy O'Higgins has more experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently so.  Most of these cottages, particularly the older cottages, are family dwellings that have been tenanted for well nigh 100 years by successive tenants in the same family.  Time and time again improvements are carried out to what was originally a small two- or three-roomed cottage long before the Labourers Act of 1946.  There is no doubt about that. If the Minister disputes that he may do so, but it is my experience and I suggest it to the House as one of the first classes of cases that may be affected by the section as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister understand?  I am going to say this in simple words.  I did not suggest that any tenant has the right to reconstruct or improve his cottage.  What I did suggest is this: that local authorities time and time again have given permission to tenants to expend money on the improvement of their cottages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>They acquire no further right by doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They acquire nothing for it but the local authority is glad to see it done.  They get something more and their security for the rent is substantially improved.  That is one set of cases.  The second set is in relation to cottage purchase schemes and mind you this is something that will arise more and more frequently nowadays.  Cottage purchase schemes in a lot of midland counties and in my own constituency in Laois, at the moment have been applied to cottages built roughly prior to 1930.  They extend back to cottages built in or around the time when the parent Act was passed and from that up to 1930 over a period of 60 or 70 years.  There is an obligation on the local authority, before a cottage purchase scheme can go into operation, to put its cottages into a reasonable state of repair in accordance with the Labourers Act, 1936.  That much is clear.  As the valuation laws stand at the moment and will stand no matter whether this Bill becomes law or not, there is nothing to stop the Valuation Office revaluing any building.  There is a statutory obligation on them to do so if required by any ratepayer or any rate collector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 3,000 cottages in Laois the subject of a tenant purchase scheme that has been approved by the Minister and which may go into operation. All those cottages had to have repairs carried out on them.  When the scheme is accepted by the tenants, the tenants will become the freehold owners of those cottages.  Very well, the Minister thinks that is grand.  Any one of those tenants may have a row with his next door neighbour and his particular cottage <Col N="480" /> may be reported for inclusion in the annual valuation revision list.  If it is once reported there is a statutory obligation, under penalty of imprisonment, in the Valuation Act of 1852 to have that cottage revalued.</P>
    <P>If the valuation of a cottage built in 1890 was something round £3 and in the year 1953 or 1954 the local authority spends £100 in doing it up as they frequently have to do to accord with the Act of 1936, you may take it as certain that the valuation officer, enforcing the valuation law of 1852, will decide 100 years later that the annual rent of that cottage is more than £3 per year.  That is a very serious omission in this section and that is what we are endeavouring to deal with.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds and thousands of cottages in the country at the moment that will become the subject of cottage purchase schemes that are going to be made a fair mark for the Valuation Office.  The Minister thinks everything is going to be hunkey-dorey because he is ensuring that, once the freehold owner passes, the new owner, the tenant, then carries out improvements he is going to get protection.  That is not good enough.  It is too late because each one of these cottages at the moment can be revalued and will be revalued because repairs have been carried out and money expended on them.</P>
    <P>I earnestly suggest to the Minister that this is a matter which should command more attention than it has obviously got.  I suggest to the Minister he should ensure that in relation to labourers' cottages passing now from local authorities to the tenants themselves they will not become the subject of a revaluation.  He has done it, of course, when the purchase scheme is completed.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) of Section 3 provides that the Bill will apply to the enlargement or improvement of what is, in effect, a labourer's cottage except where it is owned by the occupier.  That is sound enough, but that only applies to improvements or enlargements carried out after the operation of a cottage purchase scheme.  It does not safeguard the tenant in relation to work done, not by him, but by the county council to accord with the <Col N="481" /> Labourers Act, 1936, to put the cottage into a fit state to sell it to the tenant.  That must be done as a preliminary step to the execution of any cottage purchase scheme.  Once it is done the Valuation Office machinery can be called into force to increase the valuation of any such cottage.  If it is called into force as it can be, either by the rate collector or by any ratepayer, there is a statutory obligation then on the Commissioner of Valuation to include that house for the revision of its valuation.  It is then no good for the Minister or for any member of the Government to say: &ldquo;Well, we intended to give that benefit under the section,&rdquo; when, in fact, they have not done it.  There is no safeguard in the section at the moment and that is why the amendment is put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to see any confusion created concerning this very important matter so far as the tenants of cottages are concerned in the case of the coming into operation of a cottage purchase scheme.  Deputy O'Higgins correctly stated&mdash;the Minister knows it as well&mdash;that a cottage purchase scheme covering about 2,400 cottage tenants has been secured and is likely to come into operation at a very early date.  I want to see that the cottage purchase tenants who will take advantage of that cottage purchase scheme which I strongly favour will not suffer in any way as a result of the coming into operation of the measure now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see these cottage tenants, when the cottage purchase scheme comes into operation, where improvements are carried out, get the same benefit as every other section will get under the terms of this measure when it becomes law.  I am personally aware over a long period of years that decent and industrious cottage tenants in Laois and Offaly have in many cases, and in some cases repeatedly, made application for permission to the local authority to build additional rooms. I could never understand the attitude of the county manager on this matter. In some cases, the county manager demanded the payment of a lump sum of <Col N="482" /> £200 or £250, a ridiculous figure, for the purpose of covering the cost of an additional room to a cottage built 40 or 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>In other cases the county manager was prepared to give permission to carry out the necessary extensions on payment of an additional fixed figure of 1/- or 2/- per week.  I requested on many occasions that there should be some common sense applied in these particular cases when decent industrious cottage tenants with large families wanted to carry out these extensions. Surely to God there is a sound case for saying that there should be either a fixed sum put down by the applicant concerned or that there should be a standardised increased rent per week in these cases.</P>
    <P>A large number of these tenants declined to comply with the conditions laid down by the county manager and, therefore, the necessary extensions were not carried out.  I have grave reason to suspect that, when the cottage purchase scheme comes into operation in Laois, many of these industrious cottage tenants will proceed to carry out the extensions.  They will be quite entitled to do so when they become owners of the cottages but I want an assurance from the Minister that if and when the scheme comes into operation and if, as a result of its coming into operation, these tenants proceed to carry out certain extensions, build additional rooms or carry out other improvements&mdash;I am not talking about repairs as a preliminary because that is already covered&mdash;the tenants in these circumstances will be covered by the benefit of this Bill in the same manner as every other section.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 3, to delete all words after &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; in line 43 down to the end of the sub-section and substitute &ldquo;such increase shall not come into operation for a period of seven years from the date thereof&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is to provide that instead of doling out a two-thirds remission in rates for seven years we should give, for the period of seven years, a remission in full of the effect of the increase in valuation.  I should like to make clear to Deputies who, perhaps, were not present at our previous discussions, the difference <Col N="485" /> between the Minister's section and the proposal which we make.  When an improvement is carried out to a building, or an enlargement is made, or some reconstruction work is done, or even when no work is done&mdash;but we are not considering the latter case now&mdash;and revaluation takes place, it is open to the Valuation Office, having got in by the front door, to revalue the entire building from beginning to end and to assess an entirely new valuation.  A valuation may go up from £20 to £60 or £80.  The Minister, in the section as it stands, provides that in the event of such a revaluation the Commissioner of Valuation will say that of the increase in valuation from £20 to £60, or whatever it may be, so much is attributable to enlargement or improvement and, in relation to the rates falling to be paid on the new valuation, the owner will pay only one-third instead of threethirds for the next six financial years. Therefore, in effect, the Minister's section gives two-thirds remission of rates.</P>
    <P>In the amendment which I have tabled, I suggest it would be better&mdash; in the interests of securing immediate employment for people and bringing about immediate building activity&mdash; that there should be a complete remission for seven years in the rates attributable to the increase in valuation related to an enlargement or the improvement of a building.  I suggest that we should not retain a tax of one-third of the rates on a person who complies with the intention behind this section by enlarging his building and giving employment but that we should give him, for the ensuing six financial years, remission of the full extra rate which is attributable to the improvement or enlargement work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question about it but that to give a man entire relief for seven years is more attractive than to give him two-thirds relief. However, after all, this matter concerns local bodies, too.  A two-thirds relief on any new building or enlargement for a period of seven years&mdash;some of which may have taken place over the years&mdash;is a considerable relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I said on the Second Reading <Col N="486" /> that this measure is designed to encourage people who may have carried out repairs and enlargements and extensions over a period of years and who&mdash;where such work was not measured&mdash;might not now feel inclined to undertake further work, fearing that, on its being measured for valuation purposes, the work done over the earlier period would also be included. If the commissioners are satisfied that a reasonable amount of work is done from, say, the 27th July last until 1956, a person gets the benefit of two-thirds remission in respect of a work that may have been done over a fairly extended period.  To say that the remission should be not merely two-thirds but 100 per cent. for the period is undoubtedly proposing to confer upon the person concerned a great benefit.  However, I think, and many people think, that the proposal in this measure is fairer, having regard to all the interests concerned, and it is as far as I am prepared to go.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that local bodies must be considered. Again, this is a confusion in thinking. We are dealing with a kind of taxation which only arises if the taxpayer does something: at least, that is the law. Local bodies can gain nothing&mdash;at least, they should not gain anything&mdash; unless owners of buildings enlarge or improve them.  I understood the Minister's policy to be to encourage owners of buildings to enlarge or improve them, thereby giving employment and generally putting money in circulation and offsetting some of the worst effects of the present Government's policy.  If that is the intention behind it, surely the carrot should be made as red and as large as we can make it.  We are not costing a penny to any local authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are not charging them.  No one is going to be worse off if we say: &ldquo;Look men, for the next seven years you are free to spend money on improving your business premises, employing more people and generally developing your business. You will not be charged a penny extra <Col N="487" /> local tax because of that and that alone.&rdquo;  What is unreasonable about that?  It does not cost the local authority anything because the new tax could only come into operation if the work were carried out.  It is certainly a more intelligent approach if the sole purpose of this Bill is, as the Minister said it was, to encourage the expenditure of money on rebuilding and reconstruction and thereby to give employment.  It is sensible to do what we in the Fine Gael Party proposed to do in our Bill, to give full remission for the full period of seven years.  The Minister, apparently, does not agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always something &mdash;something sensible.  It is true that if this measure were not introduced certain development might not take place.  It is quite correct to say that a local authority cannot lose what it has not got or what it will not get.  It is hoped that this measure will induce people to improve premises, to make additions to premises and to erect new buildings.  Normally, the local authority would get the full benefit of the rates applicable to new buildings or additions.  What the Deputy does not see is that if there was not some charge, even to the extent of one-third, somebody else would have to pay for the services which the local authority must render in respect of new buildings or additions.  Taking the long view and the broad view, it is a good thing that the services should be extended for the period of years during which they benefit by the remission.  It is not fair to suggest that fellow-citizens should carry on their backs the full charge of the services to be extended to new buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Deputy O'Higgins realises what is involved in local government, I do not think he understands a bit about it.  Those of us who are on local councils and have discussed <Col N="488" /> this in our council and committee meetings are quite satisfied and consider that this is as generous a measure, in all its terms, as we would want, for the purpose we have in mind, namely, to encourage additional employment through private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I have yet to hear a single member of the Deputy's Party who is a member of a local authority advocating what the Deputy is advocating.  I do not know whom the Deputy consulted.  If he were to re-examine it and consider it from the point of view of the ratepayer who is affected he will realise that the Government does not give in this Bill any grant or does not suffer any loss on the rates if they are reduced to the extent of a two-thirds remission.  I represent Dublin citizens on Dublin Corporation.  There has been consultation with my colleagues of all Parties.  We are satisfied that this is the best way to deal with it, not to have a full remission of rates for six or seven years because somebody would have to carry the baby.  Who would it be?  It would be the very people about whom the Deputy was complaining in his first amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 3, line 44, to delete &ldquo;for rating purposes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Before I start to deal with this, may I hope Deputy Briscoe will not become annoyed?  The previous amendment having been defeated by the House, this amendment is to ensure that the reduction in valuation shall not be confined as the section says, merely to rating purposes.  As the section stands, if improvements are carried out a revaluation takes place and the valuation goes up.  That means that the owner of the building has to pay more in rates, more in income-tax and other charges of that kind.  The section says that the remission given shall only be &ldquo;for rating purposes&rdquo;.  In other words, although there is a remission, although part of the valuation does not have its effect in relation to rates, it shall have its full effect immediately in relation to income-tax.  It also follows that in relation to licensed premises there will be other charges for licence duty and so on.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to remove from the section the words &ldquo;for rating purposes&rdquo;.  The section would then read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...the valuation of the tenement shall be deemed to be reduced by two-thirds of the increase.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an amendment that would appeal to Deputy Briscoe as being the <Col N="492" /> very minimum that should be given.  I cannot see that he will need any dustbin carriers to come to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish it were possible that the Deputy's colleague, who is an experienced local authority representative and well experienced in briefing counsel, might not have briefed Deputy O'Higgins on this particular matter. When I read this amendment and heard Deputy O'Higgins talking about this point on the Second Stage, I said to myself: &ldquo;This is Local Government legislating for local authorities, and Deputy O'Higgins is attempting in this to have Local Government legislating for the Department of Finance.&rdquo;  I cannot question the rulings of the Chair, but when I saw the amendment on the Order Paper, I was surprised that it was in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy waxed very hot on this particular item on the Second Stage, without giving us a single illustration of how it might affect the occupier of the particular house or building.  I was hoping he would give us an illustration this evening. Meanwhile, since the Second Stage, I have been trying to find out what the two-thirds remission of the added income-tax would mean in £s. d. in particular types of buildings. I find that in connection with the reconstruction of or additions to existing hereditaments or tenements, as far as I could gather the difference involved would be very nominal.  I agree that in the case of licensed premises other charges are of consequence, but they are separate from the ordinary non-licensed premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite prepared to make this promise to the Deputy and to the House, that I will use my best endeavours in this House and outside it with the Minister for Finance when he comes along, to see if he can bring certain reliefs where reliefs are necessary in order to further employment through private enterprise.  The Deputy must not forget, nor must I forget, that through the National Development Fund, local authorities and ratepayers are going to benefit by a <Col N="493" /> very considerable sum of money being spent on their city or area, which will far outweigh in material matters the saving which will be given to them as suggested by the Deputy in a remission of two-thirds of the added income-tax payments arising from the added valuation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we have interested the Minister at last.  Under the income-tax laws, Schedule A tax is based on five-fourths valuation&mdash; except, as Deputy Cunningham says, in the City of Waterford.  That is done because, ordinarily speaking, our valuations are very nearly 100 years old.  It has no sense when it is applied to the individual case where an individual revaluation has been carried out.  When improvements are carried out to the house, instead of having an antiquated valuation of, say, £20 the Valuation Office come along and say, as they must under the Valuation Act of 1852: &ldquo;We now have to find out the annual letting value of this tenement.&rdquo; They do so and, even being as generous as they possibly can to the owner of that particular house, they are driven, because of the Valuation Act of 1852, to step up the valuation from £20 possibly to £40 and indeed in a lot of cases to much higher than that.  The income-tax law is still the same and the owner of that house continues to pay income-tax on five-fourths of the valuation.  Instead of paying on five-fourths of £20, he will now be paying on five-fourths of £40.  That is a very serious increase as regards the outgoings he has to face.  I suggest to the Minister that there is very little use in expecting people to expend large sums of money for a two-thirds remission of rates.  Many of them would be only spending a large sum of money if their shops, factories or buildings were old and antiquated.  If they are new, with the modern valuation, then they are not going to need the expenditure of money.  It is only the old house that is going to have the inside knocked out of it and a large sum of money expended on it under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, it is only the old, the more ancient, house that <Col N="495" /> will have a large expenditure made on it.  It is ten to one that an old building will have an old valuation, one that was assessed at the time of Griffith's valuation in 1860.  The person who expends money on that will have his house, his shop or whatever it may be, revalued, and again it is ten to one that this old small valuation will be stepped up 300, 400 or 500 per cent., with the result, in relation to income-tax, that the owner of that building, now paying on five-fourths, will have a modern poor law valuation put on the building.  That is where the serious hardship comes in.  I suggest to the Minister, leaving aside altogether the question of the licensed trade which, I know, is like a red rag to a bull when mentioned in this House if Deputy Briscoe is present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If he does, he will spend a lot; if he spends a lot he will do a lot; if he does a lot his valuation will be increased a lot, and if his valuation is increased a lot his income-tax will increase a lot.  That being the situation, the Minister, if he wants to make this Bill in any way effective, should, at least, provide that the remission given in relation to rates would also apply to all charges that follow inevitably from an increase in valuation, such as income-tax and, if Deputy Briscoe will permit me to say, in relation to the licensed trade.  It will mean an increase in the excise duty, and it may also mean an increase in other charges which are not statutory such, for example, as electricity charges.  If people are to be encouraged to expend money then, I suggest, it is only fair that they should get these minimum remissions.</P>

      <P>I am going to resist the proposal that is being made of using this Bill for the purpose of dealing, as has been suggested by Deputy O'Higgins, with such things as income-tax, excise duties and Electricity Board charges.  This Bill has been introduced for the purpose of giving rate remissions, and it is on that we stand. At the same time, I should like to deal with some of the claims that have been put forward by Deputy O'Higgins.  He has cited the case of the businessman who may improve his premises and has his valuation increased.  He is quite correct in saying that if that man has a valuation of £20 he pays income-tax on the basis of £25.  I am advised that if a businessman's premises are improved and if his valuation, as a result of the improvements, were trebled that, being a businessman, he will pay no more income-tax than if his valuation had not been increased at all.</P>

      <P>That is somewhat different, I admit, but it is a very small <Col N="497" /> matter.  The first Act in which the remission of rates under this code was proposed was the Local Government Act of 1925.  Apparently, because of the phraseology that was used there was some doubt as to whether or not the remission applied only to rates. Those who were responsible in those days were so concerned that it would only apply to rates decided that whatever doubts there might be in the Local Government Act of 1925 would be clarified in the Finance Act.  Therefore, in the Finance Act which followed, it was made perfectly clear that the remission given in the Local Government Act would only apply to rates.  There can be no case made for using a measure of this kind to effect reliefs of one kind or another, whether they be income-tax, excise duties, electricity charges or any other. All these are matters that are debated in their own way and on other occasions.  I have already said that this measure has been designed for a certain purpose, namely, to give a certain amount of rate relief to the owner of property or the person who creates a new property by putting his money into work of that kind.  That is what we are aiming at in the Bill. My main approach to this amendment is that it seeks to do something that we should not attempt to do in a measure of this nature.</P>

      <P>I want to put on record that in 1914, before the adjoining townships in Dublin were taken over, the valuation of Dublin was £1,000,000. After the taking over of Rathmines, Pembroke and the other areas in 1920, the valuation of Dublin City was £1,150,000 approximately.  Since then, the rate of building in Dublin has been so rapid and the city has expanded so much, that last year the valuation of Dublin City was £2,750,000, which would show that nearly two-thirds of the city cannot be said to have been <Col N="498" /> valued under the old antiquated system.  When I think of this Bill and its effects, I include the thought that people who have modern private houses may wish to make additions and get the benefits suggested, and I do not want to see the position dealt with on any other basis than its practical application in the area about which I know something.  I should like Deputy O'Higgins to keep this in mind, that, if one does not deny an allegation, it will possibly be accepted as a fact and where the Deputy got the idea, first, that I was a teetotaller and, secondly, opposed to the licensed trade, I do not know.</P>

      <P>It is something we have to tolerate and the Minister for Finance is often very glad of it. Deputy Briscoe says that the position is that half, or perhaps more, of the property valuation in Dublin is represented by buildings of a newer kind. I am sure that is so, but the Deputy did not appreciate the point I was endeavouring to make, perhaps poorly. In so far as this Bill contemplates the expenditure of money on enlargement or improvement, it is reasonable to expect that that expenditure will take place on the older types of buildings.</P>

I cannot imagine a new house in Mount Merrion at the moment requiring as much expenditure as an old house in the centre of the city, and, if money were to be spent on them, naturally it is the older houses will require the greater expenditure.  The only point I was making was that, that being so, one is more likely to find, in relation to people who expend money under the Bill, that they are spending it on houses which have the old valuation, and, where they have the old valuation, the result will be a very considerable increase in income-tax and other charges.</P>

      <P>(2)  This section shall not take effect until a general revaluation of the County of Donegal is made and adopted for rating purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave an outline of the reasons why I was perturbed by this provision in relation to the urban area of Buncrana which is in my constituency.  Had this Bill been before the House in any of the years from 1944 to 1950, I do not think I could have &ldquo;crabbed&rdquo; the <Col N="500" /> proposals because, owing to the volume of business that came into the area from people from Derry City, I felt they could pay any reasonable sum. During those years, the maximum amount of business that could possibly be done in any town was being done in the urban area of Buncrana.  The people of Derry City were short of every kind of provisions and they made for Buncrana by train, bus, motor car, bicycle and on foot, but all that has passed.  During those years, these people who were making money progressively invested an enormous amount of it in reconstructing their businesses and they are now saddled with liabilities arising from these improvements.  The improvements were carried out on the assumption that this condition of affairs was going to continue.  It is a weakness of human nature to think that, when there is a full tide, it will never recede and they did not think the evil day would arrive in spite of anything they could do.</P>
    <P>The valuation of this urban area was increased from £7,000 to £11,000 and I pointed out on Second Reading what was taking place there.  During the past year, four drapery shops have closed down, due to the falling off in business because of increased supplies in the Six Counties, and the buying of goods in Buncrana urban area by people from Derry has disappeared. These people are now faced with this liability which was due originally to some cock-eyed proceedings at the urban council meeting where the proposal for revaluation was carried by the casting vote of the chairman and carried against the will of the citizens and ratepayers generally.</P>
    <P>The businesses which remain there, the few textile industries there are in the town, will be put in a position, arising from this revaluation, of being unable to compete and will be finally driven out of business.  This would be a major disaster for the town which has five little factories on which it lives.  It has no other means of livelihood and the only pay packets earned in the area are earned in these five textile factories.  I shudder to think what is to be the consequence of this when the burden of those increased <Col N="501" /> valuations will fall on these people. Having been caught with it, they probably hope to struggle through, but they cannot.  There is no doubt about it.  I have no doubt about it.  I have been long enough connected with business and seeing the cycle of events in the economic world to know what will happen.  Money will get scarcer, people will get poorer and competition will increase to an absolutely cutthroat extent and those people will be crushed out by taxation.  It has been admitted by everybody in this country and by all political Parties that taxation has already reached saturation point, and in the face of that this community, whose existence depends on doing first a trade with the rest of the country in competition with manufacturers who are not saddled to the same extent with regard to overhead charges &mdash;I cannot see how they are going to survive.  In my opinion, it cannot be done, and I would appeal to the Minister to withdraw the proposal provided for in this sub-section.</P>
    <P>I do it with the utmost and gravest sense of responsibility for the welfare of this community.  They are an excellent people, hardworking, with industries there for perhaps 70 years, who have survived without any protection of any kind.  Long before this State was set up they were fit to compete successfully with Lancashire and wanted no protection whatever but the sheer merit, quality and technique of their work.  It would be a dreadful thing if that community, through a mishap or perhaps the blunder of one man, would have their whole future and their destiny destroyed by what happened and what is provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended last night a meeting of the Buncrana ratepayers where this part of the Bill was discussed.  There are three things that I would like to put before the Minister as a result of my own reading of the Bill and understanding of the situation as it exists in Buncrana and as a result of some of the proposals put before me at the meeting of ratepayers, which consisted of all political Parties.  It was a meeting of all ratepayers and we <Col N="502" /> had represented all political Parties and all organisations.</P>
      <P>The first point is that they are in favour of accepting the Schedule, with this suggestion to the Minister; and the suggestion refers to the grading, that is, starting with £8,500 and adding to that basic figure an increase of £330 to the valuation per year for county-atlarge charges.  You will notice that £330 is the figure added each year to the £8,500.  The Minister explained that that figure was arrived at by finding the valuations for the four years 1946, 1947, 1948 and 1949 and finding an average of those and adding that to the old valuation.  Now the people at the meeting, and I as well, do not quarrel with finding an average, but we do not agree that the four years chosen were suitable years on which to base an average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister that during those four years there was a period of intense building activity in the town of Buncrana, one of the reasons being that mentioned by Deputy McMenamin, that it was a boom town during the emergency period for the reasons Deputy McMenamin has stated.  The emergency being over, the war being over, money and materials and so on being available, increased building activity did occur to the extent that during the four years on which the Minister has based his calculations two shirt factories were erected, one hosiery factory was extended considerably, an urban council building scheme of 48 houses for the people of Buncrana was erected, and over and above that, there was a spate of reconstruction and very many private houses were built.  To base an average which is going to affect the town of Buncrana for the next ten years on the four most prosperous years that Buncrana ever had or ever will have is not fair, I think.  They do agree that an average should be found, and it has been suggested to me, and I agree with this suggestion, that seeing that the average is going to remain for another ten years, it would be only fair to go back for a period of ten years and arrive at an average based on the increase for those ten years.  I would <Col N="503" /> put that suggestion very strongly to the Minister.  I have not studied what the figures for those ten years were but I do know that they would be nothing like what the increases in valuation that did take place for those four years were.  I think it is most unfair to base it on those.  The meeting last night, and I myself now, put that to the Minister as a suggestion, as a basis on which to arrive at something fair, something which would not go all the way but will go a good part of the way to meet the situation.  I might mention that during those four years a very big dance hall was also built, which further increased the valuation.</P>
    <P>The next point in connection with this that I want to mention is that already from the period when the higher valuations came into operation a sum of £8,000 has been paid to the county council.  That is, since 1951 up to 1953 a sum of over £8,000 over and above their just payments has been made to the Donegal County Council. Had this Bill come into operation in 1951 rather than now it would have saved the ratepayers of Buncrana a total sum of £8,000.  If an injustice is being remedied under this Bill, and I grant that it is being remedied, I want the Minister to go further and remedy the injustice of having Buncrana paying £8,000 to the Donegal County Council over and above what they should pay had this Bill been effective and over and above what any other town of the same population and valuation in the county has to pay.  I urge that a method be found to recoup those ratepayers on that score.  I know it is impossible to get the county council to fork out the £8,000 that has been paid and I suggest that this Bill be amended in such a way as to save that £8,000 over a period of ten years by reducing the figure added each year.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to do two things. I want him to reduce the figure of £330 to £250 because it is based on an exceptional period; I want him to further reduce that figure by such amount as will recoup the ratepayers of Buncrana the £8,000 they have been unjustly asked to pay to the Donegal County Council.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to mention is <Col N="504" /> in relation to licence duty, Schedule A income-tax and electricity charges. When the revision took place in Buncrana and the figure jumped from £7,000 to £11,000&mdash;it is now over £12,000&mdash;these charges also jumped.  The licence duty went up fairly steeply. Schedule A income-tax increased.  So far the electricity charges are not affected but they will be so soon as preparations are completed to supply the town with E.S.B. current.  Special arrangements have been made in relation to Schedule A income-tax with reference to the City of Waterford. Instead of paying on five-fourths of the valuation, as is done throughout the country, Waterford City for the very same reason as exists in Buncrana has received a special concession through the medium of legislation passed here and is getting off with four-fourths: in Waterford City they pay on the actual valuation instead of on five-fourths.  I suggest the same concession should be given to Buncrana in relation to Schedule A income-tax and that the licence duty be amended as well.</P>

      <P>I am concerned to deal with the effect of the amendment proposed by Deputy McMenamin before replying to the argument advanced by Deputy Cunningham, an argument which has no practical bearing upon the amendment and the effect it would have if it were accepted.  The amendment asks that this section shall not take effect until a general revaluation of the County of Donegal is made and adopted for rating purposes.  Does Deputy McMenamin appreciate the effect that would have?</P>

      <P>Of course, it does.  It would be very strange if it did not.  If the county council would not get more <Col N="505" /> from Buncrana on a valuation of £12,000 than it would get on a valuation of £8,000, that is a most peculiar form of reasoning.  Deputy McMenamin proposes that Section 7, on which the Schedule that I propose is based and to which it is linked, should not come into effect until such time as the County of Donegal as a whole is revalued. The result of that would be that the town of Buncrana would pay not, as I propose, on a valuation of £8,000, but on a valuation of nearly £12,000.  Deputy McMenamin must not have given any thought to the effect this amendment would have.  He makes the case here as to the plight of the ratepayers in that town and he proposes, at the same time, an amendment which if accepted would have the effect of making the position for the next ten years a good deal worse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham has made some arguments which I might deal with now.  I think the burden of the case made by Deputy Cunningham was that the years which we took in order to arrive at the actual increase that should take place were unfavourable in the sense that they were years of progress and expansion.  The revaluation took place in 1950.  We found the average by this process.  We took the average for the two years prior to 1950, which was £450.  Then we took the average for three years prior to 1950 and it was £332.  Then we took the average for four years prior to 1950 and it was £287.  Then we took the average for five years prior to 1950 and it was £256.  We added these four together and we got a figure of £1,325. We divided that by four and we arrived at the figure of £331.  That is the way in which we arrived at the figure of the annual increase for the next ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy says that these were years of advancement and great business, but in the war years there was <Col N="506" /> no activity at all in the way of business because there were no materials. Surely it would not be fair to take any of these years as representative of a normal year for Buncrana or any other town.  The Deputy does not seem to realise, nor does Deputy McMenamin seem to realise just how much what we are proposing to do here means for Buncrana.  The valuation as determined in 1951 was £11,446.  There have been, I suppose, some increases since.  As the result of this Bill when it becomes an Act, for county demand purposes Buncrana will be creeping to that figure for the next ten years by additions of £330 each year, but the natural normal development that will be taking place in Buncrana between now and then will not be included at all.  Therefore, Buncrana will be getting the additional advantage for the next ten years of that fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not.  We are trying to talk on this intelligently and I do not want to be nasty.  As I explained on the Second Reading, I am trying to do something that I felt reluctant to do because, after all, here was a step that was taken, whether by the casting vote of the chairman or otherwise.  The request was made for the revaluation and, apparently, they did not foresee the result of what that step would be.  As one who had no responsibility whatever, nor had my predecessor or any Department of State, in any shape or form, I am trying to struggle through with a proposal that would at least substantially ease the position of those ratepayers from whom Deputy McMenamin will receive a vote and I will receive nothing at all only the abuse that Deputy McMenamin will try, with misrepresentations sometimes even in relation to this matter, to push over my way.  I do not mind that, but it is no harm to remember that in my efforts here to meet a situation that I know was a bit unfortunate&mdash;it was stupid, it was certainly a very unsatisfactory step from their point of view&mdash; I should have the sympathy and encouragement of one of the Deputies <Col N="507" /> who will benefit more from what I am doing than anybody else.</P>
      <P>I am not therefore prepared to take the suggestion made here.  As far as the case cited in connection with income-tax is concerned, I think we disposed of that on another amendment. If a business premises in Buncrana is improved and if the income-tax is determined on the new valuation arrived at in 1951 as the result of the revaluation of the town, the owner of the business premises will pay under Schedule A and the amount on which he paid under Schedule A will be deducted from the amount on which he pays under Schedule D.  It may mean something in the matter of electricity charges or licence duty, but as far as income-tax is concerned I cannot see where it will have any detrimental effects to business people whose valuations are increased.  Anyhow, I am making this general claim, that this is a matter in which I succeeded in interesting the Government.  It is a local matter; it was their own act.  This Bill had nothing to do with Buncrana in the sense that we are attempting to cover the situation there.  If I succeeded in interesting the Government to the extent of inducing them to give me permission to include in this measure proposals to ease the position for the people there, then I think I should not be expected to go further than, in my view, it would be fair to ask me.</P>

      <P>Now that the Minister, by inserting this Part III of the Bill, has remedied to a great extent the position as it existed in Buncrana, I hate to think that he would not remove the fly or two from the ointment.  It is a pity not to do something, in the first place, about reducing the figure at least to £300 or to £280 and, in the second place, not to do something about the unjust payment of £8,000 which has been made to the county council.  I grant you that all this has been the result of bad work done by the urban council.  I know that it did take some effort on the Minister's part to get round to fixing the situation.  After all, in Donegal, <Col N="508" /> away up in the north, we are far away from the Department of Local Government here in the city and it was a good thing that the situation impressed itself so much on the minds of the Minister and the officials of his Department.  They saw that there was something to be remedied when they took these steps.  It is, however, a pity that the two snags which exist at the moment could not be remedied. In regard to Schedule A tax, the Minister has said that the situation is not so serious because by paying in one way you get it back in another.  There must, however, have been some very good reason why, when a similar 100 per cent. increase in valuation took place in Waterford, the Minister was induced&mdash;it may not have been the Minister but his predecessor&mdash;to agree that instead of paying tax on five-fourths of the valuation, the City of Waterford should pay only on four-fourths. The same good reason, I suggest, existed in the case of Buncrana.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is some time since the Minister made his Second Reading speech on this Bill.  As well as I can remember, one of the things which he said was that it was largely a Committee Bill.  With that statement, of course, we would all agree.  So far as the principle of the Bill before us on the Second Reading is concerned, it is the principle whether we consider the legislation governing factories should or should not be revised.  I think we would all agree, without any question, that that legislation should be revised. <Col N="509" /> The original code goes back to 1901. The 1901 Act, as well as I can remember, was extremely complex and it is quite obvious that, after 50 years, many of its provisions require substantial amendment.  The Act was previously amended, I think, on three occasions before 1922 and, of course, part of what was previously contained in the Factories Act was dealt with by us in the Conditions of Employment Act.  We would all, therefore, agree that it is time that a Bill of this nature should be brought before the House to deal with modern requirements in respect of the health, welfare and safety of those working in factories. As I say, the earlier part of the old Factories Act of 1901, which dealt with the limitation of hours and so forth, has been already covered in the Conditions of Employment Act and therefore does not arise now.</P>
      <P>The most striking thing I felt about the speech of the Minister on the last occasion, a matter which I verified since, was the fact that the Minister brought this Bill to the House without having any consultation with any of the people who would be primarily interested because they will have to work it and carry it out.  I think it is extraordinary that the Minister should bring a Bill of this type to the House without first having had some consultation with the representatives, on the one hand, of the employers&mdash;say the Federated Union of Employers or the Chambers of Commerce&mdash;and, on the other hand, with the two Trade Union Congresses.  There seems to be a sort of feeling somewhere amongst members of the present Government that the fact of having consultation with interested parties before measures are brought to this House means something subservient.  It does not mean anything of the sort.  It does not necessarily mean that one will slavishly adopt and accept everything that is put up to the Government.  Surely, when the efficacy of a Bill such as this depends on the goodwill of those who have to work it on both sides&mdash;the employers on the one hand and the employees on the other&mdash;it is not too much to expect that there would be consultation on general lines before the Bill is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" /> I know in advance the attitude the Minister is going to adopt but I disagree with his view.  His view is that it is better to introduce a Bill, put it through the House to the public, and then leave it to interested parties to examine its provisions between Second Reading and Committee Stage.  I disagree totally with that idea.  We know that it is far more difficult to deal with a matter in that way than if there were some consultation before the Bill came to the House.  I understood the Minister on the last night to say that he had no such consultation and all my inquiries rather led to the same view. I did hope also that the Minister, when he was introducing the Second Reading, would have given us some indication of the record and pattern of accidents, so that we could evaluate the requirements of legislation by reference to that record.  But the Minister did not do so, nor give us any indication of trends in that respect at all and I am quite positive there must be very substantial records and very substantial analyses in his office.</P>
    <P>So far as details of this Bill are concerned I think it is a good thing that it goes some distance towards trying to solve the problem of when is a factory not a factory, in respect of the travelling crane for example which is the old case.  It goes some way in that direction and also towards dealing with engineering construction works.</P>
    <P>The Minister to, I think, has had&mdash;in fact I know he has had&mdash;representations made to him about a provision that is in the Bill which requires a very substantial amendment in wording and detail in order to meet the desire that we all have in respect of basement bakehouses.  The section as phrased dealing with basement bakehouses takes no account whatever of the situation which will arise where there is a town built on the side of a hill.  You may have a premises built on the side of a hill&mdash;the effect there is to give very substantial head room and very large light and airy bakehouses but, nevertheless, because of the wording of this Bill&mdash;that the measurement must be taken from the nearest point of ground&mdash;such premises would be put out of commission under the terms of the section as it stands. <Col N="511" /> Of course, I appreciate that that is a question of drafting and that it is not with advertence to that that the section as such was drafted.  The idea that the Minister had and the idea that is in the Bill was to ensure that there would not be what I might call more clearly &ldquo;dungeon bakehouses&rdquo;.  There are certain ones which require to be very substantially modified in that respect, but where you have a bakehouse which has a very large, high ceiling, a very large number of cubic feet per worker employed, it should be by reference to that that the adequacy or otherwise of the premises should be considered and not to an entirely extraneous position of where the level of the nearest point of ground is to be taken.</P>
    <P>I know one premises where in the front the premises are exactly level with the street and the bakehouses are far and away higher than any normal allowances that are made for the personnel that are employed.  The first floor of that premises is actually under ground level at the back, and as I read the section because the premises are built on the side of a hill you must consider ground level at the back and not the ground level at the front because you go through a door in one section of the premises and it is a cutoff room.  That is a matter which will require to be considered during the passage of the Bill in Committee Stage.  There are, no doubt, many other similar things which will require to be considered but as the Minister said, it is a Committee Bill and it is not proper to discuss them now.  I merely mention that because I think it is the type of thing that could have been avoided if there had been consultation before rather than consultation during the passage of the Bill itself through the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a peculiar thing that this is the first occasion in the 32 years of native government that we have been offered an opportunity of dealing with matters which in fact should have been basic to the whole policy of industrial development which we are assured so repeatedly has been pursued by the present Minister and the present Government.  It is correct <Col N="512" /> that under the Conditions of Employment Act and the Holidays (Employees) Act, we did touch upon certain aspects of workers' welfare which ordinarily might be included under the provisions of the Factories Acts but so far as the pure question of factory safety and factory welfare is concerned this is the first approach we have made to try and bring in our own legislation and establish our own standards. That is worthy of comment because of the fact that whether we listen to Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil&mdash; both of them assure us that during their respective periods of office a policy of industrial expansion was pursued&mdash;the relative claims of the two Parties to have made progress are not material to the point at the moment. The point is that we set out to expand the industrial basis of our community and in so far as the prime factor in industry is concerned we left it to British legislation to afford protection to the human element in industry and we are now proposing in the present Bill to establish our own standards and measures of safety for Irish workers in Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While making that somewhat critical comment it does not mean in any way that the Bill is not welcome.  But it is worth while making that comment so far as those 32 years which have passed before we have been given an opportunity of trying to establish our own independent code of factory safety and welfare.  There is also the other factor&mdash;that this is 1954 and I am personally particularly interested to know why the delay since 1947, because I recall hearing from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that in the autumn of 1947 a Factory Bill was practically completed so far as drafting was concerned.  Now it appears at the end of 1953 and we are discussing it in 1954.  When the present Minister left office I, naturally, and other representatives of trade unions, bore in mind his remark of that date as to the state of readiness of that Bill and its very early availability for consideration both by the trade unions and the employers.  I was somewhat amazed a little later when we inquired from his successor as to when the Bill would be ready, and over a period of <Col N="513" /> some two years during which there was very consistent questioning both in the House and outside it we were never able to trace the Bill at all. Whether the Bill to which the Tánaiste referred in 1947 was regarded as his particular brain-child and had to be placed in the archives of the Department until he returned or not I do not know.  We were never able to trace that Bill of 1947 but I am quite sure that there is not much difference between that Bill of 1947&mdash;I take it there was a Bill almost completed in draft form&mdash;and the Bill we have before us at the present time.  Why delay over seven years unless in the meantime there were alterations in legislation in other countries that might have given rise to further study, I do not know.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome and even though these delays have taken place it is worth while drawing attention to them, but it should not make us too critical of the Bill.  Of course, the Bill does not in any way attempt to establish what we are always advised should be our guide in this country, namely, native Irish standards.  I will not say Gaelic standards, but we can use the words &ldquo;Irish standards.&rdquo;  A great many of us, when discussing economic and social questions, are advised by the pure-souled 100 per cent.  Irish Irelanders that we should never look outside the shores of our country for inspiration and should not follow foreign systems of economics and social theories and still less political and legislative forms, but that all of our inspiration and guidance should be found within the four corners of our own country.</P>
    <P>That advice is, of course, very often thrown at us from members of the Government Party, although they claim the main credit as far as the political life of the country is concerned for having brought about a very remarkable development in the capitalist system.  That is by the way. There is no attempt in the Bill to provide or establish our own native standards in regard to the safety and the welfare of workers engaged in industry, factories and workshops of the country.  We have not even gone out to <Col N="514" /> embody in our legislation many of the conventions of the International Labour Office which are available to us.  In introducing the Bill, the Minister referred to that in passing and pointed out that certain difficulties arose in so far as we did not accept the convention.  Even if we did not accept the convention, I do not know why we could not have regard to it as a guide for legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill we are now dealing with is practically word for word the same as the Factories Act passed in the British House of Commons.  It is almost section by section the same in regard to standards.  In regard to the approach to the problem of welfare, there is no departure at all.  That would not constitute an argument against the Bill because the legislation in the United Kingdom is very up to date.  It is based on the original main Act of 1939, revised in 1948 and much of that legislation has been the outcome of submissions made by the British Trade Union Congress and the special study they made of the work in the main Act during a period when British industry as a whole was working subject to tremendous strains.  Therefore, the weaknesses in any code of safety or welfare during the war years and the years immediately following it would very rapidly show themselves.  As far as I understand it, a great many of the suggestions were used and embodied in the present legislation.</P>
    <P>It is proper to comment, when we are so frequently reminded of the desirability of establishing our own standards inside the country based on our own conceptions of life, our own approach to economics, sociology and politics, that the standards we have accepted now are those which are embodied in the latest and most up to date legislation in the United Kingdom. There is very little that can be said on the Bill, on Second Reading.  It is essentially a Bill for Committee work. I have no doubt we will give the Minister plenty to keep him occupied on the Committee Stage not in an obstructive way, because, like the Minister, we regard the Bill as very important.  We will be as helpful as we can in making the Bill as effective as possible and try <Col N="515" /> to provide that a proper code of safety and welfare for workers will be embodied in the final legislation.  Possibly, this is one type of Bill which could be more effectively dealt with in Special Committee of the House.  Unfortunately, we have the horrible example of Deputy Cowan in regard to the Defence Bill and we had better keep off that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to make one or two general remarks at this stage. First of all, I think there is one weakness in the Bill.  It is one which is very difficult to overcome.  If we are going to try and establish standards, granted they must be minimum, in too many sections of the Bill there is an acceptance that under certain conditions even the minimum standard might not be imposed.  I can quite understand that there are always exceptional cases.  A very strong argument can be made for granting power to the Minister for making exclusion Orders in certain cases.  I noticed that in certain sections of the Bill exclusion can even apply to new buildings.  If there are minimum standards to be applied there may be a case made for granting exemption from the observances of standards where old buildings have to be adapted.  I cannot see at the moment why there should be that exclusion when we are dealing with buildings yet to be constructed and where we hope not merely to provide safety and welfare under the conditions at present existing in so far as industrial structure is concerned but also to secure that industrial structure will conform to these new and higher standards of safety and welfare that should become over a period the common environment of workers in Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Granted that there should be exclusion in certain exceptional cases, it is always difficult to keep track of the many regulations that flow out of Bills of this kind and which emanate from a Department subject to the control and supervision of the Minister's advisers as the final authority.  We know to our cost in the case of the Social Welfare Act that regulations can become so <Col N="516" /> great in volume that it is almost physically impossible to keep track of them.</P>
    <P>On that question of regulation I want to make a comment.  In many sections it seems to me that we have not sought to embody sufficient in the act of legislation itself but have left a great deal to be done through regulation by the Minister.  I have no doubt there is a very good case for that.  I think that, as we go through the sections, it will be necessary to examine very carefully how we can reduce the application of the Act by regulation to the very minimum and secure that the basic sections of the Act in regard to standards shall be defined in the Act and shall not be dependent on regulations.</P>
    <P>Probably the most important part of the Act relates to the question of the enforcement of the Act.  One of the bad features of existing legislation is the weakness of the machinery for enforcing the existing Factory Acts. One of the reasons for that was, of course, that during the period of the emergency there was a drastic reduction in the numbers of the inspectorate available for the enforcement of the various Factory Acts.  At one time the number was so small that it was completely ineffective.  There has been a gradual building up again of the numbers and I gather that when the present Bill becomes law there will be an addition to the staff of inspectors.</P>
    <P>Even though the number of inspectors may be increased I would submit that the manner in which they are required to discharge their duties as inspectors should be reviewed.  We have had the experience very frequntly in the trade union movement of submitting a complaint to the inspectors' section of the Department.  I have no doubt the complaint was acted upon but it seems to be the policy of the Department that we can never find out until there is official action taken what has been the result of the complaint. If we want to find out whether an inspector has gone to a particular workshop we have to check with our own members there.  We cannot be told if there was an inspector sent down and be given such information as: &ldquo;We <Col N="517" /> investigated your complaint and this was the result&rdquo;; &ldquo;Your complaint was found to be without foundation&rdquo;; &ldquo;It was partly correct and there was a certain justification for it&rdquo;; or &ldquo;It was completely supported by the inspector's visit and due process of law is now being instituted&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a weakness in that respect.  I do not want in any way to criticise factory inspectors in regard to their sense of responsibility but it is well known that on many occasions, possibly due to various reasons, their visits are very casual and haphazard and there is a great lack of faith among the ordinary workers in factory inspectors.  Workers know a great deal more about the situation than even trade union officials because they are working in the workshops and factories. They know when a factory inspector goes around and when he does not go around.  It would be helpful if, in regard to the machinery of the Act, it were possible to associate, in a constructive and helpful way, the machinery of the trade union movement and the support and active cooperation of workers in industry. Where the trade union receives from its members a complaint which the trade union checks upon as to whether there is any foundation for it and transmits that complaint to the inspectors' branch, they should be able to help, in consultation with the factory inspectors, to find out if inquiries have been made and whether in fact the complaint was found to be supported by the inspector's investigation.</P>
    <P>On many occasions it may well be that when an inspector comes to check on a complaint he meets with certain difficulties.  He finds it is not possible to pursue his inquiries in the way he would like.  Further consultation with the trade union and the workers in a particular factory might prove very helpful to the inspector.  The suggestion seems to be that if an employer comes under suspicion for having committed a breach of the Factory Acts we must play fair with him and give him every chance to get away from being found out.  I submit the opposite is the case and that, subject to not trespassing on his rights as a citizen <Col N="518" /> and granting him ordinary equity and justice in regard to investigations, every type of machinery that is available, whether it be through the trade unions or through the workers' welfare committees in factories, and so on, should be used by the inspectors to ensure that the protection which this House is providing for workers is made available and that there is no evasion or breach of the Act.</P>
    <P>Because of this gap between the time the trade union make the complaint and the subsequent activities of the inspectors until you hear of a prosecution in court, it is very difficult at times not merely to submit a complaint but to follow it up in the same way as a member of this House follows up complaints made to any other Government Department.  If I make a complaint, for example, to the public health section or the housing section of the corporation, I can keep ringing them up and following up the matter every day of the week.  If at any time they meet with certain difficulties, I may be able to assist them to overcome those difficulties so that they can pursue their inquiries or avail of information which finally enables them to make a decision.  However, our experience in the application of the Factories Acts&mdash;and this also applies to the enforcement of the regulations by the General Labour Committee in regard to wages and conditions&mdash;is that we have that gap which often reduces the enthusiasm not so much of trade union officials but of workers for bringing forward reports with which we could deal, because we are never able to tell them what particular action is taken in the matter.  They just have to wait and see.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in so far as the enforcement machinery itself is concerned, the Minister should take a somewhat bolder step than he apparently has decided to take in the Bill up to the moment by trying to associate the enforcement of the Act, particularly in regard to safety and also welfare, with the actual workers in the factories and workshops.  While Section 48 is very indefinite the White Paper circulated with the Bill does indicate that &ldquo;This section envisages the setting up <Col N="519" /> of safety committees in factories.&rdquo;  I gather possibly what the Minister has in mind that, taking advantage of that section, he will try in a tentative and timid way the establishment of some committees, and if they are successful and if they are not open to strong objection by the Federation of Irish Manufacturers and a number of other professional bodies, he may pursue the matter further.</P>
    <P>I feel the Minister should grasp the nettle a little more firmly.  If we are serious when we speak of the workers' participation in management&mdash;not talking about profits&mdash;and the workers' interest in increasing productivity, surely we should not hesitate to suggest that the workers should from the beginning be given definite statutory and legal rights in regard to their safety and welfare and particularly in regard to safety, that in factories and workshops of a certain minimum size there should be a statutory safety committee with representatives of workers on it. Furthermore, there should be an effort not merely to get them to accept the statutory duties but, through that, to take an interest in what is also part of production, that is, safe production. Many of the difficulties that we speak of as being obstacles to increased productivity are in many cases factors of safety and welfare to which nobody pays particular attention.</P>
    <P>In regard also to the drafting of regulations under the various sections of the Act and also in regard to enforcement, there should be something in the nature of a consultative committee&mdash;I suppose I naturally would prefer only trade unions but I grant that the employers have an interest as well.  There should be something in the way of consultative committees of a permanent character both in respect of the making of regulations and particularly in so far as regulations make it possible for the Minister to continue to apply an increasingly higher standard as industry expands and the conception of industrial safety and welfare improves. In the same manner, something in the way of permanent consultative committees <Col N="520" /> should be available to the inspectorate branch and, in fact, the trade union should be tied in, in some degree, in a consultative capacity in regard to the effectiveness of the inspectorate machinery.  I am not saying that every time a factory inspector goes into a workshop he should be accompanied by a trade union official. It could be done periodically, from an overall point of view, for the purpose of seeing whether the inspectorate machinery is proving effective.</P>
    <P>I come now to the matter of enforcement. I notice that in the various sections where provision is made for penalties for breaches of a section, and also in the clause at the end of the Bill dealing with offences in general against the Bill, there is the usual provision that an offence will be subject to a fine not exceeding £10, £20 or whatever it may be.  A special section which I welcome deals with penalties where fatal accidents occur because of breaches of statutory provisions.  Another aspect of that matter is our experience of the attitude of the courts on many occasions to breaches of the existing factory legislation.  Everyone is aware that the penalties in respect of breaches of the minimum wage regulations or of factory legislation itself or in regard to welfare are very often farcical.  You read of an employer being prosecuted in respect, maybe, of 20 offences and that he is fined, say, 2/6 on each count.  Granted that in the 20 cases there has been no serious breach, no serious injury to a worker, no fatal accident; that is the luck of the game.  To impose a fine of 2/6, 5/-or 7/6 on an employer in a fairly substantial way of business, and to have that become known to his workers, is to disgrace the word &ldquo;legislation&rdquo; itself because that same man will go out of the court after the case has been heard and he will probably spend twice as much on a dinner.  Yet, the fine is not merely to represent a penalty on him for his failure to observe the law; it is also intended to be an inducement to secure that, in future, he will observe the law.  A fine which is brought down to shillings does not in any way bring about that point of view in the average employer. <Col N="521" /> Certainly it will not bring about an acceptance of their moral as well as their legal obligations on the types of employers against whom this particular legislation is directed, i.e. the employer who will fail to take proper precautions for the safety of his workers; the employer who will fail to provide proper measures of welfare and the employer who, generally, is working his workshop on the cheapest basis he can.</P>
    <P>Such an employer will not be unduly concerned if, after saving himself considerable expenditure on safety or welfare measures or on paying the minimum wage&mdash;after possibly saving himself hundreds or thousands of pounds&mdash;he is then given a light tap on the back and told that he is a bad boy and fined a few pounds.  In my view, we should examine on the Committee Stage whether we can ensure that the courts will take the same view of breaches of legislation as this House does when it passes legislation.  Granted that when we say a penalty will be subject to a fine not exceeding £20 we do not expect that in the case of every proven offence the maximum fine will be imposed, nevertheless, we expect that the punishment will be measured to the seriousness of the offence.  Where we see that the maximum fine is £20 and then that a person is fined maybe 5/-, 7/6, 10/- or 12/6 on a number of offences, sometimes reaching as many as 20 or 30, I think that is departing from the spirit in which this House put through the legislation.  I personally feel and I think it is generally accepted that if that will be our experience under the new code then, before the code finally leaves this House, we should try and remedy that defect and ensure that if it is accepted that industry has an obligation to the people working in it, and that the country has an obligation to the people who serve in industry&mdash; and if that obligation is embodied in the statutory code&mdash;then it should not be possible because of lack of proper understanding on the part of those who administer the law to permit those who break the law to escape too lightly and in complete contravention of what we intended when passing the code in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman commented on the fact that there had been no consultation with representative organisations or other interested parties before the Bill was presented to the House.  I do not think there is any point in that criticism.  It was well known to everybody that this Bill was in course of preparation and I had made known publicly and to those who had approached me regarding its provisions that it was my intention to proceed by way of preparing and circulating a Bill, leaving it to the interested organisations and affected firms and individuals to make their representations as to desirable amendments between the Second Reading and the Committee Stages.</P>
      <P>I had intended, as the House knows, to have the Second Reading debate concluded before the Christmas adjournment so that there would be the whole period of the adjournment between the two stages.  That did not prove to be possible, but, nevertheless, most of the interests affected by the Bill have proceeded on the assumption that the Second Reading would be carried and that the Committee Stage would be taken this session. Quite a number of organisations&mdash;trade unions, employers' organisations and individual firms&mdash;have already made representations to my Department regarding provisions of the Bill and have suggested amendments and extensions of the Bill and these representations are being considered.  Some of them may be the cause of amendments to be proposed by me on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It is not easy and, personally, I have no desire to attempt to answer Deputy Larkin's criticism about the delay in producing this Bill.  For my own part, I may say that I recognised right at the beginning of the effort towards industrial development in this country that legislation of this character&mdash;legislation dealing with conditions of employment in factories&mdash;was necessary here.  As I explained to the House when introducing the Bill, I had intended originally that there would be one comprehensive measure dealing with all issues affecting conditions of employment in factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was preparing that measure <Col N="523" /> I was, however, forced to the conclusion that it would take a long time to complete it and get it on the Statute Book.  I decided, therefore, in 1935 to divide the task into two parts.  As I explained, one of these parts was completed when the Conditions of Employment Act came into operation in 1936, and then the completion of the second part was put in hands, the preparation of a Bill such as is now before the House.  That was proceeding in the years between 1936 and 1939 and some progress had been made towards getting it to the Dáil when the war started.  As I informed the Dáil then, I decided to postpone the attempt to reform the Factories Act until after the war because it would clearly be difficult to impose conditions upon factory owners, requiring the alteration or extension of factory premises in many cases at a time when materials were scarce and the problem with most factories was to keep them working.  I do not think that I said a Bill was drafted in 1947.  What I said was that I had taken decisions then upon the form of the Bill, upon each individual section that was to be comprised in the Bill, and had given instructions that its drafting was to proceed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin will not ask me to explain any delay between 1948 and 1951, but it will perhaps be realised by some Deputies that a Bill of this kind is always difficult to get out of the parliamentary draftsman's office.  It is a complicated, technical Bill, to which the draftsmen, naturally, want to give very careful attention because every section in it will almost certainly be on some occasion the subject of proceedings in the courts, and there is always the tendency to put it back in favour of more urgent legislation.</P>
    <P>When I took up the matter again, in 1951, I went back over the decisions I had taken in 1947.  Some of them I decided to amend.  There have been developments since 1947.  First of all, there was the Report of the Commission on Youth Unemployment, which contained a number of recommendations bearing upon this legislation. Secondly, there was the intention to introduce new legislation by the Minister <Col N="524" /> for Health and the Minister for Health and myself found it necessary to reconcile our views as to our respective functions in respect of the health of workers employed in factories.  However, the drafting of the Bill was put in hands and the measure is now before the House.</P>
    <P>Fifty years have passed since the existing law was enacted.  It may be 50 years before there is another Bill of this kind before the Irish Legislature. I think, therefore, we should take our time over it.  It is not the type of measure that should be rushed because it is unlikely that it will be casually amended merely because some sections of it are found to be slightly defective. If and when another Bill of this kind comes before the Legislature here it will be because of some fundamental change in the general outlook on factory legislation rather than because of a desire to effect minor adjustments in particular provisions.</P>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy Larkin has in mind when he refers to Irish standards in legislation of this kind, nor do I think it is a criticism of the Bill to say that it has very close similarity to legislation passed by the British Parliament.  We based the Bill to a very great extent on the Conventions of the International Labour Organisation.  It is the aim of the International Labour Organisation to endeavour to get uniformity in legislation of this kind in all countries and it is, therefore, possibly true to say that this Bill also has a close similarity to corresponding legislation in other countries which have adopted the International Labour Office Conventions as their guide.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is passed it will be possible for this country to ratify practically all the International Labour Office Conventions dealing with this matter.  Where we will not be able to ratify them is where the International Labour Office mistakenly introduced in their conventions recommendations or proposals which were not properly the concern of factories legislation at all.  While our law, in so far as it deals with employment in factories, will be in conformity with the recommendations of these conventions, <Col N="525" /> formal ratification may not be possible.</P>
    <P>There is another reason also why I think we should have special regard to the provisions in British legislation. Our present law is that which was enacted in Britain 50 years ago.  The practice of the Department of Industry and Commerce in enforcing the law, the standards accepted by manufacturers and workers, have grown up in much the same way here as in Great Britain and any attempt to introduce some completely different set of principles would only cause unnecessary complication and would, I think, make our factories legislation ineffective, at least for a while.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Larkin rightly remarked, the legislation in England is quite up to date.  It represents the outcome of the experience of the British people&mdash; and they have more knowledge of the problems arising in manufacturing industries than we have&mdash;over a long period, and also the results of pressure by the British trade union movement, based upon their knowledge of what was required.</P>
    <P>There may be other reasons also, of a practical nature, why we should try to keep our legislation in line with British legislation in this respect or, at any rate, not depart from it unless differences in our circumstances or some obvious advantage justify that course.</P>
    <P>Many of our factory managers, many of the technical experts who are employed for the promotion of Irish industry have come here from Great Britain and, naturally, they would apply in their operations here the experience they secured in the operation of the British code.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the general view expressed by Deputy Larkin that it is not desirable that we should make too many exceptions from the requirements of the Act to meet the difficulty of individual cases.  Nevertheless, it is recognised that we may have to do so, particularly where the coming into force of this new Bill may require substantial alteration in existing factory premises.  The power we take in the Bill is to postpone its full enforcement in particular cases where there is <Col N="526" /> good reason for it.  I agree, however, that ordinarily it would be undesirable that particular industrial firms should be excepted from maintaining the conditions and observing the regulations which are enforced on others.</P>
    <P>I doubt that it will be practicable to avoid in many of these sections giving power to the Minister to make regulations nor would it be desirable to attempt to make the Bill too rigid by setting out in the legislation the details of the conditions that must exist in factories.  By having power of regulation there is an element of elasticity introduced.  The regulations can be changed more easily than the legislation can be changed and while it is desirable to state clearly in the law what factory owners must do, wherever it is possible to do so, if there is likelihood that these requirements may change with changing circumstances, it is better to take power to deal with these matters by regulation than by specific provisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin spoke at some length on the subject of the enforcement of the legislation.  He approached it, however, I think, from the basis that the problem of enforcement is solely to get employers to conform with regulations. It is true to say that there are far more factory accidents caused by the neglect of workers than by the neglect of employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in what the Deputy said in that connection. Anything that might get workers to appreciate that these regulations are made in their own interest would be helpful.  We put the obligation, in the main, on the employer to see that the regulations are enforced.  If the worker, for his convenience, removes the fencing off a machine or does not wear goggles when he should, or if girls in some factory think their permanent waves would be upset and do not conform with the regulations to keep their heads covered, the employer can be prosecuted.  There would be introduced an element of difficulty in enforcement if the approach were solely from the <Col N="527" /> point of view of seeing that the employer did his job.</P>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to why the inspection branch of the Department is reluctant to tell trade unions of progress on the investigation of complaints made by them.  I know that a great many of the special investigations follow on complaints received from individual workers who expressly urge that their names should not be made known to the particular employer, for fear of victimisation.  There is, naturally, a tendency in the branch to keep their sources of information to themselves.</P>

      <P>Might I interrupt the Minister?  There was one case where a dispute was threatened, as to whether a particular place was safe to work in or not.  The men asked the inspector to examine it and would have been prepared to accept his decision.  He could not give it and they were faced with a dispute as to whether the place was dangerous or not.  Was that an extraordinary case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal practice of the inspection branch is not to prosecute unless a prosecution is necessary to get compliance.  If the inspector visiting the factory finds that a regulation is not being observed&mdash;that a machine is not properly fenced or that the heating or ventilation are not right &mdash;he tells the employer: &ldquo;Fix this and have it fixed before I am back again.&rdquo; It is only in the event of it being found on second inspection that the complaint has not been rectified that a prosecution would follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with Deputy Larkin in his comments on the inadequacy of the penalty sometimes enforced by the courts.  That is something we have to put up with.  I think the practice of not prescribing minimum penalties in our legislation is quite sound.  I had recourse to minimum penalties in some of the emergency measures and the result was not always what I expected. The tendency on the part of the justice <Col N="528" /> who felt that the minimum penalty prescribed was too severe, was to acquit, so that the person charged, instead of being penalised to some extent, suffered no penalty at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will convey that suggestion to my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  These are matters we can consider.  I would like to see this factory inspection made efficient.  We have to recognise there is some danger that the legislation, and the system of inspection under it, may be used to victimise either individual employers or individual workers by the making of frequent or unjustifiable complaints. There are certain safeguards we have to enforce but these are matters which I am quite prepared to consider on the Committee Stage.  Subject to the general requirement that, while protecting the health and safety and welfare of our workers, we do not impose too heavy a burden on industry, I would be prepared to consider any amendments suggested.</P>
      <P>There was a suggestion that this Bill could go to a Special Committee.  I do not want to come to a decision on that until we see how many amendments we are likely to have.  A number of trade unions, some individual firms and some groups of employers have already discussed the provisions of the Bill with us.  At the moment, the indications are that no great difficulties will arise from their recommendations.  In so far as it is decided to adopt them, quite simple amendments will cover them.  It is only in the event of there being a clear gain in time that I would agree to a Special Committee.  It is quite possible that, when we come down to details on individual sections, we will find the number of amendments may not be so abnormal as to require a Special Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to a Special Committee, it can only have value if the members appointed to it attend its meetings.  I think the Minister will agree that is so.  It has been <Col N="529" /> on trial but if it has apparently not been successful the Minister will find that is due to the fact that a very substantial number of the members appointed did not attend the meetings.</P>

      <P>On Friday last, when I moved the adjournment of the debate, I indicated that I would avail of the opportunity over the week-end to look up Canadian law, British naval law and the Police Forces (Amalgamation) Act, 1925.  These were three Acts specially mentioned by the Minister and I was particularly interested in what the Minister said on that point.  I find, in column 316 of the Dáil debates for the 11th February, 1954, that this is what the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The decision to change over completely to the regulations system was taken by one of my predecessors in 1949.  While the decision was based mainly on administrative considerations there are ample precedents for dealing with such matters by regulations rather than in legislation. In this country, for example, forfeitures and penal deductions in the case of the Garda Síochána are dealt with by regulations made by the Minister for Justice (with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance) under Section 12 (1) of the Police Force Amalgamation Act, 1925.  The British, in spite of having these provisions in their Army Act, deal by regulations with forfeitures <Col N="530" /> and deductions in the case of the Navy.  So they are not wedded to that system any more than we are. That this procedure is now the modern trend in other countries is indicated by the fact that the Canadians adopted the regulations system in their National Defence Act of 1950.  I made that clear at our discussions during the Special Committee debates.  I do not think I impressed Deputy Cowan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Captain Cowan: You did not convince me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I regret to say that, having read the three Acts referred to, I came to a completely different conclusion from that of the Minister.  When the Minister made that statement it was not, of course, a statement that was made without preparation.  It was a deliberately made statement, he apparently having considered the Acts referred to.  I want to say that in my view it is a complete misinterpretation of the three Acts that I have mentioned. That is a very serious cause of worry to me in regard to what is proposed here, if it is proposed to allow regulations to be made and to be misinterpreted.  I will submit to the House that these Acts and Statutes referred to have been misinterpreted, and I think that shows why this House should only, for the gravest reasons, give the power which is in the section and which I want to delete.</P>
    <P>Let me take the first one which is the Police Forces Amalgamation Act of 1925.  There are three Acts.  There is the Garda Síochána Act of 1924, the Police Forces Amalgamation Act of 1925 and there is a slight amendment in the Act of 1926 which does not affect the matter very much.  I will take first the Police Forces Amalgamation Act of 1925.  I refer Deputies to page 169 of the printed volume of the Statutes.  I want the House to pay particular attention to the wording of Section 12 of that Act which says that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may with the sanction of the Minister for Finance from time to time by Order regulate and appoint the rates of pay and allowances (including conditions applicable <Col N="531" /> thereto) to be paid to the several ranks and to the several grades of each rank of the officers and men of the amalgamated force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to say that is the section which deals with the rates of pay, including the conditions applicable thereto.  That is what sub-section (1) of the section says, but I want the House to listen to what sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before making an Order under this section the Minister shall cause the draft of the Order to be submitted to the several representative bodies representing the several ranks and grades of the amalgamated force who would be affected by the Order when made and shall consider any representations made to him in respect of the draft Order by any such representative body.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I must say that I was amazed when I came to read that Act.  That is an Act which deals with an entirely different matter.  It deals with a representative body, established by law, on which there are representatives of every rank in the grades under the rank of surgeon, and which has the statutory power to assemble and make representations to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence knows, and his advisers should know, that under no circumstances could we have such a trade union organisation in the Army&mdash;a representative body of the sergeants, corporals, privates, company sergeants, sergeant majors, and company sergeant majors.  But that is what the Police Forces Amalgamation Act prescribes.  That section of the 1925 Act went further.  I do not want to labour the matter or weary the House, but it set out, in subsequent sections, provisions whereby the rates of pay then payable to the commissioner, deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners and surgeon, and the pay of each member of the amalgamated force below the rank of surgeon and the pay of each member of the amalgamated force not hereinbefore provided for shall be in accordance with the rates of pay that were then in existence unless varied by an Order made under the section.  The section also provides <Col N="532" /> that the allowances payable to each member of the amalgamated force stationed in the Dublin metropolitan area shall be in accordance with the rates and conditions laid down by the Dublin Metropolitan Police Allowances Order of 1920.</P>
    <P>First and foremost, those were regulations which only related to rates of pay.  What is in dispute here is not rates of pay but deductions from pay, penal deductions and forfeitures of pay.  Where it is proposed to make any regulation in the case of the Garda Síochána in regard to pay, before the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Finance can do anything in regard to it, the matter must be referred to a body which is in the nature of a trade union, a body which has power to make representations in regard to pay and which can publish its own journal.  In fact, it does publish its own journal in which there is very often criticism of the administration of the Garda Síochána.  It is not outside the knowledge of this House that police forces, subject to similar Acts in other countries, have gone on strike, and that, in fact, there have been whimpers and rumours of police strikes from time to time in this country.  Therefore, I say, with all respect to the Minister personally, that that is not a statute which should have been quoted in this House in support of what it is proposed to do in the section and of the words which I want to have deleted from it.</P>
    <P>I take a very serious view of that. I did so without having had an opportunity of seeing it&mdash;of only hearing the Minister mention these Acts.  I thought that the precedents were not good precedents.  An examination of the Acts proves that I am entirely right.  It establishes very strongly in my view that the persons who advised the Minister are not competent in the interpretation of statutes or of the effect of statutes.</P>

Somebody has to advise him and the best that the Minister can get is the best advice that is available.  That is advice that should be given to me and to every Deputy in the House.  I take exception to its being quoted in support of this matter in the House. That is bad enough.  I could, if I wanted to, waste the time of the House and spend a lot of time on that Act, but I have no intention of doing that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's point is that, in support of the section with which the Deputy has been dealing in the House, the Act to which he has referred was quoted as a precedent. Is it the Deputy's point that these Acts are in no way a precedent for the section because they are completely different, that they are not the same type of regulation, that the regulations made under that Act are in respect of scales of pay only and have nothing to do with deductions or forfeitures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain it briefly to the Deputy.  In reply to me, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The decision to change over completely to the regulations system was taken by one of my predecessors in 1949.  While the decision was based mainly on administrative considerations there are ample precedents for dealing with such matters by regulations rather than in legislation.  In this country, for example, forfeitures and penal deductions in the case of the Garda Síochána&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to repeat that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;forfeitures and penal deductions ... are dealt with by regulations made by the Minister for Justice (with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance) under Section 12 (1) <Col N="534" /> of the Police Force Amalgamation Act, 1925.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 12 (1) is very simple.  It says:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, from time to time by Order regulate and appoint the rates of pay and allowances (including conditions applicable thereto) to be paid to the several ranks and to the several grades of each rank of the officers and men of the amalgamated force.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of interpretation, but it does not mean forfeitures or deductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a different section.  All I am saying is that the Minister quoted a particular sub-section which he said was a precedent for penal deductions and forfeitures in the Garda Síochána and during the week-end I had to examine it.  I have the section and I am dealing with it, and I may say right away that he quoted the British Navy and the Canadian Defence Forces Act.  I have both of these Acts to establish my case that there is a very grave misinterpretation in the Minister's statement to the House.  I mention that now because I want to elaborate on it. Where we are dealing with a matter of <Col N="535" /> such grave consequence, there can be no carelessness in regard to the language used and, as the House knows, when the Minister made the statement, he read out that particular paragraph.  In other words, it was a prepared statement in answer to my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as far as the Garda Síochána are concerned and I hope that when I resume later on I shall be able to help with the matter of the regulations.  The Minister quoted the Canadian Act and I have, with the help, which I gladly acknowledge, of the Canadian Ambassador, been able to read the Canadian Act. It says in Section 36 (1):-</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" />&ldquo;The pay and allowances of officers and men shall be at such rates and issued under such conditions as are prescribed in regulations made by the Governor in Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want particularly to deal with that&mdash;&ldquo;the Governor in Council&rdquo; in Canada.  Sub-section (2) says:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The pay and allowances of officers and men are subject to such forfeitures and deductions as are prescribed in regulations made by the Governor in Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) then says:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unless made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Governor in Council an assignment of pay and allowances is void.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is what Section 14 of the National Defence Act, 1952, of Canada says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where in any section of this Act other than Section 14 and this section there is express reference to regulations made or prescribed by the Governor in Council in respect of any matter the Minister does not have power to make regulations pertaining to this matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is as clear as a pikestaff that, in Canada, the Minister has no power to make these regulations, although that Act was quoted for the House as giving the Minister power in Canada to make the regulations.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister and the House to consider the position of the Governor in Council in Canada&mdash;his constitutional relationship to the King, his Privy Council and their relationship to parliament where they have a Minister like our Minister.  It is laid down that the Minister has no power to make regulations where the Act says these regulations should be made by the Governor in Council.  In Canada, the Minister for Defence may make regulations dealing with discipline and so on as here, but the soldier's pay is protected and can only be affected by an order made by the representative of the King in Council because of the old position of the <Col N="537" /> royal prerogative, which I will open up on the next occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked the Minister to-day was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Agriculture if he will indicate if it will be possible for merchants in rural areas who install drying plants to obtain the maximum price for dried wheat payable at present only to the millers throughout the country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I did not consider that the reply I received from the Minister was satisfactory. Therefore, it is with regret that I raise this on the adjournment. This is a matter of the greatest importance. Last year for the first time in this country a great deal of the wheat was harvested by combine harvesters and the position obtained whereby a limited number of people in this State had a licence to dry the said wheat. Therefore, on account of the wheat coming in to the millers as it did last year more or less in huge quantities at the same time these firms were totally unable to deal with the wheat that was delivered to them, with resultant hardship to the merchants who were buying wheat and more so to the farmers who were growing it and taking the risk of doing so against all the hazards of the weather.  When it came to the time that they finished and cropped and harvested the wheat, instead of being able to deliver it straight away, in many cases they were held up not a question of hours but for days on end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is increasingly evident, I think, to anybody who knows anything about it that it will be necessary for any merchant who wishes to stay in the grain business under modern conditions utilising combine harvesters to install a drying plant.  All the Deputies <Col N="538" /> will appreciate that a drying plant costs thousands of pounds.  The curious feature about it is that merchants or even farmers can dry oats and barley satisfactorily and are allowed to obtain for that the maximum price, but when it comes to a question of drying wheat the position that obtains in this State is that there are 36 people in the whole of Ireland who are allowed by licence to dry wheat and to obtain the maximum price for doing so.  Anyone who buys a dryer can dry wheat but they would not get a licence from the Minister for Agriculture or the Department of Agriculture, as the case may be, to enable them to obtain any price for that wheat other than the maximum green price.  What is the result?  The result is this, that these 36 people have the monopoly. In reply to my question to-day and to supplementaries I put to him the Minister stated&mdash;and I have no doubt he believes this, but I suggest it is wrong&mdash;that these firms, merchants, farmers, whoever they may be, may make an agreement with the millers whereby they would be allowed the maximum price.  My information is this, that merchants who bought dryers, and, in fact, any people in this State who have dryers and have tried to make an agreement with the millers, have not been able to make one.  The millers have simply said: &ldquo;We are going to dry wheat.  That is our right. We have a licence to dry wheat and we are going to adhere to that.&rdquo;  It strikes me as being entirely wrong that 36 people in a country like this should be in a position that they can decide <i>ipso facto</i> that they have the power to decide whether they will accept dried wheat from anybody or not.  Why should they be in that position?  What rights have they over and above any other citizens in this State?</P>
    <P>I think it is a fair statement that the millers have not lost any money in Ireland over the years here.  They had a good opportunity last year and they are going to have a better opportunity next year of making more money than they ever made before.  The advent of lime on the land, the utilisation of lime&mdash;it is not necessary to go into why and how the farmers started using <Col N="539" /> lime&mdash;but the advent of lime and concentrated fertilisers has enabled the Irish farmer to get a more economic production out of wheat than he had in years gone by.  In my constituency and the Minister's, which is a tillage county the same as mine, people are ploughing land and preparing to sow wheat probably to a greater extent than they were before.</P>
    <P>Last year we had a state of affairs whereby lorries were lined up and drivers were sitting in those lorries all night waiting to get into the mills to unload their wheat.  I am not going to mention any names but I am absolutely certain that what I am saying is correct&mdash;that in any mill in Ireland at any time there was a queue waiting, and that delay was thrown back on to the merchant and on to the farmer as well.  It should be perfectly easy for any farmer who grows wheat in this country to be able to dispose of it and trans-ship as soon as it is harvested, but that was not the case last year, and it is not going to be the case this year, because, as I say, the position is very much worse than it was before.  It is a situation that can be very easily met.  The Minister knows quite well that in his Department at the present moment they have a scheme for lending money to farmers to buy dryers.  I have checked on that and I have seen the forms.  He knows as well that co-operative societies have got together and bought dryers for the benefit of farmers, but they have not had the real benefit of drying grain of any sort except oats and barley.  When it comes to a question of drying wheat you are back again to the old story.  The monopoly steps in.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated categorically here to me to-day&mdash;I will read what he said again:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not proposed to extend the present list of licensed wheat dealers and, therefore, merchants who are not so licensed may not purchase wheat from the growers for resale. Merchants who have drying facilities or propose to provide such facilities are, however, free to negotiate with the flour millers for the drying of wheat on their behalf.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> I am not exaggerating when I say that the whole wheat harvest, the handling of the wheat harvest and the drying of the wheat, is handed over to a combine.  That is the state of affairs that exists and that is what we object to here.  We object to monopolies in any shape or form.  The Minister probably spends, in his high office, a great deal more time in Dublin than he did originally on the land down in the country, and maybe the information he is getting from his Department is not providing the facts for him such as I am trying to make clear; but it is a known fact that there was, to put it mildly, a botch last harvest over the drying of wheat when the millers were not able to take it.  They did not have the facilities for it, and if they did not have the facilities last year they are not going to have them this year.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister that he would license any suitable applicant with a dryer, co-operative merchant or even a farmer, to dry wheat.  After all this is a free country.  Why should not anybody who grows wheat and expends capital in setting up a dryer be entitled to get the full benefit from it? Why should it be handed over to a monopolistic group?  It is unfair to do that and I appeal to the Minister to rectify the situation.  If the Minister does not seriously consider this matter, chaos and disorganisation will be caused in the harvest this year.  If, on the instructions of the Department of Agriculture, people grow a particular crop they are then entitled to equitable treatment from the Department. It costs a certain amount of public money to insert notices in all the Irish newspapers asking the people to grow more wheat and possibly people will respond more so this year than hither to for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    <P>The solution is a simple one and the Minister has the solution.  I suggest that anybody who has the courage and initiative to spend £3,000 or £4,000 in putting in a dryer should be free to dry wheat and, having dried it, he should be entitled to the maximum guaranteed price.  That should be available to anybody who is prepared to take the risk of investing money for that purpose.  If the Minister considers <Col N="541" /> this matter seriously he will have the thanks not only of the farmers but also of the merchants and of the people as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is not fully aware of the present controls in relation to the purchase of wheat. Wheat can only be purchased by six categories under the Wheat Order.  The first category is a person who purchases wheat as seed for sowing on land being cultivated by him; secondly, the licensed miller; thirdly, the registered distiller, fourthly, the licensed wheat dealer; fifthly, the holder of a seed wheat assembler's permit and, sixthly, the holder of a special permit to purchase specified quantities of wheat.</P>
      <P>The wheat that is grown is the raw material for the miller.  The drying and processing of that wheat is a highly technical job and I would ask the Deputy if, in sponsoring this motion and asking this question, he is fully aware of the difficulties that would confront farmers in finding the technicians to do this job properly.  There is more at stake than the Deputy is aware of in the proper drying of wheat.  If wheat is not properly dried that will mean bad flour.  Bad flour will mean bad bread.  Surely, after all the years of campaigning and trying to encourage people to grow wheat we are not now going to sacrifice all that has been done and all that has been said by handing over one of the most highly technical processes to farmers who have no knowledge or experience whatsoever of drying wheat, or even to the merchants who have been mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the farmer's function to grow wheat as raw material and, in growing that wheat and marketing it, he is under an obligation to see that he takes reasonable care to put it on the market in reasonably good condition. If he fulfils that obligation he is doing as much as we ask him to do.  In the production of flour we ask the millers, on the other hand, to give us a high-class commodity, and unless we reserve for them the right of processing the raw material we cannot subsequently come back and tell them they <Col N="542" /> have messed up the job entrusted to them.  That is one of the reasons why this task of drying wheat is reserved to the millers.</P>
    <P>There is another reason.  The millers are statutorily bound and obliged to provide drying and storage facilities. They have already spent over £1,000,000 in providing those facilities. This year they are making provision to further extend drying plants and storage.  Is it suggested that we should have duplication of that effort by permitting every merchant and every farmer who wishes to invest money in drying plant and storage to do so, irrespective of the fact that these facilities will not be needed?  That is what the Deputy is asking us to do. If we succeed in getting sufficient storage and drying plant facilities provided by the millers we will be doing a good day's work.</P>

      <P>We can.  The effort is being made and we have been told by the millers they will erect this storage. I am sure Deputy Esmonde will not set himself up as an expert.  I have been advised by those who are experts that this is a highly technical job and that there is grave danger that if unqualified people go into it we will not be able to manufacture flour from wheat dried as it should be dried.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Why should I undertake that responsibility?  My responsibility is to get wheat grown. If I succeed in doing that, I then hand it over to somebody to mill it and it is the miller's function to ensure that he produces a good article from the raw material.  That is the miller's responsibility and we will not relieve him of that responsibility by bringing in a third party to do some of the work he should be doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Our bread to-day contains 75 per cent. Irish wheat.  It took us over 20 years to establish <Col N="543" /> wheat growing and we will not sacrifice that effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting these people should manufacture flour. I am merely suggesting they should be allowed to dry wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking me to permit them to destroy the raw material because it is more than likely that would happen.  I will not permit that.  I will not have duplication. Wheat is grown at a very high cost to the country, despite the efforts of some people who have over the years tried to persuade our farmers not to grow wheat.  There are still people here who would prefer to see the flour and bread consumed here manufactured from foreign wheat.  We have established the fact that we can provide as good bread with home-grown wheat properly handled and manufactured as any bread that can be baked from foreign wheat or from a mixture of Irish and foreign.  I am very jealous of the record we have established in that respect.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said that we had not the facilities to accommodate the farmers this year.  We had the facilities.  We have grown more wheat in the past than we grew this year, strange as it may seem to Deputies.  With the advent of the combine there are many farmers and combine owners who are not taking the precautions they should take and must take if the wheat is to be marketed in proper condition.  I know as well as Deputies know that many combine owners, in order to try to earn as much money as possible in the shortest time, have even tried to work through the night when the wheat was damp and not fit for harvesting.  I have known many farmers who were getting anxious about their crop because they thought it was overripe and were afraid to leave it and who, even when it was damp and not in a fit condition to harvest, brought in the combine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>What precautions are taken to prevent that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>A penalty is the only precaution we have and that is what <Col N="544" /> we will have to impose on people who follow that line.  If we are paying for an article, we must get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the farmers who have to leave it in the field for three or four weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past, before the advent of combines into the country, when we were growing barley, oats and wheat, I saw barley and wheat held for a month and five weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>In bags?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It was safe and secure.  It can be safe and secure even with the combine.  I had barley which was harvested with the combine for six weeks this year in sacks and it was all right because it was in a fit condition when it was harvested.  There is no excuse whatever for the man who tells me that because of the combine he must now get rid of wheat immediately it is harvested.  He does not have to do it if he permits it to get ripe and to get dry and then have it harvested. There is no greater moisture in it than there is in corn harvested in another way if it is properly done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the wheat is not being taken in.  It is not a question of the condition in which the farmer has it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what storage is provided, we cannot take in all the harvest in three or four weeks, even if all the merchants in the country were engaged in it.  The harvest in the past covered a period of from eight to 12 weeks.  With all the goodwill in the world and all the money we can invest in it.  I do not believe we will have it all reaped and saved within a period of three weeks.  There must be some other way of doing it.  You will still have the bottlenecks created.  Farmers who are anxious to use the combine must realise that they also have to take precautions, that they cannot reap corn to-day and think they can put the whole lot of it into the mill at night.  It has not been done in the past, nor can it be done in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to spend £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 on the erection of mills and <Col N="545" /> storage and drying plants at the mills and go down the country and encourage merchants and even farmers? Last year in the County Meath grants were offered to farmers to purchase small drying plants and there was only one applicant for a grant.  These people must realise, as I said, that wheat is a product that must be properly treated if we are to get the best results from it.  The only people who are qualified to do that at the moment, the highly technical people, are in the mills.  It is not the merchants because they have no technicians to do this, and the farmers have no technicians. Until such time as our people are educated in the proper drying of wheat it must remain with the technicians who are in a position to do the work.  That is why I told the Deputy this afternoon that I had no intention of deviating from the present system.  It will be the responsibility of the farmers to produce the wheat in a reasonably dry condition and send it into the mills and it is the millers' function to produce good flour.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to prevent any merchant or dealer, if he thinks he can get a sufficient quantity of wheat from farmers in his locality, from going to the miller and telling him he is prepared to co-operate with him and to erect a drying plant with the sanction of the miller; but the miller will be held responsible.  It is not the merchant who would be responsible in that case.  The miller is the man who is responsible to us for the manufacture of flour and not the agent or dealer who buys the wheat.  He is not our agent; he is the agent of the <Col N="546" /> miller.  That is the system that I am going to follow.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may rest assured that every effort is being made to get sufficient drying plant and storage; and as a result of last year's experience and of the greater quantity of wheat grown I can tell the Deputy that the millers are making every effort to provide extra drying plants and extra storage for the next harvest and that the people who are anxious to go into it need not invest the money they may wish to invest.  Again, for the Deputy's information, I can tell him that I have talked with farmers' organisations in regard to this matter. He asked why they would not get the dried wheat price.  I talked to them and pointed out to them the amount of money that is there for drying.  It would not be worth their while drying wheat for the amount of money they would be allowed for drying.  The sum of money covers many factors.  You have transport costs, storage costs, interest on investment and all these things.  In addition to that, let me tell the Deputy that the farmer who dries his wheat with a 23 per cent. moisture content will lose almost two stones of wheat, which at the present price is worth 8/-. After having these discussions with the farmers' organisations, they came to the conclusion that it would be better for them to leave it in the hands of the millers, and that is what I propose to do.</P>
