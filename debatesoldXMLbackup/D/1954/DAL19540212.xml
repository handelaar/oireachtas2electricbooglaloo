      <P>That the Wexford Gas Order, 1954, proposed to be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and laid in draft before Dáil Éireann on the 29th day of January, 1954, under sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>
      <P>The Wexford Gas Company applied for an Order under the Gas Regulation Acts to enable the company to secure additional capital for the reconstruction and modernisation of plant and equipment.  The Order proposes to increase the authorised capital from £20,000 to £40,000 and its borrowing powers from £10,000 to £20,000.  It authorises the company to purchase on lease houses, cottages and other buildings for use as offices and housing accommodation for their employees. Notice of intention to apply for the Order was given by the gas company and no objections to the making of the Order were received.</P>

      <P>What is the reason for the inclusion of paragraphs Nos. 10, 11, 12 and 13?  These are not new powers. They have these powers already.</P>

      <P>No.  Paragraph 10 facilitates them in the laying of pipes for the supply of gas to premises in <Col N="342" /> private streets not dedicated to public use arising in the case of new housing estates.  It may be argued that the company has the powers.  The provisional Order was put in in order to remove any doubts in that regard. Ordinarily, the company would have to secure the owner's consent and there might be difficulty in some cases where the ownership itself might be difficult to determine.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 9 deals with the disposal of land.  It means that it will not be necessary that the lands should be first offered to original or adjoining owners. It would be necessary under the existing Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;January&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;June&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason for this is to give people an opportunity of making their wills if they do not wish their property to be divided as provided for in this Bill. On Second Stage, I referred Deputies to the explanatory memorandum circulated by the last Government, when they introduced the first Bill, and that point was made.  It is only fair and reasonable that people who do not want their property divided, as provided for in the Bill, should be given fair notice and opportunity to make their will leaving their property to whomsoever they wish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that <Col N="343" /> amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6 may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can discuss them together.  This problem of intestates' estates has a very long history. It had its origin in the days when women were regarded as just a chattel and early legislation on the subject put women in a particularly inferior position as far as the disposal of their assets was concerned in relation to men.  Until this legislation was introduced, the position was that if a woman died her husband could take over all the assets of his widow but if the husband died the widow was entitled to only £500 and after that the balance was divided between the widow and all or any of the husband's relations, relations whom the husband or wife might never have seen; and if none of those turned up to claim it, I think the balance was divided between the State and the widow.</P>
      <P>I agree that this legislation moves somewhat further than that.  It says to the widow that if the husband dies she will get the first £2,000 and the balance then will be divided between the widow and the husband's relations, known or unknown, seen or unseen. What we ought to do in regard to this whole matter is to recognise the equality of men and women.  If the husband is entitled on the death of the wife to all his wife's estate, then, conversely, if the husband dies, the widow ought to be entitled to the husband's entire estate unless the husband makes a will disposing of his estate otherwise.  This Bill, however, does not go that far.  It still retains some of the characteristics of early wifely subordination to the husband in the matter of the disposal of property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have asked in this amendment that the widow should be entitled to all the property up to £5,000, I am not terribly enamoured of my own amendment; I prefer to say where the husband dies intestate the widow should be entitled to the entire property unless the husband has disposed of the property otherwise.  But I do not know whether the Minister would <Col N="344" /> be prepared to travel that far with me.  Giving the widow the first £2,000, having regard to the present value of money, is not doing justice to the widow and I want to give the Minister the opportunity of travelling to the extent of giving the widow the first £5,000.  After all, if the husband dies and the widow is left to provide for herself, an investment in these days does not bring in a lot of money; furthermore, the dead man, the State and community generally, owe the widow the obligation of making some provision by law whereby in the event of the husband dying without making a will she would be entitled to at least a sufficiently substantial amount of her husband's property to provide herself with a competence for the rest of her life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support this amendment moved by Deputy Norton.  It seems inconsistent that on the occasion of marriage the husband endows his wife with all his worldly goods and the State should come in and say: &ldquo;No, only to the extent of so much.&rdquo;  I think it is completely wrong and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought making provision for £2,000 was pretty good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>And also the provision in regard to the residue.  If a man wants to leave all his property to his wife he ought to do it, but we all know what conditions are in this country and it might happen that there might be a parent for whom a man, say, if he died young, might like to make some provision.  It might be a widowed mother, and under the law as it stood she would be entitled to get some of that money.  In most cases in this country £5,000 would represent more than what the average person would have and £2,000 seems to me to be a fair amount.  It was previously £500.  We have also arranged that the widow gets her share of the residue if there is any.  If you go to £5,000 I think you are overdoing it.  The husband can leave it all to the widow <Col N="345" /> if he so desires.  We all have sympathy for widows but there may be other very deserving dependents of the husband. There might be a sister wanting some help and if he did make his will he might say: &ldquo;I will not leave my sister without anything at all.&rdquo;  As was pointed out in the Seanad it could happen that there would be a very old man who married a young woman &mdash;there have been gold diggers sometimes&mdash;and he might say: &ldquo;Why should I give her all my money?  We were only married lately.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the husband desires to leave everything to the widow, he <Col N="346" /> ought to make his will.  We must consider that there might be an invalid sister or an old mother who might be a widow.  Are they to be excluded altogether?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can sympathise with the Minister's concern in that respect, but if the old boy who has got the property is concerned about the sister and the mother, no doubt he will make tracks to the nearest lawyer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>He knows the law at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he can make a will in which he can ensure they get something, but to leave the widow £2,000 in 1954 is not giving her a proper competence.  If this woman undertakes to marry a man at an altar, and if the man there promises to look after his wife for the rest of his life, and if he has got any property, I think she is more entitled to it than the flock of vultures who turn up at the man's wake and funeral, all wanting to make sure that they will get something out of it.  In this matter, my sympathies are with the widow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>All the time?  It all depends on circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the man wants to give something to his mother or his sister he can easily do so by making a will.  Folk who want to do that really do it.  Let us take the situation in which a man dies intestate.  He leaves a widow.  There is a brother who has been in Australia or New Zealand for 30 years.  He has some other relatives whom he has never seen.  Then it comes to the disposal of his property. Who is to get it?  My sympathies and, I think, the sympathy of every reasonably minded person, would be with his wife, that she should have the first claim.  These other folk come flying back to pay their tributes to the dead man whom they had not seen for 20 or 30 years&mdash;a whole flock of unknown nieces and nephews and other relations &mdash;to see how much jam they will get out of it.  I am on the side of the widow.  Having regard to the depreciation in the value of money, the Minister is not going very far; the <Col N="347" /> original £500 was worth more than the £2,000 is worth to-day.  The Minister ought to accept this amendment.  If he does he will have the benediction of the whole House.  I do not want to make this matter a Party issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one angle of this matter which reinforces the case that has been made for extending the limit beyond what is contained in the Bill.  There is the difficulty that in cases where a man might be most inclined to make provision for his widow he takes it so much for granted that he may fail to make it.  That is one of the most common cases.  If a man is thinking about it and if he has any problem in connection with the matter, he nearly always arranges his affairs.  Where the difficulty and tragedy arise is where two people are married and the relationship is such that no question enters into it of property; the thought does not arise. Then, because of the way the law is, something happens which leaves the widow practically destitute.  Is that not the position very largely?  The only answer that may be made to that case is the answer the Minister made, namely, that there might be some dependent relatives of fairly close degree.</P>
      <P>Would it be possible, then, to face the thing this way?  Would it be possible to put the whole right in the widow and then put in certain savers for, say, a mother, father, sister or brother in a specific close relationship like that, barring the cousins, second succession and all the other people whom Deputy Norton has characterised as &ldquo;vultures&rdquo;?  Could you approach it in that way&mdash;to put the whole right in the widow and saving rights for contingent possibilities in respect of, say, a widowed mother or something like that?  The Minister said that this is not a Party issue.  Personally, I would advocate raising it to the £5,000 in the case of a widow.</P>

      <P>As I understand the matter, Deputy Dillon is afraid that the effect of this Bill is to take away the power of an executor to pay a debt of the deceased even when that debt is statute-barred.  The Minisster appreciates that the statute-barring of a debt does not mean that it is not any longer morally due; it means that it is legally unenforceable. The position has always been up to this that in the case of a deceased an executor has discretion as to whether or not he will pay a debt that is morally due but legally unenforceable. Deputy Dillon was afraid that the wording of this Bill as introduced took away that discretion.  I understand that the Minister has an assurance that the Bill does not so do, that the discretion is still left to the executor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night I was dealing with certain matters that were mentioned by the Minister in reply to my motion.  The Minister paid me a very high compliment when he said that I would be satisfied with no Defence Bill except one that I had introduced and prepared myself.  I accept that as an exceptionally high compliment from the Minister because, human nature being what it is, we all think that we can do things best.  If it were simply a matter of who drafted or prepared the Bill the House would not have much trouble in regard to it.  It is because the principle involved in it is of such tremendous importance that I considered it necessary to examine it in all its implications.  I can fairly say that the defence made by the Minister for his proposals did not in any way weaken the very strong case that I made in favour of my proposal.</P>
      <P>The Minister has introduced a section which has the effect of authorising and empowering the Minister to deal with all matters relating to the pay of officers and soldiers of the Defence Forces.  It enables the Minister to make the law that deals with deductions, forfeitures and penal deductions and, having made the law, to interpret it and to decide the law on his own interpretation.  When the Minister makes regulations, as in this case, which are made by him with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, the general position is that in case of any doubt in regard to interpretation the Minister is the final arbiter as to what the regulations mean.  The Act of 1923 specifically laid down the occasions and circumstances in which pay might be forfeited or deducted. There is no such limitation in the Minister's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this new section becomes law the Minister may make any regulations he <Col N="353" /> wishes dealing with forfeitures and penal deductions.  That is clear from the terms of an amendment that the Minister himself proposes as a result of objections that I made to this new idea in the Special Committee.  He says in this new amendment that he will make regulations dealing with the forfeiture of pay in the case of desertion or absence without leave, in the case of custody, imprisonment or detention, in the case of absence from duty on account of a disease or disability arising out of the commission of any offence, and in respect of a new item called unclaimed amounts.  In the same amendment he also proposes that the regulations that he will make in regard to deductions from pay will apply only to articles or services provided&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to know before Deputy Cowan concludes how far he feels the Minister has gone to meet him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>He has not gone anywhere to meet me.  That is the position. That will be a matter for the Dáil.  Section 97 (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations in relation to the following matters&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the forfeitures, deductions and stoppages to which the pay, allowances and gratuities of and grants to members of the Defence Forces may be subjected,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  the deductions and stoppages to which grants to units of <Col N="355" /> the Defence Forces may be subjected, ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For the moment I am concerned only with the first paragraph there.  The Minister says, in an endeavour to meet me in regard to the wide scope of the power, that he proposes to introduce an amendment to limit that power.  As I was pointing out in regard to deductions, the Minister has set them out in six headings.  He says the regulations under that sub-section will apply only to forfeiture of pay in the case of absence on desertion or without leave, to forfeiture in respect of custody, imprisonment or detention, to forfeiture on account of absence from duty through disease or disability arising out of the commission of any offence, or to unclaimed amounts; and that the deductions, taking them in the broad general way in which they are set out, will apply only to articles or services provided, to marriage allowances, to fines, penalties, damages, compensation or costs awarded, to public or service property lost, deficient, damaged or destroyed, to public or service debt or disallowance, and to unauthorised expenditure or commitment.</P>
    <P>In answer to the point that Deputy Collins makes, I say that that could not possibly meet my point of view. Every conceivable case of forfeiture or deduction is included in the ten subheads set out by the Minister in his amendment.  It includes every conceivable deduction or forfeiture that could, with any show of reason, be made.  Therefore, it is my view that the Minister's proposal, for an amendment to his own section, shows how wide in scope the particular section is. If those ten points are, in fact, the limitation of it, then the section has extraordinary width.  The one matter which affects the ordinary officer or soldier is the matter of his pay and allowances.  Those, naturally, are the most important things in his life.  The Minister says that I have adopted this idea because there are certain precedents for it, and one of the precedents he mentioned was the Canadian Defence Forces.  I think that if we were <Col N="356" /> to pay our soldiers in the same way as soldiers in the Canadian Army are paid, if we were to pay them the rates of pay that are paid in the Canadian Army&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates do not arise on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but what I am saying is that if we had to pay the rates of pay that are paid in the Canadian Army then, perhaps, our soldiers would have no objection to being dealt with in the same way in regard to forfeitures and deductions as the Canadian soldiers are dealt with.</P>
      <P>Now until this new Bill becomes law, and until this particular section that we are discussing is put into operation, every soldier and every officer has protection under the law of the country against any illegal or improper interference with his pay and allowances, but, when this Bill is passed and becomes an Act, that legal protection will be gone.  That is my ground of objection to the provisions in Section 97 of the Bill, that it does deprive officers and soldiers of legal protection in respect to their pay and allowances, and leaves it entirely to the Minister which, in effect, is the Department of Defence, to decide what forfeitures and what deductions may be made from the pay of an officer or a soldier.</P>
      <P>Every person who served in the Defence Forces since it was founded, and particularly those who served in the Defence Forces during the emergency, amounting to thousands of our citizens, are aware that there was continuous objection to the attempts made by the finance section of the Department of Defence to deprive them of pay and allowances under the authority of one sub-section of the old Act which gave the Minister power to oblige an officer or a soldier:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to make good any loss, damage or destruction to public property which, after due investigation, appears to the Minister to have been occasioned by any wrongful act or negligence on the part of the officer&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> That was the only aspect of an officer's or a soldier's pay that was left to the discretion of the Minister.  That section has been operated for a period of over 30 years in a way that has caused resentment amongst the officers and soldiers.  It has been a cause of discontent amongst the ranks of the Defence Forces.  If that section which, in itself, if properly interpreted could not cause much harm, was misused as it has been misused, what guarantee can any one of us have, what guarantee can any officer or soldier in the Army have, what guarantee can any citizen who understands the Army have, that the wider powers now taken by the Minister to interfere with pay and allowances will not be misused?</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to understand clearly that, as he stated himself in reply to my motion, this Bill is not entirely his Bill.  This Bill, in the main, was a Bill that was adopted by his predecessor and that was introduced in the Dáil by his predecessor.</P>

      <P>I further propose that the main portions of the old Section 126, and subsequent sections of the 1923 Act that deal with pay and allowances, should be inserted instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> The Minister said that I do not apparently want to have any provisions in the Bill in regard to forfeitures or deductions, but of course that is not so.  I made it perfectly clear in opening, and I understand from experience, that there must be provision for forfeiture of pay and for deductions.  Where the Minister and I differ is in relation to what is the proper lawful procedure in respect of these deductions.  I would not for one moment make the point that if a soldier or officer is absent on desertion or without leave, he should not forfeit a day's pay for every day of such absence, and certainly if an officer or soldier is in custody on a charge which results in a conviction by a civil court, I agree that it is proper that there should be a forfeiture for every day on which he is in that custody.  Similarly, if he is in custody on a charge resulting in a conviction by a court-martial, unless the court-martial otherwise direct, I think it right that he should forfeit pay for that period, so that the Minister is entirely wrong in the suggestion that I do not want forfeitures or deductions.  Similarly, if an officer or soldier by wilful act commits an offence against military law, and, in the commission of that offence, causes loss, damage, destruction or expense, it is right that he should be obliged to make good that expense, loss, damage or destruction.</P>
    <P>There is one provision in regard to deduction which I do not think is of any materiality&mdash;&ldquo;the sum required to make good the pay of an officer or soldier which he has unlawfully retained or refused to pay.&rdquo;  I do not think we need worry very much about that, but certainly if an officer is fined by a court-martial or by a civil court or by his superior officer after due trial, I believe it is right that the amount of that fine should be deducted from his pay, and I agree also that he should be obliged to make good any loss, damage or destruction of public property which has been occasioned by his wrongful act or negligence.</P>

      <P>While I agree that there should be a deduction in that respect, it is the one section in respect of which I was anxious that the power of the Minister to decide it should be taken away.  As Deputy Collins has said, it is the widening of that sub-section which has caused discontent right through the whole Defence Forces since the terms of that sub-section came to be applied.  Had the sub-section been interpreted correctly and strictly, with due regard to the rights of the officer and of the soldier, a considerable amount of the discontent and uneasiness that existed in the Army in regard to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At the moment the law is laid down clearly and the law at the moment says that you cannot suffer a deduction or forfeiture except in these specific instances and no Minister and no Department of Defence dare interfere with these rights given to the soldier by law.

The Minister will agree, I think, that in the Special Committee and again in this House I have gone to a considerable amount of trouble to assist the House to get what I consider to be a good Bill, and if I am to be criticised for doing the work that a Deputy ought to do I think it is most unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did make the point that I was entirely opposed to forfeitures and to deductions, and as you will see from amendment No. 52 I did, in that amendment, set out all the circumstances in which I thought it was reasonable that there should be a forfeiture or a deduction from pay.  In the eight sections that are covered and inserted in that amendment, I made provision in the first one for automatic forfeiture in respect of an officer; in the second, for automatic forfeiture in the case of a soldier; in the third, I set out my definition of what a day meant for the purposes of the application of these particular sections dealing with forfeitures&mdash;and on that I do not think that there is very much difference between the Minister and myself; I think that the Minister agrees that &ldquo;day,&rdquo; for the purposes of this forfeiture or deduction, is to continue as it has been; in the fourth sub-section, I made provision for the penal deductions that may be made from the pay due to an officer; and in the fifth for the penal deductions that may be made from the pay due to a soldier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt that I was approaching this problem in a reasonable way and in a constructive way, and I was hoping <Col N="365" /> that the Minister would see the reasonableness of meeting the case that I was making.  I cannot see any reason why the law that has protected officers' and soldiers' pay for a period of 30 years should now be done away with and that the Department of Defence should seek to take powers to enable them to do what they wished with the pay of officers and of soldiers.  I want to repeat, without being guilty of repetition to which the Chair could take exception, that, as far as the Army is concerned, if this new Bill with this section that the Minister proposes is passed, the officers and men will be in a worse position in relation to their pay and allowances than they are at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to repeat it without transgressing the rules of the House in relation to repetition. I want to bring it home to the Minister and that is why I am so adamant and so strong in my opposition to the proposed change.</P>
      <P>If eight sections of the old Act have worked well I can see no reason why we should drop those sections now and adopt one sub-section, consisting of 24 words, the effect of which will be to deprive this House of its control over forfeitures and deductions while handing over full power to the Minister to deal with these matters.  As Deputy S. Collins said by way of interjection it has been the misuse, the ministerpretation and the misapplication of one sub-section in the old Act which has caused all the concern, confusion and worry to officers and men over a long period.  It is now proposed not only to leave that power with the Minister but to give him wider and more extensive powers so that no one will know from day to day what deduction will be made from him or what forfeiture he will be liable to because the decision as to forfeiture or penal deduction will, in the last analysis, rest with the Minister and, as the routine has grown up, it will unfortunately rest not with the Minister but with his advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I instanced a typical case in the <Col N="366" /> course of my opposition to this amendment, a case which has become routine in the Defence Forces; some person in the Department decides that an officer or a soldier should contribute a certain sum of money to the State and that person writes to the officer or the soldier asking him to show cause why he should not be obliged to pay that sum to the State.  Will that be the interpretation of the new Act? Can the Minister assure the House that the faulty interpretation and the misunderstanding of the section that has grown up in the Department will not continue and apply to any other regulations that may be made in the future?</P>
    <P>Is it reasonable to ask the Minister if in the regulations he proposes to make under this section he will lay it down that in case of doubt he will be the authority who will resolve that doubt; and, if he is the authority who will resolve that doubt, will he put into the regulation that in case of doubt the decision will be in favour of the officer or soldier and not in favour of the Department?  It is one of the fundamental laws of this State that where there is a doubt the doubt must be resolved, if it is a criminal matter, in favour of the person against whom the proceedings are taken and, if it is a civil matter, on the basis of common sense and sound precedent.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have indicated to us the type of regulation he proposes and the provisions that he will include in such regulation to ensure of its interpretation strictly in accordance with the law and not in accordance with Civil Service interpretation.  He should provide, too, that where there is a doubt that doubt will be resolved in favour of the officer or soldier concerned.</P>
    <P>There are some matters that are not available to me at the moment for the purpose of examination of the statement made by the Minister yesterday in relation to British naval law and Canadian military law.  During the week-end I hope that I will be able to examine both the British naval code and the Canadian military code because I am anxious to discover the <Col N="367" /> precedents the Minister has mentioned and which his advisers have suggested to him it is wise and desirable we should adopt.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if I appear to be delaying the Minister in getting this measure through but I hoped that in a Bill of such consequence, affecting as it does so many people now and in the future, some regard would have been had to the views of those who have had practical experience and who understand the point of view of military personnel. If regard had been had to those views in the preparation of this Bill, it would perhaps have had a speedier passage through this House.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Local Government to introduce proposals for legislation to amend the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948, so as to secure (1) that servants of local authorities who did not apply for registration as established servants within the statutory period of six months be now permitted to apply with full credit for previous service; (2) that employees of local authorities who had been directed to work other than county council employment during the statutory three years' qualifying period be given full credit for periods spent at such work, e.g. farm work, minor relief schemes, Land Commission schemes, E.S.B. employment, drainage committees; (3) that the subscription of ½d. in the 1/- be abolished and a charge of 1/- per week substituted, and (4) that servants of local authorities, who have been registered as established servants but who for any reason have not been credited with previous service, be now given credit for such services.  &mdash;(Deputies Dunne and Kyne.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been struck by one peculiar aspect of the activities of <Col N="368" /> this Parliament and, pondering over the remarks the Minister made on this motion, that peculiar aspect of the activities of the Dáil was again borne in on my mind.  How is it that we seem to be able to pass through this House with great expedition legislation favourably affecting the incomes of certain grades in what might be described as the public service and that we inevitably have interminable delays in relation to legislation which may be designed to improve the living standards of large numbers of other public servants?</P>
      <P>I recall that quite recently we had placed before us a piece of legislation which provided for the improvement of the salaries of district justices and High Court judges and it went through this House in record time.  But, in regard to this question which is under consideration now and which affects many thousands of road workers, it is quite clear from what the Minister says that it will be a very considerable time before legislation is put through this House that will do anything for them.</P>
      <P>Is that a proper state of affairs?  Is that a correct interpretation of the glorious ideal laid down in the Proclamation of 1916, that all the children of the nation were to be cherished equally? We seem to be cherishing some of the children of the nation more favourably than we do others.  It is a wrong thing, and I think it should be condemned. We think that it is far more important that the pension rights of men who have worked with their hands for 20, 30 and 40 years for county councils should be secured and improved than that we should concern ourselves with the interests of a small group of people who are fairly well off at the moment in relation to the rest of the community.  That does not seem to be the principle on which the House operates, and it is a bad thing for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In concluding my comments on this motion of ours, I press the Minister to have this matter of the amendment of the Superannuation Act of 1948 put through with all energy and with all speed.  I was not a member of the House when <Col N="369" /> the Act was passed, but I recall, and it has been brought to my mind by other members of my Party who were in the House at the time, that the Act of 1948 was put through this House at a time when it was known that the Dáil was about to be dissolved in preparation for a general election.  It was put through this House without that consideration which it might have received if there was not the election tension at that time.  For that reason, I do not think that it represented the fully-considered views of the House when it finally became enacted.  That fact is reflected in the countless complaints which are being received by members of the House in regard to the operation of the Act, by trade union representatives of the workers concerned and by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one consequence which has flown from the Act as it stands.  I understand that in the City of Waterford there was a strike some two or three years ago.  It was not of very long duration, but the result of the strike has been that, under the terms of the present Act, a number of tradesmen who participated in the strike have lost their pension rights entirely and, before their pension rights can be restored, an amending Bill or a special Bill must be introduced and put through this House. I have no doubt that when proposals for such a Bill are formulated it will take a much longer time for that Bill to appear on the Order Paper and go through the House than it took to increase the salaries of district justices and High Court judges.</P>
    <P>I want to refer particularly to the undesirability of this archaic regulation. I think it is the relic of a period when strike action by workers was regarded by those in authority as something immoral, something that should not be countenanced in any circumstances, and that we should remove as far as we can from the regulations affecting workers in this country any suggestion that their right to cease work was held in question.  It is a fundamental right which has been admitted in every democratic country <Col N="370" /> in the world that workers should have the right to cease work if and when they feel they have a grievance which requires such action.  But in this Act we have a provision that should workers cease work they are penalised to the extent of loss of their pension rights.  That is something that most people in this House would strongly disagree with.  It is there and, from what the Minister said, it will be a considerable time before it is remedied.</P>
    <P>In counties where Part III of the present Act has been adopted it seems to be impossible for councillors or workers to determine just what registration means.  I have met county councillors who seemed to think that the creation of a register of established servants which is called for under the terms of the Act means that only servants with full employment for the entire 12 months would be eligible to have their names entered upon such a register.  On the other hand, we have cases of councils which are completely at a loss to know what to do in regard to the treatment of their established servants.  The Act, in my view, should be so amended as to ensure that there should be security of employment for those of the workers whose names are entered on the register.</P>
    <P>Obviously it is quite unreal to try to apply an expensive superannuation code such as this to casual workers who do not know from one year to another whether they will get six months', eight months' or nine months' employment.  It is unreasonable to expect that casual workers employed in certain counties on a purely seasonal basis in some instances, or at certain times of the year, should be expected to accept very considerable deductions from their wages as contributions towards a superannuation scheme under which they may never come to benefit.  A halfpenny in the shilling is a very substantial deduction in the wages of such workers when it is remembered their wages are so very low.</P>
    <P>One other anomaly which has been brought to my notice, and indeed it is a coincidence that this instance that I bring to the attention of the Minister <Col N="371" /> occurred in County Cavan.  There a roadworker with a substantial number of years' service&mdash;he was over 60 years of age&mdash;was retired by the county council.  Under the terms of the Act he qualified for allowances or pension under the provision of the 1925 Act. He was about a week or two on pension when he died.  His wife received no gratuity or pension because the 1925 Act does not provide that any gratuity be paid in respect of persons who are pensioned within its terms.  The Act of 1948 does provide that where a pensionable servant goes on pension directly under the terms of the 1948 Act, in the event of his death his wife becomes entitled to a gratuity equivalent to 12 months' pay.  But that will not come into operation for a very considerable time because it is obvious that some years must elapse before any road workers will be pensioned directly under the Act of 1948.</P>
    <P>Those of them who are at present going out on pension are going out on pension and receiving pensions by virtue of the Act of 1925 as provided for through the medium of the Act of 1948.  Such people are usually very old men&mdash;in fact I have come across a man of 80 who succeeded in concealing his age over a long period so that he would not be dismissed by the county council.  That particular activity is not unknown to Deputies in other areas, too.  In cases such as this when the man dies and leaves a widow, the widow is not entitled to the same benefit as other workers' widows would be entitled to in a few years' time, that is, a gratuity equal to one year's pay.  That is something that should be corrected and I hope will be corrected when the time comes.</P>
    <P>The only other aspect of the matter that I will refer to and that occurs to me at the present time&mdash;there are thousands of matters of detail that could be referred to but I do not think it would be right to take up the time of the House in discussing them here in such a fashion&mdash;is one which is important as it affects the operation of the Act permanently and one which I think can be dealt with by the Minister even without legislation.  That is the <Col N="372" /> very lengthy delay which occurs at the present time at the moment when a worker employed by a county council ceases to work and applies for a pension. We have had cases of workers having to wait&mdash;old men who have served out 40 years in some cases, more years than they can remember, literally&mdash;and some of them as far as I can see started to work with local authorities when local authorities were first founded in this country and have remained working since.</P>
    <P>I think it is most unfair to those men that when they do come to the age that they are retired, or voluntarily retire themselves, that they should have to wait six or eight months to get the few shillings coming to them by way of pension.  This is an administrative matter and varies in its treatment from one county to another.  It may be a comment on the relative efficiency of the staff of one county or another.</P>
    <P>We have had many complaints here and I would ask the Minister to issue a directive to all county councils or managements that particular attention should be paid to applications of such workers for pensions and that they should be expedited, facilitated and pushed through in every way.  It is not fair that these delays should occur and many of us have seen what has happened when a worker ceases work with a county council with which he has been employed for a long number of years.  It is generally found that he has not very many days of his life left so that we should try to make those few days he has in hand at least as happy as it is possible to make them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney mentioned the question of road workers who were dismissed before the Act came into operation in 1948.  We had the position in County Dublin in 1947&mdash;the year in which the Act was introduced and put through this Dáil&mdash;in which 40 or 50 men, not one of whom had less than 35 years' service and some of whom had almost 45 years' service&mdash;were callously dismissed by the acting-county commissioner who was in office at the time.  They were dismissed only a matter of months before the Act became law and was entered on the Statute Book.  Most of them are dead <Col N="373" /> now.  There is hardly a dozen of them left alive but in justice to them, because of their long service, I would urge the Minister to consider when he is examining this whole question making some provision for people of that classification who had long service and who, through no fault of their own and through no reason to which they contributed, were disemployed shortly before the introduction of this legislation. I suppose from the indications there are that we will not see this amending legislation for some considerable time and that that problem will solve itself because most of those men who served their councils well will most probably have passed away.  But it is an important principle that they should not be overlooked even if only one of them was left when the time comes to amend the Act.</P>
    <P>I want to say, finally, that it is a matter of complete dissatisfaction to us that we should have to wait so long when we have been promised that the amending legislation was under consideration by the Minister and officials of the Department.  Many Deputies have been assured by means of parliamentary questions that this Act was under examination for the purpose of amendment, and yet we are now told that no guarantee can be given as to when the amendments can be introduced. We have had five years' experience of the operation of this Act, and it is completely unsatisfactory.  Members of other local authorities have had the same experience.  It is a piece of mystery legislation on which the lawyers cannot get agreement among themselves on its interpretation, while it is evident that it inflicts hardship on road workers throughout the country.  Yet we are told that the Government can give no guarantee as to when it will be amended.  Contrast that with the fact that legislation which is, to my mind, of a relatively frivolous nature can be rushed through in a matter of minutes in order to improve the conditions of a small group of vested interests.  The road workers have to wait until the Dáil thinks fit in its own good time.  I think that is most unjust.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is really a very simple measure.  It sets out to do something with which I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House will agree.  At the moment there are thousands of parcels of land required for housing that have not been paid for and there are very many of these that will never be paid for.  This Bill is an effort to enable payment to be made for these plots, also for plots that were acquired in the past and for which payment has not yet been made.</P>
      <P>Money was lodged in court years and years ago in respect of parcels of land acquired for housing which was never passed on to the person from whom the land was acquired.  I am informed on reliable authority that some of that money was there so long that it was appropriated by the Government after a certain period.  I do not know whether the statute of limitations applies in this case but I know a number of cases in County Cork where land was acquired over 30 years ago, the money lodged in court and that money was never paid to the person from whom the land was taken. I doubt if there is a record in the offices of the local authority about that money.  At any rate, I am informed on reliable authority that some of that money was appropriated by the Government after a certain period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a system in this country whereby we make compulsory purchase orders.  A local authority may make a compulsory purchase order which gives it full and complete title to the land which they take from the land owner. There is no obligation on the local authority to find out who has the proper title of that land before making the compulsory purchase order.  You can have a person who is a holder of the land, who is liable for rates and who can get his rate demand, his six days' notice, his civil bill as an owner or occupier of a certain holding but that is not good enough for the local <Col N="375" /> authority when they want to pay for land they compulsorily acquire.</P>
    <P>You have land held by vested tenants and the Land Commission and it is quite all right for the Land Commission to have a registered owner of that land registered in the Land Commission.  It is quite all right for the Land Commission to serve six day notices on the occupier of that land for the annuities.  It is quite all right for the Land Commission to demand and receive their annuities on that land because the person is the registered occupier in the Land Commission's register.  But when it comes to the question of paying for land compulsorily acquired by a local authority none of these things seems to apply.  The local authority does not even have to serve the notice on the owner.</P>
    <P>The local authority makes a compulsory purchase order and enters into a field and it does not matter what is in the field.  I know of cases where the county council entered a field in which beet was growing and pulled up the beet and started their building scheme. The person has not been paid for that plot yet.  It creates great difficulty for members of local authorities when they are going round trying to get further housing schemes.</P>
    <P>We go to a certain man.  Let us call him Pat Murphy, and we ask Pat Murphy for a site for six houses, a site for a cottage or an acre of ground for a labourer's cottage.  The first thing Pat Murphy will say is: &ldquo;What about the plot of land you took from me in 1948?&rdquo;  or &ldquo;What about the plot of land you took from me in 1923?  I have not been paid for that yet.  The land was taken from me when you came to me in 1948 or 1923.  I was as accommodating as I could possibly be.  I gave you the acre of my farm because I believed in housing the people.  I believed that if they asked only half an acre or an acre of land they would want the best ground they could get.  I accommodated you in every way possible but I have not been paid for that and now you are here to-day, again asking me for another acre or two for a housing scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> This whole system is impeding the housing schemes that local authorities want to develop.  I believe that if the principle set out in this Bill is accepted by the Government and the House&mdash;I am sure that all Deputies will agree with it&mdash;it will make it easier to find housing sites and eventually to house the people of the country who require houses and whom the local authority wish to house as quickly and as well as they possibly can.</P>
    <P>The first section of this Bill seeks to extend a value that was laid down in 1906.  In the 1906 Labourers Act it was provided that payment for cottage plots could be made without the discharge of equities provided the sum did not exceed £60.  In the second section of this Bill I seek to increase that.  I mentioned the figure of £500, but if £500 is too high a figure in the opinion of the House I am quite prepared to alter it.  There is no doubt that if £60 was a fair and reasonable figure to pay for the land for housing in 1906, the value of the £ has changed since and there should be some change in the amount set out in the Act of 1906.  Last December I asked the Taoiseach to give the relative values of the £ sterling in 1906 and in 1953 and the following is the Taoiseach's answer:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No official series of price index numbers are available on the basis of which it would be possible to compare the present purchasing power of the £ in this country with its purchasing power in 1906.  However, using various sets of unofficial index numbers of retail, wholesale and agricultural prices, it is estimated roughly that £1 at present would purchase the same quantum of goods as 5/- in 1906.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the £ would purchase 5/- worth of goods now as against 1906, I think there is a reasonable case to be made for increasing that figure to some extent, possibly not to £500 but probably to £250.</P>
    <P>The other section asks that the registered holder of land should be entitled to payment.  The registered holder is liable for rates and for annuities and he is liable to be sued if <Col N="377" /> he defaults in any of these payments. I believe that in case of doubt and where there is a danger that a person may not be paid at all the registered owner should be paid where there is not another feasible means of ascertaining the owner or where it is not possible to discharge equities easily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to find this out for my own information.  I could be registered as a person to whom a receivable order might be sent on the understanding that I was paying rent on a holding.  I could be registered in that sense but that would not mean being registered in the sense in which a registered owner is generally accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean the person who is registered in the generally accepted sense.  There are a number of cases I have come across where it is very difficult to discharge equities.  There is a tradition in certain areas where the land is passed on from one to the other and the eldest son gets it.  If there is no intention of selling the holding or part of it and somebody comes along and pays £61 to put a cottage plot on it, equities have to be discharged on that holding and that is a problem that has to be solved.  Perhaps there is a large family of six or seven who have scattered&mdash;there is a nun in Australia, somebody has emigrated to America, there is somebody married in Dublin and it is absolutely impossible to fulfil the legal requirements that are necessary <Col N="378" /> to discharge equity on that type of holding.</P>
      <P>I had hoped to be able to give the House a great deal of detailed information in this connection which I know exists, but unfortunately I found it very difficult to get information.  I applied to county councils for information and I was told that county council officials can supply information only to chairmen of councils, to the Minister and to the council itself if arranged at a meeting, and further that it is open to a ratepayer in a particular county to go into the county council office, see the books and extract whatever information he can in that regard.  In these circumstances, I am sorry I have not all the detailed information that I would like to present to the House in an official form but I know that in County Cork there are a number of housing sites some of which were acquired over 30 years ago for which payment has not been made yet.</P>
      <P>I am perfectly satisfied in my own mind that even the county council office has no record of these transactions because at that time they were done under various boards that had their own individual solicitors.  I am not surprised that county councils cannot give the information that I want because I do not believe they have it themselves.  However, I am sure the Minister could probably get it from the records of the court.  He would find at least the cases in which the money was lodged in court.</P>
      <P>I have some little information here which I was able to extract and which may give a small picture of what is happening.  In the southern portion of County Cork, which is only a small part of that county, a compulsory purchase order was made in 1948 involving 505 parcels of land, and at the beginning of this year 143, that is, a third of those sites had not been paid for. There were 166 paid for in 1952; there were 143 paid for in 1953, and there are still outstanding 143 from the 1948 compulsory order.  That applies to one small section of County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the West Cork district there were 45 sites acquired under the 1948 order, and of those 17 had been paid for, <Col N="379" /> and under the 1951 order in the West Cork area four sites had been paid for. In the North Cork area, there were 33 sites acquired in 1949 of which 21 were paid for, leaving 12 outstanding.  Under the 1950 (No. 1) order for North Cork there were 198 sites acquired of which 98 have not yet been paid for; under the 1950 (No. 2) order for North Cork there are 20 sites out of 39 not yet paid for.</P>
    <P>As long as this position remains, it is going to be very difficult for local authorities to acquire sites.  I believe that a number of Deputies in other counties are experiencing similar difficulties. The attitude of the Minister would appear to be that it is the responsibility of the local county solicitor. The Minister mentioned that in Volume 143, column 178 of the Official Debates of the 17th November last.  He said: &ldquo;That is the law agent's job.  If he is satisfied you can pay any time you like.&rdquo;  But the law agent is tied up by certain Acts of this House.  If the sum is over £60, he cannot pay without the discharge of equities, so the Minister is not quite right in that point of view.  I am satisfied that a number of Deputies hold the same view as I do.</P>
    <P>I will now quote from the Official Report, column 177, Volume 143, No. 1, where Deputy Corry is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is one matter which I am wondering whether the Minister can find some way of rectifying and that is in regard to the payment of farmers for sites taken by local authorities for non-municipal houses or cottages.  I can assure the Minister that sites acquired and built on as far back as 1948 are still unpaid for in the South Cork area of the Cork County Council.</P>
    <P>Mr. Smith: That is the law agent's job.  If he is satisfied you can pay any time you like.</P>
    <P>Mr. Corry: I cannot see any sane reason, if a farmer is a recognised tenant, having his rent accepted by the Land Commission and his rates accepted by the local authority, why he cannot be paid for the acre of <Col N="380" /> land that is compulsorily taken from him by the same local authority.</P>
    <P>Mr. Smith: Surely that does not prove title?</P>
    <P>Mr. Corry: Surely, if he is a registered holder of that land, that proves his title?</P>
    <P>Mr. Smith: That is another matter.</P>
    <P>Mr. Corry: We have had these cases dragging on for six years. Actually, we have had them dragging on over 30 years, and ordinary elected representatives have been placed in the position that for the third time they have had to call on some of these farmers to get more land from them for cottages, and I propose that in future when we are going around taking such land we shall be accompanied by the legal adviser...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry was apparently taking a leaf out of the Minister's book.  The whole position is quite unsatisfactory and it amounts to sheer confiscation of property.  The local authority know in many cases when they are acquiring land that the owners cannot get paid for it and that it is pure confiscation. In many cases the land that has been acquired was productively worked before it was acquired and in some cases after being acquired it has not been productively worked and it has been a loss to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>In addition to the views expressed by Deputy Corry, I think the Minister will remember that when he was in Cork comparatively recently all Parties on the county council pointed out this problem and the various grievances that they were suffering from.  I quite agree that this Bill which I have drafted may not be a masterpiece but the only thing that gave me courage to produce it at all was the number of Acts which I have seen coming out of the draftsman's office that were not masterpieces either.  I am sure every side of the House will agree that it is necessary that something should be done to get rid of some of the grievances that exist at the moment in the case of people from whom land has <Col N="381" /> been confiscated.  I want to make it quite clear that I do not agree with the Minister that the fault lies with the county solicitor in Cork or in any other county.  As a matter of fact, I think that if there is fault lying anywhere it lies with the client's solicitor rather than with the county solicitor.</P>
    <P>I understand that this Bill has been submitted to the Incorporated Law Society, some gentlemen of which society were not very complimentary about it.  I think that if that society put their own house in order and got their members who had had a case presented to them, and who were supposed to be acting for a client, to return the documents that were sent to them by the county solicitor, it would be very much to the point.  In the South Cork area, in which I am particularly interested, documents were sent to solicitors by the county solicitor and in 35 cases these documents were not returned.  If the Incorporated Law Society would look into that matter I think they would be doing useful work.</P>
    <P>It is important that people from whom we take land should be compensated. If a local authority find and know that in taking land from a man or a woman they will never be able to pay for it then I think they should give grave consideration to the whole question.  I realise that the money may be lodged in court but that it may lie there for a certain period and then be appropriated at some future date. I think the local authority, in such circumstances, should be prevented from taking that land.</P>
    <P>In my view, it should be made as easy as possible for the local authority to pay the owner, after trying as well as they can to find out who is the right owner.  There should not be the necessity to discharge equities now on the basis of £60, as is laid down in the Act of 1906.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment Deputy Lehane on his efforts to remedy certain injustices.  I am in a difficulty as far as the Bill itself is concerned inasmuch as I am not in agreement with the Bill as a whole.  I fully support Deputy Lehane in his desire to amend Section 11 of the 1906 <Col N="382" /> Labourers Act which relates to payment for land acquired where the amount of money involved is over £60, I think that is something that should appeal to the Minister himself as a perfectly fair request.  If we take into consideration the value of the £ in 1906 and the depreciation that has taken place since, I think there is a very strong case to extend and enlarge the figure from £60.  I do not suggest or agree that it should be brought up to £500.  My own view is that if the Minister were willing to meet Deputy Lehane on a sum of £250 it would be very reasonable.  That is the section of this Bill with which I am in complete agreement.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say too much but I cannot agree fully with Deputy Lehane that the delays he has outlined as having taken place in County Cork apply to my own county.  However, rather than say too much on this particular matter, and perhaps throw cold water on the efforts made by my colleague, I will simply confine my remarks to the amendment of the section dealing with the sum of £60 to whatever figure the Minister and his advisers think suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no idea as to the extent of this problem in the country, but I do know that it is to some extent a problem.  I do not know that it is as large as Deputy Lehane seems to believe.  For many years it has been the practice of local bodies, when the need to acquire land for purposes such as housing arose, to endeavour to secure that land voluntarily because thereby they avoided all the legal difficulties and delays that arise as a result of endeavouring to acquire land by compulsory means.  As far as my experience on a local body goes, it was only when they found it impossible to get the amount of land they required or the type of site they needed that they resorted to compulsory purchase.  My experience has been that if a local authority found that the title was not clear to a suitable site that they intended to acquire by compulsion, with the result that the moneys would have to be lodged in court, they usually went about acquiring a reasonably suitable alternative, if that was convenient.  If <Col N="383" /> no such alternative was available, they had to ignore the fact that title could not be shown and proceeded to acquire the site, which to my mind was an entirely justifiable procedure.  There are many cases where title cannot be shown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases where there was voluntary agreement about a site, a compulsory purchase order was made and even in cases where there was voluntary agreement about the site payment was not made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Compulsory purchase orders might have to be made in order to meet the difficulty caused by the failure of the person concerned to show title.  Does not this question of showing title arise in thousands of ways, not only in regard to the acquisition of land for local authority purposes but in every conceivable way?  Whether it is a question of the payment for land acquired by a local authority or a question of the receipt of moneys by an individual, the person to whom the money is being paid has to show that he is the person legally entitled to it and, unless he can show that, the party that is due to make the payment will not make the payment but will proceed to lodge the amount of money until such time as the claimant can show title to it.</P>
      <P>I remember the question to which Deputy Lehane has referred and I can recall the reply to the supplementary question by Deputy Corry.  The gist of my reply to that supplementary question was that it was the responsibility of the legal adviser to the county council to keep his employers, the county council, safe and it was not a matter of my blaming the legal adviser; it was not a matter of my trying to blame the legal people acting for the landowner. I was merely saying that in all these matters the responsibility for giving advice and interpreting rests with the legal adviser of the local body.  I am sure it was in that sense that I made the reply to the supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Deputy an important question as to what he meant by the <Col N="384" />&ldquo;registered owner of land.&rdquo;  We are not able to make sense out of the use of that expression because, if a person is the registered owner of land, the land can be disposed of by the local body and can be paid for.  If he is registered in the sense of merely being the person to whom the receivable order is issued or the demand is made for the payment of rent, that is an entirely different matter and that individual has no legal status whatever. It was because of our confusion as to what exactly was meant by the use of the term &ldquo;registered owner&rdquo; that I asked a couple of questions.</P>
    <P>With some aspects of the proposals contained in the measure we are not in disagreement.  The point made by Deputy McQuillan in giving his limited support to these proposals is quite understandable.  On the advice of my officials I was going to suggest that there is a Housing Bill on the stocks, which will be introduced in the course of a month or two and, if this Bill was withdrawn, I would give the assurance that all the matters referred to here would be examined and we would try in the Housing Bill to meet at least some of what is contained in this proposal and maybe go somewhat further and examine a wider field than is actually covered here, to see if we can tighten or tidy up the law in that regard.  If the Deputy is satisfied with that, I will give him the assurance that we will undertake that work before the Housing Bill is introduced and try to provide in it what will go some distance at any rate to meet the point of view to which the Deputy has given expression.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">

      <P>I am quite aware that this Bill is by no means perfect.  To do what I want to do would necessitate five or six different Bills going back to the Act of 1845.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in accepting the Bill.  Having regard to the Minister's assurance that he will examine these matters fully and probably include in the Housing Bill, which he says is due in a month's time, some sections to cover points that I have in mind, I withdraw the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in view of public uneasiness caused by the sale of An Bord Fáilte property at Tramore by private treaty to three private individuals at a much lower figure than possibly might have been obtained if an opportunity had been given to the public to bid at a public auction or by tender, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that a Select Committee of the House should be set up to investigate all the facts of the sale and to report back to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>This motion was tabled with a view to having a full discussion in this House, so that Deputies would have an opportunity of saying whether or not they believed that the facts they heard during the discussion would justify their setting up such a committee. The motion was put down by me not from any narrow Party political point of view; it was put down by me as a public representative of a constituency at the request of a local authority in that constituency. That request was conveyed to me and to the other Deputies of the constituency of Waterford by the unanimous wish of the town commissioners of Tramore.  The members of that body hold different shades of political opinion.  As far as I know there was no Party politics motivating the commissioners but a sincere desire that the full facts of the sale of certain properties at Tramore should be investigated and that the whole country should have an opportunity of judging whether or not the sale, including the manner in which it was carried out, was justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it is just as essential for him as it is for the people of Tramore or anywhere else that all the facts of this case should be made public, that this committee should be set up.  They should have power to examine every detail, every transaction, every letter in connection with the sale and they should publish, for the whole country to see, their considered opinion&mdash;whether it be that the sale was properly constituted, that it <Col N="386" /> was an advisable act, and that it was done in the public interest, or whether they find contrary to that.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to suggest that there is any bribery or political corruption in this sale.  I am suggesting that it was an ill-considered move, that the Minister was induced to do something that should not have been done, and that it is in the public interest that when such a thing happens an investigation should follow, so that, even if no remedy for the particular act follows from the investigation, it will for the future act as a deterrent to similar actions taking place.  The Minister and his office should, I suggest, be like Caesar's wife, above suspicion.  I do not wish to attribute to him any question of suspicion in this case, but I suggest to this House that the facts are such that an investigation is desirable and that some conclusions should be come to by the committee and should be published, to assure the people of the country once and for all that public funds and public property held by the Government for the people of the country will be administered and will be used to the advantage of the people as a whole, with no particular private gain to any individual or any group of individuals.</P>
    <P>I ask the Deputies who are interested to listen to this, irrespective of what political views they hold, as just an ordinary business transaction, and to say to themselves: &ldquo;If that happened in my ordinary private life, what would be my view of it?&rdquo;  and to vote, not according to the Party to which they belong, but according to conscience on the matter.  I would appeal in particular to my colleagues in Waterford constituency to take part in this debate, to express their views, and to appeal to this House for support for this motion so that, once and for all, the matter can be finished with.</P>
    <P>I will give in very brief detail an outline of the facts as I know them. Property was held at Tramore estimated at a value of £84,550 by An Bord Fáilte.  A decision had been come to by the previous Government that it was desirable that properties held by the Tourist Board should be <Col N="387" /> disposed of.  That Government, acting on that decision, did dispose of a considerable amount of property throughout the length and breadth of this country but this particular property of Tramore had not been disposed of at the time when the inter-Party Government went out of office.  The present Minister on taking up his position indicated that while he did not agree with that decision because of the fact that so much of the property had been disposed of it would not be desirable to alter it and that he intended to continue that policy.  The property at Tramore was finally sold. It is on the question of how it was sold that the motion is down.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there are three questions which Deputies should put to themselves: (1) Was the sale carried out in the normal way; (2) were there any circumstances, if the sale was not carried out in the normal way, to justify any change in the method of procedure of selling and (3) was the best possible price got for the property and were the interests to whom the property was sold the best interests in the long run when viewed from the point of view of tourism.  I think that is a very ordinary and very simple series of questions for anyone to put to himself and give a decision on.</P>
    <P>On No. 1, as to whether the sale was carried out in the normal way, I would say this&mdash;and I suggest I cannot be contradicted&mdash;that this was the only property sold by the board that was sold without having been first offered for sale by public auction.  I am well aware that on two occasions property held by An Bord Fáilte was sold by private treaty, having first been offered by public auction at which the bids made did not apparently reach the reserve fixed by the board.  The property was then withdrawn and later, as a result of private negotiations, the sale took place.  I suggest that in every other case in which property held by the board was sold an opportunity was given to those interested to bid for it in the public market up to whatever figure they thought represented its value.</P>
    <P>The Minister, replying to a series of <Col N="388" /> questions put to him by various Deputies, and particularly Deputy Flanagan, in February, 1953, indicated that his general view was, prior to the sale, that it should be a sale by public auction.  I can quote from the reports statements made by the Minister in this House that that was his belief at that time.  I can also quote from the <i>Waterford Star</i> of January, 1953, which published the report of a meeting of the town commissioners dealing with the sale of this property.  At that meeting, letters were read from An Bord Fáilte indicating to the town commissioners that they could be assured that the sale would be by public auction.  In the same paper there appears a report made by members to the town commissioners, who are not politically opposed to the Minister, to the effect that at a public meeting in the town of Tramore he had made statements assuring the people of Tramore that if there was a sale the public would have an opportunity of bidding.  I think all that establishes that there was the direct intention up to a certain point to have the sale by public auction.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the owners of certain property, which was taken over by the Tramore Development Company, were assured that if ever this property was to go back into private hands, they would be given the opportunity of redeeming it at a value roughly corresponding to the compensations which they had been paid for it, or at least that they would be given the opportunity of bidding for it in the public market.</P>
    <P>I now propose to give some of the facts in regard to this case.  This property was sold to three private individuals by private treaty, negotiated between An Bord Fáilte and themselves, for a sum of £22,500, roughly one quarter of the estimated value of the property.  The estimate that I gave of £84,550 was not made by me but was given in this House by the present Minister.  Therefore, we find that, at one quarter of its estimated value, this public property held in trust by An Bord Fáilte for the people of Ireland was disposed of to three private individuals.  It was not <Col N="389" /> until the sale had been completed that the people of Tramore and other people interested knew of what had happened.  They had been assured that their property would be sold by public auction.  They had indicated that they were interested in it and were awaiting the public auction, and then learned one morning from a public announcement that the property which they desired to purchase in the interests of the people of Tramore had been purchased not by a company but by three private individuals at a price representing one quarter of its estimated value.</P>
    <P>This property consisted of land and of buildings.  One portion of the buildings was what was formerly a summer camp or a summer house for St. Joseph's Boys' Club.  This was a charitable organisation formed by certain people in Waterford City, the object being to send young boys, who could not afford to take a vacation themselves, to the seaside for a period each year. That was a laudable object.  Therefore, Deputies will agree that the building was being used for a laudable purpose.  It was acquired in the public interest by the Tramore Development Company for a sum of money, by way of compensation to the trustees of the society who owned it.  They were assured that if ever it was to revert back to private ownership they would have an opportunity of purchasing it to continue the work in which they had been engaged.  That organisation was willing and interested in making a bid to secure its former property as, I say, it was anxious to continue the work in which it had been engaged prior to its purchase by the Tramore Development Company.  There was an urgent need for the continuation of that work, and I understand from certain members of the society that they had so indicated to An Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>There was a garage owner in Tramore carrying on a substantial business whose property was acquired.  He informed me that he also had been assured that, should the occasion arise, he would be given an opportunity of bidding for it.  Not only were the members of the St. Joseph's Boys' Club and the garage owner deprived of their <Col N="390" /> right of again securing the property which they formerly held, but the Waterford County Council acting, as they believed, in the public interest through the commissioner appointed to act for the council, gave to the Waterford Development Company two acres three roods and 38 perches of land which they owned.  They did so, believing that it was in the interests of tourism that the land should be surrendered to the company that had been established in Tramore.</P>
    <P>That was in consideration of a sum of £170, a nominal sum.  The members of the Waterford County Council surrendered their rights, but they wished, should the property ever revert to any private interests, that they should have an opportunity of taking over the land which they had given.  It is a fact that since this land was sold to three private individuals the Waterford County Council, on behalf of the Tramore Town Commissioners, made application for a portion of the property to be used as a parking-place for the cars of tourists visiting the town, and the conditions under which they were given the property by the present owners were such that a sum of £870 for a stretch of land roughly 30 yards long by 30 feet deep had to be expended by the council so that the town commissioners in Tramore could carry out work essential to tourism.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that one of the reasons which induced him to change his mind about consenting to the sale of this property by private treaty was that the people who were thinking of purchasing the property were so well known to be interested in tourism that it was desirable that they should secure it rather than that the risk should be taken of some outside body securing it at public auction for personal gain.  I do not wish under the shelter and the privilege of the House to make any claims against the interests of the three individuals who purchased the property so far as their wish to develop and foster tourism in Tramore is concerned.  From my knowledge of them&mdash;some of them I know personally&mdash;they are quite respectable and responsible people but <Col N="391" /> I suggest that they are three private individuals and that the purchase was motivated by the fact that here was value for their money and here was a likely return in the form of yearly dividends.  I cast no blame on them for taking that view.  It is a natural everyday thing for people to look at a proposition in that way but I suggest that when the Minister states that he selected these because they and they alone were the people so interested he is guilty of a misstatement of fact.</P>
    <P>It must be well known to the board and to the Minister that, prior to the sale, the town commissioners of Tramore, either as a body as town commissioners or as individuals, were prepared to bid for this property.  That body comprised of men of standing, of money and of responsibility, were prepared to join together and form a company to purchase this property and use it in the interests of tourism and of the people of Tramore without any personal gain.  I can give the names of distinguished people, of people who carry on extensive business in the City of Waterford and the area around Tramore who are members of the town commissioners and who have assured me that they were prepared&mdash;if they could not do it as town commissioners to do it as private individuals&mdash;to put up their own money in the interests of tourism.  I suggest that they were deprived of the right to do that by what happened.  I suggest that all the circumstances should be examined to see whether blame can be apportioned for what happened, so that in the public interest never again will such a thing give rise to the justifiable suspicion that something underhand or careless has taken place.</P>
    <P>Two significant facts have taken place since the property was sold which do not indicate any particular desire on the part of the three people who now own the property to encourage tourism in Tramore.  Almost immediately on the property going into the possession of these three private individuals the Irish Countrywomen's Association which had rented from An Bord Fáilte a large plot of ground, <Col N="392" /> were notified that they were required by the new owners to give immediate possession of that property.  In that ground&mdash;roughly an acre or an acre and a half&mdash;I understand the Irish Countrywomen's Association had planted thousands of bulbs which would be in flower around the Tóstal period, but the Irish Countrywomen's Association were compelled to root up these bulbs and to leave the property free for the new owners.  Does that indicate any particular interest in seeing that Tramore was made beautiful, developed and made interesting for visitors?  I suggest that that act can only be construed as indicating a desire quite contrary to any desire to encourage tourism.</P>
    <P>I am also told that buildings in this new property are now being used against the interests of hoteliers in Tramore in relation to catering for wedding breakfasts and various other functions which would normally be a source of income to the people who own property and pay rates in Tramore.  There is not, I suggest, one single thing done by the new owners that can indicate any justification for the confidence reposed in them by An Bord Fáilte and the Minister in giving them the property as custodians of the interests of tourism in County Waterford. I would feel that this House would be doing a sensible act by appointing 15 members drawn from all sides and saying to them: &ldquo;There is something to be investigated.  We suggest to you that you act for us, you sift through the various pieces of correspondence, you inquire into all the facts, and that you come to a decision which will be sent back to us here so that not only are the facts known and made public but all question of suspicion shall be cleared from the Minister and from the board and that the people of this country can be assured that any property held in trust by his Department for the nation will be administered and sold if necessary in the very same manner as it would be had it been his personal property.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and welcome this opportunity.  I feel that the House in general should welcome an opportunity of this kind <Col N="393" /> when there is a matter of such vital importance and such a great principle involved as we have to discuss on this motion tabled by Deputy Kyne.  I consider that if we had an indication from the Minister as to whether he was prepared to accept the motion which has been so ably moved by Deputy Kyne probably most of the comments that could be made in this House on this matter could be best made and have more effect before the Select Committee of the House which would be appointed to investigate it should the Minister decide to accept this motion.</P>
      <P>This is really a matter in which the House should very seriously give thought to the appointment of the committee suggested by Deputy Kyne because there are two very important matters at stake.  Number 1, a Minister of State is looked upon as a man of responsibility, a man of honesty, a man of trust, a man with a word, and here we have the case in which the Tánaiste, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, gave his word to the Tramore Town Commissioners on the occasion of his visit to Waterford to open a glass factory and on his behalf the Department of Industry and Commerce gave their word to certain interests in Tramore that this property, if it was to be disposed of, would be disposed of by public auction.</P>
      <P>If the people of the country are to respect, look up to and have confidence in the Ministers in charge of the various Departments of State, the least they can expect from such people in such responsible places is that they will have some word rather than to see the Press of the country being placed in the position of using the thickest and biggest possible print to publish in their headlines: &ldquo;Breach of faith by Minister.&rdquo;  I think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as far as the property in Tramore is concerned, not alone gave false information but was misleading, and it should be the duty of the Select Committee of this House to investigate the motives which were behind the misleading information given to the people of Waterford as far as this property is concerned.  That is Number 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> Number 2, there is and should be great interest taken in the principle that when it is decided that State property-either produced by the State, erected from State funds or vested in the State-should change hands it should be placed on the open market and on the public market.  In the past, and even during the time of the inter-Party Government, there were forms of State property being sold which were placed on the open market and on the public market.  I would like to know why there was a departure in this case from placing this property on the public market.  Was it because of the tremendous influence that was behind the three respected and, I admit, highly respected citizens of Waterford?  Was it because of the extraordinary influence they had that arrangements were made to keep this property from public auction?  One seems to find the whole position unreal when we see the hydro alone, which cost £67,000 to erect, being sold with other property for the sum of £22,500.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the Department of Industry and Commerce, despite the many requests and protests that have come from Tramore, have evaded in every possible way both the giving of information and the holding of an inquiry in order to clear up what I describe as a dishonest mess with a very strange and a very strong and suspicious odour.  I think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be right, in order to clear the air and to satisfy the public uneasiness that does prevail not alone in the town of Tramore but in every part of this country where the taxpayers were asked to contribute their share, however small it may be, towards the reclamation of land in the first instance by the Construction Corps from 1939 onwards until the land was reclaimed, to consider the grave inconvenience that was caused in one case to the garage owner referred to by Deputy Kyne and to amusements caterers and others who were removed from this particular site by the Irish Tourist Board during those years and were given an undertaking that if the property was ever being sold or disposed of they, as the original people who carried on business on this site, <Col N="395" /> would be given first preference and an opportunity of putting a bid on these lands.</P>
    <P>Is it not an extraordinary state of affairs that both the garage owner, the amusement caterers and shopkeepers concerned viewed with alarm, horror, amazement and disgust the concealed and suspicious manner in which this property was afterwards handed over to three of the wealthiest men in Waterford with the support of an outstanding wealthy racehorse owner from South Tipperary very well known to the Minister?  I think that as the Labour Deputy for Waterford has put forward this, it is a matter which should be investigated, and that this House is failing in its duty, and we are failing in our duty to the taxpayers, if we do not do what we can to see that a complaint or an injustice, or something concealed behind a disgraceful transaction of this kind, will be ventilated and that the committee which this motion suggests will have power to send for papers, persons and records so that this disgraceful transaction may be fully and properly investigated.</P>
    <P>The Tramore Town Commissioners are a body of enthusiastic people elected by the people of Tramore to administer the affairs of the town. They are nine trustworthy citizens, the most trustworthy of them being the chairman, Mr. Eric Power, one of the staunchest possible supporters of the present Minister.  As chairman of the town commissioners he headed the deputation which interviewed the Minister in connection with this matter.  Subsequently, speaking at a meeting of the town commissioners held in the evening of the day on which the Minister received the deputation, Mr. Power stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The decision to dispose of the property by private treaty had apparently been made in May, although Mr. Lemass at a by-election meeting in Tramore in June stated that the sale would be by public auction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am quoting from the report which appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on the <Col N="396" /> date on which the Minister received the deputation.</P>
    <P>Surely that must seem almost incredible to decent-minded people.  It is not incredible to those of us who know the mean low tactics to which the Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce resort on the eve of by-elections.  We have had the case in which a biscuit factory was promised prior to a by-election in one constituency.  In Waterford it was not a biscuit factory, or an airfield, or an extension of a cement factory; it was that the public property of the Tourist Board in Tramore would be sold by public auction.  The Minister stated that in June but in May he had full knowledge of the fact that the property would be sold privately to these three individuals, and the chairman of the town commissioners stated publicly at meetings in Tramore and throughout County Waterford that he had been deceived and misled and that he failed to understand how any honest and responsible Minister could deliberately mislead the chairman of a public authority and, even more so, a political colleague and a political supporter.</P>
    <P>The giving of misleading information for the purpose of soliciting support from Tramore in the by-election is something we must view with horror and disgust.  Such conduct falls far short of what we expect from Parliament and from a Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is well known locally that if this property had been put up for public auction it would have reached a higher sum than £22,500. Correspondence passed between the Minister and the Tramore Town Commissioners on that aspect of the matter. The town clerk communicated with the Department and the Department replied asking the town commissioners to give details of the property for which they were prepared to make a bid.  That information was supplied. The town clerk also asked the Minister to hold up the sale of the property until such time as due notice would be given of its sale by public auction.</P>
    <P>This whole transaction was hedged round with secrecy.  I asked several questions in relation to this matter last February and it is abundantly <Col N="397" /> clear that every possible opportunity was availed of by the Minister to sidestep the main issue.  The Minister appeared to believe that if the property was put up for public auction they would not have got a better bid than the £22,500, but it has been proved that a higher bid than £22,500 would have been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>When one hears the Government wailing about expenditure one is inclined to ask oneself if the Government is really sincere?  The Government spent £85,000 of the taxpayers' money and subsequently deprived local interests of property to which they were entitled for the conduct of their business in this seaside resort.</P>
    <P>On 4th February, 1953, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in reply to a question tabled by me, said:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am advised by An Bord Fáilte that the costs of acquisition and development of the properties at Tramore cannot be segregated in the form sought in one of the questions. The cost of erecting and equipping the hydro was £35,535.  The cost of the pitch-and-putt course was £1,000 and the cost of the boys' club (lands and buildings) was £2,700.  I am informed by An Bord Fáilte that separate figures cannot be provided for the cost of developing the site prior to the erection of the hydro or for the cost of the casion.  The total net expenditure on acquisition and development of all the properties, after making allowance for revenues received, was £84,550.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand that if this property had been sold by public auction it could have reached a figure of £50,000 or £55,000.  Considering that that sum could have been procured from interested parties there must be some very strange motives behind the secrecy which surrounded the sale privately of this property.  These influential gentlemen who purchased the property did so for the purpose of swelling their own purses.  With respect to the three gentlemen who did purchase it, they purchased it as businessmen. It cannot be disputed that they are very keen businessmen, and it was not in the interests of Tramore and its <Col N="398" /> development that they purchased this property; it was for the purpose, as I say, of swelling their own purses and they have achieved that purpose with the able help and the fullest possible co-operation and assistance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It is only now that the local business people, the hotel proprietors, the amusements caterers and the local people generally realise that this property was purchased for the benefit of those who bought it and not in the interests of the development of the tourist industry.  I hope the Minister will not stand over such a transaction as that.  Even if he has got himself into a very serious mess as a result of this disgraceful transaction, it is not too late to tell the chairman, the town commissioners and the people that he is sorry he misled them and that the transaction has served its purpose in the return of Deputy Kenneally to this House in the by-election because of the promise he made; that he misled the people and that as far as the property was concerned he was prepared in Waterford to sacrifice £85,000 worth of property for £22,000 in order to satisfy the influence which was brought upon him by those three individuals who purchased this property.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann should certainly lose no time in inquiring into this.  I very strongly commend and compliment Deputy Kyne for the manner in which he has presented this case to the House.  I want to express my keen disappointment that the Government did not provide time for a motion such as this much earlier so that the House would be given an opportunity of clearing up this disgraceful transaction and having it fully inquired into so that the people of Tramore would be given an opportunity of finding out the real motives which cannot be disclosed except through an inquiry by this House which this motion asks for and which I am sure the House with the fullest possible support will agree to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I have considered this matter, the better am I satisfied that in accepting the recommendations of An Bord Fáilte for the <Col N="399" /> disposal of this property I secured for it a higher price than could have been secured by any other method, and the kind of arrangement which is best likely to serve the interests of Tramore as a holiday resort.  Deputy Kyne contends that the property should have been sold by public auction.  Underlining this contention is the suggestion that the persons to whom the property was sold were just ordinary private citizens who had no better claim for special consideration in relation to the property than anybody else.  That, of course, is not a fact.  The properties were sold to directors of a company which was set up by the Tourist Board itself in 1946 for the purpose of acquiring, developing and managing these properties, and the directors of this company were the people who knew all about them, who had been responsible for their management from the beginning, men who had, as public citizens interested in Tramore, acted without fee or reward in the management of these properties and who were content to allow the position to continue as originally contemplated by the Tourist Board when that local company was established.</P>
      <P>When, however, it was decided by the Government which came into office in 1948 to dispose of the properties held by the Tourist Board, naturally the interests of Tramore were considered by the Tourist Board in relation to the disposal of properties there.  The Tourist Board were always of opinion that the right way to secure the interests of Tramore as a holiday resort was to dispose of these properties to the directors of the local company. That was recommended to my predecessor; that was recommended to me.  The Tourist Board were strongly of opinion that the individuals who had supervised the development and had been responsible for the management of the properties were the best fitted to direct them in future so as to secure the benefits for Tramore that were always contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore&mdash;and this is an important point in relation to the matter, important to an understanding of why the Tourist Board were so strongly <Col N="400" /> of that opinion&mdash;when the Government in 1948 decided that this policy of developing holiday resorts through the activities of the Tourist Board was to stop, the plan for the development of Tramore had only begun; it had not been even half completed.  The local company had been pressing for the acquisition of further properties there, acquisition which they thought was necessary both for the proper development of and to protect the value of the properties already acquired.  In the hope that the then Government might change its mind and reverse this decision to stop the policy of holiday resort development, the directors themselves out of their own resources found the money to buy this additional property. As the interests of Tramore required that all the properties should be developed in accordance with some consistent plan, it was obviously desirable that the property which was in the particular ownership of the Tourist Board, although managed by the local company, should be disposed of to those who already owned on their own behalf and purchased with their own money a further portion of property.</P>
    <P>No proposal for purchasing this property was received from the town commissioners.  The town commissioners came to my predecessor to intimate that they had an interest in the acquiring of the property.  There was some doubt as to their legal powers and considerable doubt as to their authority to raise the money for the purchase of the property.  They were, however, invited to put up their proposals in relation to the property but have never done so.  It is true that subsequently another private company composed of members of the town commissioners as private individuals evinced an interest in the acquisition of the property, but it was as private individuals, even though the individuals happened to be members of the town commission for the time being, that they came together.  The town commissioners, as such, while they might have, under statute, powers to acquire the property or at any rate part of the property, could not raise the money for that purpose and if the money was to be raised it would have <Col N="401" /> to be provided for the town commissioners by the Waterford County Council. So far as I am aware, the question was never even discussed by the Waterford County Council.</P>
    <P>Then there is another fact.  It has been said that this property has been mismanaged since it went into the hands of the new owners and that they have exploited the property for the betterment of their own interests.  They have not got the property yet.  The sale has not been completed.  The purchase price has been paid, but the lease has not been finally executed. For the time being, the local people concerned are managing the property as caretakers for the Tourist Board. To suggest that the property was transferred and was being used to the detriment of the town or for private gain is nonsense.  The property is still the property of the Tourist Board.  The purchase price has been paid but it is only as caretakers for the Tourist Board that the local company managed the property during the past year.</P>
    <P>It is not true that other properties of the Tourist Board were not disposed <Col N="402" /> of by private treaty or only after they had been offered by public auction. My predecessor on three occasions sanctioned the sale by private treaty of Tourist Board property without that property having been offered for sale by public auction.  He was right.  I am not criticising his decision.  On each occasion he sanctioned the proposals of the Tourist Board to dispose of the property in the way best designed to serve the interests of tourist development. It would have been a serious mistake from the point of view of the Tourist Board if these properties had passed into the hands of any other persons except those who acquired them. So far as precedents are required, there are three, one in relation to property at Portmarnock, one in relation to property at Killarney, and one in relation to property at Bundoran.</P>
