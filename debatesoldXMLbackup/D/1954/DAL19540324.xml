      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the unusually protracted negotiations which have been and are being experienced by landowners whose holdings are being flooded by the Lee Hydro Electric Scheme and that an impression has been created that higher compensation can be obtained by extended negotiations; and, if so, whether he will make representations to the E.S.B. to make equitable offers at first interviews so as to dispel the impression already created and expedite the payment of compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>These representations have been made and the position is an extremely grave one. Would the Parliamentary Secretary ask the Minister to make some representations to the E.S.B. to expedite the compensation?  Further, is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that solicitors, when they are now made an offer by the E.S.B., will not bring the farmers into their offices because they are aware of the fact that it is not a real offer?  In many cases they have to come in 30 and 40 times before there is anything by way of a realistic offer made on the part of the E.S.B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Every effort is made to make a realistic valuation of any lands acquired under the Electricity Supply Act, 1945, and not only that but landholders whose lands are expected to be acquired are given the opportunity of employing a valuer and a solicitor at the expense of the E.S.B. and in the final result the question is one for an arbitrator.  The Deputy must agree that in such an event it is not proper for the Minister to interfere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that under the E.S.B.'s new scale of charges, it is proposed to fix a bimonthly charge of 11/- for a five-roomed house in Cork as against a charge of 8/- for a similar house in the Dublin area; and, if so, if he will take steps to ensure that such discriminations against Cork will not be brought into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no function in sanctioning the scale.  The Deputy might be pleased to learn that the expected effect of the introduction of the new scale will be an over-all reduction in the cost of electricity to the citizens of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has been in communication with the E.S.B. in this connection, might I ask what redress the citizens of Cork have when there is no satisfactory reply from the board in regard to this matter of charging 11/- for a five-roomed house there as against 8/- in Dublin?  What redress have the people if those in office who are responsible to the people do not investigate such matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said there would be an over-all reduction in the price of electricity in Cork.  As I understand the situation as regards five-roomed houses in Cork, there was a meter rent of 1/6 for every period of two months.  From now on there will be a meter rent of 11/- for every period of two months and the difference in the fixed charge will be £2 17s. in favour of the E.S.B.  I do not regard that as satisfactory.</P>

I have assumed that the Deputy requires the figures for overdraft as at a particular date and have given the figures for the last day of each year, except in the case of the Irish Potato Marketing Company Limited, where overdraft accommodation was required for short periods only and the overdraft figure has been taken at the last day in 1952 and 1953 on which an overdraft was outstanding.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state why, in view of the legislative provisions regarding the short birth certificate and the clearly expressed views of both Houses of the Oireachtas thereon, a circular instruction has been issued to civil servants requiring them to submit the long form of birth certificate with applications for children's allowances, why civil servants are placed, in this matter, in a different category to other citizens and if he will have the circular instruction cancelled.</P>

      <P>It would not be practicable to dispense with the requirement that the unabridged form of birth certificate should accompany applications for Civil Service children's allowances.  A birth certificate in this form contains certified information as to the parentage of the child which is necessary for the purpose of such applications but which is omitted from the short birth certificate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what amount of the Estimates for Public Services, 1954-55, are capital services as defined by him in his Budget statement of 1953, and if he will indicate with reference to each sub-head of each Estimate, how the sum for capital services is made up in respect of the forthcoming financial year.</P>

      <P>The amount included in the 1954-55 Volume of Estimates for the &ldquo;voted capital services&rdquo; taken into account in framing the 1953 Budget is £14,282,260.  Details of the items making up this total are set out in a statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have included in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I should, however, remind the Deputy that, in my Budget statement last year, I did not define the expression &ldquo;voted capital services.&rdquo;  I merely contented myself with charging to capital those particular services and services of a similar character for which my predecessor had been in the habit of borrowing.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>PROVISION in the Estimates for Public Services, 1954-55, for items regarded as &ldquo;capital&rdquo; for purposes of the Budget statement of 1953.</P>

The townland of Knockroe is in the electoral division of Kilcoe adjacent to Ballydehob, and I assume that the road in question is one in the townlands of Skeaghanore West and Knockroe, which may be described as &ldquo;from the county road <Col N="19" /> west of James McGrath's cottage, leading north-west and ending at the county road near William Sweeney's house.&rdquo;  A number of grants were made some years ago for this proposal and when the last grant was expended in 1949 we were advised that the work had been satisfactorily completed. No further representations in the matter have since been received.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction of £1,000,000 in the proposed Grant-in-Aid to the Hospitals' Trust Fund for the coming financial year, as compared with the provision in the Estimates for the current year, is due firstly to an expected increase in revenue to the fund from sweepstakes as a consequence of the very heartenlishe <Col N="21" /> ing growth of support for the sweeps; secondly, to the carry-over of a security valued at £175,000 which is due for redemption in October next; and thirdly, to a somewhat slower than expected rate of progress on works under construction as well as delays in the commencement of further works included in the building programme.</P>
      <P>Despite this latter factor, I should say that the ensuing year will be one of very great significance in the expansion of our hospital services. It should see the virtual completion of the section of the programme relating to tuberculosis which alone involves an outlay of about £10,000,000 from the fund.  Major projects due for final completion during the year include the regional sanatoria at Galway, Dublin and Cork and Ardkeen chest hospital.  Other major hospitals due to come into operation during the year include Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin; St. Luke's Hospital for cancer at Rathgar; Galway and Limerick regional general hospitals; Cork Orthopædic Hospital; the addition of Rialto Hospital to St. Kevin's as a general hospital; Manorhamilton and Cahirciveen hospitals; the provision of 320 extra beds at Grangegorman and Portrane Mental Hospitals and 1,000 additional beds for mental defectives at Drumcar, County Louth; Lota, County Cork; Clonsilla, Dublin; and Celbridge, County Kildare.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the fact that there is no slackening of the effort to press on with the programme, I might mention some of the more important projects on which building work should start during the next financial year: the new St. Laurence's Hospital; the major improvement scheme at Steevens' Hospital; Cork Regional General Hospital; Limerick Regional Maternity Hospital; Kilcreene Orthopædic Hospital; the County Hospitals at Letterkenny, Dundalk and Longford; the extension to Bantry Hospital; district hospitals at Dungloe and Carndonagh. In addition, a number of important improvements to the mental hospitals should be put in hands during the year.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, various other services at present provided under other codes (e.g. public assistance services, school medical services) are in process of continuous improvement and further improvement will be facilitated by the replacement of the existing statutory authority for those services in the more comprehensive Health Act, 1953.  The relevant sections of the Act, which, of course, are sections additional to those I have already mentioned, will be brought into operation at suitably early dates.  The cash provision necessary as a result of such improvements, amounting to £155,000, is made under the old headings in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>The aggregate provision for these new services and extensions of existing services, is, therefore, £1,495,000.  I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, to circulate with the Official Report a statement showing the distribution of that sum amongst the various services.</P>

      <P>The question of preventing damage to objects of archaeological interest during the course of land reclamation operations has been the subject of correspondence and discussions between the Keeper of Irish Antiquities, National Museum, The National Monuments Advisory Council, and officers of my Department since the early stages of the land reclamation scheme.</P>
      <P>In October, 1950, the Keeper of Irish Antiquities gave a lecture on the subject of field monuments of archaeological interest to the district officers, and distributed to them a memorandum which he had prepared specially for their guidance.</P>
      <P>As operations under the scheme were extended, it was found that the danger of interference with sites of possible interest was increasing.  This position was kept under close observation and in July, 1952, instructions were issued to all outdoor officers engaged on land reclamation that schemes should be planned so as to obviate as far as possible interference with archaeological sites.  To meet occasional cases where a scheme would necessitate interference with such sites, there has since 1950 been an arrangement whereby sites are inspected by an experienced archaeologist, and if warranted an archaeological excavation is carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in the past ten days the prices obtained by producers generally for eggs have fallen from about 2/- to 1/6 per dozen.  During the period mentioned, there has been a weakening in the demand for Irish eggs in Britain in consequence of the usual seasonal increase in egg supplies there and I consider that at the moment 1/6 per dozen is on average equivalent to the price obtainable on the export markets.  British producers supply the home market to the extent of approximately 85 per cent of its requirements and therefore it may be taken that British home produced supplies are the biggest factor in determining the market price for all eggs in Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 192 says that there are certain circumstances in which proceedings should be held <i>in camera.</i>  That section is being deleted by the Minister's amendment.  His substitute amendment provides for particular occasions on which the court may sit <i>in camera.</i>  My objection to this particular sub-section is that it is too wide, and that the convening authority may consider the matter expedient, in the interests of public safety which, in fact, may be contrary to the public interest, to have it in private.  It may consider that it may be in the interests of defence that the court-martial should not be held in public, or that it may not be in the interests of public morals that the trial should be held in public. Not only may the convening authority decide, but the president of the court-martial may decide.  The difficulty that arises is that the convening authority which, in the ordinary way, would be the Adjutant-General or the president of the court-martial may form an opinion as to what is in the interests of public safety and may order, for that reason, that a court-martial shall be held <i>in camera,</i> which court-martial should in the public interest be held in public.  From that point of view the convening authority, or the president, should not have the final say in relation to that matter.  I think it is the Attorney-General who should take such a decision as that, or the Minister, because if the Minister comes to a decision which is not in the public interest he can be questioned about it here; similarly, if the Attorney-General takes a decision, that decision can be questioned here.  But if the convening authority or the president of the court-martial takes a decision great difficulty will arise in having that decision raised here because neither of these officers is entitled to be present and the Minister would say that the Legislature had given that particular power to these officers and, once the power had been given and they had exercised it, the matter could not be raised here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances serious and grave abuses could grow out of the <Col N="53" /> implementation of this particular sub-section as it stands and I am anxious that such power should not be given. If the deciding authority was independent of the military authority there would be some safeguard for the public interest; in matters military, both here and else where, the military profession is a sheltered profession in which ideas as to public safety may develop, unsound ideas both in the public interest and in the interests of public safety.  It is for that reason I oppose the inclusion of a sub-section which confers such wide power as this and which confers no real protection on the accused person.  The accused may be anxious that the proceedings should be public because the glare of publicity may prevent an injustice being done and it would be very wrong for the convening authority, merely because he thought it expedient in the interests of public safety, to order a trial to be held <i>in camera.</i></P>
    <P>Almost every matter relating to public safety may be raised here. Almost every matter relating to defence may be raised here.  I think it is unwise to give such wide scope in the prohibition of publicity as is provided in this sub-section.  Similarly, in regard to public morals there are certain very well-defined rules laid down in the ordinary criminal code and I think the limitation in regard to public morals should be the same limitation as is provided in the ordinary criminal law.</P>

      <P>Who is the deciding authority there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The law has decided the cases which may be held <i>in camera.</i>  They are very specific. The judiciary then enforces those laws. The circumstances in which an ordinary civilian case may be heard <i>in camera</i> are very clearly and specifically laid down.  It is not left to the discretion of the Attorney-General, the Minister for Justice or the trial judge to close the court on his own initiative because he thinks what may be disclosed might be contrary to public morals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is laid down clearly in the Constitution that justice must be done in public.  The only circumstances in <Col N="54" /> which justice may be done <i>in camera</i> are laid down in the statutes and I have some doubts, therefore, as to the validity of a sub-section such as this which gives absolute power to the convening authority or the president of the court-martial to say that it is expedient, in his opinion, in the interests of public safety to hold a trial <i>in camera</i> and to exclude the public from the whole or any part of that trial.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be well advised to have this particular sub-section re-examined. He would be well advised to lay down specifically the circumstances in which a court-martial may be held <i>in camera.</i>  The reasons should be stated with absolute precision.  I think that it is the Attorney-General who should decide whether or not a case should be held <i>in camera,</i> and such a decision should only be taken with his authority and on his certificate.</P>
    <P>This sub-section raises very important issues in relation to the rights of citizens and very important principles in regard to the administration of justice. Matters of that kind should be decided by persons who have been trained in law, who have a knowledge of constitutional law, and who will be influenced by the principles relevant to the rights of citizens.</P>
    <P>But if we leave it in the state in which it is in this amendment, the convening authority may have no knowledge of law, good, bad or indifferent. It is no part of his business to know anything about law.  Every officer in the Army is supposed to know, and in fact does know, something about military law.  Some officers know more than others, but all officers get some training in military law in the cadet school and they receive lectures on it from time to time.  But there is no obligation on the convening authority, who, generally speaking, is the Adjutant-General, to have a knowledge of the principles of constitutional law of the law which governs this State in ordinary criminal matters.  The same thing applies to the president of the court, who is an officer also and who has just a knowledge of military law that enables him to administer the military code.</P>
    <P>It is very wrong that this very important <Col N="55" /> power, because it is an important power, should be given, at absolute discretion, to one or other of these officers who, obviously, cannot be expected to have the knowledge of law that would enable an Attorney-General to issue an appropriate certificate in such a case.  It is wrong that the decision, once taken, under that particular sub-section is final, conclusive and binding on everybody.  It is a bad sub-section, it is a sub-section that can lend itself to grave abuses.  As I have said on other sections, I do not visualise any grave abuses happening now or perhaps in the very immediate future.  But this is a permanent Army Bill.  These powers may be exercised, and can be exercised, contrary to the public interest and, consequently, to the rights of an individual, whether he is an officer or a soldier, and to that extent contrary to the interest of the citizens.  I ask the Minister to agree that the sub-section should be deleted and, if it is not deleted, that the Minister should agree to have it re-examined. When the Bill comes before the Seanad, it may be possible for him to introduce an amendment which would have the approval of the Attorney-General in so far as it affects the constitutional rights of the citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is merely reiterating the statements which he already made at the Special Committee.  Arising out of the case which he made on that occasion, I went to the trouble of having this very carefully re-examined and amendment No. 148 which I am proposing, is the result of that reexamination. The Deputy referred to this being a permanent Bill.  It is permanent only in so far as it can be altered at any time that the House desires to alter it.  If it is found that this works in any way such as described by the Deputy, it can be very readily amended.  As I said, I have had this very carefully re-examined and it was re-examined in the Attorney-General's office.  We did not even rely entirely on our own legal authorities; we sent it still further afield, and this is the result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that any of the fears <Col N="56" /> expressed by Deputy Cowan are likely to be realised.  I think it is not only desirable but necessary that a convening authority or the president of a court-martial should have the power to judge whether the circumstances with which the court was confronted were such as to make it desirable that the case should be heard <i>in camera.</i>  The matter is clearly defined here in sub-section (2) of the amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the convening authority or the president of a court-martial considers that it is expedient in the interests of public safety, defence or public morals that the public should be excluded...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That restricts the convening authority or the president of the court and no convening authority or president of a court is going to go outside of these directions.</P>
    <P>I am sure that if a convening authority or the president of a court-martial deems it desirable from the point of view of public morals or from the point of view of public safety or defence that the court should be cleared nobody will grumble about that.  It is only within this very restricted range that the convening authority or the president of a court-martial can suggest that the trial should be heard <i>in camera.</i>  So that, having had a long discussion of this section at the Special Committee and having had it not only re-examined but reconstituted in the manner in which it has been reconstituted, I could not possibly accept the Deputy's amendment.  I think I am going a very considerable distance to meet the Deputy in amendment No. 148.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there has been an improvement in this particular section since the Special Committee, but I am not satisfied that sub-section (2) is a sub-section which should be approved of by this House without being restricted much further.  What is &ldquo;in the interests of public safety?&rdquo;  That is one of the big problems that arise.  It is all right for the Minister to say that he is satisfied if an Army officer came <Col N="57" /> to the conclusion that it was not expedient in the interests of public safety to have a court held in the open that it should be held <i>in camera.</i> But the problem that arises is the problem that I mentioned, that our courts of justice should be open except in such circumstances where it is provided by law that they may be closed to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

      <P>These are the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I just want to say that in my view that is not sufficient, that under the Constitution the law must be administered in open court and as far as the ordinary criminal cases are concerned there are specific rules governing the circumstances in which the cases may be held <i>in camera.</i> It is not left, as far as the ordinary criminal law is concerned, to the discretion of the Attorney-General, nor is it left to the discretion of a judge.  It is laid down by law.  This proposes to close courts-martial not in accordance with fixed principles that are laid down but in accordance with the discretion of the particular officer who happens to have the responsibility of convening a court-martial or of presiding at a court-martial, and that is the difference between the ordinary criminal code and what is laid down here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the dangers that can arise here is that in certain circumstances a military officer may consider that it is in the interests of the public safety that the light of day would not be allowed to shine on some particular aspect that might injuriously affect the military profession.  Perhaps as a small country with a small Army we need not worry unduly about the dangers from that point of view, but nevertheless the dangers are there as has been known in certain countries where the military machine was operated in such a way as to cause the gravest injustice.  If one wants to read about the sort of thing that can be done there is plenty of history on the famous Dreyfus case in France.  That is one of the reasons why I object to the fact that this is left to the discretion of the officer rather than that we should say in the section that there are precise limitations <Col N="58" /> to the exercise of that power. There is no limitation here.  All the convening officer has to say to himself is: &ldquo;I consider it expedient in the interest of public safety that this court should be held <i>in camera.</i>&rdquo;</P>

      <P>No, he is not answerable, and that is the trouble.  If he were the Minister he would be answerable to this House, but he is not, and if the Minister were asked any question about it this answer is: &ldquo;The law gives that officer the power and I have no jurisdiction or function in regard to it.&rdquo; That is the objection I have to the section, that it does not prescribe the conditions in which the court may be closed but leaves it to the discretion of one or two officers who could not possibly have or be expected to have the training that would be necessary for them to have to decide what was in the public interest.  It is not the function or duty of an Army officer to decide what is in the interest of public safety.  That is a matter for the Attorney-General and for the Government, not for an individual Army officer.  In actual fact it would perhaps be best if the decision as to whether it should be in public or <i>in camera</i> were taken by the Government rather than by anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we say so here he could.  The Attorney-General in exercising a judicial discretion would exercise it as a person who was trained in and had knowledge of constitutional rights, and one could reasonably expect that his decision, which would be a judicial decision, would be a fair one, whereas if you leave it to a person who has no knowledge and no training and no preparation for that important decision, or function of decision, then I think you are making a mistake.  I realise that the Minister has had this examined and that he has gone some way to meet the objections raised at the Special Committee by this amendment which the Minister moved and <Col N="59" /> which is before the House.  All I could do when I saw it was to propose that this particular sub-section be deleted. Time was not available to me to draft the kind of sub-section I think should be put in its place.  It would involve and necessitate a substantial amount of work and all I could do was simply to put down the motion that I have here, to delete the sub-section, and give my reasons for it.</P>
      <P>As I say, the Minister has had it examined by the Attorney-General's Department and apparently they have approved of the form of wording that we have here.  I have a strong objection to it.  I have expressed this objection.  I have now placed it on record, and that is all I can do in regard to it.</P>

Provision is made in Section 238 for the presentation of petitions by or on behalf of persons sentenced by courts-martial.

      <P>I move amendment No. 153:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 90 to delete Section 206 (2), lines 39 to 48.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 206 deals with contempt of court-martial and provides that if a person not subject to military law&mdash; that is, a person who is not an officer or soldier&mdash;is summoned as a witness and makes default in attending or realis <Col N="61" /> fuses to take an oath or does anything that would be contempt if it were committed in a civil court, he may have his offence certified by the president of the court-martial to the High Court and the High Court may punish that person as they think fit.  The second part of the section provides that where a person subject to military law is guilty of contempt, by using insulting or threatening language or by causing any interruption or disturbance in the proceedings of the court-martial, &ldquo;the court-martial, if they think it expedient, instead of the offender being tried by court-martial, may by order under the hand of the president order the offender to be imprisoned without hard labour or in the case of a man, to undergo detention for a period not exceeding 21 days.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that that is a sub-section that we can easily do without.  In the case of a civilian guilty of contempt before a court-martial, the court-martial cannot deal with him there and then. The president of the court has to certify the contempt and that goes before the High Court.  The accused civilian or citizen has the right to make such defences as are open to him in regard to that particular charge. If, however, the offender before the court-martial is not a civilian and happens to be a soldier or officer, then we abolish the rule of law altogether and we give the court-martial power there and then, by order under the hand of the president, to imprison for 21 days or in the case of a soldier to give him detention, instead of imprisonment, in a military detention barracks for 21 days.  In other words, the court may there and then give an officer 21 days' imprisonment or a soldier 21 days' detention.  It seems to me unjust that we should have any such provision as that for the soldier when we have a completely different procedure in regard to the civilian.</P>
    <P>The fact must not be overlooked, that if a person who goes before a court-martial as a witness is guilty of contempt of the court-martial, he may be charged with that contempt and he may have his case examined in the ordinary way, as if he were charged with anything else, so that the civilian <Col N="62" /> witness is liable only to have his case certified to the High Court, but the ordinary soldier or officer before the court is liable to be court-martialled for the offence or, if the court so decides, he may be punished in drumhead fashion there and then when the members of the court are all &ldquo;het-up&rdquo; about something.  I was reading in the papers yesterday or the day before about a witness before a French court who got into an altercation with the judge and all that happened to him was that they put him put out of court; but in the Army here&mdash;so far as a soldier or an officer is concerned&mdash;they want not only to have the right to court-martial him and to punish him, but they want to have the right to punish him there and then, in the heat of the moment, and to sentence him to detention or imprisonment for 21 days. I think that is neither right, desirable, nor necessary.  I think that discipline can be maintained without that provision.</P>
    <P>In an experience lasting over 30 years of courts-martial, I have never yet seen an occasion on which such a thing as is envisaged here happened. In fact, it is very seldom, if ever, that one hears of contempt of a court-martial. Courts-martial are treated with respect by everybody, by civilian witnesses and by military witnesses. On the very odd occasion on which, in future, a soldier or officer might be guilty of contempt, I think it is better that he should be charged and dealt with in the ordinary way by a tribunal that can give an impartial hearing to the facts on all sides, instead of what is here provided&mdash;permitting the president of the court to order the man to be imprisoned for 21 days for contempt, or for what he alleges at the time is contempt of the court, and which, in fact, might not be considered to be contempt of the court by an independent court-martial.</P>
    <P>These drumhead procedures are objectionable. In my view there is no necessity for them and why we should provide for them now I do not know.  You set up a president of a court-martial in this case to try one person in accordance with law and at the same time, if he becomes annoyed with a witness whom he may consider as having used <Col N="63" /> insulting or threatening language or having interrupted the proceedings, you give him the right there and then, in the heat of the moment, to order that that particular person be sent for 21 days to imprisonment or detention and you give no right to the individual concerned to appeal against the decision or to go forward for trial by somebody else.  You deprive the accused of that right altogether and it is specifically laid down that Chapter VII of this Part of the Bill shall not apply to such cases.  In other words, in the case of any other soldier or officer punished by a court-martial, the sentence does not become effective until it has been confirmed by a confirming authority who studies the record and decides whether or not the proceedings should be confirmed.  But even that procedure of confirmation is wiped out here and we have this out-of-hand drumhead procedure being authorised by the law of the country.  It is contrary to my concept of justice.</P>
    <P>If a person is alleged to have committed an offence, whether it be contempt of a court-martial or not, he ought to be tried in accordance with the proper procedure.  He ought to have the right of having his defence heard and ought to have the right of being represented by an officer or lawyer and the decision should be subject to review in the same way as any other sentence is subject to review. Here there is no protection, good, bad or indifferent, and it is not even stated in the section that the court-martial of three officers shall, by a majority, decide that he was guilty of contempt. There is no protection whatever in it. The only thing in it is the definite statement that the president, by order under his hand, may order the offender to be imprisoned without hard labour for a period not exceeding 21 days.  I am perfectly certain the Minister could find no justification for that drumhead procedure and I should be surprised if he should wish to retain a provision such as that in the military code.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan is a bonny fighter, but on this occasion he had some difficulty in making his case. He said, in the course of his remarks, <Col N="64" /> that this was a sub-section we could very well do without.  No one knows better than Deputy Cowan does the absolute necessity of dealing with an individual who would treat a court with contempt.  We know from our own past experience how far we were able to advance the national cause itself by our treating particular courts with contempt and we know that if we had not got a section to deal with that type of case, courts-martial might find it very difficult to deal with cases at all or to ensure that they would be regarded in what would be a serious manner.  There is nothing drumhead about this and I am surprised by Deputy Cowan's repeated references to this drumhead procedure.  The Deputy knows that is not correct. This is a case of a normal court-martial at which a man is being tried for some offence.  If, in the course of the trial, whether the offence be a simple offence or a grievous offence, that man treats the court in a grossly insulting manner, the court will have to deal with it, and there was no necessity whatever for Deputy Cowan to take us to France in order to give us a case in point of something which he thought was contempt and which was merely dealt with by removing the individual from the court.</P>

There was no necessity for him to go to France, because how often have we read of court cases in this country which, because of something an individual may have said or some action he may have taken in court, have been stopped by the judge and the individual ordered to be taken into custody or removed from the court and, perhaps, tried by a higher court for contempt? We have had civil court cases in which individuals were not only removed from the court for contempt but were put into Mountjoy Prison for indefinite periods because of contempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> I agree with the Deputy when he says there are very few cases&mdash;I do not know of any cases myself&mdash;of a court-martial being treated with contempt, but surely it is the right thing to do to provide for every and all possible difficulty which is likely to arise.  This is merely another effort in that direction.  The old Act which this measure will replace is an Act which is draped around with all sorts of amendments because of the experience we have gained over the years. We have had amendment after amendment year after year for the past 20 odd years and these are now contained in the legislation, and, if I were to hold it up for the House to see, the House would be amazed by the difficulties confronting officers who have to interpret it from time to time.  We are endeavouring to make this Bill an Act in respect of which it will not be necessary, so far as one can foresee, to have amendments coming forward year after year.</P>
    <P>I have already said that this is not a final Act.  It is described as a permanent Act, but we all know that no Act is permanent, that, in course of time, all Acts have to be amended and I have no doubt that, in the course of time&mdash;I hope, a considerable time&mdash; it will be necessary to amend this Act, but there is nothing in this provision to which one can take objection.  It conforms, so far as I can see, with the ordinary civil law and does not go any further.  It merely makes provision that if a court should be treated with utter contempt&mdash;I hope it will never arise&mdash;the court will be placed in a position to deal with that contempt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reasons for retaining the section are not conclusive, so far as I am concerned, because this whole matter of contempt of court&mdash;not only of courts-martial but of any court in the country&mdash;has a very interesting history.  A lot of matters which were considered from time to time to be contempt of court were nothing more or less than something considered to be an affront to the judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judges in some countries in the world take the view that you cannot <Col N="66" /> joke with them, that you cannot talk to them as one man to another and that you have always got to keep on your knees in front of them.  This matter of contempt was a means of making people come, almost in a state of terror, before the courts.  If a person is deliberately insulting and offensive to a court, I agree he ought to be punished.  Where the Minister and I differ is in the method of punishment.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, in Section 160, which has already been passed, we have provided a whole section covering offences in relation to courts-martial.  In Section 160 we provide that every person, subject to military law, who, being duly summoned or ordered to attend as a witness, makes default in attending or refuses to take an oath or refuses to produce a document or refuses to answer a question or&mdash;and this is the very matter we are dealing with now&mdash;uses insulting or threatening language or causes any interruption or disturbance in the proceedings of a court-martial or commits any other contempt is guilty of an offence against military law and shall, on conviction, be liable to suffer imprisonment or any less punishment awardable by a court-martial.</P>
    <P>I agree with the provisions of that section.  If a person refuses to take an oath, refuses to produce a document or answer a question lawfully put to him and if he uses insulting or threatening language or causes any interruption or disturbance in the proceedings or commits any other contempt he is guilty of an offence and ought to be punished for it.  He is liable to be sentenced to imprisonment not to 21 days but to two years.  That is his liability but under that section it has to be proved that he is guilty of contempt and he has the right to defend himself and to cross-examine any person who alleges he is guilty of contempt and before the sentence can be made effective it has to go before the Judge Advocate General to consider it from the legal point of view.</P>
    <P>It has also to go before the confirming authority to consider it from the general point of view.  If the confirming authority, after considering the <Col N="67" /> case and taking into account the opinion of the Judge Advocate General, thinks that the man is guilty of the offence then he confirms the punishment. If he thinks he is not guilty, he can quash the finding or if he thinks the punishment too severe, remit it in whole or in part.  I have no objection to that but what I am objecting to is that where you have the same alleged offence committed before a court-martial the president himself may decide the conduct of the witness to be contempt.  He may consider language used by a witness to be insulting that an independent tribunal would not consider insulting.  Apparently, he need not take the view of the two or four other officers on the court-martial. He is the judge himself, the single individual.  The president can there and then say to the witness: &ldquo;21 days' imprisonment.&rdquo;  That is the most he can say.  He can say: &ldquo;ten days' imprisonment, 14 days' imprisonment or seven days' imprisonment.&rdquo; He can say that there and then without giving the man any chance of explaining his conduct or any chance of making a defence.  That sentence of the president is not subject to review by anyone and has to be carried out right away.</P>
    <P>I describe that as drumhead procedure. I think that the Minister would agree with that.  It is summary punishment inflicted on the spur of the moment perhaps by the president of a court who is peeved or annoyed with what has been said to him not by the accused person before the court but by a witness before the court.  This section does not confine it to the accused.  It is any person subject to military law and the very fact that he wears a uniform subjects him to this drumhead procedure as I term it.  If he was not a soldier or an officer, then he has the right of being defended if he wants to be defended and of getting his case before the High Court.  But because he happens to wear the uniform he can be dealt with in this summary fashion.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the particular type of contempt in the old days when people went in before a court&mdash;it might <Col N="68" /> be a court-martial or it might be a criminal court&mdash;and said: &ldquo;We will refuse to recognise the authority of this court&rdquo; and they treated it with deliberate contempt.  That was part of the national struggle.  But I have seen judges who ordered into custody advocates appearing before them because they were peeved.  They had lost the judicial sense and it required the strength of the legal profession to put an end to that sort of conduct.</P>
    <P>In this type of case the president is a human being and he may be peeved, offended or annoyed by what is said to him by a witness in the court-martial and just because he is peeved, offended or annoyed, we give him the right just to write out a little docket and say to the Governor of Mountjoy Prison: &ldquo;Take this man in for 21, 14 or seven days because he has been guilty of contempt of court.&rdquo;  If the section allowed even the court-martial as a whole unanimously to say this was contempt of the court there would be some little protection, but apparently nobody decides it except the president himself. I say there is no sense in or necessity in modern times for such a provision, particularly where we have, as in Section 160, given power to another court-martial to deal with offences of contempt of the court-martial.</P>
    <P>I would strongly press on the Minister to agree that the section is unnecessary, that it should not be there, and that it might be abused.  If, in over 30 years' application of military law to our Defence Forces, we never had a case of it, I do not think there is any necessity to put the section in now.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 159:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 93, between lines 45 and 46, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a person has been convicted by a court-martial of an offence against military law the court-martial may, in view of the previous good character and faithful service of such person, instead of awarding a sentence as provided for in Section 207 or Section 208 of this Act, record that in view of the previous good character and faithful service of the accused the court considers it proper not to impose any sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I should have to say very much in regard to this.  It is bringing into the military code something similar to the Probation of Offenders Act in the ordinary criminal law of the country.  I may say to the Minister that I have personal experience of occasions on which a court-martial would be anxious to have a provision such as this where a person was charged, perhaps, with a number of offences and it was found that he was not guilty of any serious or grave offence but that it was a purely technical offence in which the court <Col N="70" /> would be placed in the position of having to say &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; when, in fact, they knew he was guilty, or of having the power of saying: &ldquo;He is guilty of that offence&mdash;it is purely technical&mdash;but because of his previous good character and faithful service we do not think it right to impose any punishment.&rdquo;  I do not think there should be any objection in the world to incorporating a section such as that in our military law.</P>
    <P>The Probation of Offenders Act is a very valuable thing in the ordinary criminal law of the country.  In actual fact I had personal experience to-day of the application of the Probation of Offenders Act in a case in which a soldier was concerned, where he was found guilty by a jury of larceny by finding and in which the judge said he would record no conviction against him but would apply the Probation of Offenders Act.  It was a very proper case for such a decision.</P>
    <P>If that man had been convicted by a court-martial of the same offence he could not get the benefit of the Probation Act or of anything equivalent to it and the court would have to proceed under the scale of punishments that are laid down in Section 208. When they find him guilty, they have to impose a punishment.  It was always considered an anomaly in the Defence Forces that where a person is charged before a commanding officer with an offence the commanding officer is given discretion, if he thinks the circumstances warrant it, not to proceed with the charge and, in effect, to dispose of it under that machinery by simply saying it is not desirable to proceed.  We give that power to the commanding officer.  That power has been in the old Act and it is retained in the new one.  The commanding officer has discretion to say: &ldquo;He may be guilty of this, but in my opinion it is not desirable to proceed with the case.&rdquo;  That is the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>If, however, that person goes before a court-martial and the court-martial finds him guilty, they must impose a punishment and they have no right not to impose it.  I do earnestly press the Minister to meet me, even on this little point, where a soldier before a court-martial <Col N="71" /> who is a man of good character and has given faithful service has been convicted of an offence.  If, because of the circumstances of that offence and its technicalities, the court-martial want to say: &ldquo;We do not want to give a severe reprimand or impose any punishment by way of fine or otherwise; we consider it proper not to impose any sentence,&rdquo; I think it is desirable that that should be provided for. I know from my own personal experience it is a power a court would wish to have.  I know of many cases in which a court would like to exercise that power and I do not see any reason whatever why there should be objection to giving the court-martial that power.  We cannot say to a court-martial: &ldquo;If that is what you think, find him not guilty,&rdquo; because by their oath members of the court are bound to try him in accordance with the evidence.  If the evidence is that he is guilty of that offence, even if he is only technically guilty, their oaths bind them to find him guilty.  The suggestion I am making here is the way out, and I strongly press the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are retaining in this Bill the power of the commanding officer to deal summarily with an offence.  If he deals with it summarily he can, as Deputy Cowan stated, award a punishment that may not be as serious as that which would be awarded by a court-martial.  What Deputy Cowan is, perhaps, overlooking is the fact that it is the same commanding officer that examines the case.  Having examined it, he comes to the conclusion that it is too serious for him to deal with and he refers it to a court-martial.  If the case is not so serious and the court-martial tries the individual and finds him guilty, they can, if they think it not serious enough to award a severe sentence, reprimand the individual.  That is, perhaps, almost the equivalent of the case which the Deputy himself has stated.  I suppose it is the second least form of punishment that can be awarded to an officer.  No doubt it is recorded, but it is a very mild sentence. If a man has been guilty of <Col N="72" /> some particular offence that is serious enough in the view of the commanding officer to necessitate a court-martial, surely it should be recorded? I cannot see any grave reason why that type of crime should not be recorded on the individual's record, so I do not see there is much to worry about.</P>
      <P>At the Special Committee, the Deputy made a strong appeal to me to consult various judge advocates or the legal officers in the Army who were dealing with matters of this kind.  I did so.  I consulted these particular officers and they said there was no crying need whatever for this, that the position was somewhat as I have said and they thought the present position should remain.  Having consulted these people at the request of Deputy Cowan and having received their opinion, I regret that I am unable to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

Does the Deputy not know that practically every ministerial amendment that is down here is to meet some point the Deputy made in the Special Committee? Surely that was not a waste of time. The Deputy should realise the amount of time and trouble that it cost me and my officials during the time the House was in recess, examining all the points made in that Special Committee&mdash;a Committee that sat for three months and produced a voluminous report.  We went through that report day after day while other members of this House were, perhaps, taking life more easily. We examined critically everything in it.  Where it was necessary to pass it on to the legal authority, even to the Attorney-General in some cases, we did so.  We even called a committee of legal experts together&mdash;a representative from the Attorney-General's office, a representative from the Department of Justice and a legal representative from the Department of Defence.  We got these people to sit down and examine it carefully before we decided to make an alteration&mdash; which in a very large number of cases emanated from Deputy Cowan himself. Almost every ministerial amendment here is down to meet some case made by Deputy Cowan.  I am rather surprised then that he should make a statement that he feels he is wasting his time in discussing this Bill.</P>

      <P>I hope he does not object to anyone who feels he can help.  That is all I want to say about this.  What may have peeved me&mdash; like the judge I was talking about recently&mdash;was the approach of the Minister to the amendment I put down.  He went on the basis that if the commanding officer considered it serious enough he could send the man for court-martial.  Therefore, if they found him guilty they should punish him.  The Minister overlooked this aspect of it, that an accused person has the right himself to elect to go before a court-martial, just as a person going before a district justice may elect to go before a judge and jury.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only dealing with what the Minister said in answer to my case, that where the commanding officer considered it serious and he was found guilty by a court-martial there should be some punishment, even though only a reprimand.  If the accused person thinks he is not guilty of an offence, he may say he wishes to be tried by court-martial; and all I am asking is that when he goes before the court-martial and the court-martial comes to the conclusion: &ldquo;Yes, there is a technical guilt there but it is of such a kind that we do not want to impose a punishment at all; we will apply the equivalent to the Probation of Offenders Act,&rdquo; they should have that power.  I am not saying they are to exercise it unless it is necessary to do so, but that they should be given freedom to say: &ldquo;This is only a technical offence, this is a very fine type of fellow and, while in strict technical law he committed an offence, we do not want to punish him; we will record the <Col N="75" /> fact that we consider it of such a trivial technical nature that we will not record a punishment against him.&rdquo;  I think that power should be given to the court-martial, and I see no reason why it should be deprived of that power.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the second lowest punishment is a reprimand.  A reprimand is, in regard to an officer, the lowest punishment that can be imposed by a court-martial.  A reprimand is a very serious blot on an officer's conduct sheet and certainly a reprimand imposed by a court-martial is very serious.  Similarly, in regard to Section 208, as far as men are concerned, a man includes a sergenat-major down to a private, and a sergeant-major or a company quarter-master-sergeant or a battalion quarter-master-sergeant or a sergeant or a corporal who is given a reprimand by a court-martial has a very serious blot on his character record.  The trouble is that the court-martial may not want to give him a reprimand, but they have nothing else to give him. The Minister knows very well that if it were a question of promoting a sergeant to be a lieutenant and the file came up with his record there: &ldquo;Reprimand by court-martial&rdquo; on a certain date, that finished him, as far as a commission was concerned.</P>

      <P>That is the point. If he was tried and it was a technical offence and the court-martial said that because of the man's good character and faithful service they considered that punishment should not be recorded and that it was not proper to impose sentence, that could not debar the man from being considered for promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the Minister's opposition to me on the last section in regard to contempt of court-martial, but I cannot understand the objection to empowering a court-martial to deal properly with a case where a person is technically guilty but not otherwise guilty.  There is provision in the ordinary criminal law in the case of a person who goes before a judge and <Col N="76" /> jury, as happened to-day, that the judge may say that, although the jury has found him guilty, he will not record a conviction against him but will apply the Probation Act.  That man was a soldier and that is how the criminal court decided that they should dispose of the case.  If that soldier were before a court-martial, it would have to be recorded that he was found guilty and reprimanded by the court-martial.</P>

      <P>Section 218 deals with the powers of the confirming authority.  Sub-section (1) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The following provisions shall apply in relation to any sentence passed by a court-martial&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if the sentence is informally expressed, the confirming authority may, when confirming it, vary the form of the sentence so that it shall be properly expressed;</P>
      <P>(b)  if the punishment awarded by the sentence is invalid or in excess of that authorised by this Act&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  in case the offence in respect of which the punishment was awarded was an offence under Section 138, the confirming authority may substitute for the sentence a sentence of dismissal with ignominy from the Defence Forces or any less punishment mentioned in the scale to sub-section (1) of Section 207, and confirm the sentence so substituted,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  in any other case, the confirming authority may substitute for the sentence a sentence of any other punishment which might have been awarded by the <Col N="77" /> court-martial to the offender, and confirm the sentence so substituted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I propose in amendments Nos. 160 and 161 to delete the two paragraphs I have mentioned, so that the paragraph would then read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;if the punishment awarded by the sentence is invalid or in excess of that authorised by this Act the confirming authority shall refuse to confirm the finding and sentence of the court-martial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The whole thing is being stacked up all the time against the accused person. He goes before the court-martial. The court-martial gives him a sentence that is invalid or in excess of that authorised by the Act and then the provision is that the confirming authority can become the court itself and may look around to see what is the right sentence and give him that sentence.  If the court-martial is so stupid as to give him an invalid sentence or a sentence in excess of their jurisdiction, I want to provide that the confirming authority shall refuse to confirm the finding and sentence of the court-martial.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is anything to worry about here.  If there is any question of a sentence being invalid, it is not legal and it will have to be rectified and it will be rectified by the confirming authority.  If it is an excessive sentence, the same thing will happen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to propose that the Adjutant-General shall quash the finding and sentence.  I think it should be done. I see very few circumstances in which a court-martial will impose an invalid or excessive sentence but if they do I think that the finding and the sentence should be quashed.  I think that is only just.  As far as I can see from the <Col N="79" /> amendments we are putting into this Act, it does not matter two hoots what sort of sentence the court-martial impose. It does not matter two hoots what they do: the poor unfortunate accused will be caught, anyway.  The confirming authority will get him if the court-martial fails to do it.  On top of that, we have the superior officer&mdash;say, the Adjutant-General. Even if the confirming authority go wrong, he will put it right.  There is no escape from the punishment if you are convicted by a court-martial.</P>

      <P>In page 98, Section 222, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 27, down to the end of the section, and substitute &ldquo;and sentence of the court-martial.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is really the quashing of the finding of a court-martial, which is a most extraordinary thing to find in the Bill.  Section 222 (1) reads as follows: &ldquo;Where the finding and sentence of a court-martial in respect of an accused person have been confirmed and it appears to the Minister that the proceedings of the court-martial were illegal, the Minister shall quash the finding, and thereupon the following provisions shall have effect...&rdquo; This, again, runs on the same line.  In other words, the finding and sentence of a court-martial have been confirmed.  Then the Minister asertains that the proceedings were illegal.  In such a case &ldquo;the Minister shall quash the finding&rdquo;. After going through all the procedure whereby the man was tried, found guilty by the court-martial, sentenced and the sentence confirmed&mdash;after all that procedure had been gone through &mdash;it is subsequently discovered that the proceedings were illegal.  However, that does not mean that the poor unfortunate accused person has escaped the net.  A trap is set for him again&mdash;&ldquo;... and thereupon the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the whole of the sentence passed by the court-martial shall cease to have effect;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;as if it could have any effect once it was illegal&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  the Minister may at the same time direct that the accused be tried again for the offence which <Col N="81" /> was the subject of the finding, and in such case the accused may, notwithstanding anything in this Act or any rule of law, be tried by court-martial for such offence and if found guilty punished therefor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not say that all the legal authorities mentioned&mdash; the Attorney-General and Army legal officers&mdash;have had anything to do with what I consider a disgraceful provision.  Under the ordinary law of this country if such a matter came before a court of criminal appeal it would be quashed and that would be the end of it.  There would be no question of trying it again.  Here there is no escape at all&mdash;there must be punishment at all costs.  It does not matter if it cost the accused concerned £1,000 to defend himself and if it is subsequently discovered that the trial was illegal, he has to face the music again when the Minister says so.  Even if there is a rule of law against it, that is to be set aside and the man is to be tried again.  I think any Deputy in this House who appreciates the importance of that and who would allow that section to go through is not doing his duty to the citizens of this country.</P>

Then if the whole thing is discovered to be wrong, no matter what it cost you to defend yourself you are tried again.  If it is contrary to any rule of law you will still be tried again.

The Minister was present; the members of his Party were present and I was there.  The members of the Labour Party who were appointed members of this committee did not bother their heads attending.  The members of the Fine Gael Party did not bother their heads except on a few occasions and then they talk about the proceedings of the Special Committee. There would be none of the discussion there is here on the Report Stage if the members of the Parties appointed to the Special Committee had attended the Special Committee and given their views to the Minister. There are many sections on which the Minister, with the opinion of different sides of the House, might have taken different views to what he is taking now.  It is left then to me&mdash;and Deputy O'Sullivan may talk about my ego&mdash; to try to stop what I consider to be a grave abuse of our whole conception of the legal code of this country.  Is there any Deputy in this House who would attempt to justify this&mdash;that where the whole thing is illegal he should be tried again?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of any rule of law and regardless of anything that is in this Act.  Sometime, the proceedings of this House in regard to this Bill will be read by somebody, and this Act will be the Act which will provide the rule of law by which officers and soldiers will be governed both in peace and in war.  It is as important to this House as any other Act that provides punishments, even to the death punishment.  But nobody, cares about <Col N="84" /> it, and if anybody did care about it, a section such as this would not be put in.  When I think of the simple little things like giving an officer or a soldier the right to something like the probation of offenders, which is not there, that this House would not even ask the Minister to give that right, I am naturally worried.  When the House will permit the Minister to get accepted a section such as this which abrogates every such rule of law for the protection of an accused person, I think it will be understood why I am vehemently opposing particular sections of this Bill.  Every one of the sections or sub-sections I am opposing here are ones that are interfering with rights and fundamental liberties of individuals. When the Minister comes to answer, there is no use in him saying: &ldquo;This was raised at the Special Committee. I had it examined and I am not advised to change it.&rdquo;  Where we have a section such as this seeking to abolish the rule of law in regard to the rights of a person who has been illegally convicted in any proceedings, the Minister should give reasons for it to the House.  I am asking him now, if he insists on that being there, to give his reasons why that procedure should govern courts-material and should not govern ordinary trials outside. I know that if a case occurs, as a case is likely to, and may occur, of a person such as this being brought through all the procedure of a court-martial and of having the court-martial sentence approved, and it is then found that it is illegal, and the Miniter orders him to be retried, I am perfectly certain that one would find Deputies in this House endeavouring to make all the political capital they could out of the outcry that would arise.  But, when it is a question of trying to prevent a section such as this going into the Defence Bill, there is nobody to bother about it.  That is what is wrong not only with this legislation but with most of the legislation that goes through this House.  The Deputies who would be foremost clamouring against the injustices that would arise are the people who are conspicuous by their absence from the House when the matter is being discussed. <Col N="85" /> Here, we are dealing with the whole code relating to life and death, with the abrogation of the rule of law and the wiping out of any protection that is in the old Act, and providing that a person may be retried by order of the Minister, even where the whole proceedings have been found to be illegal.  In that situation, we find that nobody seems to worry one bit about it.</P>
      <P>I have expressed the opinion and the view that this is completely contrary to any conceptions that one should have of fair play and justice in regard to matters such as this.  I should like to hear the Minister give reasons as to why the rule of law is to be abrogated, if necessary, in order to have a person tried again.  In the section that we are dealing with, the whole idea is to give no escape at all, no matter how illegal, how excessive, or how invalid the position may be, but to pursue it and substitute one punishment for another.  All this can be done by somebody before whom the written proceedings of the court come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish it were possible to have the speech we have just listened to analysed by lawyers and their opinions on it submitted to this House.  If that were done, I venture to suggest that their opinions would differ very greatly from the views which have been expressed by Deputy Cowan.  What are we doing here? That is what we want to examine. What we are doing is that, &ldquo;where the finding and sentence of a court-martial in respect of an accused person have been confirmed, and it appears to the Minister that the proceedings of the court-martial were illegal, the Minister shall quash the findings,&rdquo; and, because it is provided in the section that the Minister may order a second trial, the first one being illegal, Deputy Cowan objects. He wants the individual who is being tried, whatever his crime may be, and whether he was guilty or not guilty, to be set free right away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan, in the course of his remarks, also said: &ldquo;I hope the Minister will not tell me that he has consulted his legal authorities.&rdquo;  I have. I am not a lawyer, and I have to depend <Col N="86" /> on expert legal advice in respect to everything that is contained in this measure.  Naturally, not being a lawyer, I have to depend on that advice. Surely the position is not that all these legal experts, including the lawyers in the Attorney-General's office and in the Department of Defence, are all wrong and that Deputy Cowan is right?  All these people sit together and consult on these matters. They examine them from every possible angle, and the advice which they give is put in the form in which it appears in the section. That is all that we are doing here. Suppose, for example, that the Minister discovers that a trial was it fact illegal or invalid.  There are many reasons why it could be.  The court-martial might have been illegally formed.  It might not have been formed in accordance with the regulations governing courts-martial.  There may be other reasons which I cannot think of at the moment why it might be illegal, but if by any chance some legal authority draws the Minister's attention to the fact that a trial which has taken place was an illegal trial, surely everyone will admit that it is the Minister's duty to see that whatever sentence was passed on an individual through the medium of that illegal trial will not operate, and that the next thing which the Minister should do is to reconstitute the court legally and have the trial carried out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan said that this was entirely against the ordinary civil law, that it takes away all the rights of the individual soldier, that once he gets into uniform he is the sort of person whom the law does not protect.  That is not correct.  So far as the soldier is concerned, he has all the freedoms which the Constitution gives to every citizen of this State.  I suggest to Deputy Cowan that if he believes in the speech which he has made, that we are taking from the soldier any of the freedoms which the Constitution entitles him to, it is his duty to take the matter up and see that the soldier's rights are not endangered.  I feel perfectly satisfied, however, about his constitutional position.  I am accepting the advice which I have been given by my legal advisers.  I am also advised <Col N="87" /> that the Court of Criminal Appeal has the same power as I have.  I do not think there is anything wrong here.</P>
    <P>I am rather surprised that Deputy Cowan should allow himself to become so heated with regard to this particular amendment which I may say was discussed at great length in the Special Committee.  It is unfortunate that we should have to keep on repeating the fact that this Bill was discussed at the Special Committee and that certain action was taken.  That Special Committee gave three solid months to discussing this Bill.  We accepted the recommendations of the Special Committee and we came back here, presented them to the House and the House accepted them.  That was quite satisfactory.  What is not so satisfactory is that practically every amendment that was discussed at the Special Committee has been put down once more on the Report Stage of this Bill and we are now doing on the Report Stage what we did in the Special Committee. From my point of view the valuable work done by the Special Committee has to some extent been lost by the continuous repetition over a protracted period.  I do not know how long we have been on this Bill now here in the House, but the repetition has taken away from the value of the work done by the Special Committee. There are nearly 200 ministerial amendments and practically every one of those arose out of the discussions which took place in the Special Committee, which goes to show that the work of that committee was taken so very seriously that a very large number of ministerial amendments went into the Bill and the Bill we are discussing to-day is a greatly altered Bill as compared with the original measure.</P>
    <P>Now it is a tribute to the Special Committee and to the House that the Bill received such careful examination. That is also verification of the fact that the Bill got a very through examination.  I cannot see any good reason why Deputy Cowan should have worked himself into such a passion over this particular section, especially when one remembers that the same thing happens in the ordinary civil courts.  Surely if a trial is found to <Col N="88" /> be illegal in a civil court it can be retired and is, I am sure, retried.  I have been advised that the Court of Criminal Appeal has power to order such a retrial.  I want to emphasise that the likelihood of such a situation arising, whereby a court would be declared to be acting illegally for some reason or another is very, very remote. Such an incident would happen very seldom and it is only for the purpose of trying to foresee the likelihood of such an incident arising that we have made this provision.  I cannot, therefore, accept Deputy Cowan's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When talking about the Special Committee and the value of the work done there, I do not lose sight of the fact that every amendment that was put down for consideration was put down by me; it was put down by me because I took an interest in this Bill.  I am still taking an interest in the Bill.  I am trying to ensure that we shall have the best possible Bill. If the Bill was examined very carefully by the Special Committee it was examined because of the amendments that were put down.  But the Special Committee lost a good deal of its value because the members of this House who were appointed to attend the meetings did not do so.  Take any of the records of the meetings and this is what one will find; I have just opened Number 16 of the 29th April, 1952, column 642:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Committee divided: Tá, 1; Níl, 5.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Tá was Cowan, Peadar; the Níl represents the Minister for Defence, Brennan, Thomas; Colley, Harry; Davern, Michael; Hilliard, Michael. The Minister, the members of the Minister's Party and myself&mdash;no one else.  That is why I say more consideration would have been given to the work of the Special Committee if the members of the Dáil who were appointed to that committee had attended the meetings.  It is a rule in other Parliaments that it is an offence not to attend committees of this kind and a member who does not attend has to give a very good reason for his non-attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to be praised indirectly <Col N="89" /> for the value of the work done by the Special Committee and criticised for continuing the examination of the Bill here in the House.  If I feel the Minister's attitude was unreasonable in relation to the amendments suggested, then it is this House and the Seanad that can decide the issue.  This provision makes a serious encroachment on principles and it should not be allowed to pass without protest.  I would have been satisfied if the Minister had examined the issue, as I invited him to do.</P>
    <P>In the Defence Forces Bill of 1923 there was no provision in relation to the quashing of a finding by the Minister. Something occurred, and in the 1924 Act provision was made in Section 33 whereby the Minister may quash the finding of a court-martial. That was in 1924.  This is 1954.  In 1954 the Minister wants the right, where he finds the proceedings of a court-martial illegal, to order the unfortunate accused person to be tried again.  Mention is made of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  That is some of the difficulty I have in discussing this Bill: one can mention that the Court of Criminal Appeal has the same powers.  When our Court of Criminal Appeal was established it was given powers that the Court of Criminal Appeal in England, for instance, has not got.  It was given power to order a retrial in proper circumstances.  Up to that time if a man was found guilty and the Court of Criminal Appeal could not support the conviction, that was an end of it.  No matter what the crime was the accused was acquitted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am about to deal with that.  The matter cannot be dealt with on the basis of question and answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Court of Criminal Appeal in certain circumstances may order a retrial, and these circumstances are specifically prescribed in law.  Where the Court of Criminal Appeal exercise the right of ordering a retrial, they generally, on application&mdash;in fact, I would say in 99 cases out of 100, <Col N="90" /> because I have only known of one case &mdash;order the State to pay all the expenses of the retrial.  That is of some little importance.  On that retrial, the man may be defended by senior and junior counsel, and the State pays the whole of the expenses.  Is there any such thing here?  None.  The Court of Criminal Appeal cannot just decide on a case before them that they will order a retrial.  There are certain circumstances in which they can order a retrial.  But if the proceedings of the Central Criminal Court or the Circuit Criminal Court were illegal, the Court of Criminal Appeal have no right and could have no right to order a retrial.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been advised that in certain circumstances the Court of Criminal Appeal have the right to order a retrial.  The Minister has not been advised what the circumstances are in which they can do it and what are the grounds on which they can do it, because that would have a substantial bearing on the decision.  He is simply told: &ldquo;They have the right to do it, and we advise you that you should have that right also.&rdquo;  Why did the Minister depart from the law as it was in 1923 or 1924?</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister puts it that way.  How many cases have been quashed since 1924 in which the Minister for the time being would have ordered a retrial if he had this power?  That is a fair question if we are going to talk about experience. In how many cases has a trial been quashed by the Minister in which the Minister would have ordered a retrial if he had the power that he wants to get now?  Can the Minister answer that question?</P>

      <P>The Minister says that this is based on experience.  What is the experience?  The experience can only be of cases that occurred, of cases that were quashed in which the <Col N="91" /> Minister considers he should have this power.  On how many occasions has justice been thwarted by the fact that the Minister had not this power?  I venture to say that there has been no case on which the Minister can base an appeal to experience in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might not necessarily order another trial. He may order it, but he need not do so if he does not like.  The provision is there as a safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's defence here will not divert me from the point I am making.  The Minister stated that this alteration from 1924 to 1954 is due to experience in the meantime.  What I am stating specifically and categorically is that there has been no case in which justice demanded a right to order a retrial and that this section confirms what I said about the rest of the sections, that this Bill is not the production of lawyers.  It is clearly, as far as this is concerned, the production of some person who wants to proceed step by step to a particular objective whether or not all reason, all experience and all the rules and codes of law have been against that.  In the words of the section, it is that notwithstanding anything in this Act or notwithstanding any rule of law, the unfortunate accused can be tried again and can pay for his own retrial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no sense of justice, no sense of equity or no sense of consideration of rights in a section such as this.  If the Minister could quote to us the case of A, B, C or D in which that provision would have been necessary, then the House could consider it and say: &ldquo;Is it right that we should put this in?&rdquo; But everything here in this Bill is being pushed to what I might call a logical conclusion based on the forms of words rather than on the principles of justice or the rights of an accused person or anything else.  The Minister says: &ldquo;Is there anything wrong in sending a man back for trial where the proceedings have been quashed because they were entirely illegal?&rdquo;  Is there anything right in doing it?  I want to go on that basis.  I want to <Col N="92" /> see if there is anything right or anything fair about it when the whole proceedings have been found to be illegal and you simply quash them.  If they are illegal, they are a nullity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not logical to have a second one if the first is illegal and really no trial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person has been charged, sent forward for trial, brought before a court-martial, found guilty and sentenced, and if the proceedings have been sent to the confirming authority and the confirming authority has examined them and confirmed them and subsequently the Minister discovers that the proceedings were illegal, from any point of view, of fair play, equity or justice, that would be the end of it; but no, in so far as military law is concerned the Minister makes an Order quashing the whole proceedings and he may order the accused to be tried again.  Of course, the Minister knows that there have been some encroachments on the position that was maintained for many years, that if you were tried you cannot be put in peril again.  That has been very fundamental, that you should not be put in peril a second time.  It has been a principle of law, and apparently a principle of military law in this country for the last 30 years, and now we propose to do away with it.  If we propose to do away with it, as I have said, we ought to have grounds submitted to us for doing away with it.  The same thing would apply outside.  One can say in regard to any person tried outside that if the proceedings have been found to be illegal why should he not be tried again.  The Minister and his advisers can say that.  They may say that it is entirely wrong that he should escape because something went wrong with the trial and the trial was defective. But every person who has been concerned with justice and with rights and with the protection of the citizens says that, having put him in peril, if the State has gone wrong the citizen must not be subjected to the same procedure and to the same trial again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a case where the Court of Criminal Appeal directs a new trial in a case <Col N="93" /> in which they are authorised by law to do so, and only in such a case, they try to soften the position as much as they can by providing that all the expenses and costs of fighting that retrial are to be paid by the State.  That enables an accused person, even though in the previous trial he was on his own, to have solicitor, junior counsel, senior counsel, and to have those paid by the State for defending him.  There is no such provision here, no right given to him, no protection given to him.  It simply says that if the Minister quashes it where the whole thing is illegal then he may order him to be retried although that retrial may offend any rule of law that exists in this country and may, in fact, be contrary to the provisions of this Act.</P>
    <P>We are building a pyramid right from the beginning of the Bill right up, rather like an inverted pyramid, with encroachments on rights that officers and soldiers had up to the present, and the Minister has not in any one instance been able to give concrete examples that would justify the line that he is taking.  I think that where, as in this case, fundamental principles are interfered with, and rights in law abrogated, at least the House should be given the reasons for that, and reasons based on experience, and the experience justified by cases; and if there have been no cases to justify what is alleged to be our experience then there is no case for attempting to interfere with the law as it stands at the moment.  The more I study this Bill the more convinced I am that it is a very bad Bill, that when it is law, as apparently it will be very soon, the officer and the soldier will be in a worse position than they have been for many years, that all the provisions that were in the old Act giving them rights and amenities and ensuring that they would be dealt with fairly and justly are being stolen away by this new Bill.  This is one of the encroachments, one of the rights that have been stolen from them.</P>
    <P>I cannot argue against the Minister when he simply says: &ldquo;We have considered this matter.  We think we should have these powers.  The legal authorities think we should have them. Some legal members of the Attorney-General's <Col N="94" /> staff think we should have these powers&rdquo;.  It is impossible to argue against that, particularly to argue in a docile House that does not give two hoots what is done with the Army.  I can only hope that when this Bill reaches the Seanad somebody up there will see these sections, particularly this section, that are encroaching on fundamental rights of officers and soldiers, and will be able to make a much better case than I am making for them here in this House, and will have more support for the case they are making against these encroachments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 172:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 100, between lines 23 and 24, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a sentence of imprisonment or any higher punishment passed by a court-martial has been confirmed the person sentenced may within 14 days after the promulgation to him of the sentence appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against his conviction.</P>
      <P>(2)  The appeal under this section shall be made in accordance with rules of the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
      <P>(3)  The appeal shall be heard and determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the same way as an appeal from the Central Criminal Court, but the court shall not interfere with the sentence of court-martial unless it quashes the conviction appealed against.</P>
      <P>(4)  The Court of Criminal Appeal shall have no jurisdiction to hear an appeal against the sentence only of a court-martial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is, perhaps, the last of the major amendments.  It proposes to give a right of appeal to a person convicted and sentenced by court-martial.  It is, as I say, a major amendment and I hope to be able to justify it although I have no hope that the Minister will accept it.  In the course of the Report Stage of the Bill up to the present, and in the different other stages in the House and in Special Committee, we were told about the wonderful research that had been made into Canadian military law and British naval law and, in actual fact, at one period of desperation we were brought into the Police Forces (Amalgamation) Act. <Col N="96" /> We were told that the Department of Defence had studied everything up to the moment in all possible countries to try to get for us the very best Defence Forces Bill they could, but one provision, one modern development, based on experience, they were not anxious to have, and that is a development that has occurred in Great Britain in recent years where&mdash;I think it was the Labour Government but I am not sure &mdash;the British Government brought in a provision whereby a soldier or officer sentenced by court-martial would have a right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against his conviction. That is a development that has been advocated for many years by persons interested in military law everywhere, that there should be a right of appeal against conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal, which is the highest court that deals with criminal appeals in this country and, similarly, in other countries.</P>
    <P>Although the British Army Act is substantially the same as our 1923 Act was up to the moment, and although there is not in it the sort of thing we discussed on the last section&mdash;this matter of a quashing order and of a retrial; where there is quashing, it is quashing and that is the end of it&mdash; they have provided an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I have been very anxious for many years that we should have such a right here.</P>
    <P>I think it is a valuable right to have for many reasons.  It keeps a court-martial on its toes, as it were.  No person on a court-martial, certainly no legal officer of a court-martial or no judge-advocate, if there was a right to have the proceedings examined by the Court of Criminal Appeal, would do anything slovenly or carelessly in regard to the proceedings and he certainly would keep himself in touch with law and the developments of law. It would be an additional protection for an accused person if he felt that he were dealt with wrongly, to have the right to go to the Court of Criminal Appeal and say to that court: &ldquo;I want you to examine this case and to declare that I have been legally convicted&rdquo;. No one would imagine that there could be any objection to that, particularly <Col N="97" /> in a Bill where the authorities have gone out to crucify the officer and soldier all the way.  I make no apology for using that expression to describe what is in this Bill in regard to the officer and the soldier.  I have dealt with his pay.  I have been dealing with his punishment and now in the matter of his trial, even where it may be illegal, they are going to get him again. Where it was a question of putting in something that might be beneficial or helpful to him, there was a stone-wall attitude against its insertion.  Now they want to keep their whole procedure in the dark, to keep it away from the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    <P>A few sections back we dealt with the proposal to hear these cases <i>in camera</i>, to keep the public out.  They certainly want to give no opportunity to the accused person to have his case examined by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  A Deputy or even a citizen reading the amendment might say: &ldquo;Well, what does the Court of Criminal Appeal know about military matters?  They are not interested in discipline; they would not know anything about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want the House to know the specific right of appeal that I want to have incorporated in the Bill.  The first part of the amendment reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a sentence of imprisonment or any higher punishment passed by a court-martial has been confirmed, the person sentenced may within 14 days after the promulgation to him of the sentence appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against his conviction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to point out where that leads us.  In the case of an officer, it eliminates any appeal where the sentence is a reprimand, a severe reprimand, a fine not exceeding £25, a forfeiture of seniority of rank, dismissal from the Defence Forces or dismissal with ignominy from the Defence Forces.  I would not give the Court of Criminal Appeal the right to investigate any of these things, but where, in the case of an officer, the sentence is one of imprisonment, which is considered to be something in the nature of the punishment imposed by a civil court on citizens, of penal <Col N="98" /> servitude or of death, it provides that he will have a right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, but for nothing less than these.</P>
    <P>Similarly in the case of a soldier, where he is sentenced to imprisonment, to penal servitude or to death, he will have a right of appeal, but will have no right of appeal where the sentence is detention, discharged with ignominy from the Defence Forces, discharge from the Defence Forces, reduction in rank, a fine, a forfeiture, a severe reprimand or a reprimand, so that there is no question of sending to the Court of Criminal Appeal any case where the punishment is purely military. The right of appeal is given only in cases of imprisonment, penal servitude or death.</P>
    <P>A citizen of this country&mdash;whether he be a soldier, a sailor or an airforce man, whether he be a private or a general, or whether he is an ordinary citizen&mdash;if he is sentenced to imprisonment by any tribunal, be it the Circuit Criminal Court, the Central Criminal Court or a court-martial, will have the right to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the conviction which resulted in the sentence.  I do not want anyone to ask what would the Court of Criminal Appeal have to do with courts-martial, with discipline.  They are not asked to have anything to do with courts-martial or discipline.  They are simply asked to examine into the proceedings of a court which has imposed sentence of imprisonment, of penal servitude or of death.</P>
    <P>The next sub-section provides that an appeal under the section shall be made in accordance with rules of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  That is a formal sub-section, although it is only in fact a sentence, because in every case where there is a right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal makes the rules&mdash;the simple rules about lodgment, about the number of copies and matters that are purely domestic, as it were, in so far as that court is concerned.</P>
    <P>The third sub-section says that the appeal shall be heard and determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the same way as an appeal from the Central Criminal Court, but the court <Col N="99" /> shall not interfere with the sentence, unless it quashes the conviction appealed against.  In other words, the appeal is against conviction only.  If the Court of Criminal Appeal find that the conviction is illegal, they quash it, but if they do not, if they find that the conviction is all right, they do not interfere with the sentence.  In this I am again endeavouring to provide for as little interference as possible by the Court of Criminal Appeal, while having it there to protect the person who feels that he has been, and who, in fact has been, illegally convicted.</P>
    <P>Then sub-section (4)  provides that the Court of Criminal Appeal shall have no jurisdiction to hear an appeal against the sentence only of a court-martial. The position of the Court of Criminal Appeal so far as this amendment is concerned is that its duty is only to examine the proceedings to ascertain whether a man was legally and lawfully convicted.  If he has been legally and lawfully convicted, it would be no business of the court to say whether the sentence was excessive or not, because different considerations, as has been stated here, must apply to military punishments from those which apply to punishments in the ordinary criminal courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot complain, and nobody can complain, that the insertion of a section such as that in any way interferes unduly, improperly or unnecessarily with the jurisdiction and functions of courts-martial and certainly it does not in any way interfere with the maintenance of discipline, because discipline has to be based on law and it cannot be based on illegal decisions of courts-martial. If there is an illegal decision of a court-martial, the sooner it is disposed of the better, and when an accused person feels that he has been illegally convicted, he has the right within 14 days of confirmation to have his case brought before the Court of Criminal Appeal and there examined and dealt with.</P>
    <P>I think that would be an invaluable protection and not only would it be an invaluable protection but it would ensure that the rule of law prevailed.  I do not want to be met with the answer <Col N="100" /> that this would be entering the domain of the military.  It is not entering the domain of the military&mdash;it is entering the domain of justice.  Let justice be done, somebody has said, though the heavens fall, and neither the Minister nor anybody else could have any objection to an examination of a conviction, if that examination results in the quashing of an obviously illegal finding.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured, this being, as I think it is, the last of the major amendments, to put the case for this right of appeal on grounds of justice and I propose, when we resume, to say a few words in regard to the exercise of that right in those countries where it has been given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill was circulated with a fairly detailed explanatory memorandum which will have informed Deputies of its main purposes.  These main purposes are threefold.  First, the Bill is necessary to authorise an increase from the present statutory limit of £65,000,000 odd to £100,000,000 in the expenditure which the E.S.B. may incur for capital purposes other than the rural electrification scheme; secondly, to authorise the board to obtain moneys required for these capital purposes and for the performance of its functions generally from sources other than the Central Fund and, thirdly, to authorise an increase from £8,000,000 to £16,000,000 in the statutory limit of advances which may be made from the <Col N="101" /> Central Fund to the board for the rural electrification scheme.</P>
      <P>Bills to amend the limit of capital advances to the E.S.B. have been submitted from time to time.  It has been the practice of the House to deal with the capital requirements of the E.S.B. upon that basis and in that respect this Bill is no different from any other. The main change which it proposes is that contemplated in regard to the raising of money.  It proposes to enable the board to raise capital for its development purposes other than from the Central Fund by the issue of stocks to the public.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains a provision for the exclusion of the board from the application of the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893 and provides for an increase in the maximum pensions which may be paid on retirement to whole-time members of the board.  The remaining provisions of the Bill which are complementary to the main financial provisions deal with such matters as State guarantee and underwriting of issues of securities by the board, the use of sinking funds which will be established for redemption of such securities and the investment of surplus moneys which the board may have on hands at any time.</P>
      <P>Under the Electricity Acts passed from 1927 to 1952 the total amount of advances available to the board is £58,945,000 for its general purposes and £8,000,000 for rural electrification. There are two other sources of finance available to the board&mdash;I will refer to them again later&mdash;but the Central Fund has been the main source and, in fact, the use of these other sources of finance merely postpones demands on the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of this Bill which provides for an increase in the authorised total of the board's capital expenditure is also designed to consolidate the fianancial provisions of all previous Electricity (Supply) Acts (including the financial provisions of the Shannon Electricity Act of 1925, as amended) and of this Bill.  That has been done not only to make it clear that the figure of £100,000,000 now proposed is inclusive of the amounts authorised under all previous electricity legislation, but also to give the House and <Col N="102" /> the public a clear picture of the various sources from which the board has obtained finance in the past and of the additional borrowing powers which it is now proposed to confer on the board. I think that in view of the magnitude of the board's undertaking and the large proportion of national capital expenditure which its development programme will absorb for a considerable time ahead, it is desirable that the House and the public should have as much information as practicable on the board's general financial position, of the nature of its development programme and on the methods by which it has been financed in the past and will be financed in the future.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to deal first in some detail with the various existing sources of finance as set out in sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Bill and to explain the need for the new programme before dealing with the new borrowing powers proposed in Sections 3 and 4 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general financial position, first, there is the sum of £6,030,066 which is described as the expenditure on the Shannon works for which the board became liable under the Act of 1927.  That sum represents the agreed liability accepted by the board in respect of the Shannon scheme.  It was the Minister for Industry and Commerce who was authorised by the Electricity Act of 1925 to construct the Shannon scheme.  The moneys required for its construction were made available out of the Central Fund.  The Shannon works comprise the main works at Arnacrusha, as well as transformers, distribution systems and lands forming portions of the Shannon works which were transferred to the board under the Act of 1927.  In law, however, these properties remain vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce and it is now proposed to invest them in the board.  Under the 1927 Act, the board assumed liability for the repayment of the sum and, therefore, it is included in the £100,000,000 as being part of the capital expenditure incurred by the board.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is a sum of £38,094,570, which represents the total of repayable advances made to the <Col N="103" /> board from the Central Fund for purposes other than rural electrification in the period from the establishment of the board up to the 31st December last.  That amount has been expended on the various works which the board was authorised to undertake under the Electricity Acts.  I may mention that of the total liability of £44,000,000 odd in respect of these advances and the Shannon works liability the board has already repaid £1,961,515, but for the purposes of this Bill no account is taken of such repayments in calculating the authorised total of capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs (c) and (d) of sub-section (2) deal with the two other sources of finance available to the board, namely, the board's depreciation reserves and the superannuation funds.  Under the Act of 1927 the board is under a statutory obligation so to adjust its charges as to make adequate provision not only for its day-to-day expenses but also for the repayment of moneys borrowed by it and for the renewal or replacement of its wasting assets. In accordance with that obligation to provide for the renewal or replacement of its assets, the board sets aside each year out of its revenue sums which, accumulating over the life of these assets, will, it is estimated, be sufficient to provide for their replacement when the assets have reached the end of their useful life.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1941 the board was authorised to invest these reserve allocations in trustee securities or in such other securities as might be approved by the Minister for Finance. In fact, however, the board has not availed itself of that power but has used these reserves for the provision of new capital assets according as these were authorised under successive electricity Acts.  In other words, the board's depreciation reserves have been invested in its own undertaking. That practice has advantages both from the point of view of the board and of the Exchequer.  From the board's point of view it is more advantageous to invest these funds in new capital works rather than in securities which might be liable to fluctuate in value and which would probably give <Col N="104" /> a net return somewhat less than the board would have to pay for advances from the Central Fund.  It has also relieved the Exchequer, temporarily, at least, of demands which might otherwise have been made on it if these funds had not been available to the board.</P>
    <P>It will, of course, be appreciated that all sums used in that manner must be included in the authorised total of the board's capital expenditure at any particular time and paragraph (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Bill provides accordingly.  At 31st December, 1953, the amount of these reserves which had been temporarily utilised to finance new capital projects other than rural electrification was £10,845,342.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) of sub-section (2) deals with borrowings from the superannuation funds.  The Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act of 1942 provided for the introduction of superannuation schemes on a contributory basis for the board's employees and for the management of the superannuation funds by trustees. Under Section 8 of that Act the trustees were authorised to lend to the board such sums as they thought proper to lend and the board was authorised to borrow from these funds for any purposes arising out of the performance of its functions.  These borrowings are repayable at 90 days' notice on either side.  The provision is mutually advantageous.  For the trustees it provides a convenient and readily realisable form of investment, the value of which remains stable and for the board it provides a convenient additional source of finance.  At 31st December, 1953, the total amount borrowed by the board from superannuation fund trustees was £1,546,200.</P>
    <P>Summarised, therefore, the present position is that: (a) excluding the Shannon works liability, the authorised limit of capital expenditure is £66,945,000 of which £8,000,000 is for rural electrification; (b) the board has available to it three sources of finance, namely, the Central Fund, its own depreciation reserves and the superannuation funds; (c) at 31st December, 1953, the total of the board's borrowings from these sources was £58,486,112 <Col N="105" /> (including £8,000,000 for rural electrification) or about £8,500,000 less than the total statutory provision of £66,945,000.</P>
    <P>The difference between the amount authorised and the total of the amounts borrowed is due to the time-lag between commitments and expenditure which is inherent in the nature of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>The appendix to the White Paper which has been circulated to Deputies with the Bill, gives a comprehensive picture of the existing installed capacity and of the board's development programme, including that part for which advances have already been authorised and which provides for an increase in installed capacity from the present figure of 377,000 kilowatts to 624,000 kilowatts; these new stations will be brought into commission in the period up to 31st March, 1958.  The new programme which is outlined in Part III of the appendix to the White Paper provides for a further increase of 413,000 kilowatts, bringing the total capacity at 31st March, 1961, to 1,037,000 kilowatts, and part of this new programme will proceed simultaneously with the existing programme.</P>
    <P>This new programme has two aspects.  The primary object is, of course, to provide additional generating capacity to meet the growth in demand for electricity.  The estimates of increased demand over the period to 1961 have been based on the board's experience of a doubling in demand in each period of five or six years.  I am satisfied that there is considerable scope for development in the production and consumption of electricity in this country in which, despite the considerable expansion which has taken place, we still lag considerably behind other European countries with somewhat similar economic conditions. The results of a survey recently carried out by O.E.E.C. show that of the 17 O.E.E.C. countries, Ireland was in 15th place in terms both of installed generating capacity and production of electricity.  If we are to maintain, much less to improve, our position in the increasingly competitive conditions which we may expect to experience in our export markets, it is vital that <Col N="106" /> we should improve our productive efficiency and the measure of that efficiency will depend largely on the extent to which we apply modern methods to our productive processes. Electricity is recognised as one of the cheapest and most easily utilised forms of energy both in industrial and agricultural processes, and from the point of view of the national economy it has the further advantage that a large proportion of our requirements can be produced from native resources which we have in comparative abundance.  I have emphasised to the board that its efforts should be directed not merely towards providing for the normal growth in demand, but that it should endeavour to stimulate demand by means of sales propaganda and demonstrations.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the new programme is that it is based almost entirely on the use of our native resources.  It will be observed that the emphasis is almost entirely on turf-fired and hydro stations.  In so far as the turf-fired stations are concerned, the new programme may be regarded as complementary to the Bord na Móna development programme which I outlined to the House last summer when the Turf Development Bill, 1953, was before the House prior to its enactment. When this co-ordinated programme has been completed the electricity generating stations fired with turf or native fuel will use annually at least 400,000 tons of machine-won turf, 120,000 tons of hand-won turf and over 2,500,000 tons of milled peat, as well as 45,000 to 50,000 tons of Arigna coal.  The annual average output of all our native fuel stations will be over 1,500 million units which compares with an estimated total output of 1,300 million units from all the board's stations in the current year.  Indeed, if past experience is any guide, these estimates may be exceeded. The requirements of the two existing turf-fired stations at Allenwood and Clonsast were originally estimated at 300,000 tons per annum and the annual average output at 225,000,000 units of electricity.  In the year ended 31st March, 1953, fuel consumption was 395,600 tons and the output of electricity was 325,454,000 units.  In the <Col N="107" /> year ending 31st August, 1954, Bord na Móna has contracted to supply 410,000 tons to these two stations.  There is also the possibility (mentioned in the appendix to the White Paper) that some of the additional capacity required may also be based on turf instead of on imported fuel.  We will, therefore, have at least 63 per cent. and possibly more of our total installed capacity in native fuel or in hydro stations in 1961 and our dependence on imported fuels for our electricity requirements will be considerably reduced.  In view of our experience during the emergency, and the increasing importance of balance of payments considerations I need not emphasise the desirability of this development.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the Lanesboro' station and the four small stations for hand-won turf to be built in Kerry, Clare, Galway and Donegal, all the new turf-fired stations will use milled peat.  The considerations on which this decision were based have already been outlined in the House. Briefly, they are that the necessary preliminary development work on bogs, being less elaborate, can be done more quickly; milled peat can be won by mechanical means and requires less man-power than sod turf, and it can be burned at a much higher moisture content, 55 per cent., than in the case of sod turf, which is 30 per cent.  It is, therefore, a much cheaper fuel than sod turf.  Deputies may be interested to learn that the board has already placed orders for three of the boilers which will use milled peat in the Ferbane station.  This station, when completed, will be not only the largest in the E.S.B. system but the largest turf-fired station in Western Europe and will have an annual average output of 405,000,000 units.</P>
    <P>As regards the four small stations, I think it should be emphasised that the primary object in establishing these was to provide an outlet in the areas concerned for hand-won turf. Normally the construction of stations of such a small size and with such a limited rate of consumption would not be considered as economic.  In fact, these stations are directed more to <Col N="108" /> serve a social than an economic purpose.</P>
    <P>As explained in the White Paper, the total cost of this programme, excluding rural electrification, is estimated at £53,500,000, and a further £1,750,000 will be required to cover the increased cost of the existing programme, that is to say, the increase in the present estimate of its cost over that which was current when the programme was originally approved.  If full provision were made now, it would be necessary to increase the authorised limit of capital expenditure from the present limit of £65,000,000 odd to approximately £120,000,000.  It has been decided, however, that as an interim measure, it will be sufficient to increase the authorised limit to £100,000,000.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that this will be sufficient to cover the cumulative total of the board's capital expenditure whether actually incurred or for which contracts wil have been entered into in the period up to 31st March, 1956, but excluding capital works which will at that time be still in the planning stage and will not yet have become the subject of contractual commitments.  It will be necessary to make further legislative provision before 31st March, 1956, to increase the authorised limit of capital expenditure so as to provide for the completion of the programme. The House will regard it as desirable that provision should not be made too far ahead, so that it will have an opportunity periodically of reviewing the progress of the work on measures of this kind.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I wish to refer concerns the proposals for the financing of that programme.  I would inform the House that since its establishment, the board has financed its operations from three sources&mdash;from the Central Fund, from its depreciation reserve and from the superannuation funds&mdash;and from these only.  These sources will still be available to the board but in Sections 3 and 4 of this Bill it is proposed to confer new borrowing powers on the board. Section 3 authorises the board to borrow temporarily.  Temporary borrowing is a normal feature of commercial undertakings and its convenience <Col N="109" /> and advantages need not be stressed.  Other statutory bodies such as Bord na Móna and C.I.E. already possess this power.  This provision will empower the board not only to obtain overdraft accommodation which may be required from time to time to meet ordinary revenue expenditure such as salaries and wages but also to obtain short-term loans for capital purposes from such sources of finance as may be available.  The only limit on borrowing for revenue expenditure will be that approved from time to time by the responsible Ministers.  Borrowings for capital purposes will, of course, count towards the authorised limit of capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The principal new borrowing power is that contained in Section 4, which authorises the board to borrow money by the issue of its own securities and thus enables it to obtain its capital requirements in future from sources other than the Central Fund which as I have made clear has heretofore been the main source.  The total of £25,000,000 which the board is being authorised to borrow under sub-section (4) of Section 4 is estimated to be sufficient to meet the board's actual expenditure on projects other than rural electrification in the period 1st April, 1954 to 31st March, 1956.  The terms and conditions of such issues will be subject to the approval of the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Finance and the uses to which the moneys so obtained may be applied will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. These provisions are designed to provide an assurance that the board's development programme will be on the general lines which the Government has approved and that there will be no departure from this programme without the approval of the responsible Minister.  In view of the magnitude of the proposed programme and the large proportion of national capital investment which it will absorb, the Government regards it as essential that such an assurance should be given in statutory form.  From the investor's point of view I can see distinct advantages in the existence of a provision which will ensure that the programme for <Col N="110" /> which he will be asked to subscribe has ministerial approval.</P>
    <P>I think it will be agreed that the board's undertaking has now developed to the stage at which it should be possible for it to obtain its capital requirements for projects other than rural electrification from the investing public and that it need no longer rely on the Central Fund save in exceptional circumstances.  I will explain later the reasons for the exclusion of rural electrification.</P>
    <P>The financial administration of the board has been satisfactory and it has succeeded in complying with the statutory obligations imposed on it to pay its way and make proper provision for the repayment of its borrowings and for the depreciation of its wasting assets.  Its liabilities are amply covered by its fixed and liquid assets and it enjoys the advantage of being the sole producer in a market which is constantly expanding and in which the scope for future expansion is almost unlimited.  The board's capital requirements will be considerable for some years ahead, but in view of the growth in demand which has been consistently experienced and which may be expected to continue the investor can be assured that the moneys which he will be asked to subscribe will be remuneratively employed.  A further attraction is that these E.S.B. securities will be trustee securities and that issues of them by the board may be underwritten by the Minister for Finance.  Section 9 of the Bill empowers the Minister for Finance to guarantee the board's securities.</P>
    <P>The financing of electricity development from sources other than the Exchequer is the normal practice in most European countries, in some of which, of course, private enterprise plays a considerable part.  One of the reasons which made it necessary for the State to assume responsibility for electricity development in this country was that we lacked a tradition of industrial investment and of large industrial enterprise to which a task of such magnitude could be entrusted.  Since then, however, thanks to our industrial development, we have succeeded in gradually building up an increasing <Col N="111" /> investment in native enterprises, some of which are heavily capitalised and operated on a large scale.  I am convinced that there is still available a large volume of savings which are not productively employed due largely to this lack of a tradition of investment, and I am hopeful that some of these savings can be attracted by the board's issues.  I have in mind particularly the ever-growing number of consumers, particularly in rural areas, many of whom will have much more direct interest in the E.S.B. undertaking than previously because they will have constantly before them tangible evidence of its activities.</P>
    <P>The issue by the board of its own securities has other advantages.  To the extent that the board can obtain its capital requirements from sources other than the Central Fund, the Government will be correspondingly relieved of the necessity for providing for such requirements in its own issues of securities to the public.  The House is aware that the capital requirements of the E.S.B. represented a considerable proportion of the moneys raised by the State for investment purposes.  It will also make available on our rather limited security market a new and attractive type of security which it is hoped will attract an additional class of investor who might not normally invest in State issues but would be prepared to invest in E.S.B. issues.  The type of securities to be issued will, of course, be governed by the statutory position of the board which does not permit for instance the issue of stock with voting rights, but the board will nevertheless have considerable freedom of action, and its issues should be of the type to make a wide appeal to investors.</P>
    <P>In future, therefore, the operations of the board will be financed by long-term borrowings from the public and by temporary borrowing from other sources of finance including the board's own reserves and its superannuation funds.  In connection with temporary borrowing of this type there is in paragraph (f) of sub-section (2) of Section 2 a proviso, the necessity for which may have to be explained. From what I have already <Col N="112" /> said it will be clear that all temporary borrowing which is used for capital purposes other than rural electrification must count immediately towards the authorised total of capital expenditure.  Deputies will appreciate that the use of borrowings from the superannuation funds or of the board's reserves for capital purposes is really just another form of temporary borrowing. Superannuation funds borrowings are repayable at 90 days' notice, and the reserves must be replenished when it becomes necessary to replace the assets for which they were built up.  The object of the proviso is to ensure that if and when it becomes necessary to repay such borrowings&mdash; by funding them in long-term issues for example&mdash;new borrowings which are intended solely for the purpose of such repayments will not count against the authorised total.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that Central Fund advances would continue to be available to the board and Section 5 of the Bill provides for the making of such advances to the board by the Minister for Finance within the authorised limit.  I should explain, however, that the sole purpose of this provision is to ensure that the board will have available to it at all times the moneys which it will require so that the development programme may go ahead unhampered.  The Central Fund will, however, be only a secondary source of finance and it is intended that in future advances will be sought from the Exchequer only for the purpose of tiding the board over periods during which it might not be thought convenient or desirable to seek capital from other sources.  The Central Fund will, therefore, be the lender of last resort and is unlikely to be called on to any great extent. During the course of my remarks I indicated that in the various figures I mentioned the cost of the rural electrification scheme was omitted and that, in the matter of raising capital from the board by the issue of securities to the public, rural electrification is also excluded.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for an increase from £8,000,000 to £16,000,000 in the total of advances which may be made for the purpose of the rural electrification <Col N="113" /> scheme from the Central Fund. The reason why the rural electrification scheme will continue to be financed by the Central Fund is that it is a service which is being subsidised and will continue to be subsidised by the Government and it was thought preferable, therefore, that it should continue to be financed exclusively by the State.  Aside from the fact that it would obviously be inappropriate to seek money from investors for a subsidised service the continuance of the present arrangement is more convenient and simple from the administrative point of view.</P>
    <P>In the matter of rural electrification, the House should be informed that there have been two important developments in that sphere of the board's activities.  The first is that the basis on which the order of priority of areas for development under the scheme was determined has been altered.  I found that, in practice, the former system under which priority was determined solely on the basis of the ratio of fixed charge revenue to capital cost led to inequities in some cases because it did not give sufficient recognition to the percentage of the residents in the area willing to accept supply.  I found that cases existed in which there was no prospect of development taking place at an early date despite the fact that a very large percentage of the people of the area were willing to take supply while areas with a relatively low percentage of acceptances were being developed simply because their financial returns happened to be better.  I discussed the matter with the board and, as a result of our discussions, a new system of selection has now been introduced which gives due weight to the percentage of acceptances in each area. The effect of the new system is that in future the prospects of an area being selected will depend to a great extent on the number of residents in the area who agree to take supply.  I think the House will agree that it is only equitable that those areas which show the greatest enthusiasm for the scheme and in which the greater proportion of the population want the scheme should be the first to benefit from the extension of the scheme.  The <Col N="114" /> revised basis of selection will not affect the ultimate cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The second and perhaps most important development is that the rate of construction on the scheme has been accelerated by 50 per cent. and that a still further increase of 50 per cent. on this rate of development will commence to operate in the very near future.  Up to recently the rate of construction was retarded by shortages of materials and as a result the number of areas completed in any one year did not exceed 49.  The supply position has now improved and the number employed on the scheme has been increased.  At 31st January, 1954, the number employed on the scheme was 1,800 as compared with 1,220 on 31st January, 1953, and the board estimates that this will enable the number of areas completed in each year to be increased to 75.  As soon as this has been achieved a further increase is planned to bring the number of areas completed to 100 annually.  At 31st December, 1953, 265 areas had been completed, construction work was proceeding in 30 areas and preparations for commencing work in a further 27 areas were under way.  The total of 322 areas developed or in course of development at that date represents about 40 per cent. of the total number of areas and the board now hopes that it will be possible to complete the scheme in about five years from now.</P>
    <P>The Government, as the House knows, attaches particular importance to the development of rural electrification and I can assure the Dáil that nothing will be left undone to bring the scheme to completion as quickly as possible.  The fact that the sum now being made available to cover the period up to 31st March, 1956, is equal to the total amount authorised since 1945 is sufficient proof of this resolve. I have, moreover, told the board that if any difficulties are experienced which could be solved by Government intervention there should be no hesitation in approaching me for assistance.</P>
    <P>There are some other provisions to which I should refer.  Section 17 provides for the exclusion of the board from the application of the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893. Legislation to amend this Act is at <Col N="115" /> present under consideration by the Government but it has been decided that the position in so far as it affects statutory bodies such as the E.S.B. should be dealt with in legislation dealing specifically with these bodies. Advantage is being taken of the enactment of this Bill to provide for the exclusion of the board from the application of the Act.</P>
    <P>I think that the only other provision to which I need refer at this stage is Section 19, which provides for an increase from 20 forty-eighths to 24 forty-eighths of salary on retirement in the maximum pension which may be paid to whole-time members of the board.  Each of the three whole-time members has now service of over 23 years and I think it will be agreed that they should receive credit for their service in excess of 20 years sufficient to permit the payment of a pension to them equal to half of their salaries on retirement.</P>
    <P>The programme for which approval is now sought is the largest ever undertaken by the board, and taken in conjunction with the co-ordinated programme being undertaken simultaneously by Bord na Móna, represents the greatest and most ambitious programme of national development which has ever been undertaken in this country.  Its importance, not merely in the economic field but also in the social field, cannot be exaggerated. From now onwards, the greater part of the activities of both boards will be in areas which, because of their remote and desolate state, were in danger of being regarded as permanent &ldquo;distressed areas&rdquo; which were not only incapable of making any contribution to our national wealth but were likely to constitute a permanent burden on the whole national economy. When this programme has been completed these areas will be one of our most valuable national assets.  In the 60-70,000 acres of bog which will be developed for electricity production, about 4,000 men will be permanently employed and about 7,000 will be employed in the peak periods of production.</P>
    <P>The construction of the stations and <Col N="116" /> of the transmission and distribution systems which will radiate from them will also provide considerable employment and, when all the native fuel and hydro stations are operating, about 1,000 men, many of them skilled, will be permanently employed in the stations themselves.  All this additional employment will be available in areas where opportunities for productive employment have hitherto been almost non-existent and in which depopulation and emigration have been the chief features.  The construction of the stations will also facilitate the extension of rural electrification to these areas and provide a much-needed amenity which might not otherwise be made available for some considerable time.  There is no doubt, therefore, that the effect on social and economic conditions in these areas will be considerable.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that the House will join with me in paying a tribute to the directors and staff of the E.S.B. for the energy and enthusiasm with which they have tackled and overcome the problems and difficulties which they have experienced in the design, construction and operation of the generating stations and of the transmission and rural distribution network.  I think that we can take considerable pride in the fact that all these new stations will be designed by the board's own staff without any outside assistance. The success which they have already achieved is a tribute not only to their professional skill but to their appreciation of the national importance of their work.  It is these qualities which have made the board one of our greatest national undertakings and which will, in the future, enhance the good reputation it already enjoys.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this Bill is essential to enable the board to go ahead with its task of developing further our national energy resources and of bringing to the rural community a modern amenity and an important aid to increased production.  I, therefore, confidently recommend it for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister sits down, I would like to ask this question: <Col N="117" /> what amount of money known as repayable capital has been advanced to the board up-to-date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave that figure, Deputy.  The total amount authorised under various Acts to date for advances to the board is £58,945,000 for general purposes and £8,000,000 for rural electrification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>What amount of that £58,000,000 is known as repayable capital?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>All of it is repayable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>But the money advanced for rural electrification is not looked upon as repayable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The £8,000,000 I am referring to is capital advanced to the board.  In addition to the capital advanced the board gets a subvention from voted moneys of an equivalent amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The measure before the House brings to an end one period of development associated with the E.S.B.  I believe that the E.S.B. has been a unique success and that the development which began with what was then known as the Shannon scheme reflects credit on all those associated with it.  It reflects credit on its sponsors, on the board, and on the administrative and technical staff who have since developed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to allow the board in future to make its own financial arrangements is one which may be welcomed.  In fact, I believe it is a decision which might have been implemented before now.  The E.S.B. is probably the greatest example&mdash;in fact I think it can be said without qualification that it is the greatest example&mdash;of State investment in this country and has to its credit the best return of State investment for any undertaking of this nature.  Some years ago an examination of a return of State investments was made and while the return showed a profit, if the E.S.B. venture were excluded from it I believe the profit would have vanished as well.  So that from every point of view the money invested in the development of our resources which <Col N="118" /> has been made in the case of the E.S.B. has benefited the community as well as reflecting credit on those who are responsible for it.</P>
    <P>The development of electricity supply which the Minister referred to was in a unique way based on native resources.  There are in the provisions contained in this Bill references to stations other than the hydro stations and the peat stations, but in the main the scheme which was developed in the beginning under the Shannon scheme &mdash;subsequently acquired by the E.S.B. and extended in other schemes&mdash;is entirely based on the development of native resources.  That in itself is a most desirable development, one which has meant not only power and light but substantial extension of employment.</P>
    <P>The references which the Minister has made to the financial provisions and which have been fairly fully set out in the White Paper go into figures and details which enable Deputies and the people in the country generally to get a full picture of the total development up to date and a picture of the proposed development for the future. The success which has attended the development of the electrical supply system has meant throughout the country reforms of a type that were only dreamt of before.  It has meant in rural areas light and power, but it has brought with it one of the aims of national policy, and that is to brighten the lives of the people living in these areas and to make life easier for them by providing amenities and the means whereby employment can be provided either directly or indirectly.</P>
    <P>This Bill, which consolidates the financial position and which will enable the board itself to raise money for its own purposes, is, as I said at the beginning, the culmination of the development of the electricity supply system up to the present.  I have no doubt that the success which has attended the development associated with the E.S.B. will continue to attend its extension in the future.  That it should have no difficulty in raising capital for these purposes need not be stressed.  The success which has attended the E.S.B. is recognised <Col N="119" /> throughout the country and is, I think, agreed by all who have watched its development over the years or who have in some way or other taken an interest in the various schemes and have been touched by the effect which the development has meant in all parts of the country and, I think, for all citizens.</P>
    <P>There are no objections now, I think, to the scale of the proposed development.  It was not always so. In the beginning when the E.S.B. was established and when the proposed development was undertaken a great many people thought it was too big for the country and that its rate of development was too great for the demand.  The passing of time and subsequent demand has nullified all the doleful prophecies then made.  The fact is that since the work was commenced, I think in no year&mdash;or certainly only for brief periods&mdash;was the supply adequate to the demand and in recent years the demand has grown on a much larger scale.</P>
    <P>I believe the proposed financial arrangements enshrined in the Bill will meet with the general approval of the House.  The Minister did refer to the fact that in Section 4, which provides for the general borrowing powers of the board, the board would have to get the sanction of the Minister and that that sanction would in itself carry a better guarantee because of the Government authority behind it than if the board had undertaken the proposals on its own.  While in some cases that may be so, the fact that the Government sponsors a particular investment is no guarantee that it will provide any return or an adequate return.  It may be necessary to consider that on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision for a variation in the maximum rate of pension, I believe that every member of the House will welcome that.  The directors of the board, and some of them I believe have been associated with the undertaking from the beginning, deserve the best thanks of the House and of the country.  The staff, both administrative and technical, also are entitled to the highest <Col N="120" /> praise which the House and the country will give them for the magnificent work they have done since the scheme was started almost 30 years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure everyone will agree that the work done by the board is a grand job, and that no more important work could have been undertaken for the country.  I cannot support the method suggested of financing this undertaking in the future.  Neither can I follow Deputy Cosgrave when he says that the financial arrangements in this Bill will meet with the unanimous approval of the House.  He says, as regards the money that is to be borrowed, that the fact that there is a Government guarantee behind it will encourage people to give the necessary money for the electrification of the country. What I want to know is why should we borrow money at a high price if the credit of the Government and of the country is behind the undertaking?  If the credit of the country and the resources of the people are behind it, why should we have to pay interest on the money that is required for the development and electrification of the country?  Deputy Cosgrave says that a change in the financial arrangements is long overdue.  Is it not a fact that we are trying to carry on the same system of financing anything that is worth while for the country?  We use the credit of the country and we pay people interest on the money that they give us on that credit.  We pay it on the credit that belongs to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always been interested in the E.S.B. because of the importance of its undertaking to the country.  I was reading recently the chairman's statement at the last annual meeting.  He pointed out that the gross revenue of the board now was £7,670,103, and that the working expenditure, including depreciation, amounted to £6,592,088. He said that the interest and repayment of capital advances came to £1,566,288, leaving a deficiency of £488,213.  Here we have an undertaking of these dimensions with the backing of the credit of the country behind it.  Why, therefore, should we have a system of having to borrow from the people, while we have the <Col N="121" /> resources of the nation behind the undertaking to give us whatever capital is necessary to develop the electrification of the country?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave says that a change in the financial arrangements is long overdue.  I want to submit to the Minister and to Deputy Cosgrave that there is a big job, which is long overdue, that requires to be done, and that is to adjust the financial backing of the country for its development.  I was looking up some figures recently and I saw where the chairman talked about the rate of annual interest charged by the Minister for Finance on repayable capital advances.  I found that it had been increased from the 7th October, 1952, to 5¼ per cent.  He went on to say that the higher interest rate would, by reason of the high capital expenditure at present in progress, have a material effect on the board's expenses.</P>
    <P>I want to ask Deputy Cosgrave is it necessary for us, for the Government elected by the people, to have to pay 5¼ per cent., or even 2 per cent., on money that is borrowed on the credit of the country by the E.S.B. for the electrification of the country.  The revenue from the undertaking is now over £7,500,000.  I have looked up the accounts, and I find that the total repayable capital advanced to the E.S.B. for the last 23 years amounted to £35,177,557.  Over the same number of years the E.S.B. paid to the Government in interest £15,412,743, which is the equivalent of 44 per cent. of the repayable capital advanced, while over the same number of years the repayments of capital to the Minister for Finance was only £1,687,390, or less than 5 per cent. of the repayable capital. Surely the time has come when we should consider whether that system is to continue.</P>
    <P>This undertaking has been a real salvation for the country.  One may say that it has brought new life into the country.  It provides us with light and heat and other amenities.  Why, therefore, should we have to borrow money on the credit of the country and of the people and pay that high rate of interest on it for the development and electrification of the country?  I should <Col N="122" /> like to hear Deputy Cosgrave later on that, especially when he says that an adjustment of the financial arrangements is long overdue.  Surely since, as he argued, the Government guarantee is behind it, the people will give us the money.  Of course they will.  The banks and others will also give it, because the Government guarantee is there, but why should we pay interest for the money that is required when the credit of the people and the country is behind the undertaking? Why should we allow anyone to charge interest on that credit?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, in my opinion, there is a need for a small body of men to throw a searchlight on the working of the E.S.B.  I could not say enough by way of appreciation of what the E.S.B. has done for our cities and towns.  As far as we are concerned, we want to see its work advance more and more.  We want to see that it is given every co-operation.  I cannot agree, however, that we should be using the credit of the country to enable some people to draw heavy sums of money by way of interest payments on the capital which the board requires.  I have already pointed out that over a period of 23 years a sum of over £15,000,000 has been paid by way of interest which is equivalent to 44 per cent. of the capital invested in the undertaking, while only less than 5 per cent. of the redemption charges were met in the same period.  Does Deputy Cosgrave agree, or will anybody agree that such a system as that should continue to prevail?  What it amounts to is this, that out of every £ that I pay for light or heat in my house, 7/- or 8/-of that £ goes to meet the interest charges on the money borrowed, from whom and for what?  I am not suggesting that a change can take place suddenly.  But something has to be done about that.  I again suggest to the Minister that there is a need at the moment for a small body of capable men to go into these matters, to put a searchlight on the working of the E.S.B. and the method that has been adopted of financing it.  Why should we fear using the credit of the nation to provide the system of electrification that we need for our requirements?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> Are we not guaranteed a refund of that capital as time goes on?  We have power.  We have heating and lighting. We have everything we can ask for. Why then should we allow people to use a creditor country and pay interest on borrowed moneys?  I suggest that before we proceed any further with this Bill we should provide for something better than increased borrowing, with a Government guarantee for the moneys borrowed.  Is it not time we sat down calmly and deliberately and gave to the Central Fund the necessary power to provide whatever moneys are necessary for the electrification of the country?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave supported the Minister in relation to the provision of proper superannuation for the directors of the company.  By all means give the directors decent pensions, but is it not strange that we all seem to forget about the ordinary men who are doing equally important work, the men with the pick and shovel?  Why should we not give them the same consideration when they come to retire?  Is there anything wrong in giving them more than half their wages by way of pension? Why confine it to the directors? Have the directors not good salaries out of which to make provision for themselves when they retire?  I am not objecting to giving them a decent pension, but is it not strange that we should have so much sympathy for the men with the big salaries who can provide for their own future and so little sympathy for the men who are out in the cold and the wet and the muck and slush bringing electricity all over the country?  Is there any reason why we should differentiate as between the directors and the ordinary employee when we come to deal with pensions?  The time has come when we must change our views as to what should be done for the men at the top and for those at the bottom of the scale.  Those at the bottom of the scale are not paid proper wages for the hard work they have to do week in and week out throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I have a strong objection to casual employment in connection with the E.S.B.  It is easy to carry 1,000 men on <Col N="124" /> a week-to-week basis and cast them off whenever the board thinks it can do without them.  The question of security of employment enters into the matter here.  When we have an undertaking in which the wages bill amounts to over £7,000,000 it is time we made up our minds that the credit of the country is sufficiently sound to give the board all the money it requires to electrify the country and provide those services for our people that they are not getting at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's review has been very edifying.  Because the Government intends to underwrite the requirements of the board will the members of this House in future be able to ask the Minister questions in relation to the working of the E.S.B.? Will we be permitted to question changes in the method of charging for electricity?  In the City of Dublin the two-way tariff about which there is some talk at the moment is meeting with a certain opposition.  Those in the cottage type house, flats and so on believe it is the intention to take an average of £1 or £2 from them under the new method of charging.  When questions have been asked in the past the Minister's invariable reply is that he has no function in the matter and cannot interfere.  Are we to have no power to ask the Minister to put a break on the activities of the E.S.B. if that body increases its charges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very proper that there should be electrification and I think some tribute should be paid here to those who laid the foundations of the scheme.  The Minister in his very edifying statement did not mention Deputy McGilligan, the man who founded the Shannon scheme.  The Minister did not mention Sir John Purser Griffith who experimented at his own expense in the utilisation of turf for the generation of electricity. Some of his dreams are now coming to fruition.  The Minister did not mention Michael Moynihan, borough surveyor of the City of Dublin, who had advanced ideas on electrification and who found it very hard to get people to accept his ideas.  The Minister did not mention Larry Kettle, one of the finest engineers this country has <Col N="125" /> ever produced, who advocated the utilisation of turf for the generation of electricity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is very general.  Due tribute must be paid to the Dublin Corporation which built the Pigeon House.  I doubt if people know that some years ago during a drought the whole of Ireland was provided with electricity by the Pigeon House.  The year that the Minister for Industry and Commerce took over the Pigeon House the Dublin Corporation was able to put £60,000 received for electricity towards the relief of rates generally.  I want to put these matters on record.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction.  I have not the ability to give much thought or consideration to the points advanced by Deputy Hickey in relation to the financing of this project.  I know very little about money matters but I know one gets very little for a pound these days.  I expect that affects all of us.</P>
      <P>The point I want to get at is this. Will the Minister be able to tell us that in the near future the E.S.B. will not be permitted to increase their charges or to alter their method of charging?</P>

I merely want to remind the House that the Dublin Corporation at present is the largest landlord in the country.  At the moment the corporation have 30,000 tenants and each of them is going to be mulcted to the extent of £1 or £2 per annum under the new method of charging for electricity.  I wish to protest strongly against the E.S.B. having power to do that.  From Dublin Corporation tenants they will take at least £30,000 per annum.</P>

      <P>That some other time never arises.  I want to support Deputy Hickey in his references to the retired men who went out some years ago on pensions based on the rates of wages which they had at that time and who have got very little increase since. While I agree with the Minister that the men at the top in the various grades should get sufficient reward for what they have done for the country and the way they have managed it, I support the appeal made by Deputy Hickey that it is time to review the case of the men at the bottom and those in the middle also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not the pleasure of hearing the Minister's entire statement and therefore I intend to be very brief.  I merely intervene to compliment the Minister on the two changes which have been made in regard to rural electrification.</P>
      <P>It is a very good thing that absolute priority is now being given to rural areas which have the highest percentage of acceptances.  We had the position in many areas where a very high percentage of the people contracted to accept the current but were debarred on economic considerations. That has been overcome, and I think it is a good thing because it does give encouragement to progressive areas and to people in those areas who are anxious to be the pioneers and initiate the work of getting the scheme under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also a good development that the rate of progress in rural electrification has been accelerated very <Col N="127" /> greatly over the past couple of years. I think the Minister stated that it has been increased by 40 or 50 per cent., with the result that the entire work of rural electrification will be completed inside five years.  That is a very welcome announcement.  No matter what people may say about the unprogressive and backward nature of our rural population, there is no doubt that our rural people have responded very readily to this new development and have taken to it in a very progressive spirit.  Rural electrification, although it is heavily subsidised by the State, does entail considerable cost on the consumer.  In the case of the small farmer with a limited income or an agricultural worker with a small wage, it does entail having to undertake a liability which he had not heretofore experienced.  But in this, as in other matters, our people are progressive and are prepared to weigh up the advantages of this new amenity against its cost.  Regardless of how limited may be the resources of people in some areas where the land is poor they cheerfully undertake it.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for congratulation that there has been such a spectacular development in the generation and production of electricity over the years since it was first introduced.  I am interested in and of course approve of hydro-electric development, but it is also a matter for congratulation that there has been so much development in our bog areas which, as the Minister said, were regarded as depressed areas. As a result of this, they can be looked upon as centres of progress and employment and centres of industry.</P>
    <P>This Bill simply seeks to ensure that the E.S.B. can obtain their necessary capital directly from investors.  I do not think there are many people qualified to go as deeply into the matter of finance as Deputy Hickey.  He has expressed his profound disagreement with both the Minister and Deputy Cosgrave in regard to how this whole project should be financed.  He has suggested that it is time to sit down and settle this whole question. I assume that this whole question will be settled within the next couple of weeks, particularly as between his <Col N="128" /> Party and Deputy Cosgrave's.  While it is right and proper to emphasise the high cost of interest in regard to the capitalising and financing of work of this kind, it is of course necessary also to weigh up all the implications of the complete change in the financial system which Deputy Hickey advocates.  I have often wondered how a complete change such as he advocates would affect our entire economic position, how, for example, it would affect our external trade and our large export trade in agricultural products and how these matters could be adjusted in a small country such as this, particularly in a country which is divided at the moment geographically and which is very closely linked with the Six Counties and with Great Britain.  These are all matters which I trust will be investigated and settled in the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one remark in regard to this matter.  While the State has got to pay a very large amount of money to investors, whether they be banks or citizens, I assume the State also collects a very substantial amount of revenue from those investors in income-tax.  It would be no harm if Deputy Hickey were investigating this matter if he weighed up how it would react in that way.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to know exactly what the total recoupment is by way of revenue from direct and indirect taxation.  This matter, of course, is far too deep to be introduced on a Bill such as this although I suppose it is relevant.  It is rather a deep question to be settled in the next few weeks. However, I think that whatever about the financing of the project the House and the country generally feel a considerable amount of satisfaction in regard to the success of this whole development. The fact that we as a nation have been able to harness our resources efficiently and effectively is something to boast of.  There were people, before we became independent, <Col N="129" /> who said that the Irish people were incapable of managing any large or important concern.  It has been proved that we have the engineers, the experts and the directors of the board who have been able to harness our great rivers, and we have been ahead of most countries in the development of our peat resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it could be done effectively without endangering some other important resource of the nation I would welcome it.  We have also, as I say, shown that a big concern such as this employing a very large number of workers has been efficiently run.  It is extraordinary how little is the volume of criticism one hears in regard to the manner in which this very large concern operates compared with the local authorities and county councils, that are frequently criticised in regard to the manner in which they carry on road construction and other work of that kind.  We do not hear the same volume of criticism in regard to the manner in which the E.S.B. carry through their work.  In the rural areas they have shown themselves highly efficient.  They have to employ a great volume of casual labour and, nevertheless, their plans are so well laid and their scheme of work so well organised that there is not, as far as the ordinary citizen can see, any inefficiency or any volume of waste.  I think that that is the best tribute one can pay to this large concern.  There must be business minds and a capable, hardworking executive at the head of this organisation to carry out this work so efficiently.  I think the country owes a debt of gratitude to the men who control this concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave described this Bill as a new stage of the development of the E.S.B., and I think that is not an inaccurate description.  He referred to the original decision to establish a single undertaking to produce, distribute and sell electricity.  I think that was a good decision.  It is true that the <Col N="130" /> scale and the character of the operations of the E.S.B. have changed out of all recognition since then, but when the big development came later it was decided to base it upon the organisation which was already there, and that decision has also proved sound.</P>
      <P>When the E.S.B. was set up originally the consumption of electricity in this country was very low and almost stagnant.  The first big development came with the growth of industry following 1932, and the spectacular increases in the sales of electricity for industrial power purposes recorded after that year were at the time regarded as the measure of our industrial expansion.  The first big stage in the E.S.B.'s development was, in fact, that rapid growth in the industrial power load in those years immediately before the war and which opened up the need for the development of a very big new generation construction programme.</P>
      <P>The second important stage in the board's development was, I think, the decision taken in 1938 to base new development upon native resources as far as possible, and particularly the decision to organise the production of machine turf for the purpose of providing fuel for power stations.  That was at the time an experimental development, and the practicability of producing an economic fuel from Irish turf bogs by mechanical means had not been established.  I think it is a source of great satisfaction to all of us that not merely was that work successfully begun but nobody would now suggest seriously that we should think of any other method of development apart from water power until the fullest development has been secured in the utilisation of our turf bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be true to say that the next main stage in the development of our electricity programme was the decision to embark upon a rural electrification scheme.  When the Act which launched that scheme was introduced in the Dáil in 1943 the war was at its height.  It was fully realised by the Government at the time that no work on the scheme could be done until the war was over, and that Act was one of a series produced then to provide a legislative basis for a postwar <Col N="131" /> development programme.  The importance of that scheme to the rural areas of this country is now generally recognised, and it is a happy moment for me to be able to announce now that the rate of development is going to be doubled and that we can see the completion in five years of the programme which was only a sort of dream for the future when I brought the Electricity Supply Act of 1943 before the House.</P>
    <P>I think that another and very important stage in the E.S.B.'s development was the decision taken in 1952 to embark upon the development of milled peat.  It is true that there is no station yet fired by milled peat. The Ferbane station, as I have said, will be the first.  But all the indications are that through the utilisation of milled peat we will have our fuel costs of electricity generation down as low as any other country in Europe. The authorities of Bord na Móna say that they will be disappointed if when these new milled peat stations come into operation they cannot demonstrate that units of heat are being put into the boilers of those stations located on Irish bogs at prices as low as, or lower than, at any power station located at the pit head of a coal-mine in England.  If their achievement reaches their hopes in that regard, I am sure that the decision to change over from sod peat to milled peat will become another landmark in the whole history of electricity development here.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for a change, not so much in the construction or development programme as in the methods of financing it.  We contemplate that from now on the E.S.B. will be responsible itself for raising from the public, through the issue of its own securities, the money required for development.  The position up to the present was that the Government undertook to find whatever capital the E.S.B. required within the limits authorised from time to time by the Legislature.  When the Minister for Finance floated a loan last year, he included in the amount of the loan the capital requirements of the E.S.B. The money borrowed from the public by the Exchequer was in part passed <Col N="132" /> on to the E.S.B. on the same repayment basis and at a rate of interest which enabled the Minister for Finance to pay interest to those who had lent the money to him and to cover the administrative costs involved in the transaction.  In future, the Exchequer will not have that primary responsibility for finding the capital required by the E.S.B.  The E.S.B. will issue its own securities to the public, securities based on its own revenues and guaranteed by the State. That will enable it to raise money upon the most advantageous terms possible and will relieve the Exchequer of the responsibility for finding resources for the board.</P>
    <P>I am not going to argue with Deputy Hickey whether it is possible to borrow money without incurring an obligation to pay interest.  All I can say is that we believe that a development of this kind should be financed by attracting the savings of our people for that purpose.  We believe that people will be prepared to make their savings available for national development purposes if they are given the same payment for the use of their savings as they can get by making them available for some other purpose or by transferring them for investment in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on the actual material wealth of the country.  I do not want to get into an argument with the Deputy on that subject because I do not think I could ever please Deputy Hickey.  The Deputy referred <Col N="133" /> to the proposal to provide pensions for whole-time members of the board. I think he misunderstands the position concerning members of the board's staff.  I introduced some ten years ago a Bill which provided for the setting up of superannuation funds and pension schemes.  A worker joining the board's service and undertaking to contribute in accordance with the pensions scheme will get a 50 per cent. pension on retirement after 40 years' service.  The Deputy has, apparently, in mind certain difficulties which arose in the case of a number of people whose service was less than the maximum contemplated by the scheme.  In their case some relief was given by the Bill introduced some time ago.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne referred to the case of men who retired some time ago and who got pensions related to the actual wages in operation at the time which were less than the rates paid now.  In their case also there was legislation which authorised an increase in the amount of pensions payable.  Whether that increase was enough or not, we can perhaps discuss on some other occasion but it would not arise on this Bill.  There was a special Pensions Act which provided for these charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne asked&mdash;and this is an important matter from the point of view of the House&mdash;whether it will be possible to ask questions here on the administration of the board and its charges.  It will not.  When the E.S.B. was set up almost 30 years ago, the House decided that the board should have a free hand in the matters of the charges made, subject to the condition only that it would make no profit and that these charges would be so fixed as to bring in enough and only enough to meet the outgoings of the board and its capital liabilities.  The board has been carried on on that basis ever since.  That clause in the Act of 1927 which gave the board that freedom and which put the Government in the position of having no function in regard to the charges of the E.S.B., has remained unchanged since.  The various Governments which have come into office since did not think it desirable to change it.  I do not think it would be possible to set up an organisation <Col N="134" /> of this kind and keep it on a string.  If the day to day details of administration are going to be the responsibility of the Minister, then he might as well scrap the board altogether and accept full powers.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of policy.  I know nothing about the proposed new charges except what the board themselves have said.  What they said was that they proposed to change their method of charging because they felt that the new method would be fairer to consumers.  They added that they would not get an additional penny of revenue by reason of the change.  The board does not have to seek increased charges for the purpose of getting in more money.  It is merely making certain changes in the system of charges which will mean a fairer basis of charging as between the various types of consumer.</P>
      <P>I brought this Bill to the Dáil knowing that, by and large, it would be welcomed by the House and that Deputies would be glad to see the very comprehensive programme set out in the White Paper which the Bill is designed to implement.  Everybody will be glad to know that this work is going ahead far more rapidly now than ever before and that the growing demand for electric power in this country will be met under this programme within the period to which this Bill relates&mdash; that is, between now and 1961 and that is about as far ahead as we can plan in these matters at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was dealing with amendment No. 172 which provides for a right of appeal from the sentence of a court-martial.  I had explained that the right suggested in this amendment was a right that has been clamoured for by many armies for quite a long time.  Since the last great war, the right has been conceded in Britain and <Col N="135" /> officers and soldiers there have the right of bringing appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal in England on points of law.  I do not know how many appeals have been heard, but I think the number of appeals heard in Britain, since this right was provided, has been very small.  There is no question, and cannot be any question, of an abuse of the procedure, because the right of appeal is limited to a matter of law, and, so far as my amendment is concerned, it could apply only where the sentence was one of imprisonment, penal servitude or death, and the appeal is not against the sentence but against the conviction.  In England, they have that appeal on a point of law.</P>
      <P>When I put down the amendment, I thought the Minister would have considered it and that, as he kept up with modern development in Canada in regard to punitive provisions in relation to matters of pay, he would have adopted this new and long-sought after provision of the right of appeal which has been adopted by the English Parliament.  The provision cannot be abused, as I say, so there can be no objection to it on that score.  It is a valuable right&mdash;it is, in fact, an essential&mdash;that, where one has punishment of the nature provided in this Act, the conviction which gives rise to the punishment should be subject to examination by the Court of Criminal Appeal, and it is significant that when we had the Special Criminal Court, a court composed of military officers, which had very extensive powers granted to it by legislation and under the Constitution, a right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal existed and was frequently availed of.  There were many cases in which the Court of Criminal Appeal found that the Special Criminal Court, composed, as it was, of military officers, were wrong in their conception of the law and on a number of occasions quashed the convictions of that Special Criminal Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where we have all this haggling and baggling with principles of justice, as we have here&mdash;quashing convictions that are found to be absolutely illegal and ordering the accused to be tried <Col N="136" /> again and substituting one punishment for another&mdash;we certainly should have a right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Bad as this particular Bill is in its draftsmanship, it would be very signally improved if it included a provision such as I suggest.  I do not for one moment suggest that the form of words I have put down is the best to provide for the appeal, but if the principle of the appeal was conceded, the Minister would have the services of the parliamentary draftsman in putting in acceptable form the provision that there should be an appeal.</P>
    <P>The Court of Criminal Appeal, as we know, is a court constituted of the Chief Justice or President of the High Court and two other judges of either the Supreme Court or High Court.  It is a court which is constituted when any appeal is pending, and which hears very carefully the submissions made to it and which examines all the authorities laid down by itself from time to time and the principles of criminal law that have been laid down over the years and have been accepted as applicable to this country.  Where an individual, whether a soldier or an officer, has been convicted of an offence which involves very serious punishment&mdash;imprisonment, penal servitude or death&mdash;I think it will be agreed that he should have the right to have his case considered if he thinks the court of trial has dealt with him illegally.</P>
    <P>If the right existed in relation to some of the matters which we discussed on a previous section, as to the Minister ascertaining whether the proceedings of a court-martial are illegal, the Court of Criminal Appeal in a very short period would decide whether they were illegal or not.  It is better in the interests of justice that there should be that immediate examination, where an accused person feels he has been treated unjustly, unfairly or improperly by the court-martial which tried him.</P>
    <P>It is surprising that a Deputy should have to advocate this right of appeal for an accused person in the circumstances set out in the amendment. There should be no question whatever about it and I am anxious to know what objection the Minister can have <Col N="137" /> to this right of appeal, what objection can he have to it on legal principles? What objection can he have to it on the grounds of justice?  Does he think that a soldier or an officer who feels he has been illegally convicted should be deprived of the right of going to the highest tribunal in the country to have his conviction examined and, if illegal, set aside?  What objection can there be to the procedure?</P>
    <P>I am very anxious to hear from the Minister why he did not avail himself of the machinery of appeal that has been established in Great Britain.  I read recently in the newspapers that, in Germany, where provision is being made at the moment for the creation of an armed force, where amendments to their own Constitution have been made and where certain laws in respect of the new military force have been under consideration this question of appeal from the verdicts of military courts-martial has also been very favourably considered.  It does seem to me that in any country that considers itself in the van of civilisation there should be the right of appeal against a conviction carrying with it the grave and serious penalties that this military code provides.</P>
    <P>The right of appeal against conviction is a right that has been established over a long number of years in the case of ordinary criminal offences.  That right of appeal has been established at the insistence mainly of lawyers but at the insistence of citizens who believed it was the fundamental right of an accused person to have a case re-examined by a higher tribunal if they felt they were dealt with unfairly and unjustly.  There has been rapid progress in regard to that conception of appeal.  Anyone who reads our own history will find that it is not many years ago when an accused person in Green Street courthouse who had been sentenced to death was executed within a matter of hours.  No right of appeal whatsoever was granted.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly certain that in those days there were judges and civil servants who opposed very vigorously that the right of appeal should be <Col N="138" /> granted to an ordinary citizen.  One has only got to read the defences that were conducted by John Philpott Curran to realise the sort of summary procedures that were carried out in those days where trials lasted right over midnight into the early hours of the morning, sentences of death imposed and the accused trandled off to Thomas Street or somewhere else to be hanged, drawn and quartered.</P>
    <P>There were people in those days who believed that was the right thing to do and that the accused person should have no right of appeal.  It astonishes me that that same old idea lingers on in, perhaps, the most conservative part of this country&mdash;the Department of Defence.  In the early stages I said they were stretching out into new continents to avail of their experience for the purpose of executing for more offences than the old Acts provided, but when it is a question of this fundamental right of appeal against improper conviction we find them away back in the dark age of the 18th century when no right of appeal would be given.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that I should have had to spend any time on this matter. I regret very much that the conception of appeal was not accepted.  If it was there would be no trouble whatsoever in the machinery or in agreement on the form of words that would bring this about.  I will be very interested to hear the Minister's defence of maintaining the military code without the right of appeal, particularly where there are so many instances already in this Bill of interference with what has up to the present been considered rights of the citizens and rights of the individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another of the sections which was discussed at very great length in the Special Committee. On that occasion I spoke at very great length also and I gave what I considered to be a very detailed and very exact description of the section and its effects.  As a result of the long discussion which took place there and of the views which were expressed, I went to the trouble of having a special committee of legal men set up to <Col N="139" /> examine the whole question.  The committee consisted of representatives of the Attorney-General's Department, a legal representative of the Department of Justice and a legal representative nominated by myself.</P>
      <P>That was going quite a considerable distance to meet the views expressed by Deputy Cowan on that occasion, which he has repeated here again this evening.  As a result of that very careful and very meticulous examination by the legal men who examined this from every possible aspect, they advised me that the question of an appeal from a court-martial was not necessary in view of the small number of offences, of their almost exclusively military nature and the absence of a system of free legal aid and the fact that there is no form of compulsory military service here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan went to great pains to advise the House that a situation which existed for a considerable period of time in England was eventually altered in a manner in which he desires that the situation here should be altered through this Bill.  But what Deputy Cowan did not tell the House was that a number of commissions had already sat for very many years examining that same question and that all these commissions without exception turned down the recommendation. They turned it down until conscription was enforced in England; then the commission was set up again and re-examined the situation. In view of the fact that men were being compulsorily taken into the army, in other words, that they were not coming in any longer in a voluntary manner accepting the conditions of service as they knew them to be but were, so to speak, being forced into the service, then the commission, naturally and logically I think, decided that there should be an appeal, but it was only on these grounds that the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was eventually agreed to.  I cannot see any good reason why a purely military offence should be appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 238 of this Bill there is under the heading of Rules and Procedure <Col N="140" /> a provision which says: &ldquo;The Minister may make rules (in this Act referred to as rules of procedure) in relation to all or any of the following matters,&rdquo; and then a number of matters under headings (a), (b), (c), (d), etc., are listed.  Sub-clause (h) provides for the presentation of petitions by or on behalf of persons sentenced by courts-martial.  In that respect it is proposed to have such petitions as would be provided for by that sub-clause (h) examined by the Attorney-General in conjunction with the Minister. I think that represents a very reasonable precaution and safeguards the individual from the horrors which Deputy Cowan seems to think will be inflicted on him by reason of the passing of this particular section.  I cannot see any good reason why a civil court should be asked to come in and adjudicate on a matter which is a purely military offence.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks Deputy Cowan referred to the case of a person who is illegally sentenced.  I do not know what he meant by a person who is illegally sentenced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is &ldquo;illegally convicted&rdquo; or &ldquo;sentenced&rdquo;&mdash;whatever the difference may be&mdash;we can deal with that and I think we dealt with it some sections back.  If a sentence is an illegal one it can be dealt with by the convening authority of the court-martial, by the President of the court-martial or by the Minister.  But there is no question of illegal sentence covered in Deputy Cowan's amendment. Anyhow an illegal sentence would be an invalid decision and to my mind would not be a decision which would be upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that is not what would be examined.  What would be examined under this petition in Section 238 would be an appeal against a sentence which was inflicted for whatever offence had been committed.  There would be no question of it being illegal; I presume the petition would be for a reduction in the punishment inflicted.  If it was a question of an illegal sentence that would be another matter.  It would <Col N="141" /> be dealt with by the Attorney-General in conjunction with the Minister, provided for by rules of procedure which it is proposed to bring in.  I do not propose to accept this amendment because I am satisfied that as far as the section is concerned every possible precaution that can be afforded to a man who is under trial by court-martial is in fact provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am in the same boat I was in when I sat down before.  I asked the Minister to justify the refusal to provide a right of appeal to a person convicted of an offence and sentenced to imprisonment, penal servitude or death, and the Minister has not dealt with that at all.  The Minister has assumed that we were discussing purely military matters and that there was no reason why they should go before the Court of Criminal Appeal, which he says is a purely civil court to deal with purely civil matters. Obviously, there are very few military offences for which a person gets two years' imprisonment, very few military offences for which he gets a sentence of penal servitude.</P>
      <P>There are cases in which he can be sentenced to death and whether they are military offences or not it is only right that the accused person should have the right to have the conviction reviewed by a competent court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister's explanation of this matter of appeals against convictions of courts-martial in England.  I have not had time to study it up and was interested to hear that a number of commissions in England decided against including this provision of appeal in the British military code. It is interesting to find that a more recent commission came to the conclusion that it was right that there should be appeals.  The Minister says that was conceded by the commission because of compulsory military service in Britain, that when people were forced into the Army they should have the right of appeal and when they joined it voluntarily they should have no right of appeal.  For the life of me, I cannot see the logic of it.  Of course, I can see an ingenious British explanation <Col N="142" /> for one commission coming to a different decision from that of previous commissions.</P>
    <P>On a matter of justice, does it matter two hoots whether a man is brought in by compulsion and made subject to military law or whether he signs on the dotted line and comes in voluntarily?  On the question of justice, it makes no difference, and it is justice I am concerned with and justice we all ought to be concerned with.  To say that because a man is brought in by compulsion, because of compulsory military service, you give him justice, but you give him no justice if he joins voluntarily, is an explanation that I find it very difficult to accept.</P>
    <P>The important fact is that in England over many years&mdash;because several commissions dealt with it&mdash; there was repeated demand for a right of appeal from sentences of courts-martial and eventually, as in all other matters, progress and civilised development brought about a right of appeal, just as progress and civilised development brought about the right of appeal in ordinary criminal cases. I would not worry an awful lot about some of these old English commissions. They were terribly annoyed some years ago.  When it was proposed to take children out of the mines by legislation, they were shocked and affronted.  It is not so many years since not one but many scores of judges in England came to the conclusion that the whole world would collapse if the right were removed of sentencing people to death for particular petty larcencies.  This matter should be dealt with on a basis of justice.  In England there has been this reasonable development that where a person has been convicted and where the conviction is due to an error or defect in law, he has the right to go to the Court of Criminal Appeal and have the conviction quashed.  The number of cases in which that would occur would be very few.  But the very fact that the machinery of appeal was there would ensure that no injustice would be done and that military courts-martial and judge-advocates on military courts-martial would take <Col N="143" /> every possible step to ensure that no injustice was done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says they are doing that at present.  Of course they are-they are doing their very best to ensure that nothing wrong takes place.  Fortunately, the number of courts-martial in the Army to-day is very small.  This is a measure to govern the Army in peace and in war. It is a measure to govern the Army whether it is 10,000 strong as it is at the moment, or 200,000 strong, as it might be in times of emergency.  It is a measure to govern the present very experienced legal officers and judge-advocates there are in the Army and also to govern judge-advocates and legal officers who, in the case of the rapid expansion of the Army, would not have the experience or the knowledge that our present very capable staff of judge-advocates and legal officers have.  I am dealing with this Bill as one which will become an Act to govern the Army in peace and in war&mdash;not to govern only the 9,000 or 10,000 we have at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not looking on it as an Act to govern the half-dozen very competent legal officers we have now in the Army.  My view of the present legal officers is that nobody could go to more trouble than they do to ensure that an accused person gets fair play.  I want to take the opportunity of paying them a very high tribute that they deserve.  I agree with the Minister that this is to be a permanent Act, though it is one which at some time in the future will be amended.  I hope so.  I think it would be a shame if the provisions of this Act were allowed to operate very long.  It requires very substantial amendment. When it is as long in operation as the old Act of 1923, it will be frilled around with as many amendments as the Act of 1923 is.  This measure is to govern the Army in peace and in war, to govern the present 10,000 or the future <Col N="144" /> 50,000 or 100,000.  It will govern inexperienced legal officers and, perhaps, unjust legal officers in the future.</P>

      <P>It is vital that this machinery should enable justice to be done at all costs.  I accept what the Minister says, that he discussed this with a committee composed of legal representatives from the Attorney-General's Office, the Department of Justice and the Army.  They said to him: &ldquo;We advise against appeal.&rdquo; With all respect, it is not they who should decide whether there should be an appeal or not.  That is a matter for the Legislature.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for this House whether there should be an appeal or not.  I would be very much surprised if they would take it on themselves to say that they advised against the appeal in principle or against an appeal in the manner suggested in the amendment or against the appeal because convictions are exclusively in respect of military offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am analysing the statement the Minister made.  He made a point that we have no free legal aid. Perhaps due to my own stupidity, I did not get the point.  We ought to have free legal aid but the fact that we have not should not be a justification for refusing to give a soldier or an officer the right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal if he has been sentenced to imprisonment, penal servitude or death.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come to that.  Whether we have free legal aid or not, the machinery of justice ought to be available.  The Minister says that under Section 238 the Minister can provide machinery of petition.  I <Col N="145" /> do not like very much the connotation of &ldquo;petition&rdquo;.  It suggests &ldquo;I have been convicted properly.  I petition the Minister to give me a lesser punishment than that awarded by the court.&rdquo; The form of petition could be extended but it is not a form of which I approve. I am not concerned with the punishment except in so far as the seriousness of the punishment justifies the right of appeal against the conviction.</P>
      <P>Petition could mean a petition by a person who is convicted and who says: &ldquo;I was convicted.  I am guilty of this and graver offences.  I have been a traitor to my country.  I have let down the flag.  I crave mercy from the Minister.&rdquo;  I am not concerned with petitions against punishment.  I am concerned with appeals against wrongful convictions.</P>
      <P>I have specifically stated in the amendment that the Court of Criminal Appeal shall have no jurisdiction to hear an appeal against the sentence only of a court-martial, that the Court of Criminal Appeal will not interfere with the sentence unless it quashes the conviction.  Therefore, I am not concerned with petition in that form.</P>
      <P>The presentation of petitions by, or on behalf of, persons sentenced by courts-martial means nothing more or less than that a person who is sentenced, say, to imprisonment for a year or six months or two years, would get down on his knees to the Minister and ask for clemency and mercy.  That is what &ldquo;petition&rdquo; is but that is not what I am interested in here.  I am interested, not in the amount of the punishment, but as to whether or not the convicion was legal, or illegal.  I hope I have made that point perfectly clear to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently, the Minister was advised that if we had free legal aid in this country a soldier or an officer could appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I gather that there would not be the same amount of objection to giving the right of appeal if we had free legal aid.  Because we have not free legal aid, apparently, we are depriving a soldier of the right of appeal, of the right of the machinery for appeal, simply and solely because we deprive him of the right to be legally <Col N="146" /> represented at the expense of the State rather than at his own expense.</P>
    <P>In my respectful submission, there is no justification for the Minister's opposition to appeal.  Where a Bill such as this makes ducks and drakes of ideas we had in regard to justice and the machinery of justice perhaps it is only right that it should go the distance of refusing to allow the Court of Criminal Appeal to investigate the correctness or otherwise of a conviction by a court-martial.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the point that in England there is compulsory military service and that here we have voluntary service.  I have dealt with that point.  I want to direct the attention of the House to a section that we discussed earlier where we extended the classes who are subject to military law.  Under the ordinary law, military law does not apply to a member of Fórsa Cosanta Áitiuil except when he is on permanent service, if called out in aid of the civil power or as prescribed in the Act.  Similarly, in regard to the other classes of the Reserve, they are subject to military law when they are not on exercises or on permanent service or called out on public service when necessary.  We have extended it to provide that a person is subject to military law when he is permitted to wear a uniform at a social function, or whenever he wears a uniform&mdash;and whether or not that applies to the men or the boys I meet from time to time down the country bringing home turf from the bog in uniform, I do not know.  However, if one extends liability to military law to all these citizen soldiers who give their services and their part-time services to the State, why should they not have the right, say in the case of liability to imprisonment, to ask the Court of Criminal Appeal to examine the record of the proceedings of the court-martial that convicted them and to quash the conviction if the Court of Criminal Appeal finds it was illegal?</P>
    <P>The whole trouble with the Bill is that it is pushed to logical extremes against the officer and against the soldier.  Where it is a question of taking his pay, of punishing him, of bringing him up like an Aunt Sally to be tried and tried again, hit and hit <Col N="147" /> again, it is pushed to these logical extremes but the position is altogether different when it is a question of giving him the protection, say, of statutory provisions here in regard to his pay, in regard to the quashing of his conviction without re-trial, in regard to giving him the right of appeal.  In these respects, the Bill is pushed to the other extreme to give him no rights at all.</P>
    <P>That attitude of mind in regard to a military force might have suited military forces many years ago when armies were not citizen armies or were not manned by the decent type of citizen that one finds in the armies of all countries to-day.  That type of mentality in regard to armies is out of date and out-moded.  Personally, I am not a bit surprised that it exists in one of the few places where it could exist in this country and that is in the Department of Defence.  I remember reading one time about a Duke&mdash;I think it was the Duke of Wellington&mdash;who went out and took a look at his army and said: &ldquo;My God, I do not know how they affect the enemy but they frighten me.&rdquo; For that type of soldier, this type of Act would be all right but the modern citizen will not put up with it.  You can have your logical Act pushed to its logical extremes against the soldier there but you will have a logical Act and no Army with which to play under that Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that, since the emergency, it has cost the State a very large sum of money, by recruiting campaigns from time to time to try and get the Army up to strength.  The only hope of keeping the Army up to strength without these expensive recruiting campaigns is to have conditions of service in the Army so attractive that young boys will be encouraged to go into the Army&mdash;and in order to have that attraction the rights of the soldier must be preserved.  Even the Department of Defence must realise that the young boys of to-day will not be pushed around.  Whether it be in the factory, on the football field or anywhere else, the young boys of to-day will not be pushed around&mdash;and they will not permit themselves to be pushed around in the Army.  I should <Col N="148" /> prefer if we were keeping in step here with modern developments by providing the machinery for appeal&mdash;by providing the machinery that would eliminate grievances and complaints and causes of objection to the Defence Forces&mdash;instead of putting through a Bill of this type, designed only to punish the members of the Army and to deny them the rights that, as ordinary citizens, they should be entitled to.</P>
    <P>I cannot do anything with it.  I cannot do anything about it.  All I can do is to point out the foolishness of the attitude being adopted here.  All I can do is to point out to the Minister, in so far as I can, that where we have a development in military law in other countries&mdash;that is, following the development of some years ago in regard to the ordinary criminal law of the country&mdash;in regard to the rights of the soldier and the rights of the citizen to appeal against what they consider improper or unlawful conviction, we should put that in and that if this Act were to err it should err on the side of the provision which it would make for the rights of the citizens.</P>
    <P>I have done my best in the Special Committee and I have done my best here to get this principle of appeal accepted.  It is not being accepted. The House does not want it to be accepted.  The members that compose this Dáil do not want those rights given to the Army.  The members of this Dáil want to deny to the soldier that fundamental right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an improper or an illegal conviction.  The members of this House want to maintain the old idea in regard to the Army&mdash;that the soldier is a type of chattel or, if you like, of cattle that will not be given rights at all.  That is the position of this House in regard to the Defence Forces and the rights of the Defence Forces.  The Minister tells us that there is no necessity to give him the appeal, that he might not have the money to pay for the appeal.  He might not have the money to pay a lawyer to appear for him in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  He can appear himself if he wants to do so.  We do not give free legal aid.  Therefore it <Col N="149" /> would be cheaper for him to make a petition.  It would be cheaper for him to send in a big <i>mea culpa</i> to the Minister or to the Government to reduce the sentence that has been imposed on him, whether it is an illegal or a legal conviction.  That is what he has to do.  He has the right of appeal. He has the right to petition.  Everybody has right to petition, and in the bad old days one had the right to go in before the landlord with his cap in his hand.  That is the right that is given to the soldier to-day and not the right of a freeman to assert his innocence of the charge before the highest court we have in this country in respect to criminal appeals.  We are not giving him that right but the right of a supplicant to beg for mercy when he has been improperly or illegally convicted of an offence.  If the Dáil wants it that way the Dáil can have it that way, but please God in the future some other Dáil will take a different view and it will be necessary to take a different view in regard to matters of that kind.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 174:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 102, Section 228, line 15, to delete &ldquo;or is released without proper authority&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment here is to delete certain words from the section as it stands.  It is a section dealing with the suspension of currency of sentences where a person escapes or is released without proper authority.  The section provides that if a person who is sentenced to imprisonment, detention or penal servitude escapes, his sentence is suspended for the period of his escape, the period during which he is free after the escape, and it begins to operate again when he is apprehended.  The Act provides that where a person is released without proper authority the sentence will be suspended while he is out and when he is caught again the <Col N="150" /> sentence will resume.  I cannot see how a soldier or a person subject to military law could be released without proper authority.  That is the first thing that worries me.  Secondly, if he is released by some authority whose power to release might not be all that is desired, why should he be re-arrested and why should his sentence be revived?  Why should he have to serve the balance of his sentence? I would ask the Minister to inform the House what are the circumstances in which a person could be improperly released?  If a person is sentenced to penal servitude he is down in Portlaoise.  I am leaving out the escape part of it because I am not quarrelling with the fact that if he escapes and is caught he goes back and that is all about it.  But how could he be released improperly from Portlaoise or if in Mountjoy, how could he be released without proper authority? Or if he were in Arbour Hill detention barracks how could he be released other than by proper authority?  One need not say very much about the ordinary detention guard rooms and things like that but I would like to hear the Minister explain the circumstances in which it is visualised that a person could be released from Portlaoise or Mountjoy, or any other civilian prison or Arbour Hill, or any other military detention barracks.  How could he be released without proper authority?  And if he is released by some mistake of somebody, some person of military authority or civil authority, if he is released by mistake of fact or mistake of law, is it right that he should be liable to apprehension and liable to be put back, liable to be kept there as if he were never released?  I would like the Minister's view on that.  I think the same point arises on amendment No. 175&mdash;exactly the same point.</P>

      <P>The best way I can answer the queries which Deputy Cowan has put to me is by quoting from the report of the Special Committee which deals with this particular section.  I was replying to Deputy Cowan&mdash;he made a similar case to that he has made just now&mdash;and this is what I said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" />&ldquo;Mr. Traynor: Release without proper authority may be accidental but it could also be by collusion.  If it is accidental the person need not necessarily be required to serve the period during which he is away as the section merely says `may'.  On the other hand, if there were collusion he should be required to serve it.  If there is some kind of conspiracy to get a man out and he is party to it he should be made to serve the full term, but if he is released by mistake the provision need not operate at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Cowan said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would be satisfied so long as that would be the interpretation.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the force of the argument made by Deputy Cowan.  If he is released through collusion or a conspiracy, then somebody else ought to be in a jail instead of the accused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but I cannot see that happening, and, therefore, I must take the point of view that he is released by some sort of authority, and that he cannot be released except by those who have the responsibility of keeping a convicted person in custody. The thing that upsets me about this is the fact that if he was in Portlaoise prison and the Minister for Justice released him, could it be argued that he had not been released by the proper authority?  In that case he had been in a convict prison which is under the Department of the Minister for Justice.  If the convict appealed or petitioned to the Minister for Justice, instead of to the Minister for Defence or to the convening authority, would his release by the Minister for Justice be an improper release?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the point is that it was not the proper authority that released him.</P>

    <Col N="152" />
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that later.  It is an admitted fact that, under the Courts of Justice Act, the Government may delegate power to the Minister for Justice to remit in the case of punishment or a conviction. Suppose the Minister for Justice got a petition from Private John Brown or Lieutenant Michael White appealing for release or for a remission of his sentence, and that the Minister released him, would his release be held to be an improper one?  I am afraid that the Minister for Defence or the Army authorities could hold that it was, and could under this section rearrest him.  That is why I do not like the phrase &ldquo;released without proper authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Now, with regard to accidental releases, I have known of such cases. I think that in a case where a release was accidental, somebody else had to pay the piper, and that a new warrant was issued for the arrest of the accused.  He could not be taken into custody again without a continuance of the offence.  I am aware of accidental releases under the existing Act.  At the same time, I feel that the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the section does not give enough protection to an accused person.  I think the words in the section are not necessary, and that the Minister would be well advised to examine the matter again and see if my contention is right.  My opinion is, that we should not put anything into the Act that is unnecessary.  I think that the words &ldquo;without proper authority&rdquo; are unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy MacEoin has made that point on this particular amendment.  The Minister, however, says, in effect: &ldquo;Well, this is what I said in the Special Committee and this is the end of it.&rdquo;  That, of course, is part of our trouble in regard to the whole Bill and it has been so all the time&mdash;that is this style &ldquo;that is what I said and I stick to it&rdquo;.</P>

    <Col N="153" />
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I said I was satisfied if that was the effect of it. I am not satisfied, however, when the Minister says: &ldquo;This section will be interpreted in the way that I say it will be interpreted.&rdquo;  That is our difficulty.  That would be all right if the Minister were to be a Methuselah and we were to have him for the next 900 years&mdash;that is, that he would always deal with cases that came before him in that way.  If that were so, we would have nothing to worry about. I do not think, however, that science has progressed so far that any of us can hope to reach the age of Methuselah.</P>
      <P>It is from that point of view that I think the section is a bit slipshod. It is a new section, and, as far as I can see, it is slipshod in so far as it refers to &ldquo;without proper authority&rdquo; because it does not say what the authority is.  You could have a position where the civil authority would release, whereas in fact, under the provisions of this Act it might be the military authorities that should give the order.  I think that once he is released that is the end of it, although an attempt is being made in subsequent sections to deal with cases of temporary release.</P>
      <P>Not so very long ago I had a question before the Department of Justice. It was a case where I was anxious that a person sentenced to a period of imprisonment would be released to attend a family funeral.  The Department of Justice explained to me their difficulty in regard to it.  If the man concerned had almost finished his sentence or had more than half finished it, the remainder of the sentence could have been remitted, but it was not possible as he had only started to serve the sentence.  My suggestion was that he should be released or let out in charge of a warder.  The difficulties were pointed out to me.  The Department felt that, once he was let outside the prison, they had no power under the existing law to bring him back.  The position is different in regard to a convicted person in Portlaoise, because then he could be released on a ticket of leave or on conditions.  If he broke the conditions he could be re-arrested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> There are difficulties in regard to the section.  It is not as simple as it may appear on the face of it.  I hope the Minister will adopt the suggestion made by Deputy MacEoin and look into this matter again.  I do not like the words &ldquo;without proper authority&rdquo;. I do not know whether they have been defined or not.  I have not been able to check up on that.  The term &ldquo;released without proper authority&rdquo; is vague and uncertain.  If a person is released by someone who thinks he has authority, although, in fact, the authority may not be there, it would be very wrong if that person should be liable to be brought back again because some person had misconceived what his authority was.  I think that the words I have referred to should not be in the sub-section, and I strongly appeal to the Minister to drop them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 176:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 105, Section 238 (1) (c), line 10, to delete &ldquo;and constitution&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this amendment I propose the deletion of the two words &ldquo;and constitution&rdquo;. Section 238 provides that the Minister may make rules of procedure. Now rules of procedure are very important rules because they are rules that govern the procedure of a court-martial under the Bill.  The rules adopted under the 1923 Act were very good rules.  They lasted a long time.  Defects were discovered in them and it took some little time to cure those defects, but, generally speaking, the principles of justice were contained in the rules of procedure as they then existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section gives the Minister power to make rules of procedure governing all the matters relating to courts-martial and the sub-section I propose to amend deals with the convening and constitution of courts-martial. But the constitution of courts-martial is already set out in the Bill and for that reason I do not see why we should have a double-barrelled power stipulating that the constitution of courts-martial should be set out in <Col N="155" /> the rules of procedure.  That is the net point in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we provide that the president of a court-martial will be of a certain rank; that the president of a local or limited court-martial will be of a certain rank and that the local or limited court-martial will have a certain number of persons.  Similarly, in relation to a general court-martial, we provide for its constitution.  The very words are taken from the old Act and I can see no reason for the insertion of the words &ldquo;and constitution&rdquo; in this sub-section, seeing we have already provided for the constitution of a court-martial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Deputy that Rules 22 to 29 of the present Rules of Procedure, which will continue in operation, contain incidental matters relating to the constitution of courts-martial.  These rules are necessary and are designed to enable a court to satisfy itself that it is properly constituted according to the requirements of the Act.  If the Deputy looks at the Act he will see that the Minister may make rules, and so on. Then there is a reference to the convening and constitution of courts-martial. The actual constitution of a court-martial is, of course, set out in the Bill itself, as the Deputy has stated, and the rules cannot add anything to what is already there.  They are, in the main, merely a kind of guide or yardstick for the convenience of the court-martial itself, something to which the officers can refer if they are in any doubt.  As the Deputy has said, the court-martial is already dealt with in the Bill and the Rules of Procedure are merely there for guidance subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see the point.  It does not matter very much and I will not waste any time on it. We set out in the Bill the specific constitution of courts-martial.  Then we come along and we give the Minister power to make rules of procedure, in other words to deal with incidental matters such as the time of assembly of the court, how it will be convened, the steps taken to bring the man to <Col N="156" /> trial, the supplying of a summary of evidence and the charge sheet.  All these things cover the position.  But we set out the constitution of a court-martial and since the Rules of Procedure cannot alter that I do not like to see in another section power being given to the Minister to prescribe the constitution of a court-martial because under the Bill when it becomes law the Minister will have no power to do that. However, the Minister insists he must have the power, although I think it is not necessary.  But who am I to say that the Minister is wrong?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 177:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 106, to delete Section 240, lines 1 to 39.</P>
      <P>I propose in this amendment to delete Section 240 <i>in toto.</i>  This section deals with the punishment of certain offences committed by reservists.  This is where we come into the country, as it were. This section enables a reservist to be brought before a court of summary jurisdiction and punished.  I have a very strong objection to the section because, if it is ever put into operation, it is good-bye to the Reserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a man joins the Reserve and is out for training, whether on permanent service or otherwise, he is subject to certain regulations.  When he is subject to military law, he can be dealt with for a breach of these regulations.  But, under this section, a reservist who fails to attend a parade in Clifden, Ballydehob, Ballinalee, or anywhere else can be brought up in the local district court and charged with not attending a parade at 20 hours on Friday of a particular date.  If we are to deal with the reservists in that fashion, if we are to bring a reservist up before a district court for not attending a parade, and if the reservist has to go in there and give an excuse to the district justice for not attending the parade, it is good-bye to that member of the Reserve, good-bye to any relations he has with the Reserve, in fact it may be good-bye to the local company. If we cannot have a Reserve without that sort of business, then I <Col N="157" /> do not think it is very much good to us.</P>
    <P>It is even worse as one goes down the section.  It is bad enough to bring a reservist before a district justice for being absent from parade, but if he &ldquo;uses threatening or insulting language or behaves in an insubordinate manner to any officer or non-commissioned officer who, in pursuance of Reserve Defence Force regulations, is acting in the execution of his office and would, if such reservist were subject to military law, be his superior officer,&rdquo; again he can be brought up in the District Court.</P>
    <P>I can visualise a person who holds the rank of private in the Reserve and a person who holds the rank of corporal in the Reserve using certain language to one another on occasions, and it would be a nice state of affairs if the private were liable to be brought up in the District Court for telling a person who would be his corporal if they were both subject to military law what he thought of him.  I do not think it is very desirable from the point of view of either of them or from the point of view of the Army Reserve that we should have our local District Courts dealing with that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>If a reservist &ldquo;in reply to any notice served on him under this Act of Reserve Force Defence regulations sends any communication of an insubordinate kind,&rdquo; again he may be brought up before a district justice and dealt with.  Similarly, if he &ldquo;by any fraudulent means obtains or is accessory to obtaining any pay or other sum contrary to regulations made under Section 97,&rdquo; in other words, if he claims too much travelling expenses, he can be brought up in the District Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or, if he &ldquo;fails without reasonable cause to comply with Reserve Defence Force regulations,&rdquo; he will be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £25. There is, I think, in the Department a sense of humour, because they have a great chance of getting £25 either from the court or from anybody else <Col N="158" /> for any of these types of offences.  It also provides that &ldquo;where a reservist commits an offence under this section he may be taken into service custody.&rdquo; I am not sure how far that extends. Perhaps the Minister will explain whether, if he is absent from parade, he can be arrested for that.  Sub-section (3) provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a reservist commits in the presence of any officer an offence under this section, such officer may, if he thinks fit, order such reservist, in lieu of being taken into service custody, to be taken into custody by any member of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The next sub-section deals with the certificate which would be evidence in the court and sub-section (5) deals with what Reserve Defence Force regulations are.</P>
      <P>My objection to putting in such sections as these is that they have no basis in reality.  The Minister knows that he will never have a reservist brought up in a District Court because he fails to attend a parade and that he should have to give a reasonable excuse to the district justice for not attending the parade.  He knows very well that if a person who is a corporal uses strong language to a person who is a sergeant, both of them being civilians but the sergeant being the superior officer, and they are both subject to military law, he would not have that type of case brought before a civilian court.  If a person gets a notice and sends in a subordinate answer to it, he will not be brought up in the District Court.  If he fails to comply with Reserve Defence Force regulations, he will not be brought up in the District Court.  But the section provides that if he does any one of these things he may be brought up in a District Court and be subject to a fine not exceeding £25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that it is ridiculous to put a section such as that into the Bill, because it will never be operated.  The day you start to operate that sort of provision by bringing a reservist before a district justice to answer why he did not parade on a Friday night at 8 o'clock it will be good-bye to the Reserve.  Some of these sections are put into the Bill because there is an <Col N="159" /> unfathomable sense of humour somewhere in the Department.  I should like to know where this originated, whether it is part of the provisions that governed the old militia who were in a very different category from the young men who belong to our Reserve. The provision whereby a reservist can be taken into service custody or ordered into the custody of the Garda Síochána for breaking the Reserve regulations in purely disciplinary matters is one that, in my submission, ought not to be passed by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 11th of this month I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the following questions:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If his attention has been drawn to a report in a trade journal to the effect that in 1951 a brewery secured an increase in the price of the pint of stout by one penny through the Prices Advisory Body because the price of barley had gone up to 84/- a barrel and because the firm agreed to increase the gravity or strength of the pint by three degrees; and, if so, if he will now refuse to permit the proposal mentioned in the report to reduce the strength of the pint in order to secure increased profits at the expense of the consumer, especially since the price of barley has been reduced this year to 62/6&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That should be 63/9&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a barrel and the firm's profit last year increased by over £400,000 to £5,681,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The second question, No. 11 was:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If he is aware of a statement in the February issue of a trade <Col N="160" /> journal stating that the strength of the pint of stout is much lower than in pre-war times and if he will state if this reduction in strength was made with his knowledge and approval, and, if so, for what reasons; and if he will indicate the exact difference in the strength (a), of stout now, compared with pre-war times and (b), between the stout in question in the Twenty-Six Counties compared with the Six Counties at present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied to both questions together and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The report referred to by the Deputy has been brought to my attention.  I am not aware of any proposal by brewers generally, or by individual brewing firms, to reduce the gravity of their products.</P>
    <P>Reductions were made in the gravity of stout during the emergency period, not for the purpose of increasing the profits of brewers, but because of the necessity to conserve supplies of raw materials.  As regards the present and pre-war strength of stout, I cannot disclose information supplied to me in confidence in regard to the quality of any trader's products.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to give information regarding the gravity of stout sold elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I consider that that reply to those two questions was totally unsatisfactory. There was a conference recently between representatives of the brewers, the principal brewing company, Messrs.  Guinness, and representatives of the licensed trade, and at that conference, as the Minister is aware, there was a proposal discussed to reduce the present gravity of stout. I do not need to inform you, a Cheann Comhairle, or any members of the House, or indeed any member of the public, of the importance of this beverage to the ordinary people of this country and to the people, indeed, of many countries, so that in a matter of this kind it appears to me that a proposal of this nature is of very considerable importance.  This conference was referred to in a journal of the trade and the Minister admits, in his reply, that he has read the report of <Col N="161" /> the conference to which I referred. He stated, however, that he was not aware of any proposal by brewers generally or by individual brewing firms to reduce the gravity of their products.  In that, of course, he indulges in a bit of side-stepping inasmuch as he indicates that there was not, or has not been as yet, a formal proposal to his Department, but the fact that this proposal was discussed between representatives of the brewers and of the licensed trade is inescapable and cannot be contradicted, and that is a matter with which I am concerned&mdash;that matter and another very important one to which I referred in my question, the position in regard to the licensed trade generally in Dublin City and County regarding the price now being paid by Messrs.  Guinness to farmers who produce malting barley as compared with the price which they were paying in 1951.  In 1951, it will be recalled, the firm of Arthur Guinness and Company secured an increase of 1d. per pint in the price of stout on the basis of the fact that they were paying at that time 84/- per barrel for barley.  They also made the case at that time that they would increase the gravity of stout.  The present price of barley is 63/9 per barrel.  There has been no reduction whatsoever in so far as the price of stout is concerned, and that, in itself, to my mind, represents a very great imposition upon the publicans, who act largely, and have been acting largely since the advent of this Government, at any rate, as no more than agents for the collection of profits for Messrs.  Guinness, and upon the consumers, who have been forced to pay the increased price for the pint of stout; and it reacts, of course, adversely upon the farmers, who are getting more than £1 per barrel less now for barley, which is essential in the production of stout, than they were getting in 1951 when the increased price was agreed to.</P>
    <P>On top of that situation we have mention of this proposal to further reduce the gravity of stout, so that not alone are the farmers being imposed upon and the publicans being imposed upon but the suggestion is that there should be a further imposition <Col N="162" /> upon all concerned by the reduction in the quality of this product.  The Minister did not in my view answer my questions in the manner in which he should and it is for that reason that I am bringing these matters forward here.  He refers to what he regards as the undesirability of disclosing information supplied to him in confidence in regard to the quality of any trader's products.  I would like to know why should there be any in confidence disclosures in a matter such as this to the Minister.  Why should not the public know what is the difference now in the gravity of Guinness's product as compared with pre-war?  What reason is there for it?  There is no good reason that I can see and no good reason that the public can see.</P>
    <P>This firm made £400,000 more last year in a period when publicans have been forced, many of them, into bankruptcy, during a period when the City of Dublin and the County of Dublin publicans are finding it almost impossible to keep their doors open because of the falling-off in trade which has resulted from the increased price which has had to be charged to the consuming public by reason of the policy of the present Government, and particularly by reason of the Budget of 1952 when, as we all know, the tax on this product was increased.</P>
    <P>The Minister in reply to a supplementary question of mine of 11th March in regard to this colossal profit made by Messrs Guinness indicated that this firm had its headquarters in London, the implication evidently being that this profit was not made entirely in this country but was made elsewhere. I am strongly of the opinion that it could be very easily proven that a very great proportion of Messrs.  Guinness profits is made in this country.  I have not heard of any other country in the world where they are producing porter and stout in such great quantities as they are produced here, so that we may assume that the additional profit of £400,000 which they made last year was very largely at any rate, taken from this country, taken from the working people of this country through the agency of the publicans who, as I say, in many cases have been reduced to <Col N="163" /> the position of being no more than profit collectors for Messrs.  Guinness.</P>
    <P>Messrs.  Guinness made £5,500,000 last year in all their activities.  I think it is most unreasonable, therefore, that there should be any suggestion of a reduction in the gravity of stout.  I do not think it would be at all unreasonable for the Minister to take any steps in his power to bring about a situation whereby Messrs.  Guinness should plough back at least some of the colossal profit which they made, into this country by a reduction in the price of stout as supplied to the publicans.  I think that that is something to which the Minister should give attention.  I do not think it is incorrect to say that this firm has a monopolistic stranglehold on the licensed trade here.  It seems from the report in the journal to which I have referred that they do not propose to brook any interference whatsoever with the profits which they have been making over a long period.  That as far as I am concerned is wholly and entirely objectionable.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by a very reliable authority, who has many years' experience in so far as the licensed trade in Dublin is concerned, that a recent examination of 30 accounts of Dublin City and County publicans showed that whole cash receipts increased by 6.2 per cent., as a result of the 1952 Budget and as a result of the increase in the price of stout, the net profit of these publicans fell by 50 per cent.  There is this comment made by the gentleman, and I think it is worthy of consideration and of notice: &ldquo;This means the virtual overnight destruction of the equities of hundreds of small vintners and a critical reduction in the value of the equities of all Dublin vintners.  In effect, the Dublin trade is, but for the withholding of bank action pending the Budget, due to experience the greatest crash since the period after the Boer War.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is obvious exploitation, to my mind, so far as this brewery is concerned, and it is time some steps were taken in regard to that exploitation. It is most undesirable that any proposals <Col N="164" /> of the nature which I have mentioned in the question, should even be considered by the bodies concerned. The Minister has not indicated to me in his reply what his attitude is likely to be in so far as proposals for a reduction in the gravity of stout are concerned.  I should like to know from him, if there is such a proposal, will he take a firm stand in the matter to ensure that no further exploitation of the consuming public or those who sell Guinness's stout will take place?</P>
    <P>Those are the matters which I want to raise here to-night.  They are, as I said, of very considerable interest to many people outside the House.  I do not know what plans the Government has in so far as the Budget is concerned, in regard to the price of this popular beverage.  It may well be that an effort will be made to regain lost ground by a gesture towards the licensed trade and towards the consuming public.  I am not concerned with that; it will not matter anyway because it will be too obvious an effort to capitalise politically, for the people to be deceived by it.  Certainly, I think that the Minister should determine that no further exploitation of those who are engaged in this trade will be tolerated and that the suggestion that is made in the report referred to will not be even considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like when he is replying if he would indicate what steps it is proposed to take to bring about a reduction in the price of the pint which as I stated before in this House on another occasion, though it might be regarded by some as a luxury, by many hundreds or thousands of people who work hard, manual workers in this country, is not considered a luxury.  While it could not be described as a necessity, it is something in the nature of an amenity to which they have become accustomed. Because of the machinations that have gone on, so far as the brewers are concerned, and because of the attitude of the Government&mdash;their utter disregard of the consuming public and the publicans as well&mdash;great hardship has been caused.  I submit that it is necessary that the Minister should indicate <Col N="165" /> what is in store in regard to this particular matter for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I gathered that Deputy Dunne read the report, which appeared in the paper called the <i>Licensed Vintner and Grocer</i>, of a conference between the representatives of the Licensed Vintners and Grocers Association and the Irish Brewers Association but he does not appear to have read the report very carefully.  I know nothing about the matter except what appears in the report but it is clear from it that, while a suggestion was made by the vintners that they should get an increased profit margin from the brewers through a reduction in the gravity of the stout sold, the brewers were strongly opposed to that suggestion. I told the Deputy that I had no information of any proposal by the brewers' association or by any individual brewery to reduce the gravity of the stout as sold.  I do not know that I should even consider the consequences of such a proposal until it is made.  So far as I know, the brewers are strongly opposed to the whole suggestion and it is most unlikely that the proposal will ever be made.</P>
      <P>The Deputy wants to know what is my attitude.  On the same day as he addressed the question to me, he addressed a question to the Minister for Finance and he was told that if the gravity of stout was reduced by one degree, the Exchequer would lose £200,000.  Does he want any more information than that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dunne said that the brewers got an increase in the price of stout in 1951 because the price of barley went up.  That is not the whole story. In 1951, the brewers applied for an increase of 17/6 in the price of a barrel of stout because their costs had gone up&mdash;not merely because the price of barley had gone up but because all their costs had gone up.  The Prices Advisory Body considered their application and recommended that they should get an increase of 12/6 a barrel, provided they increased the gravity of stout by three degrees.  I am assuming that the Prices Advisory Body went carefully into the whole question of the profits made by the <Col N="166" /> brewers and that they made their recommendation on the basis that only reasonable profits were being earned. Since then, there has been a reduction in the price of barley, it is true, but other costs have gone up and the price of barley does not alone determine the costs of producing stout.</P>
    <P>The Deputy who is now pressing for a reduction in the price of stout did not note or did not refer to the statement made at that conference on behalf of the brewers' association that, if the price of stout was reduced, small brewers would be forced out of business immediately.  I do not know if he would regard that as a desirable situation.  I cannot say if Messrs.  Guinness could carry a reduction in the price of stout on their Irish trade, but it is quite clear that, if they did reduce the price of stout, every other brewer would either have to follow suit or abandon the prospect of getting sales.  We know that every other brewer would be unable to continue in business, so that there would be only one brewery left and a very large number of workers would be unemployed. We do not think that is a desirable situation to provoke.</P>
    <P>The reference to the profits of Messrs.  Guinness is, of course, completely misleading.  Messrs. Guinness are an organisation with headquarters in London and they have a world-wide trade.  It is true that they operate a brewery in this country, but the profits to which the Deputy referred were made on the whole of their trade throughout the world.  I am assuming that their profits on their Irish trade are reasonable because the Prices Advisory Body examined that position in 1951 and have examined the position on any occasion on which it was referred to them since; but, even in relation to the Irish brewery of Messrs.  Guinness, the Deputy is no doubt aware that by far the greater part of their production is exported. We could undoubtedly take action which would put the firm out of business, but I think it would be a big loss to the country to do so and the Deputy would have some difficulty in explaining his advocacy of that course to the many thousands of workers whose livelihood would be affected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> So far as the gravity of stout is concerned, there is no proposal to reduce the gravity.  Every indication that was given of the attitude of the brewers showed their opposition to the proposal.  It is, therefore, most unlikely to be made by them.  The position of the industry, as revealed by this report, indicated that there was a desire on the part of the vintners to get an increased profit margin.  It is possible that the vintners have a good case to make for that.  I do not know whether they have or not.  They had at that time a proposal that the price of stout to the public should be increased, so that they would earn an increased <Col N="168" /> profit margin.  I understand they have abandoned that proposal and, according to this report, published in the <i>Licensed Vintner and Grocer</i>, it was decided that two associations, one representing the vintners and the other representing the brewers, should approach the Minister for Finance to discuss the position with him.  Whether that approach to the Minister for Finance will have any repercussions in the Budget is something which the Deputy must wait and find out when the Budget comes in.</P>
