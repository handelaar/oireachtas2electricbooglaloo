      <P>A grant has been sanctioned by my Department towards the cost of the erection of a new school to replace the present Mell National School, Drogheda.  The arrangements for the erection of the new school are in the hands of the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Because of the increasingly heavy programme of work involved in connection with the erection of new schools and the enlargement and improvement of existing schools and of the pressure on the architectural staff of the Commissioners of Public Works it necessarily takes the commissioners a considerable time to complete the arrangements which have to be made by them subsequent to the sanction of grants, in order to enable tenders to be invited and contracts to be placed.</P>
      <P>When the commissioners have had working drawings and a specification for the new school at Mell prepared they will be in a position to invite tenders.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to say, at this stage, when building is likely to be commenced or when the new school is likely to be ready for occupation, but the preliminary arrangements for its erection will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>

Críochnaíonn an scoilbhliain an 30 Meitheamh.  Dá bhrí sin ní féidir do na cigirí tosnú ar an obair fhiosrúcháin is gá a dhéanamh roimh mhí Iúil agus is beag fiosrúchán a bhíonn ar a gcumas a chríochnú roimh na laetheannta saoire scoile.</P>
      <P>Níl san obair fhiosrúcháin a bhaineas leis an ndeontas £5 ach aon ghné amháin de chúram na gcigirí.  Toisc fairsinge na gceantar is troime iarratas ar an ndeontas agus toisc an ollmhéid fiosrúcháin is gá do chigirí na gceantar sin a dhéanamh, ní fhéadfaidís deighleáil leis na hiarratais uile roimh an Nollaig fiú dá gcaithidís a gcuid ama ar fad leis an ngné sin dá gcuid oibre. Tuigim go maith amhthach go mb'fhearrde dá mbéadh an deontas íoctha roimh Nollaig agus féachtar i gcónaí lena íoc roimh an am sin leis an oiread teaghlach agus is féidir.  Is oth liom nach bhféadaim geallúint a thabhairt go n-íocfaí leo uile é roimh Nollaig in aon bhliain amhain.

As to the second part of the Deputy's question, my Department has no funds at its disposal out of which it could contribute to the cost of such publicity.  The question of a contribution from the Dairy Disposal Company would be a matter for the board of that company but I feel sure they would be prepared to fall in with any arrangements which the co-operative creamery societies may decide upon as regards contributing to the cost of the publicity campaign.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state whether on 23rd September, 1947, he confirmed, on appeal, the refusal of the Council of the Borough of Dún Laoghaire to grant permission for the erection of a house on a site at Vico Road, Dalkey, and, if so, if he will state the grounds on which the council refused permission and the grounds on which he confirmed the refusal; further, whether his determination is final or whether the council may revoke their decision refusing permission to build without reference to him and in disregard of the grounds on which he determined the appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 23rd September, 1947, the then Minister for Local Government determined an appeal against the decision of the planning authority in this case, which decision was made on the ground that the proposal would be contrary to the council's policy that no more houses should be permitted between the Vico Road and <Col N="792" /> the sea.  The refusal of permission was confirmed on appeal because the Minister considered that the proposed house would seriously detract from the scenic amenities of the area.</P>
      <P>Section 59 (3) of the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934, provides that the determination by the Minister of an appeal is final on that particular appeal.  It is, however, open to a proposer or any successor of such proposer to submit further proposals on which the local authority is free to decide afresh and on which the Minister has appellate jurisdiction if any appeal against such decision is made to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Further, can the Minister state is it now to be regarded as the position that in regard to the policy of a council under the Town Planning Acts where a decision is made and, on appeal, confirmed by the Minister it is possible by what amounts to a very hurried meeting to get that whole policy reversed and without any proper regard to the interests of the public in this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so. Each appeal is taken separately.  Once a decision is given by the Minister that is final but, if new plans are submitted which differ from the original plan, then a fresh appeal will lie to the Minister from any decision of the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

I do not agree that it would be more expeditious to write direct to the local authorities for such application forms as are necessary.

The Minister can tell you that both himself and your humble servant have devoted a good deal of time to this whole matter since we went to the Custom House in the beginning of June.  I requested senior inspectors to come to the Department at the end of June and made plain to them what was reasonably required of them.  I do not pretend to the House that everything is perfect.  In fact, only two weeks ago, as a result of the receipt of a well-founded complaint, I requested a Department inspector to start on a tour of the headquarters of every housing inspector and he is on that job at the moment.  In one case, where, after several warnings, an inspector was found not to be doing his job in the way expected of him, I regret to say that disciplinary action was taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. T.F. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I shall take Questions Nos. 41, 42 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>When in Cork in August last I discussed with members of the Cork local authorities, including the Deputy, the fact that voluntary hospitals in Cork had ceased to provide services for children sent for treatment under the school medical service.  I suggested that the parties concerned should come together to see whether they could settle between them the difficulties which had arisen and I offered to send officials of my Department to assist in any way they could.  While the question whether or not members of the corporation and the county council should attend at the discussion was not specifically raised, I was left with the impression that it was the wish of the meeting that the two bodies concerned should be represented by their officials. I have since confirmed that the city manager who, it was agreed, should endeavour to convene the discussion, was left with the same impression. The meeting was convened by the city manager and was held on 27th October.  The question of the amount of fees payable was not discussed at the meeting.  Any expenditure under the school medical service is, of course, dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947.</P>
      <P>I am advised that at the meeting agreement was arrived at in principle for the provision of services in respect of city children, but not in respect of county children.  The county council has written to the authorities of the hospitals concerned, but I understand that replies have not yet been received. The Munster Ophthalmological and Laryngological Society has stated, however, in a letter dated 11th instant to the council that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;it has instructed its members not to participate in the working of any school medical service scheme, with the exception of the temporary <Col N="805" /> arrangement with the corporation, until a complete scheme for these services is submitted to and approved by the society&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for consideration by the council, in the first instance, what steps it will take to fulfil its legal obligations regarding the provision of institutional and specialist services.  I and the officials of my Department will be prepared to help in every way possible and I am meeting a deputation from the Cork County Council to-day to discuss the matter with them.  I should perhaps mention that I understand that certain difficulties have arisen regarding the implementation of the scheme agreed at the conference in respect of city children.</P>
    <P>The number of children examined under the school medical service in Cork County since 1st January last was 6,059.  I have asked the county council for the remaining information required by the Deputy, but in the time at my disposal I have not been able to obtain it.  If he wishes, I shall convey the information to him by letter, or if he repeats his question next week I hope to have the information available.</P>

I was told that the conference was being postponed and, actually, the manager, before I came to Dublin the day the Dáil met, invited me to it.  The meeting between the doctors and the representatives of the corporation and the county council and the hospital was postponed until the medical officer for Cork City, who was away for the month of September on holidays, would be back.  It was not called until the 27th October &mdash; the day the Dáil was <Col N="806" /> assembling.  I was summoned as a representative of one of the voluntary hospitals&mdash;not as a representative of the corporation.  I got no notification from the corporation nor was any member of the county council, as such, notified.  I had previously asked the question in the Minister's presence so as to find out whether or not public representatives would be there.</P>

Statutory powers are available to the Minister for Health under the Health Act, 1947, in regard to the labelling or description of food in respect of which standards are fixed under Section 56 of the Act.  In the absence of evidence that there is a significant risk to the public health due to the harmful nature of the ingredients of sausages on sale to the public, it is not proposed to deal with this food by regulations under the section.

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should, in the exceptional circumstances of this year, make an arrangement with Grain Importers (Éire) Limited to purchase at a fair price, all wheat rejected as unmillable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion was put down by members of the Fianna Fáil Party in the past week in order to get the Minister for Agriculture, if it is possible to do so, to do his duty by the farmers of this country who have unmillable wheat on hands and who have not been able to dispose of it.  At the end of the last month and early in this month Deputies from this Party asked questions from the Minister about unmillable wheat.  On the 3rd November he was asked by Deputy Moher and other Deputies from this Party if he proposed setting up any <Col N="809" /> organisation for the purchase of unmillable wheat.  His reply was taken to be in the negative, that he did not propose setting up any such organisation or making any provision whatever to take the considerable amount of unmillable wheat which, owing to the very bad harvesting weather that has just passed, farmers have on hands over the whole country.</P>
    <P>I submit it is the absolute duty of the Minister for Agriculture to use the machinery of his Department to make provision for relieving the farmers, at a fair price, of this unmillable wheat. On the 3rd November, he told Deputy Moher:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the circumstances, I do not propose to arrange for the purchase of unmillable wheat by Grain Importers, Limited, or other central purchasing organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the same day Deputy Ormonde asked him:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;whether, in view of the very high percentage of unmillable wheat and the prospect of much of this wheat rotting, he will set up an organisation which would deal with the problem and which would consider the possibility of part of the milling industry's equipment being used for the purpose of turning the unfit wheat into animal fodder&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister answered:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not propose to set up an organisation on the lines suggested. The drying facilities of the milling industry are at present being operated with the main object of saving potentially millable wheat. Up to the present, where circumstances permitted, quantities of unmillable wheat have been accepted by the millers, and, so far as my Department is concerned, every effort is being made to ensure that such drying facilities as it may be possible to divert for the drying of unmillable wheat will be available to farmers to have such wheat dried for disposal as animal feed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister will admit, I am sure, that up to the moment, as far as the House is aware and as far as the people of the country are aware, no <Col N="810" /> provision whatever has been made to take over this wheat.  Various estimates have been put forward of the amount of unmillable wheat in the country.  In particular areas it is set as high as 30 per cent. of the acreage grown and it is down as low as 5 per cent. in other areas.  Taking it at 5 per cent. would mean about 40,000 tons of unmillable wheat in the whole country, which would be a very conservative estimate.  Forty thousand tons of unmillable wheat is a very considerable amount and many farmers found themselves in the unfortunate position this year that all their wheat was rejected as unmillable by the millers. I will come to the millers later on.  I have something to say about those gentlemen, too.</P>
    <P>The farmer has grown his wheat.  He probably got the seed and the manure on credit, and he may have taken conacre at a high price or it may have been on his own land.  Nevertheless, he has this unmillable wheat on hands &mdash;some of it for six or seven weeks&mdash; which was sent back from the mills, sometimes over a distance of 60 to 70 miles and thrown in the farmer's yard. Neither the Minister for Agriculture nor his Department were the slightest bit concerned whether 50 or 200 barrels of wheat rotted or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>With your assistance, I will make my case.  Deputy Murphy will be given an opportunity of solving <Col N="811" /> all these difficulties for his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture.  It can be established quite clearly that there is on the hands of the farmers of this country a large quantity of what has been designated by the millers of this country as unmillable wheat.  A large portion of it is undried and is fast deteriorating.  It will become nothing but a heap of manure in a very short time unless something is done about it.</P>
      <P>It is the bounden duty of the Minister for Agriculture to use the machinery of his Department and whatever agencies may be in the country to purchase that wheat, and enable the farmers to have it dried and processed into animal feeding stuffs.  The nation, apart altogether from the individual farmer, can illafford to lose anything between 40,000 and 100,000 tons of grain because of the utter negligence of the Minister and the contempt he has for the farmers and for wheat-growing.  On Friday last, after this motion was put down the morning daily papers came out with a big black heading: &ldquo;The Minister's plan for wet wheat&rdquo;.  He got a plan for wet wheat on Friday last after Fianna Fáil put down this motion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>He got the plan on Thursday, a day earlier.  The newspapers published on Friday the fact that he had a plan for wet wheat.  Wet wheat has been in existence in this country since the early weeks of September.  The harvesting of wheat commenced some time towards the end of August, continued through September and up to last week or the week before.  There is probably a small amount of wheat here and there not harvested yet.  Wet wheat did not become available on the 12th November; we had it on the 12th September and even earlier.  The Minister refused publicly here to make any provision for assembling and drying it and for paying farmers a fair price for it.  He did nothing whatever about it.  Several organisations of <Col N="812" /> farmers approached the Minister and the Department over the last two months, but he sat back, he had no policy, he was indifferent to the problem staring him in the face. There are areas where it is claimed that at least 30 per cent of the total wheat grown has been refused by millers as unmillable &mdash; whether that is true or not.  I am sure the Minister has ways and means of checking up on that.  He must know from the millers and assemblers the percentage rejected.  I am sure he has the figures; if he has not, he should have.  This motion has not been put down in any political sense whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely and simply trying to force the hand of the reluctant individual who now holds the portfolio of Minister for Agriculture &mdash; to force his hand and that of his Department, to request him, to beg him, to beseech him on behalf of the wheat growers who have a very serious problem that the Minister does not seem to appreciate.  Some of them are faced with absolute bankruptcy &mdash; I am sure the Minister is aware of that&mdash;to merchants and people who have given them seed or manures and for their many other debts, to pay which they were depending on the wheat harvest. They see the wheat rotting before their eyes, yet the Minister sits back unconcerned until the middle of November doing nothing about this wheat that has been harvested over the past two months.  It is his bounden duty to come to the rescue of those farmers who had the unmillable wheat on hands and take it off them and pay a fair and adequate price for it.  It is a valuable product, it is as valuable dry as the maize meal we are importing, though it may be classified as unmillable.  It is worth as much money to the nation as an animal feeding-stuff that we are importing from thousands of miles away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to give serious consideration to this.  Many members of his own Party sitting behind him are as much aware of this problem as the <Col N="813" /> Deputies on this side of the House. They are moving amongst the people who have grown this wheat and who, owing to the unfortunate weather, found it was damaged and found they were unable to get a buyer for it.</P>
    <P>Farmers are in an unfortunate position this year &mdash; a doubly unfortunate position &mdash; because they have in office a Minister for Agriculture who is hostile to wheat-growing and has always shown it; and they are unfortunate because of the tragic weather we had for the last two or three months.  They are unfortunate, also, because they have millers who, in the main, are hostile to native wheat-growing. It is not to-day or yesterday that the farmers became aware that the majority of the millers who deal with the milling of wheat for flour are hostile to Irish wheat.  They have shown that in no uncertain way and they have shown it more fully this year than ever before.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that in each mill where wheat is going in he should have a representative, a man capable of knowing what millable wheat is.  He could get someone from the farmers' organisations who would know what millable wheat is, but I suggest he put in an officer of his own who knows what millable wheat is. That man should act on behalf of the farmers and if a miller wants to reject any particular sample and if in the opinion of that officer it is millable, the miller should be compelled to take it.  The farmer has no redress, no appeal court at the present time against the millers and against the arbitrary action many of them are taking against farmers about particular samples of wheat.  We hear it all through the country.  Only yesterday I met a farmer, a neighbour of my own, who told me he sent a load of wheat last week and three sacks of that lorry were all that was taken by the miller. He kept the lorry load for two or three days in his shed and did not even unload it; he put three sacks more on it and the full load was taken three days later &mdash; the very same wheat that was cast three days before.  That is happening all over the country.  These are things that the Minister should not allow to happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> The farmers are very vulnerable at present and have been so for the past six weeks in the matter of what the miller may take as wheat.  You have all kinds of discrepancies between one miller and another.  A miller has been known to refuse wheat and another 40 miles away will take the same wheat.  That should not be allowed to happen.  It is the bounden duty of the Minister for Agriculture to see that these farmers are not unfairly treated.  They have risked their all in growing a crop of wheat.  We are asking nothing in this motion or in the suggestions that will be made but what is reasonable and what is due to the agricultural community.  Wheat that is reasonable, that can be said to be millable, should be taken by the millers.</P>
    <P>One morning newspaper last week announced the Minister's wheat scheme, but the Minister himself has made no official announcement, nor has his Department, and the farmers do not know whether a scheme is in operation or whether the newspaper was drawing on its imagination. Assuming that the scheme comes into operation, we want to ensure that the millers will not be able to take advantage of such a wet wheat scheme and designate all wheat from now on as wet and buy it at half its value. We want the Minister to ensure that. That is another reason why he should have a capable milling inspector at the mill, day in and day out, so as to prevent the millers putting it across the farmers and rejecting wheat as unmillable and paying a lower price for it.  It is the Minister's duty to safeguard the farmer's interests.  He has not done it up to now but has sat back, showing utter contempt for the whole thing.</P>
    <P>We know that wheat-growing in this country has been a burden and a nuisance to the Minister.  We know it has been a burden to others also.  We know that quite recently the Trade Union Congress was very vocal against wheat-growing in this country.  Perhaps they could throw their minds back four or five years.  It is not so long since we had an emergency, when everyone <Col N="815" /> was glad to see the Irish farmer, without manure and without machinery, trying to produce wheat to feed the people.  They are getting very poor thanks for it now.  We had hostile elements &mdash; the Minister for Agriculture, the millers, the master bakers and now the Labour Party and Trade Union Congress.  They joined the ranks of the other elements hostile to wheat-growing. Things have come to a sorry plight.  Certain elements of the Press over the last five or six months have been talking about the burden that wheat-growing is on the community. You have a line-up there.</P>

I will ask now that the Minister should treat this matter seriously and take even belated action so that the farmers will hear his melodious voice soon.  He has been the most silent Minister in the Government for the last three or four months and people are wondering why.  They love to hear his voice sometimes and like to get his opinion on things.  They like him to say publicly now and again that he will defend their interests whether it be wheat or beet growing.  I hope the Minister will answer the motion and announce that a wet wheat scheme is coming into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had rather hoped the Opposition would have approached this motion with a genuine desire to help but from the first speaker one could only deduce that not only is the motion unnecessary but that it is approached in a mischievous and unprincipled manner.</P>
      <P>When the present Minister for Agriculture assumed office, his first action was to realise that his duty was to find for the Irish farmer the best price he could get for all his produce and get the farmer his raw materials at the lowest price at which he could buy them abroad.  He has always adhered to that and in his approach to the present motion he has adhered to it also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion states that it is the opinion that owing to the exceptional circumstances of this year an agreement should be made with Grain Importers, Limited, to purchase at fair prices all wheat rejected as unmillable. We must consider what benefit would accrue to the Irish farmers.  What and who are Grain Importers?  Grain Importers are an agency in an office in Dublin.  They possess no drying facilities, no storage facilities and no staff except an official staff.  They have no machinery with which to dry wet wheat and therefore they must employ somebody to dry it and the persons they must employ are those who own drying machinery and who have storage for the wheat.  Those people whether we like it or not, are the people who rejected the wheat in the first instance.  If Grain Importers do buy this wet wheat they must employ on commission the millers and dryers to handle it and there is a very strong parallel between the manner in which they would handle it and in which they handled &mdash; the Government having instructed them to do so &mdash; the position regarding the surplus of feeding barley last year. <Col N="818" /> There was a surplus of feeding barley last year and the Government had guaranteed a price of not less than 48/- a barrel for it.</P>
    <P>When the surplus became evident it was necessary for the Government to see the farmer got his 48/- and they employed Grain Importers as an agency to purchase this feeding barley. The barley was purchased on commission and 48/- a barrel was paid and Grain Importers also paid out to various agents, sacking commission, handling commission, drying commission and eventually storage commission. When the losses on that barley were assessed it was discovered that the barrels which had been bought at 48/- must be sold at 64/-.  That loss was not borne from Government funds. It was borne &mdash; and I challenge any member of the Opposition to deny it &mdash; by the Irish farmer because that barley was married financially to the maize which is being imported, and an Order was made whereby any farmer or milling compounder who bought maize must take 50 per cent. of barley with it.  The maize which was being imported at £29 a ton at the time was sold to the people at £32 a ton.  In other words, every farmer's wife and every farmer who bought pig meal, layers' mash or any compound feeding stuff of which maize was a constituent, paid a levy which balanced the loss of the Government and Grain Importers on the feeding barley.  Does the Opposition wish to pay an unnatural price for this wet wheat and recoup the losses from the farmers who wish to buy pig meal and layers' mash, etc.?</P>
    <P>I come from a grain growing county and I would not be a party to taking money out of one pocket of the Irish farmer and putting it into another.  I believe that each and every aspect of agriculture should be in a position to stand on its own feet after the Government has made its arrangements to deal with it individually.  Therefore, I believe, Grain Importers can make no practicable contribution towards wet wheat.  The only manner in which Grain Importers could make a contribution would be if the Government afforded them means to <Col N="819" /> recoup their losses by giving money from the Exchequer.  I would like to remind the House that the Minister for Agriculture who has just been described as being disinterested in wheat, half way through this season made a change in the moisture content deductions which has brought to the Irish farmer a sum of £150,000, or 1/6 a barrel for 2,000,000 barrels of millable wheat accepted.  I would like the members of the Opposition to realise that and to remember that Mr. Dillon's approach to wheat-growing in this country is very different from what they have assessed it to be.  Deputy Allen has stated that all that happened was that, in a newspaper, a statement was made that Mr. Dillon had a plan to take care of wet wheat.  Certainly he has a plan to take care of wet wheat.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Allen had also read the newspapers, he would have discovered that the Minister for Agriculture had expedited that plan and that it has the effect that at any point of intake where the accommodation is available wet wheat can be sold.  Deputy Allen put the poser to the Minister: &ldquo;Was it as valuable as maize meal?&rdquo;  I will not answer that for Deputy Allen, but I tell him that at the price arranged by the Minister with the buyers of wet wheat, the farmer is getting as good a bargain as can be made in the circumstances and that the Minister's pledge to get for the Irish farmer the best price he can get in any part of the world is being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to worry the Opposition with figures, but if they will take the moisture content of the wet wheat, if they will strike a fair average, find its price, put down a commission for drying, deduct the loss in weight, they will discover that the difference between maize at £27 per ton and wet wheat, when dried to a moisture content comparable with that of maize, is very little.  With regard to whether or not in the circumstances Grain <Col N="820" /> Importers, Limited, would still be the proper persons, leaving out the probable loss that would accrue to the Irish farmer, to handle wet wheat, I know that last year these barleys which were bought at 48/- a barrel and sold at 64/- a barrel and on which the Irish farmer bore every penny of the loss, were railed from as far as 200 miles from the point of intake to the point of milling.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's agreement with the millers and driers at the present moment leaves them holding that baby and the Opposition would be well advised to leave them holding it and not to endeavour to introduce Grain Importers Limited into the position. I therefore submit that the Minister has made a great contribution towards wet wheat.  The Minister has done his best in all the circumstances and in the worst year that this country has ever experienced, he has produced a most wonderful result for the Irish farmers and his Department is to be congratulated.</P>
    <P>I submit that the motion should not receive any hearing from right-thinking Deputies and that Grain Importers (Éire) Limited would make no contribution to the present position with regard to wet wheat.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that I cannot see the position through the same rose-tinted spectacles as Deputy Donegan and I would like to give briefly what I might describe as the background to this matter.  I think a very great contributory factor has been the attitude adopted by the cereals section of the Department of Agriculture in trying to prevent or discourage the provision of drying facilities by farmers in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say that the <Col N="821" /> Minister has been badly advised in this particular direction by those people competent to advise him, and it is a strange situation that in this country we have an opinion expressed on this matter which is contrary to the general practice in England.  We have a complaint from the British Ministry of the slowness of farmers to provide drying facilities for wheat over there.  There is no encouragement whatever given here.  Of course, there is a very good reason because there is a handsome profit accruing to a certain section because they are permitted to have a monopoly of storage and drying.  That attitude is not peculiar to wheat-drying; it is a general attitude adopted, unfortunately, by the Department of Agriculture under various Ministers.  They have here the idea that the brains trust of Irish agriculture should and must be centralised in Merrion Street. They accept the idea that farmers down the country have not the intelligence or the competence to direct and undertake a lot of matters which are directly controlled by officials and to undertake facilities which are taken over and commercialised at a handsome profit to others.</P>
      <P>I submit that if the farmers here were given something like 11/6 a barrel for drying wheat and something like 1½d. a barrel for storing it, we would have, in addition to the large plants, a very great number of supplementary plants and a substantial increase in storage accommodation; but, since this important matter is a closed shop to the agricultural community, we are faced with an emergency like this.  We have all the chaos and all the confusion associated with centralisation in this matter.  If the big growers, certain people in the grain areas, were encouraged to provide drying and storage facilities, we would find that many of the contingent problems which have presented themselves in this emergency would be non-existent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question of the Minister here a couple of weeks ago and the reply I got was what I would describe as a dressed-up negative.  The Minister had no answer except to assure the farmers that on receipt of a halfpenny postcard by him he would have their wheat dried within 48 hours.  I looked upon that as being absolutely no solution because the Minister well knew that at that particular time every drying-plant in the country was working to full capacity trying to salvage wheat which had not yet been rejected as unmillable.  As the mills were working like that, the question arose as to whether it would be fair to divert drying-plants to the treatment of rejected wheat as against wheat in regard to which a possibility existed of its acceptance by the millers.  The Minister's assurance of course implied the utilising of drying facilities far removed from the particular farmer concerned, because if the drying facilities locally were being used for the purpose of drying wheat not yet rejected by the miller, they could not be available for the drying of wheat that had been rejected.  That posed an unanswerable question first of all as to the distance wheat has to be moved and secondly as to who was to bear the cost.  That was the problem as I saw it and I should like to hear from the Minister in his reply some indication as to what extent his offer had been utilised.</P>
      <P>One farmer's organ described the Minister's reply and his attitude on that occasion as that of a fiddling Nero and I think that pretty well summed up his reply from the practical angle.</P>

      <P>The situation is, as I say, that it is incumbent on the Minister, in view of the chaos that exists, to take such action as will save the farmers from beggary and ruin.  The Minister is well aware of the acuteness of the problem.  He is well aware of what is happening.  We all know of instances.  It is no use saying that the <Col N="824" /> wheat can be utilised this way or that because, first of all, a statement appeared, I think it was on last Friday, in which there was a report of an interview by the millers' representatives with the Minister and in which it was implied that 47/6 a barrel was to be paid for rejected wheat.  I want to make one point in connection with rejected wheat.  That is that there must be some system of grading and some purchasing authority which will decide what wheat is worth.  Wheat with a moisture content of over 30 per cent. might reasonably be worth 47/6 but let us take dried wheat rejected by the millers on the glutin test.  That, surely, is worth far more than 47/6 a barrel. I have consulted somebody who would be competent to give some idea of what the price should be and he gave me a figure of between £25 and £27 a ton.</P>
      <P>That is why it is all-important that some central agency should be appointed to purchase wheat&mdash;rejected wheat&mdash;on account of the varying nature of the wheat rejected and on account of the varying prices as animal foodstuffs.  It is only through a central agency that you can strike a mean price for rejected wheat.  If such a thing is not done, if the farmers are left to be exploited by every gangster and racketeer that can get hold of them we know what is going to happen.  We know that in many instances they will not get 47/6 a barrel because wet wheat, undried wheat, is deteriorating, constantly deteriorating, and no Minister of State can say that after two or three weeks that wheat will be worth 47/6 a barrel because the supposed purchaser may say: &ldquo;I am taking a risk with it; it has deteriorated to such an extent that it is mouldy and may be poisonous.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the position that exists and that is the position to which the Minister has got to address himself.  Again I want to bring to the Minister's notice the fact that the millers have been allowed to become and continue to be the sole arbiters as to the moisture content and as to the bushelling of wheat and as to general millability. <Col N="825" /> We know of certain mills where lorry loads of wheat have been rejected on the glutin test and have been transferred elsewhere and accepted.  I put it to the Minister that suppose some of that wheat which was primarily rejected in one mill and accepted in another was to be sold at 47/6 a barrel would that be equity; would it be fair?  Sprouting grain, sodden grain, and wheat rejected on a glutin test are very distinct products and nobody in fairness or equity can strike a mean price.  It cannot be done and it cannot be handled except by some central purchasing authority.</P>
    <P>One particular instance was brought to my notice where two combines were working in a field of wheat and two lorries drove away from that field on the same day and delivered wheat to two different mills.  In one instance the price was 57/- and in the other 74/-.  That is some indication of what is going on.  That is some indication also of the considerable amount of wheat which has been rejected and is at the moment, and for two weeks past, deteriorating in the hands of the farmers.  Deputy Donegan made the point that this could be fed to live stock.  The conacre farmers have no live stock.  Then there are farmers who have live stock but have no storage facilities.</P>
    <P>In connection with millable wheat there is 11/6 for drying and handling and something like 1½d. a barrel for storage.  With rejected wheat there is nothing.  There is just the bare 47/6, and that is for stuff that is unusable as well as wheat that is dried and rejected.  I submit the Minister's approach to this whole problem shows a compete lack of sympathy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely believe that the Minister's approach was an insult to the farmers.  It was making a mockery of the serious problem affecting them, a problem which was bringing chaos and ruin about them, to merely say: &ldquo;Just send me a halfpenny postcard and I will dry it and you can do what you like with it afterwards.&rdquo;<Col N="826" /> That was very much the Minister's attitude.  It did not show any serious thought or consideration of the problem.  The Minister may refer to any documents he likes.  I am giving him a general impression of the situation that exists from my own experience as a Deputy living in a grain growing area.  In my own feeble way I am trying to drive home to the Minister the urgency of the problem. The problem cannot be solved by advising a miller to pay a certain price.  The mills are already chock-full of wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Very early in the season we were informed that the general manager of the Irish Sugar Company was offering drying facilities in the factories in the grain growing areas.  An estimate of the drying facilities available there would be something like 2,000 tons per day. Those facilities were offered early in September, so far as I am informed, and were refused.  They were offered again prior to the company starting preparations for the beet campaign and were again refused.  Had the Minister and his advisers had the foresight then to have accepted those facilities the subsequent problem which manifested itself a few weeks later would have been rendered much less acute.  But neither foresight nor forethought was applied to that offer. The offer was refused with disastrous consequences for the people in those areas in which the beet factories are located.  Beet is not a perishable crop to the same extent that wheat is. Everybody knows that the progress of the beet campaign was contingent upon clearing the mess in the corn fields. The general manager of the Sugar Company was aware of that when he made his offer.  It was a grave mistake to turn down that offer for its acceptance would have afforded some solution to the present problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to adopt a more sympathetic approach to this problem confronting grain growers all over the country and to examine the <Col N="827" /> problem with a view to finding some solution which will provide some recoupment for the labour and anxiety suffered by our farmers during this wretched harvest.  There should be an end to exploitation.  Statements have been made that Irish wheat is the dearest in the world and those have been taken up and hammered by two newspapers, one in Cork and the other here in Dublin.  We all know the facts. We know that actually of the main wheat producing countries in Europe we produce the fourth cheapest wheat. I will submit the list: Netherlands, 62s.; Denmark, 65s.; the United Kingdom, 75s.; Ireland, approximately 81s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debate one would imagine that all the Minister had to do was to get Grain Importers to handle the rejected wheat, and everything would be grand.  I am afraid that is not the solution.  Indeed, it is far from being the solution.  As Deputy Donegan pointed out, Grain Importers is an office and not an organisation.  They have no facilities for either handling or drying grain and, if they come into the picture, they will merely provide yet another cog in the wheel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> I think what the Minister has done so far is the best that could be done in a very serious situation.  We should realise that and we should not try to play politics with the situation.  It is a serious situation for the farmers. There is no doubt about that.  Our farmers have passed through one of the most severe harvests ever experienced. Because of that a certain amount of wheat is being rejected. The amount is not very considerable. I have experience of an intensive grain growing area and the amount of wheat rejected in that area is very, very limited.</P>
    <P>On the one hand we have the millers and every drying plant in the country loaded to capacity, drying and handling millable wheat.  Does the Opposition want that situation changed? Is it the desire of Deputies opposite that the rejected wheat should be handled and that fit for human consumption let go bad?  I do not think anyone wants that to happen.  The millers will have to continue handling the wheat fit to turn into human food.</P>
    <P>The arrangements made last week with the Minister and the millers whereby they agreed to take this rejected wheat are working out satisfactorily. I have known cases in my constituency where this wheat has been taken from the farmers and is being handled by the millers.  To put the Grain Importers organisation into it will not help in the least.  It will only complicate matters because it will result in a situation similar to that which arose in the handling of feeding barley.  They will have to get their expenses and eventually they will get them from the pockets of the farmers. If this present arrangement works&mdash; which I believe it will&mdash;we will overcome this very serious problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moher referred to places where farmers have succeeded in getting the grain dried and he asked the Minister if they would still get only 47/6 a barrel for that grain.  That will not happen.  I saw an offer to-day of £25 a ton for rejected grain which was dried.</P>
    <P>All that has been said so far by the Opposition is utter nonsense&mdash;that the <Col N="829" /> Minister is so prejudiced against wheat-growing.  If that were the case, he would not have modified the moisture clause&mdash;a provision which has meant a great deal to wheat growers in this very serious year.  If the Opposition were as much concerned with wheat-growing as they claim to be, they would have made an honest effort, before the season commenced, to see that there were proper drying facilities all over the country.  No effort was made and we have the reflection of that to-day.  If there had been adequate drying facilities to deal with the difficult harvest the grain would have been handled.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain &ldquo;pile-up&rdquo; with grain.  We were lucky to the extent that the bad weather was spread over such a long period.  If we had not had such bad weather, and the grain had come in faster, the position would have been worse.  There would have been a very serious &ldquo;pileup&rdquo; and a lot of that grain would have a high moisture content and would not stand if it were not handled within a short time.  I believe that a very serious situation has been handled reasonably well and that the amount of losses in the grain-growing areas is very small indeed; that is, as far as rejected wheat is concerned, it is very small.  I was speaking to a purchaser of grain in my constituency this morning and he told me that he had only two cases of rejected grain and he would be handling 40,000 or 50,000 barrels of wheat.  What has happened is that in some districts where wheat should never have been grown, and where it is still standing and has not been harvested, the grain is being rejected.  There is not a great deal of sympathy for some of the people concerned. They were people who thought they would get rich quick by growing grain and they rushed in and grew hundreds of acres and had no machinery to handle it.  When the weather deteriorated their corn was left there.  There are some people, and I am one of them, who have not a great deal of sympathy for anyone in that situation.  A person who has been growing grain and who has made an honest effort to secure machinery <Col N="830" /> to handle it, even in a season as bad as this, has lost very little.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen, the mover of the motion, said the amount of rejected grain was as high as 30 per cent.  That is nonsense.  It is nothing like 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his handling of the situation so far. Undoubtedly, it was very difficult because adequate drying facilities were not available.  Deputy Moher referred to the fact that farmers were prevented from providing drying facilities themselves.  He compared the situation here with that in Great Britain where farmers have their own drying facilities.  The two countries are not comparable because in England there is a large number of very big growers who grow thousands of acres and it pays them to erect drying facilities. The average grain grower here is not in a position to provide such plant for himself and has not the storage facilities.  I do not think that these facilities will ever be available here. There is a possibility that the smaller type of dryer similar to the dryer supplied by the E.S.B. may prove an attractive proposition for a farmer to dry the grain that he will keep, but it will never happen here that the farmer will dry the wheat he is going to market.  I hope we will never again witness a harvest like the recent one. The farmers have been calm, in spite of their experience, and if the situation is dealt with calmly the results may be reasonably good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made no attempt to organise his Department or the farmers to put them in a position to deal with the sodden wheat.  Contrary to whatever the Government or the Minister may assert we on this side of the House assert that roughly one-third or more, perhaps, of the wheat crop will be a dead loss this year through the incompetence of the Minister and the Government to give a lead in this matter.  It is not a matter for cheap sneers or gibes in this House.  I think the motion should have been put down earlier but it was not until now that the chaos that has existed in the handling of the wheat crop as a whole was revealed.  The Minister is not even too sure at the moment what price is being paid even for millable wheat.  In my area I have known farmers who <Col N="832" /> have sold millable wheat for as low as 55/- per barrel, not to mention unmillable wheat.</P>
      <P>There was no attempt made, as I said at the outset, to organise the various services which could have been utilised to help out in this crisis.  What was to prevent the utilisation of the smaller mills throughout the country to deal with unmillable wheat?  They might not have been able to handle a large proportion of the unmillable wheat but they would at least save some of it from going to loss.</P>
      <P>I can recall to the House that at least in my area you have ten or 12 kilns which could be utilised to dry unmillable wheat and which would preserve it from going rotten.  They are now closed.  The kiln heads would have been quite suitable for the purpose I mention.  The services of millers who are quite capable of milling wheaten meal&mdash;the very best of wheaten meal&mdash;were not called into operation.  No mention of it was made by the Minister, the Department, the millers or by anybody else.</P>

      <P>Deputy Carter concluded by referring to my predecessor, Deputy Thomas Walsh, whose absence, owing to illness, from to-day's debates we all greatly deplore and whose early restoration to complete good health we all sincerely hope for.  I get the impression that this motion has fallen flat.  I have great sympathy with the Opposition. I have often had this distressing experience myself.  A trap has been prepared, the quarry sighted and, at the eleventh hour, something has gone wrong.  Then you have to face the Dáil with this infernal motion on the paper and put the best face on it you can.  I do not mind confessing now that, since last Friday, I was curious to know what on earth are they up to, what is the purpose of the motion.  Then, when Deputy Allen had opened the indictment, I turned to my colleague, Deputy O. Flanagan, and said: &ldquo;This motion has dropped dead before it ever got walking.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is a mistake to drag the unfortunate farmers of this country through the mire of political recrimination at a time when they are having an extremely rough time of it. We all know that anyone who has been struggling to save crops for the past three months here has undergone martyrdom and it does not matter very much what crop he was in face of&mdash; oats, barley, wheat or potatoes.  What I should like to say in the first place is that what constantly dazzles me in the agriculture of this country is the astonishing capacity of our people to meet adversity and to struggle through it and to come out far better than you imagined it was conceivably possible for them to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me remind the House that any blame that is due must properly fall on my shoulders, as Minister for Agriculture, and any credit, for the same reason, must be attributed, within the procedure of this House, to the Minister for Agriculture for the time being. <Col N="837" /> I want to say, as Minister for Agriculture, that, confronted with the season through which we are passing, I consider that our handling of the wheat crop has been a miracle of success.  I ask Deputies opposite, is it or is it not true that it was confidently prophesied a month ago that the streets of Dublin would be blocked with the queues of lorries that would be outside the mills&mdash;and not only in Dublin but all over the country?  Was that not prophesied?  Has there been a single queue uncatered for in any part of Ireland?  Is it not true that we were told that 30 to 50 per cent. of the wheat crop would be lost?  I challenge contradiction upon this: that, of the 1,700,000 barrels of wheat taken in at the mills to date, less than 3 per cent. has been rejected as unmillable.  I regard that as no mean performance.</P>
    <P>The text of this motion is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should, in the exceptional circumstances of this year, make an arrangement with Grain Importers (Éire) Limited to purchase at a fair price, all wheat rejected as unmillable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But, at this moment, no farmer need contact Grain Importers.  No farmer need enter into any correspondence or negotiation with anybody farther away than the nearest mill to his own farm. If he goes there with his wheat, he has the certainty that, if it is millable by any criteria, it will be purchased from him at the fixed price in accordance with the schedule and, if it proves to be unmillable, it will be taken at a price which Deputy Moher says is so good that he cannot believe the millers will ever pay it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>What price?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>47/6 to 50/- a barrel according to the quality of unmillable wheat.  Deputy Moher expresses apprehension that farmers will not get 47/6 per barrel for unmillable wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I made a distinct difference between a fixed price of 47/6 a barrel for wheat rejected, with over 30 per cent. moisture, and wheat <Col N="838" /> that was dried and rejected solely on the glutin test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood Deputy Moher to say that he was gravely apprehensive that farmers would not get from 47/6 to 50/- a barrel according to the quality of the unmillable wheat.  Is that not amazing when you consider what they have been through? Cross your heart and hope to die, did it not take the breath out of you? Listen to one another talking to-day and there are some Deputies in Fianna Fáil who are as eloquent as other Deputies in this House: did you not make a fluthering bad case for your own motion?  Why?  Because you know perfectly well that there is no substance in it.  I ask you this question for an honest answer.  Is it better to put at the disposal of every farmer in Ireland every mill in Ireland to buy his wheat at 47/6 to 50/- a barrel in the event of its being unmillable or to ask a farmer with unmillable wheat on his hands to enter into correspondence with Grain Importers to buy it from him?  Which is the more convenient arrangement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Deputy Carter will not leave for a moment.  He is on record as saying that he knows a number of his neighbours who had to sell their wheat for 20/- a barrel.  I want to ask Deputy Carter, as a responsible public representative in this country, for the names and addresses of the men who sold their wheat for 20/- a barrel&mdash;and the names and addresses of those who bought it.  It is Deputy Carter's duty to give those names.  Deputy Lahiffe, who is now sitting behind Deputy Carter, will remember that on a previous occasion, in the discharge of his public duty, he honestly gave to me the names of seven constituents of his in East Galway who, he said, had difficulty in disposing of their barley. I think he will agree that, within 24 hours, every one of them was visited and received an invitation to place their barley at the disposal of an officer of my Department for prompt sale.  I was grateful to Deputy Lahiffe for giving me an opportunity of testing the veracity of the complaints he had received.  I think Deputy Lahiffe did what a public representative is <Col N="839" /> bound to do, that is, to say: &ldquo;I got these complaints.  It is my duty to tell the Minister for Agriculture about them and to ask him if he is going to make good his undertaking.&rdquo;  I think Deputy Lahiffe will confess that, in so far as it lay within my power, it was done.  If he is a conscientious public representative he has a duty to tell me the names of the men who sold their wheat for £1 a barrel and what I want much more is the names of the men who bought it.</P>
    <P>Now Deputy Carter has another tale to tell us here.  He says within a few miles of his own home there are ten kilns well able to dry wheat, while there are hundreds of farmers with their wheat rotting on their hands and nobody can get the kilns to dry the wheat.  Has Deputy Carter given me the names of one of these kiln owners? Has he written me a line to tell me of that dilemma?  Has Deputy Carter taken out his own bicycle and ridden to the door of one of these kiln owners to say: &ldquo;Will you not light up your kiln and dry your neighbour's corn?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the members of the Fianna Fáil Party are honestly concerned for farmers struggling with difficulties, for their own neighbours, would you not think that before coming into this House caterwauling on a Thursday afternoon, that where they knew there were ten kilns idle within a few miles of their own house which could relieve their own neighbours' difficulties, they would do one of two things: send me a postcard asking me to get them working or take out their own bicycles and cycle around ten miles and say: &ldquo;Would you please light your kiln and help the neighbours whose corn is rotting in their lofts?&rdquo;  Deputy Carter has not used postcard, bicycle tyre or shoe leather, and yet he comes in to rebuke me.</P>

      <P>That is what he told me himself.  When I asked: &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;  His answer was: &ldquo;I am not Minister for Agriculture.  Why should I do anything?&rdquo;  I am very proud of what I have done.  I did not deal with <Col N="840" /> one grain grower at a time; I have been struggling to provide for the grain growers of every parish in Ireland.  If Deputy Carter wants to charge Deputy Hughes with jettisoning the conacre man let me say this: when I see a gentleman come into this country, take 800 acres of conacre land, tear it all up, plant it with wheat and present a bill to our Government for the consequential product with the intention of skipping out of the country, I do not care what happens to him.  I am not going to break my heart about what happens to that fellow. He came in here to make a speculation and to get rich quick at our people's expense.  If his speculation has not come off, the devil mend him, as far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>I have spent the last six weeks day in, day out&mdash;and I will ask Deputies in this House to remember that when I say &ldquo;I have spent&rdquo; I mean the Department of Agriculture has spent, and when I say &ldquo;I am proud of my achievement&rdquo; I mean that I am proud of the achievement of the Department of Agriculture&mdash;in that sense I have worked 15 or 16 hours a day for the last six weeks to see that wheat was handled and taken off the hands of farmers, not in one parish but in every parish in Ireland, and I dare any Deputy in this House to say we failed. The wheat was taken, the wheat was dried and now we are in a position to say, millable or unmillable, it will be taken and paid for from anyone who tenders it to any mill in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I could go into a much wider field if I chose to-day but you have ruled and the Ceann Comhairle has ruled that we are to deal with the motion put before us, that is,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should, in the exceptional circumstances of this year, make an arrangement with Grain Importers (Éire) Limited to purchase at a fair price, all wheat rejected as unmillable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have done much more than that and we are proud of the result of our labours.  Let us remember&mdash;and all Deputies will agree&mdash;that we encountered probably the worst harvest weather in living memory.  Our prime <Col N="841" /> concern must be for genuine farmers and not for speculators who are in a racket to get what they can out of it. On that basis I await to hear from any Deputy in this House an honest challenge to the performance of my task in helping farmers who grew wheat or any other cereal this year to get their crop disposed of at the best price obtainable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The case has been made that when the question of millable or unmillable wheat comes to be determined there should be some arbiter other than the miller and the farmer to determine what is millable or unmillable.  I want to say quite frankly that in logic there is no answer to that claim and, in evidence of that, I am free to say that I sent for representatives of Macra na Feirme and said, and I think I said it to the representatives of the grain growers' branch of the Beet Growers' Association: &ldquo;Turn this matter over in your mind and consider this question as to whether you want to undertake the installation of an arbitrator at every point of intake for wheat in this country, but bear in mind what it involves.&rdquo;  I reckon that, taking into account wheat agents, licensed millers and licensed wheat dealers, there must be between 300 and 400 points of intake for wheat.  If all these are to be furnished with an arbitration officer it means you have to have between 300 and 400 of them.  Bear in mind that in a shockingly adverse year of this kind lots of fellows will feel they would have done better if they had a third party there to arbitrate between them but recall that over a very long period wheat was being delivered into the mills in this country and the number of complaints were very few. What will happen if arbitration on these lines is established?  The farmer will bring his wheat to the mill and the licensed dealer or miller will estimate its moisture content, and so forth.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between the farmer and the miller and they cannot reconcile it.  Then the arbitrator comes in.  What can he do?  He must take a sample, a representative sample to the satisfaction of farmer and miller <Col N="842" /> and then the wheat passes into the mill and the price to be paid for it ultimately to the farmer will be deter mined by a test of the sample.  A third of the sample will go to the farmer, a third to the miller and a third to the Department.  That last third will have to be tested by experts in the seed-testing department for moisture content and other relevant points.  They are scientists and they will be bound by no rule but the rule of objective, literal scientific test.  They will apply the letter of the law of moisture content, millability, maltose content and glucose content.  They will report on that and on that report the farmer will be paid.</P>
    <P>I think farmers would be well advised to consider well whether in the average normal year they would do better under that system or under the system which has obtained heretofore. Think of this.  In a normal year a licensed wheat agent or a wheat dealer gets his living by handling the farmers' wheat.  He does not want to acquire the reputation in his district of being a stiff, cranky man.  On the contrary, he wants his neighbours and the farmers from further afield to say: &ldquo;If you go and deal with Pat So-and-so he will treat you fair; if the wheat is good he will take it and give you full credit for it.&rdquo;  He does not want to get the reputation: &ldquo;If you go to Pat So-and-so he will always say your wheat is 1 or 2 per cent. damper than any other miller would say.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The licensed wheat dealer or agent wants to handle wheat; the more wheat he handles the better off he is. The interest of the dealer and agent is to give the farmer the best price he can afford to get for it, because if he does not the farmer will go elsewhere. Remember, this year we had cases of farmers being offered a price by a dealer far less than he thought was fair and taking his wheat elsewhere and finding another mill which treated him much more leniently.</P>
    <P>If, however, you set some system of arbitration&mdash;and in my opinion the claim cannot be resisted if it is pressed upon any Minister for Agriculture&mdash;the arbitration will have to be based upon <Col N="843" /> the cold, objective, scientific assessment of the sample submitted.  I will leave it to the farmers themselves to determine whether under that system they would do better than under the system which obtains at the present time.  Wheat in great quantity has been accepted this year with moisture contents over 28 per cent. and up to 33 per cent.  Do not let us forget that when the Beet Growers' Association, Grain Section, was discussing this matter with my predecessor &mdash; and bear in mind they had in contemplation a normal year &mdash; their view was that they were not interested in what befell wheat which was tendered for sale with more than 28 per cent. moisture content.  I think that for a normal year that is a reality.</P>
    <P>Now, I am charged with having treated the wheat growers with contempt, with indifference, with harshness; and the facts are that their own representatives are on record as stating that in their judgment wheat with a moisture content in excess of 28 per cent. was not fit to mill and ought not to be bought by any miller.  That was the view of their own representative. The Minister for Agriculture, who is supposed to be the enemy of wheat growers, who is supposed to have treated them with indifference, harshness, and callousness, in fact required and secured that the millers would buy a very large percentage of the total volume of wheat tendered with a moisture content of between 28 and 33 per cent.  I have told you the percentage of wheat which was rejected as unmillable &mdash; less than 3 per cent.  I am not going to tell the House what my estimate is of the percentage of the total volume of wheat which was accepted at between 28 and 33 per cent. moisture content, but when the whole crop is in, if anyone wants to check on that we can go into it.  I would ask the House to remember that, applying the criterion of the wheat growers' own representative, that should not be regarded as millable wheat at all.  I insisted that it should.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the House this, and it is as well you should know, as I <Col N="844" /> believe in telling you everything.  The point was put to me that if these grades of wheat were taken, unless there was dilution of the bulk by wheat of a lower maltose and higher glutin content, the resulting bread would be inedible and would create a prejudice against the whole policy of wheat growing.  I agreed to permit the miller to bring in a certain percentage of wheats whereby to dilute the Irish wheat purchased with a moisture content of between 28 and 33 per cent., so as to ensure that the quality would be reasonably good for the bread users of the country and that the Irish product would not come to have a shocking reputation amongst those who were ultimately required to eat it.</P>
    <P>As I understand the job of any Minister for Agriculture, when he is on the hustings he places his policy before the country, he asperses the policy of his antagonists and he abides the judgment of the people when the polls are taken.  But once he is Minister for Agriculture, he is Minister for Agriculture for every farmer in the country.  My duty was, whatever a farmer's problem, to help him to sell his crop for the best possible price that he could secure.  I challenge any wheat farmer in Ireland in public now to prove that there was anything left undone, night or day, since the first sheaf of wheat was cut last September which could have been done to alleviate the distress under which he had to labour as a result of the appalling weather with which we all have had to contend.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that every single small or large farmer who is growing wheat or any other crop on his own land had a right to call on me for all the help that I could give to get him through his difficulties.  Every Deputy had not only a right but a duty to call on me to help any farmer whose circumstances they knew of.  Some Deputies did call on me and I do not think they called in vain.  I think it is true to say that some Deputies on the other side of the House called on me and I do not think they called in vain.  I deplore the action of those Deputies who knew distress amongst <Col N="845" /> their neighbours and would not call on me.  They knew perfectly well they had no need to call on me personally if they did not wish to do so; they could call on the Department without reference to me at all.  But they were equally certain that if they wanted to call on me personally they were as welcome as the flowers in May; their right to do so was most readily conceded and their representations were most welcome, if they were a contribution to put anything right that was wrong.</P>
    <P>I want the House to bear this in mind &mdash; Solomon himself could not claim that no mistakes were made, that there was no miscarriage of our plans in any part of Ireland.  Of course there were; there were cases in which farmers were getting a raw deal; but I like to make the boast that no single such case was made to me without his grievance being redressed within 24 hours of my coming to know of it. Bearing in mind my corporate capacity I want to say I am proud of that performance. I am proud to be able to claim that no single case was reported to me of a farmer getting a raw deal, or being left in the lurch where help was not brought to his door within 24 hours of the information coming to me.</P>

      <P>Before you came into the House, Deputy, I qualified that, when I said that when I spoke here I took the blame for what the Department does.  Therefore, I am bound to take the praise for what it does, too.  I want to issue this invitation to all Deputies on all sides of the House: if you hear of anybody who is getting a raw deal or less than his rights, you know where to come, and I would say to Deputies of this House that you have not only the right but the duty to come and let me know.  But I cannot put right what I do not know about and, even when I do know about it, the best I can do is my best to put it right.  That will be done, and it is as true in the case of the smallest farmer with his rood of wheat as it is in the case of the largest farmer with his acres of wheat.  But I am bound to add this: that when the speculators <Col N="846" /> come rambling into me to ask me what I am going to do to help them to salvage 800 or perhaps 1,000 acres of conacre wheat which they planted in the hope of making a kill &mdash; and they are now afraid they will not be able to make a kill &mdash; my inclination is to tell them to go to blazes.  But I have not done so, because I think that when you are in the public service you ought not to give way to your natural inclinations as frankly and as fully as a private individual may, but I have no sympathy with these people.  I have great sympathy with the man struggling with what he believed to be a sound business proposition when he sowed his crop and through no fault of his, he is now in grave jeopardy of sustaining grave loss.  The entire resources of my Department are at that individual farmer's disposal to minimise that loss and, if possible, convert it into a profit for him.</P>
      <P>I do not understand Deputy Allen. Usually when I hear him speak in this House, although I never &mdash; or very rarely&mdash;agree with him, I can always follow the trend of his discourse and understand at least what he is asking for even if I do not agree with him.  But what does Deputy Allen mean in moving this motion by saying &ldquo;hundreds of farmers have large quantities of unmillable wheat on their hands and they are not able to sell it?&rdquo; How are they not able to sell it?  Let me quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 12th instant:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon, Minister for Agriculture, met representatives of the flour millers in Dublin yesterday and asked that a special effort be made to deal with non-millable wheat by taking it from the farmers, drying it and storing it for conversion into animal feeding.</P>
      <P>The millers, it is understood, expressed willingness to come to the aid of the farmers as speedily as possible but a large quantity of wheat suitable for milling has not yet reached the mills although much of the grain requiring urgent attention has been dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The millers are prepared to reserve portion of their drying equipment <Col N="847" /> for the non-millable grain and farmers could help by not rushing to the mills wheat which has not been gravely damaged.  The mills would wish to give preference to grain known to be rain-soaked.</P>
    <P>A price of from 47/6 to 50/- per barrel will, it is stated, be paid for the grain, which is said to be reasonably good in the circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the matter with the hundreds of farmers that Deputy Allen knows with unmillable wheat on their hands that they will not bring it to the nearest miller&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>From 47/6 to 50/- according to the condition of the grain, but if Deputy Allen is complaining about the poor men who cannot dispose of it at any price, would not Deputy Moher think they would go to the nearest miller&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a salvage price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Moher has his tongue in his cheek when he says that.  Indeed, I think the price &ldquo;took the breath of him&rdquo;.  In any case what I am querying is why Deputy Allen says he knows hundreds of farmers with unmillable wheat and they are not able to sell it at any price.</P>
      <P>I honestly came in here with every conceivable aspect of the situation examined from stem to stern and I could not foresee what case the Opposition were going to make and I was rather at sea in trying to prepare to answer them, but the truth is they have said nothing.  I want to give this House an instance of some cases where I do not believe, to say the least of it, the approach is conditioned by <i>uberima fides</i>.  This case comes from County Wexford.  It was a telegram which said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon, Department of Agriculture: Have 100 bags of wheat, no drying facilities available&mdash;your suggestions, please?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to read out the fellow's name or address, but if Mr. X of <Col N="848" /> County Wexford would go 25 yards down his own street there was a man there who would dry all the wheat Mr. X could bring him.</P>
    <P>My inspector went down the following day and this fellow's wheat was dried and returned to him.  He was living within 50 yards of a dryer that we knew was in a position to dry the wheat.  Does he walk 50 yards to inquire if he can get his wheat dried? No, he sends me a wire:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon, Department of Agriculture: Have 100 bags of wheat, no drying facilities available &mdash; your suggestions, please?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I hate to be uncharitable but I wonder who wrote that telegram?  I know the man who sent it.  Those are the words that are in it and it was from County Wexford and if he challenges the authenticity of it and gives me permission&mdash;but only if he gives me permission&mdash;I will be glad to give his name and address.  Those are the facts.  I would like to ask Deputy Allen who wrote that telegram?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say this much: I had to phone the Minister for Agriculture one evening fairly late.  He very kindly told me he would have the information on the following day and he went to the trouble of phoning me in Cork City and giving me the information.  I think that is due to him.  I would also like to say, from my experience this year &mdash; and we all know what the season was like: I do not think we have ever had a season like it before for the harvest and I hope we never again will &mdash; that in so far as the Department of Agriculture could help out, they helped out and they did, in my opinion, a damn good job.  I have no hesitation at all in saying that.  I am not concerned with the gentleman who gambled and of whom the Minister has been speaking.  I am concerned with the very large number of my constituents who have millable wheat and who have got it dried and who now have it on their hands.  I <Col N="849" /> remember reading an article &mdash; by Professor Sheehy &mdash; at the start of this bad season, in which he stated that unmillable wheat for animal feeding was worth £27 a ton.  That was the value he put on it.</P>
      <P>We had an experience of this description once before &mdash; I admit it was not one-tenth as bad as it was this year&mdash; but we had a bad experience in this regard.  Winter wheat in particular will shoot when growing, and we had that experience some years ago.  I remember coming here to the then Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Ryan, with that problem and that was the reason why I phoned the Minister recently, because at that time there were certain regulations and prohibitions on the use of wheat for animal feeding.  I consulted some local millers who said: &ldquo;If we get a licence to convert that wheat into wheat flakes, we can get a market for it and we can pay a fair price for it.&rdquo;  The difference in price then between millable and unmillable wheat was £4 per ton.  We came up to Dr. Ryan and he said: &ldquo;Yes, I will give the licence.&rdquo;  He gave the licence and the wheat flakes sold like hot cakes; they disappeared off the market in the course of about six weeks.  We have a far larger quantity this year of that type of wheat.</P>
      <P>We were informed here recently that because we had to bring in foreign pollard and foreign bran the price of the pig ration went up by practically £5 per ton.  I saw questions by Deputy Allen on that matter and I saw the replies given, and I am suggesting to the Minister &mdash; as I said, I am not concerned with the gentleman who came in and drew 800 acres &mdash; that I am concerned with the farmers in my county, the tillage farmers who have been growing wheat, beet, potatoes and root crops, and who now find the bulk of their harvest left on their hands, not through their own fault.</P>

I like to give credit where credit is due and I was thankful to the Minister for the manner in which he treated the matter.  But I am coming down to this point: what should be the price paid for unmillable wheat dried?  I am suggesting to the Minister that these people should not be thrown to the wolves with a price of 47/6 per barrel. I am making a straight suggestion to the Minister, and I have told him the class of people with whom I am concerned &mdash; the man who is dependent on his harvest to pay his merchant and to pay his rates and who now finds himself with a loft full of grain, or with grain in bags in his haggard, with no market for it, unless he accepts the market offered to him which, to my mind, is not a case of robbing the rich to pay the poor, but of skinning the poor &mdash; the men who find themselves in this awkward position and of whose financial circumstances advantage is being taken.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would have patience.  I do not wish to do anything that would be unfair and I am not trying to do anything that is unfair.  I am suggesting to the Minister that he has a machine in Grain Importers, Limited, who are, I understand, a non-profit-making concern, <Col N="852" /> which he can use to purchase from all farmers, who have it on hands, their unmillable wheat.  I see no reason why it is not done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do suggest to the Minister quite frankly that his price is ridiculous.  It is after all the price of what is a superior article to either bran or pollard or maize meal.  A very distinguished professor, Professor Sheehy, has stated that it is worth £27 a ton.  That was the price he put on it in the Farmers' Journal last month.  I suggest that the Minister would buy it at £27 a ton, and I suggest also that he will find himself, with God's help, in the same position as his predecessor, Dr. Ryan, when he bought the oats, and when he gave out instructions with regard to wheat.  Let us get into this problem quite frankly. The Minister will not get unmillable wheat by offering 47/6 a barrel for it. I wonder what Professor Sheehy would have to say to the gentleman who puts up that argument or who tells him, as the Minister has said, that if he holds the wheat for a while he might get 50/-a barrel.  If that is the remedy the Minister has to offer I would suggest that he would change it and consult the officials of his Department on that particular matter and announce that Grain Importers, Limited, are prepared to purchase all unmillable wheat at such a price.  I suggest that Professor Sheehy hit about the right price.</P>

      <P>No.  No.  He can get up to 50/- for any unmillable wheat now, according to quality.

      <P>Therefore, the Minister will lose nothing if he does what is suggested in this motion.  Let us get rid of the camouflage and get down to what the people want.  I have explained the position here as a farmer and as one coming from a very heavy grain district.  I am asking the Minister&mdash;I suggest he should hold the consultation, in which he is now engaged, afterwards&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only saying that the Deputy is as cute as a Christian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have the Minister's straight reply as to whether he is going to do it or not.  The suggestion I am putting up is a reasonable one.  It was a proposal that was <Col N="854" /> adopted previously with great success by the Minister's predecessor.  I remember a period here when oats could not be sold.  It was unsaleable, and was left in the farmers' hands.  We appealed to the then Minister, Dr. Ryan, and he issued instructions immediately to Grain Importers, Limited, to purchase the oats at a certain price.  The oats was purchased and the State financed the purchase and there was not 1/- lost.  I remember in later years when the Minister was over there.  He had told the people of the country to grow oats, and no market could be found for that oats. The following harvest, we had to wait until nearly Christmas until the Minister was sent to America and the acting-Minister came along and bought the oats and did what we asked him to do.  We do not want that to happen in this case.  The farmers, as I said, want the money to pay their accounts. They have lost enough &mdash; the difference between £27 a ton and the price which in the ordinary course they would get. Thank God the farmers in my area always grew oats and wheat that fetched top price and bushelled top, and they have lost enough this season. I am asking the Minister to come to the rescue; I am asking him now to do his job.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is so anxious to rescue the farmers, as he pretends, he can rescue them by paying them a fair price for the wheat that is unmillable.  Is it not better to pay them than to pay the foreigner for muck?  In the ordinary course the supply of bran and pollard produced here is only sufficient for a couple of months and, when it is exhausted, we have to import.  This year when the time came for importing the price of the ration jumped £5 per ton.  I do not know what the price was that was paid for foreign bran and foreign pollard brought in here, but surely dried wheat is superior to either and is worth a better price than either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all the Minister's manoeuvres I do not believe he is turning a deaf ear to the case I am making.  I believe he will do what I have asked him.  I have faith in the Minister; I think he will do what I have asked him.  I think it is the natural and reasonable thing <Col N="855" /> to ask the Minister to do.  I do not think I am asking him to do anything unreasonable.  I am sorry the Minister has not announced the price for next year's wheat.  He promised he would do so in October, and we are anxious to get it.  I come from a grain growing area in which a large quantity of wheat is being left on our hands.  Some of us were lucky and got rid of the lot.  Others were not lucky and they are being left with wheat on their hands, through no fault of their own but merely because of adverse harvesting conditions.  What is the position? Will the Minister sit quietly by whilst unmillable dried wheat is bought at 47/6 per barrel?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not confuse the issue.  The farmers are entitled to bring their unmillable wheat to the mill and they will there get 47/6 per barrel for it.  Do not spread the word throughout the country that any miller has the right to turn a farmer away if his unmillable wheat has not been dried before he brings it to the mill.  The wheat will be taken from the farmer if it is unmillable and, if it is in any reasonable condition at all, he will get 47/6 a barrel.  That does not apply only to dry wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not give a hang for the Minister's 47/6.  The farmers I am dealing with are the farmers who have paid through the nose at the rate of 3/6 a barrel to get their wheat dried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not confuse the issue.  All farmers bringing unmillable wheat to the mill can now have it taken off their hands at a minimum of 47/6 a barrel.  Let me repeat&mdash;unmillable, not dried millable wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Minister to fix a price for unmillable dried wheat.  There are farmers who, helped by the Minister, have rushed all over the country and got the wheat dried.  The wheat is now dried wheat. They will not sell that wheat at 47/6 a barrel.  They will not put it in the loft, as the Minister has suggested, and keep it for a couple of months and then sell it at 50/- a barrel.  They will not do the one or the other.  I <Col N="856" /> suggest that that wheat is far better for animal feeding than any bran, pollard or maize.  Even if the Minister comes down to the jokers with the foreign barley, native wheat is still far better as a feeding stuff for animals.</P>
      <P>The problem that the farmers have to face is the fact that they want an immediate market.  Neither the merchant nor the rate collector will wait.  I am asking the Minister to provide that market.  I think it is his duty to provide it.  I go further and I say that, even if it was never his duty, I believe he will provide it.  For pity's sake, forget the fellow with the 800 acres.  Forget him for the sake of the decent farmers who have answered the request of the Government to produce more.  After all, it was a request from the Government that they should produce more.  They have produced the wheat.  Unfortunately, through no fault of the Government but merely because of forces over which we have no control, we had here a harvest this year unparalleled in the history of this country.  The farmers have lost enough. Do not rob them.  I hold they are being robbed when the Minister suggests that if they hold that dried wheat for a couple of months they will get 50/-a barrel for it.</P>

I do not grudge him trying to dig himself out if, in digging himself out, he will answer the question I put: namely, what is a fair price for dried unmillable wheat?  That is a fair question.

I did not deal with what has happened here, there or elsewhere.  I am dealing with the position in which we find ourselves. The motion before the House asks the Government to make an arrangement with Grain Importers to purchase at a fair price all wheat rejected as unmillable.  I would suggest, a Cheann Comhairle, that I am keeping strictly to the motion.  I am not going into what happened at the mills. What happened at the mills has passed and, please God, it will never happen again, because next year we will have a man in every mill who will see the load weighed, who will see the wheat bushelled and who will take the moisture content, the same as we have in the Sugar Company, and there, thank God, things are working out amicably.  We will have the same <Col N="859" /> thing in the mills next year and there will be an end to this condition of affairs.</P>
      <P>The problem that we are faced with is a serious problem for the agricultural community.  It is a serious problem for the men who have had their harvest, as I said, thrown on their hands.

      <P>I shall not go back on it but I wish to call the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister has not answered it.  I am quite satisfied to leave it at that.  There are reasons why we should have an early decision on this matter, very definite reasons. I wish that the Minister, before he leaves the House, would give us that answer.  Apparently he will not.  He can dodge around the corridor for another bit.  I hope he will not go to America this time.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House, I have put the case as clearly as I can in the time at my disposal, and I only hope that we will have some definite decision on it.</P>

      <P>He can afford to play act because he told us he was fortunate enough himself to get the top price for his wheat.  The motion is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should, in the exceptional circumstances of this year, make an arrangement with Grain Importers (Éire) Limited to purchase at a fair price, all wheat rejected as unmillable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry did not tell us what he thought a fair price would be for it. Other members of the Opposition wanted to know what we thought was a fair price.  They did not tell us what they thought was a fair price. Deputy Corry quoted a professor who said that a fair price for unmillable wheat would be £27 per ton.  That is a difference of roughly 15/- a barrel between the minimum price which has been arranged with the millers and what Deputy Corry's professor said would be a fair price.  Deputy Corry did not tell us &mdash; I hope some of those who are yet to speak on this motion will tell us &mdash; from where or from whom <Col N="862" /> is the additional 15/- per barrel to come.  Who is to pay it?</P>
    <P>Of course, it would be much more than 15/- per barrel if it were bought by Grain Importers, Limited.  Anybody who knows anything about the organisation in this country for the purchase, delivery, the storing and the drying of wheat, even in a normal year, would laugh at this motion. Earlier one of my colleagues said that as far as Grain Importers were concerned all they had was an office. What machinery would Grain Importers use to implement this motion if the House were foolish enough to pass it?  Would they not have to get the agents and the buyers the millers employed throughout the country?  Would they not have to utilise the storage and the drying facilities that are available?  Would they not have to use the whole of that machinery?  This year, when time is a vital factor, the only suggestion we can get from the people on the opposite side is that in regard to the great delaying factor and that this additional cost should be planked on.</P>
    <P>The motion is absurd and unreal. There is not a Deputy here but knows that.  Deputies will themselves admit that this whole debate was unreal. The fact of the matter is that the Deputies have been completely bewildered by the fact that the Minister made an infinitely better arrangement for the farmers than either we on this side of the House or Deputies on the opposite side thought it was possible to make.  Let me repeat what has been said and what everybody knows. This has been the worst year in living memory.  There was not a Deputy in this House or a farmer outside it who lived in or came from a representative grain-growing county but thought that we were going to have the most disastrous year from the harvest point of view that probably ever struck this country.  In a year when we were having bumper crops and an unprecedented acreage of wheat in particular there was not a Deputy who, if he was not saying it, actually felt that 25 per cent. of the crops would be completely lost and that it would be unfit either for human or for animal feeding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> Will any Deputy who knows anything about grain growing or about the trouble of trying to save grain in a year like this try and be realistic about it?  I come from a grain-growing constituency and I know something about the handling, drying and testing of grain.  I spent years at it. In the light of what we have had every fair-minded farmer will agree that to get an arrangement made that all dried or undried millable wheat will be taken from the farmers at no less than 47/6 per barrel was an achievement.  It was something which every single Deputy in this House would have said a fortnight ago would be impossible.  There is not a farmer in this country growing grain but knows it is an achievement.</P>
    <P>There is not a Deputy in this House, particularly those on the opposite side who had ministerial responsibility themselves, who believes for one moment that Grain Importers could put up from the farmer's point of view a better deal or a fairer price than the millers have already secured.</P>
    <P>When you talk about moisture content that denotes not merely the water but also dirt and chaff and everything else, and for a farmer to-day, going through what he has gone through, to be guaranteed that, irrespective of the moisture content of his grain, whether it is 25 or 35 per cent., he will get a minimum of 47/6 per barrel is a good bargain.  I am perfectly satisfied that every Deputy on the opposite side is as conscious of that as I am.  Every Deputy believes it is a good bargain. Every Deputy knows that what has now been arranged will get the farmers out of this disastrous harvest in an infinitely much better way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moher, who is too intelligent to believe what he was saying, sort of sneered at 50/- per barrel as just a salvage price.  What are we trying to deal with this year but to endeavour to save everything possible?  It is more than a salvage price.  A salvage price is a price for a part of something that has been saved from either the disaster of water or fire, but the price is not for part of the crop.  It is for the whole of the crop.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave figures for the <Col N="864" /> grain which has already been delivered to the mills.  Between 1,750,000 and 2,000,000 barrels have already been delivered.  Is there a Deputy who was not pleasantly surprised to be informed that out of those 1,750,000 to 2,000,000 barrels more grain delivered this year less than 3 per cent. of it was rejected as unmillable?  I think we ought to be ashamed of ourselves to be talking the way we have been talking this afternoon.  We ought to be ashamed to be posturing &mdash; and there was a certain amount of posturing &mdash; at being displeased with the situation.  I think we ought to thank Almighty God that the farmers are not going to be broken financially this year as it was feared that many of them would be.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that the farmers would like to see &mdash; so would all of us like to see&mdash;every barrel of the crop millable and every barrel of that crop bushelling the highest.  That does not happen even in normal years.  This motion is impracticable.  It could not be put into operation unless, I would say &mdash; and I am putting it very mildly &mdash; we were to take Deputy Corry's price of £27 a ton for unmillable wheat and add on the additional cost per barrel which would be incurred by using Grain Importers as a fifth wheel to the coach.  The difference to be found is somewhere between 20/- and 22/6 a barrel over the price that has been arranged with the millers for unmillable wheat.  I want some Fianna Fáil Deputy to tell me where the difference between 47/6 and 65/- a barrel for unmillable wheat is to come from.  Who will pay it?  Is it the consumer of bread or the purchaser of animal feeding stuffs or is it to be another £1 a barrel from the Exchequer by way of additional subsidy?  As far as I know, these are the only three sources from which they can be got. Will the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches tell us which of the three sources they suggest it could be got from or where it could be got from? Let us be realistic about this.  My constituents have suffered as much as grain growers in any other constituency. I know them as constituents and I know them intimately as grain growers.  I am confident that they will be perfectly satisfied the Minister and <Col N="865" /> his Department have left nothing undone this year to lessen the blow which the terrible weather has inflicted on them.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, I think that any fair-minded man who looks at this impartially and without any desire to play politics with so serious a matter must come to the conclusion that a very good job has been done&mdash;far better than anybody believed could have been done a fortnight ago.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen is the mover of this motion and he has the honour and privilege of replying to this debate.  I challenge him, when he is replying, to answer the following questions. Will he tell us what machinery Grain Importers, Limited, have at their disposal to enable them to purchase and handle the unmillable wheat in this country?  If they have not the machinery at the moment &mdash; and they have not, and the Deputy knows that better than I do and so does Deputy Harris know that they have no machinery other than a few typewriters and fountain pens &mdash; where are they going to get the machinery?  From whom are they going to get the machinery?  When are they going to get the machinery, and how much longer will they have to delay the taking from the farmers of the undried unmillable wheat?  I might say that there is more undried unmillable wheat in the country at the moment than there is dried unmillable wheat.  Deputies know that too.  Will some Fianna Fáil Deputy also answer this question?  Who is going to pay the difference between <Col N="867" /> 47/6 and 62/6, as suggested by Deputy Corry?  You cannot answer these questions. You could not.  It is impossible for you to answer them because the whole motion is impossible.  It is cod &mdash;and I venture to suggest that it is not worthy of a Party that was so long privileged to govern this country to put down a motion like this dealing with such a very serious situation &mdash; a situation which is still serious but no longer disastrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to a number of speeches on this motion.  I am one of the signatories to the motion.  All the motion asks for is that the farmers will get a fair price for unmillable wheat.  Anyone who lives in the country and who is familiar with the conditions that have existed there since the beginning of the harvest knows that the position is pretty bad.  Since the harvest started, the weather has been continuously bad.  We cannot blame the Government for that.  The cutting of the corn is hardly completed yet.  A large amount of wheat has been cut with the combine.  I know wheat growers who were in a desperate plight with their wheat.  When they took it to the mill at first the millers refused to accept it.  I know one man who put up an electric drier in order to try and put his wheat into condition.  This man is a young enterprising man who took a considerable acreage of conacre, ploughed it, put in his crop, treated it well and bought a combine. Of course, the year was not a suitable one for the combine.  All he could do was to snatch every hour he could to cut and dry it.  This was in the beginning of the season and I understand that, at that time, the miller refused to take it.  He said he would not take combine wheat at all.  Although I agree that this was not a suitable year for the combine, nevertheless, if it had not been for the combine I think a lot of the wheat could not be dealt with.  The man provided himself with an electric drier.  He dried the wheat and I understand that he was then told by the miller that he would not accept wheat that was dried by the owner because it was a skilled operation <Col N="868" /> which required experience and knowledge and the wheat might not be suitable for milling.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in what Deputy Corry stated here.  I am sure a number of farmers were in that position, that where they could not get their wheat into the mill they got it dried in order to preserve it and keep it from rotting.  I believe that dried wheat, if it is considered unmillable by the miller, is really a first-class animal feeding stuff, and I think that the price of 50/- a barrel offered by the Minister for wheat of that quality is very low.  Perhaps some farmers who have wheat in a very wet condition and of very low quality, so that they could hardly put any value on it at all, would consider themselves lucky to get 50/- a barrel for it.</P>
      <P>However, there must be a large amount of really good quality unmillable wheat in the country.  I understand, from reading the Young Farmers' paper, that wheat has been rejected where sprouted grains have been found in the sample.  In many cases where wheat was cut &mdash; not with a combine &mdash; and stacked, the sheaves grew on the heads of the stacks or stooks.  In the threshing of that wheat, where a great portion of it is very good, it would be impossible in many cases to keep the growing grains from mixing with the corn.  In that instance, if the miller rejected that and considered it unmillable, I would consider 50/- to be a very low price for it. Fifty shillings is all right for unmillable wheat of the very worst quality, but there is plenty of wheat in the country that could be considered unmillable and probably will be rejected as unmillable this year by the millers but which I am convinced would be of equal value to maize as animal feeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the price of maize coming into the country is about £28 a ton.  That is much higher than the price the Minister offers for unmillable wheat of good quality.  The farmer is in a very weak and vulnerable position. There is a lot of corn still to be threshed; the season is not yet finished and a lot of that corn may be rejected as unmillable, unfit for flour. We are not asking anything unreasonable <Col N="869" /> in our motion.  I understand the import price of pollard at the present time is £27 a ton.  The Minister said that this wheat is to be used in compound mixtures.  If that unmillable wheat were not there to put into the compound mixtures this year and we had to buy foreign grain to substitute for it, the Minister would not get it for the £19 a ton he offers the farmers for their wheat.  The farmers are entitled to the import price of pollard or maize for unmillable wheat of good quality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey asked here who was going to make up the difference. After all, if the consumers of animal feeding stuffs want to buy it, they should not ask the wheat growers to produce animal food for them at a cheaper rate than it could be imported. All this motion asks is fair play for the farming community.  Despite what the Minister says about the difficulties of putting an arbitrator into the mills, I think something should be done about it to look after the farmers.  All farmers know very well the difficulties to be faced.  The same thing happened at the time of gluts in the sale of store cattle.  It happened with barley and oats in the past and there was not very much sympathy for the farmers when they were weak and disorganised.  We put down this motion because we want to speak for the farmers who are disorganised and in desperate difficulties due to the weather.  They should receive more consideration from the Government in this matter.  There was no lead given to them during the whole year and I think it is almost too late now to be making any suggestion to remedy the situation.  In my own county it is only a few days ago that the military were released to give assistance.  I have heard of their being out in fields of corn where the stooks have grown trying to pull them asunder.  If they were there three weeks or a month ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers did not get the lead they expected, particularly in view of the statements made by the Minister for Agriculture about the growing of wheat.  We heard Deputy Hughes speaking to-night about the big speculators and the big growers.  I would not like to see any wheat lost, and some consideration should be given to the younger men who had not so much experience but were enterprising, paid big prices to land owners for their land to grow wheat and paid up to £30 an acre for it in my own county.  These people should be helped out.  If we do not sympathise with people who want to get rich quick, we should not ask the whole farming community to suffer on account of them.  Something should have been done and nothing was done.  The price offered by the Minister for good quality wheat that is not fit for the making of flour is not sufficient.  They should get at least its value.  It is very easy to calculate its value.  Professor Murphy told Deputy Corry that good quality unmillable wheat, dried, was worth £27 a ton. Deputy Corry pressed the Minister to buy dried unmillable wheat.  Why not give the farmers a reasonable price for it dried and give them a chance of drying it where they can do so?</P>
      <P>This motion was not put down for political purposes but to draw attention to the condition of affairs in the country. There are people suffering silently. The farmers are not grumblers &mdash; in the past we heard they were grumblers &mdash; but they are depressed and disheartened at present and they have no encouragement from the Minister or the Government.</P>

      <P>I regret very much indeed to hear Deputy Harris say that nothing was done by the Government in relation to the problems the agricultural community <Col N="871" /> have had to meet over the past two months.  I could draw many examples of things that were done in response to messages from the country, to assist people in overcoming the serious difficulties that arose as a result of the extremely bad weather. According to all reports, we had a record bad harvest; in living memory it has not been recalled that the people have undergone more privations in trying to save the harvest than they have undergone this year.</P>
      <P>I would just mention one compliment, in tribute to a former Fianna Fáil Deputy from my own constituency who is now chairman of the committee of agriculture in the County Cork. He complimented the present Minister on his action in regard to the regulations on moisture content in wheat this year.  I am sure Deputy Harris has read the comments of Councillor Meaney on that occasion.  It was a very fair tribute from an opponent of the present Minister, but it was one which he felt was demanded by the action of the Minister in meeting the situation at that time.  We must be reasonable about it.  The grain growers are deeply appreciative of the action of the Minister so promptly taken at that time in giving them that assistance.  Therefore, it is very dishonest and unfair to state that nothing was done.  In fact, Deputy Corry&mdash;despite his claim to have a particular affection for the present Minister, in opening his remarks&mdash; would have made an epic contribution to this House if he had sat down five minutes after he got up, for at that point he indicated clearly and rightly that the Minister had responded to information which he had submitted, where prompt action was taken and good results came about from the supply of the information.  That was indicative that if other Deputies who have come in and tried to avail of this motion for political purposes had been as active as Deputy Corry was on that occasion, perhaps their efforts would have been more fruitful than they have been here this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government were sufficiently conscious of the importance of saving <Col N="872" /> the wheat to provide a forum to the members on all sides to present their contributions at some length this afternoon. We awaited with some interest the suggestions that were to emanate from this motion before us.  Quite reasonable questions have been posed from this side as to what the movers consider to be a fair price.  First of all, we had some suggestions that the machinery to be employed should be different, that Grain Importers should be utilised to handle the unmillable wheat.  However, since it was pointed out that their machinery was more or less limited to the extent of their office furniture, we have had no comeback so far.  In their reply, I am sure some one of the movers of the motion &mdash; perhaps Deputy Allen &mdash; will indicate how he considers that organisation could handle the unmillable wheat.  It has been pointed out that there is a parallel comparison in what happened to barley on a previous occasion and the impact that it had on the consumers. After all, who are the consumers in this instance but the smaller farmers who have not land capable of growing wheat?  I represent a constituency which is practically evenly divided between land that is good, capable of carrying a certain amount of live stock with a very short winterage, and these farmers also grow a considerable amount of grain as a cash crop.  On the other hand, one half of my constituency, containing two-thirds of the farmers of the whole constituency, would be called on, if this motion were given effect to, to provide the additional £1 or 22/6 per barrel that the Opposition claims should be paid for this unmillable wheat.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey suggested there were three means by which the money could be found, and it was implied that there was a parallel in the history in relation to feeding barley.  If so, the movers of this motion feel that the burden is to be carried by the people who buy the feeding stuff, to convert it into meat, to feed it to poultry, to produce eggs and bring them to the market.  These unfortunates, remember, have also difficulties to meet, arising from the extraordinarily bad harvest this year.  We must not forget that these people are facing a very severe <Col N="873" /> winter, as a result of the impact of the bad weather on the fodder for live stock that they must carry over for the winter.  If it is intended to give effect to this motion, will it overcome all the burdens that they will have to carry? Surely it is accepted that the Minister, in the result that has come from his recent arrangements, has found what must now be regarded as an extraordinarily low proportion of wheat which is regarded as unmillable, when you compare it with the estimates of some weeks past?  Surely it must be conceded that, in relation to that small proportion of the entire wheat crop, the Minister has gone a long way in resolving the difficulies which the farmers had to meet in this season?</P>

      <P>I do not propose to speak at any great length on this motion but would like to say, that, as is typical of the Fianna Fáil Party here, on many occasions when events which gravely concern the well-being of the farming community are being discussed, you find that politics are dragged in.  The Fianna Fáil Party seem to avail of any opportunity to adopt these tactics.  It is indeed regrettable that that should be the case. They are prepared to stoop even to the tactics we have had to-night; they are prepared to avail of the deplorable conditions of the farmers in recent times in order to try to reflect on the present Minister for Agriculture and on the manner in which he has discharged his duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say at the outset that I fully appreciate the difficulties with which the present Minister was confronted when this emergency arose. We were waiting from day to day in the hope that the weather would improve and no improvement came.  Suddenly we discovered that the harvest in the fields was being destroyed.  Any fair-minded person must agree that, having regard to the serious conditions that prevailed, the Minister went about the whole thing in a business like way. I think it is up to me to say, on behalf of the farming community &mdash; I represent a rural constituency &mdash; that though the people were downhearted and despondent on account of the weather they are <Col N="874" /> not without appreciation of the Minister's efforts to do everything humanly possible for them.  Even Deputy Corry, though he is very often critical of the present Minister, had to admit that. I was surprised that he did.  Other Deputies on his side of the House did not agree with that viewpoint.  There were conflicting statements from gentlemen on the far side.</P>
    <P>I think I have already stated that the farmers do appreciate that the Minister has done everything humanly possible under such conditions and, furthermore, I feel that the farming community have the greatest confidence in the present Minister in this or any other matter that may arise as far as they are concerned.  Deputies from other constituencies, I could not help noticing, referred to holdings of 500 or 700 acres.  We have no such holdings in my constituency.  People who are fortunate to have such big holdings of land have now evidently turned to letting it in conacre.  That, I submit, is a very bad policy and a bad practice for the nation as a whole. I think it is something that should be very strongly condemned.  I am aware you have people at present coming across the water from England or flying over in planes buying land for conacre.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Harris who said they were paying up to £30 an acre.  I do not suggest that the people who bought the land in Deputy Harris's area were foreigners&mdash;that may not apply in his district but it does apply in some parts of the country.  These gentlemen come along from foreign countries and are actually buying up the land of Ireland or taking it in conacre and sowing wheat in it and I seriously suggest that the Minister should take some steps to see that that is discontinued.  We all know and appreciate that where land is taken in conacre, the people who do so have one purpose only and that is to knock everything they possibly can out of it and when they have robbed and plundered it they leave it. That means that the national income here is suffering seriously as a result. I would ask Deputies to appreciate that the one thing we have got in this country is the land of Ireland.  I am <Col N="875" /> sure the present Minister appreciates that as much as anybody and to think that we have foreigners coming in here robbing our lands of the very important minerals that are there, lining their pockets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>In a debate of this kind it might be suggested that what I am saying is irrelevant but I think at the same time it is a matter that has a big bearing on the whole question of this motion.  My area is not a big wheat-growing area, as the land there is not really suitable for wheat. We are bigger producers of oats and other crops than we are of wheat but I am aware of instances where wheat has been turned away from mills in certain parts of the country.  It was actually delivered by lorries and rejected by the mills because it was not up to the standard required.  Then the lorry was driven away to another mill 25 or 30 miles away and the wheat was accepted there.  That would seem to suggest to me that there is something shady about the type of mill owner who would do business in that way and I can well understand that a farmer who has quite a lot of trouble and expense and time spent tilling, reaping, and looking after his crop who is treated in that way when he offers his crop for sale, will feel very disappointed and it is unlikely that in the following year he will go in for tillage particularly of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cases to which I refer concern wheat transactions and I think the Minister when an emergency like this arises should consult with the secretaries of the various county committees of agriculture in the counties concerned and enlist their support and cooperation. I know that he has adopted that practice in the past and in matters of this kind I would suggest to him that he would enlist the support of the various county committees of agriculture to help him over these difficulties. I feel strongly on this having regard <Col N="876" /> to the abuses which I know have occurred in recent times and I feel that the Minister should take some steps to have a representative of the farmers at these mills &mdash; if not in a permanent capacity &mdash; at least to have an inspector or representative of the Department of Agriculture to look after, say, three mills, so that a farmer who delivers his wheat to the mill and has it rejected can telephone the Department representative and ask him to come along and inspect the stuff and see if the mill owner is giving a fair deal. I think it is only due to the farmer that something like that should be brought into being.  Deputies from different sides of this House have said that these things are happening in their constituencies and if that is true &mdash; and it is true in my constituency &mdash; there is something that needs remedying at once.</P>
    <P>On the question of the prices paid for inferior quality wheat I am sure the Minister with his own Department officials has gone very thoroughly into the whole question.  He and his officials have worked hard and late to do everything humanly possible in such an emergency as we unfortunately experienced and I am sure in the matter of fixing prices he has had due regard to all the factors involved.  I believe that he has had the matter of price fixation under consideration and that he will strike a fair balance taking into account that inferior wheat must in the main be fed to animals.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider seriously the few points I have made on behalf of the farming community. I have gone around among them in recent times and met scores and scores of people who have suffered very severely as a result of the weather and I can truthfully say the farmers are not without deep appreciation of what the Minister has done on their behalf in most difficult circumstances.</P>

      <P>Earlier this evening Deputy Corry asked what price was the Minister prepared to pay or recommend as the proper value for dried unmillable wheat, and he suggested that it was a matter of life and <Col N="877" /> death to the farmers of this country. Personally, I believe that the quantity of dried unmillable wheat available for sale is very small &mdash;&ldquo;none&rdquo;&mdash; I hear one of my farmer colleagues say.  In answer to Deputy Corry's query, I can give him a little piece of information: this morning, there was an offer of £25 a ton at a Dublin mill for dried unmillable wheat.  It all depends on what percentage of moisture is still left in it, and it is one of the questions to which there can be any number of answers.  If Professor Sheehy has said that it was worth £27 a ton, it may well be that my price of £25 a ton is just as good for a certain quality of wheat as his price of £27 a ton is for another quality.</P>
      <P>Earlier this evening, we had a lot of rodomontade and &ldquo;cod&rdquo; talked on the opposite side, and it looked at one stage as if the motion was not going to get going at all.  Deputy Allen said that the Minister has sat back showing his contempt for the growing of wheat in this country, and my colleague Deputy O'Sullivan has dealt with that, and it is not necessary for me to repeat what he said.  Deputy Moher made an attack on the Department of Agriculture and wanted such action as will save the farmers from beggary and ruin.  If these words have any relation to reality, I think we should not be here in this House but should all be out helping with the harvest.  Deputy Carter suggested that one-third of the wheat crop is going to be a dead loss this year and the Minister has answered that.  I had made a note and &ldquo;not one-tenth as much&rdquo; is what I had put down.  The Minister duly confirmed that by saying it was about 3 per cent.  What is that 3 per cent. worth, taking it at present prices which the Minister has arranged with the millers?  It is worth about £250,000 in a crop which is worth something around £15,000,000 or £16,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought at one stage that the Opposition Party would not go ahead with the motion.  The Minister had seen the millers on the morning of the day on which they put it down, and I thought that surely they would not go ahead with it.  It looked to-day very <Col N="878" /> much as if they realised that they should not have gone ahead with it, but it seems to me that, when they decide on a course of action, be it right or wrong, they bullheadedly proceed in a stupid fashion, if I may so with respect, to put it into effect.  This House would have been much better employed this evening in dealing with the legislation it has been discussing recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion and I think there is no question about it.  The operation has been put into effect by the Minister already. The job has been done and there is, to the best of my knowledge, no serious problem left.  Deputy Moher and Deputy Corry, both from East Cork, suggested that there was a major problem, but I have been told by people who live in East Cork that the harvest on the whole has been saved there for some weeks.  That is a question of fact also.</P>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Allen, one would think, from the way he behaves, that the Minister was the greatest enemy the farmers ever had.  When the Deputy from Kildare, Deputy Harris, was concluding, there were almost tears in his voice when he spoke of his concern for the farmers.  Would the Deputies cast their minds back a few years to the period when the land of this country was handed over to the inter-Party Government, which was in office from 1948 to 1951.  Who handed it over to them in that condition?  I am not going to dilate on that subject, but I think it is a very shabby business that this serious problem should have been made the subject of a motion like this.</P>

      <P>I consider this motion, first of all, to be useless and I regard it as a mean manoeuvre on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party to take advantage of the unfortunate situation in which the farmers find themselves.  If we examine the terms of this motion we will see that the only effective part of it is that they suggest the purchase and management of the unmillable wheat should be put into the hands of Grain Importers, Limited, who, as previously stated, have no organisation at <Col N="879" /> their hand except a few typewriters and office furniture.  They would have to refer the purchase of this unmillable wheat to the organisation of buyers and agents and millers, who are in charge of this problem at present.  I heard Deputy Corry suggesting that a price ought to be made for dried, unmillable wheat.  I would like to point out that unmillable wheat at 33? per cent. moisture content&mdash;and there is quite a lot of wheat at that figure and a great deal of it at more than 33? per cent &mdash; is worse value to the compounder than maize at £27 a ton because the maize has approximately 11 per cent. moisture.  But still we have that kind of case being bandied about by Deputy Corry without giving figures or any constructive approach.</P>
      <P>This motion appears to be just an excuse for a debate on the rather unfortunate situation in which the farmers find themselves.  It is a week late.  This matter has been dealt with in a very satisfactory way by the Minister already.  Supposing this scheme was not adopted, what would be the position of the wheat growers who would find so much of their wheat unmillable and unsaleable?  We have a situation now where there is a scheme whereby they will be able to get cash for unmillable wheat that is capable of being used as a feeding-stuff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem that we are facing at the present time and which we are discussing has deeper roots.  We must remember that the growers were, if you like, bribed or stampeded into the growing of a very large acreage of wheat and no attempt was made by the previous Government to ensure that the wheat would be properly handled when it was harvested.  There were no handling facilities, particularly in this difficult harvest, but last year, when there was a fairly large acreage of wheat and a good yield, there were considerable difficulties in the handling of the large quantity which was offered, owing to the system of combining wheat instead of the old system of stacking and threshing.  In spite of that, the wheat grower was encouraged to put in a very large <Col N="880" /> acreage this year, but in spite of the problems that arose last year, when there was a favourable season for the harvest, no attempt was made by the previous Government to handle the larger acreage on this occasion.  Added to those difficulties was the bad weather and the farmers had a double problem to deal with.</P>
    <P>Now we have the Fianna Fáil Party shedding crocodile tears.  They will not even accept a scheme which has been made to compensate the growers of that large quantity of wheat who did not get these facilities.  We can imagine, if there was a good season, the manner in which that wheat would have been handled and the long queues of loaded lorries that would have been waiting, not alone one night but several nights continuously, for their turn to have the wheat handled.  There is the situation which would have faced the farmers, if it was a favourable season.  On this occasion, we did not get a favourable season.  There was a slower delivery of the wheat to the mills, but still they had not got the machinery to handle it.  We have the Fianna Fáil Party crying about the farmers, but omitting to refer to the fact that they left the farmers completely without any kind of equipment to deal with the very large crop which they implored them to plant this year.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to wheat growing appears to have been one designed to adjust the trade balance, but let us remember that the economics of wheat are these, that 20 years ago, when there was only one ton of wheat grown here for every 15 tons of wheat imported, there were four times as many men working on the land as there are at present.</P>
    <P>Similarly we have the situation where growers of wheat are not satisfied with the manner in which the millers have dealt with the corn taken in.  The millers apparently did not give the results of the test for approximately two weeks after the wheat had been delivered and then there arose a dispute as to whether it contained 24 per cent. or 30 per cent. moisture. There is no way of proving it because apparently there is no referee or third party to decide the condition of the <Col N="881" /> wheat on delivery.  The discretion appears to be with the millers at the present time as to whether they will accept wheat as being millable or rejected as unmillable.  It is unsatisfactory but I presume it is impossible at this stage to find a solution for that problem.  At the moment it is at the discretion of the millers to decide whether wheat is millable or unmillable. I presume it has been already suggested in the course of the debate that arrangements be made in future to ensure that wheat delivered to the mills be dealt with in a proper manner. Producers are in difficulty in regard to the result of bushelling until such time as they are in a position to dispute the figures given them by the miller.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has done a very good job in devising this scheme when we realise that, if it had not been devised, there would be a large quantity of wheat unsaleable.  Wheat is saleable now but the difficulty that presents itself is whether the millers will accept it as millable wheat or unmillable wheat.  I heard Deputy Corry make a case in regard to unmillable dried wheat.  Most of it is unmillable, although saved in the normal way, and offered to the millers in that condition, because the drying facilities are not there which would enable a large quantity of it to be dried, even though it is unmillable before being offered to the millers.</P>

      <P>I do not believe this motion will do any harm at all, but it is a childish motion.  It is unfortunate that it should be brought forward, but these are the usual tactics of Fianna Fáil&mdash;cashing in on the nation's distress. Certainly the motion has shown Fianna Fáil in a very poor light indeed, because they have made no case for it at all.  It has shown also that the nation has a strong, able Minister, a Minister capable of handling the task in the national crisis that we have gone through.  It has shown him to be the right man in the right place.  There are no queues outside the mills waiting for prices to be arranged.  Everything that could humanly be done is being done.  I am certainly satisfied that our farmers have undergone untold hardship. <Col N="882" /> They have the sympathy of the entire nation, of the people in town and city, and they deserve that sympathy. I am proud of the fact that the farmers stood up to their job.  They accepted the crisis with true Christian resignation.  They were always prepared to accept God's holy will.  Anything that is bad could be worse.  We have had a wheat crisis, but is it not far more easily endured than the human holocausts which have occurred in other parts of the world and in which, not hundreds but thousands, of people have been hurled into eternity. Here we have had nothing worse than a bad harvest.  That is only a small sacrifice in comparison with the human holocausts that other countries have had to endure.  Perhaps this crisis will be a blessing in disguise if it shows that single-line farming will always throw a nation off its balance.  Indiscriminate wheat growing is a dangerous experiment. That has been proved, not to-day or yesterday but over many years.  There would be no national crisis if we had a fixed national economy.  Balanced farming will stand up to any crisis, big or small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county from which I come, royal Meath, has suffered severely. Many large farmers have been severely tried, some of them broken for ever more.  Many more have had their hands very badly burned.  We have every sympathy for all these farmers, the unbalanced farmers, whether they sowed large areas or small areas of wheat.  A farmer of that type is no gambler or chancer; he is the type of man the nation needs.  We had, however, many speculators growing wheat in the last few years.  I come from one county where speculators have run rife.  I am sorry for them, but I have not much sympathy with them.  They are nothing more than a crowd of racketeers who blew into this country from all parts of Britain and other countries in Europe.  Some of them even came from Dublin and tried to cash in on a handy way of making easy money.  It was not the hand of man that struck them down, but the hand of the Almighty Himself.  We have very little sympathy with that type of man.  I, unfortunately, am in the position that I see the fertile land <Col N="883" /> of Meath being utterly destroyed by this type of speculator who comes in and tries to get rich overnight.</P>
    <P>I want to see a balanced farming economy.  I want to see the fertile land preserved and conserved in my county where we have some of the richest land in Europe.  It is unfortunate to see it being turned into nothing more than a dust bowl such as you find in the American prairies.</P>

I say that the Minister and the Department deserve the nation's thanks for their action in the crisis we have gone through.  They have done everything that was humanly possible.  They have allayed many fears.  They have alleviated much of the distress by their promptness of action and by the manner in which they dealt with the millers.  I am not a strong supporter of the millers but I say they have done a good job in this national crisis.  Had it not been that we had a strong and able Minister, the countryside would be strewn with wheat rotting in the stacks and in the sacks and a national disaster would be upon us.  Have we a national disaster to-day?  No; we accept the will of the Almighty and we are proud of the fact that we have a strong Minister and an able Government to deal with an unprecedented situation.  They tackled it in a bold and big way and, thanks to them, many of the farmers have been saved from utter distress.  I am satisfied that in the future, as in the present situation, the Minister will stand up to his task and he will overcome the difficulties <Col N="884" /> in the way of bringing into this country a balanced economy.  The Minister is a strong man who knows his job and who will do his job.  Thanks be to God, we had a man of that type to deal with the present crisis.  What would have happened if we had the late Minister in office, or Deputy Dr. Ryan?  Would we not have floundered over the job?</P>

According to the daily papers it was prophesied that we would have queues three and four miles long outside every mill, with the men on the lorries sleeping on sacks in the roadway waiting their turn.  Thanks to the Minister, there was none of that.  The situation was settled overnight because he had strength in his hand and the orders he gave were carried out.  The farmers are not fools.

I grew wheat in 1946 and I took a cut of 10/- a barrel on one cargo and a cut of 6/- on another, and there was no weeping or wailing or shedding of tears: poor Pat had to take his beating.

The motion was deferred for a month.  If it has done nothing else it has achieved an authoritative statement that something is being done.  But nothing was being done until the motion was put down last Thursday and it is a strange coincidence that in a Dublin newspaper circulating all over the country a statement was made the following day.

      <P>There was an article in a Dublin paper; that did not come as a supplied statement.  It was not stated that it was a supplied statement.  I believe that, the problem being of such major importance, there should have been an announcement on the radio that night.  There was no statement from the Government Information Bureau that such arrangements had been made.  We had nothing authoritative until this evening.  The unfortunate part about this evening is that the arrangement does not go far enough.  It has been suggested we should accept it.  I shall try to explain why it is not possible for us to accept it and why we should not accept it without putting it to a division.</P>
      <P>I would be more than pleased if this whole question of agriculture could be taken out of the whirlpool of politics.  I hope the day will dawn when the agriculturists will formulate their own policy and leave it to the Government of the day to amend that policy or indicate where it is either inadvisable or impracticable.  That is not the position.  For a number of years agriculture has been played about with.</P>

It has been stated by the Minister and many others that this was the worst harvest in living memory.  What steps were taken by the Minister to meet that situation?  That is one of the greatest grievances I have against the Minister: although it was the worst harvest in living memory not a word of encouragement was given to the farmers who found themselves faced with a dilemma.</P>

      <P>We know what was done in 1946 and if the same steps had been taken this year it is doubtful if there would have been any need to put down this motion.  We needed the weather but, above all, we needed a pool of labour so that the farmers could utilise their ordinary reapers and binders.  That is why many of them waited to use a combine and almost lost their crops because they got no hint from anywhere or no suggestion as to what would be done. Even though suggestions were made by various vocational organisations of farmers, there was no hint given that the Army or anybody else would be available until last week, when it was too late.</P>

      <P>The farmers require sympathy and encouragement because everybody knows that, apart even from the wheat, farmers' incomes have deteriorated very considerably as compared with the same period last year and that their incomes from live stock or any other form of farm produce have decreased from 12½ per cent. to 17½ per cent.  The fact that wheat was rendered unmillable and unfit for human consumption by the elements, of course, and also by lack of cooperation and assistance from the fount where it should be expected, made their hardships and difficulties doubly difficult.</P>
      <P>Now it comes to this question of the purchase of unmillable wheat and how this motion was worded and we have been asked how does Fianna Fáil believe that Grain Importers, Limited, could handle the unmillable wheat of this country.  That question was posed by the Minister, by Deputy Morrissey and several others.  How did Grain Importers, Limited, in a similar situation of a difficult kind last year, handle the barley question?  Had not they machinery to do that?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they not got machinery to import from the ends of the earth for cereals to be used by the various mills in this country?  We were also asked the question: if the suggestion of Deputy Corry and others as regards price were conceded, who would pay for it &mdash; how would it be paid for?  Would not that money circulate within the country?  Is it a crime to pay to the Irish farmers the equivalent of what has been paid to the foreign <Col N="889" /> producers of maize and pollard and the rest of it?</P>
      <P>When it comes to the question of values, I understand that pollard is an offal of wheat and it is being sold at £27 a ton.  The whole grain must be better than its offal and in my opinion, must be of higher feeding value.  To the layman, without bringing in an expert or professor, the whole grain certainly has a much higher feeding value than its offal, pollard.  There is nothing wrong in what was suggested by Deputy Corry and others on this side of the House that the farmers should be given at least that price for their unmillable wheat.  But, when it comes to the question of fixing the price at any level for unmillable wheat or getting the millers to take it, perhaps, the easing or solution of one problem may create another.  That is the big danger in this whole question and one that, in my opinion, the Minister should take serious cognisance of. The question is how the millers will deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>We know very well that there are thousands of tons of what would be regarded as unmillable wheat that is very close to the border-line.  Without supervision or a check of some kind there is a danger that people who have millable wheat of good quality could lose and that the price of their first-class quality millable wheat that is suitable for human consumption could be cut and that the millers in that way would try to even up matters.  That problem is difficult enough to solve.  In the present year I believe the only way in which you could solve it is a rough and ready way, not by sending an inspector to every mill and keeping him there all the time but by having surprise visits and surprise tests and taking from farmers samples of rejected wheat and of wheat for which they expected to get the millable wheat price.</P>

      <P>It is often easy to ascertain the doubtful ones from the reputable ones and attention should be paid to such people.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Mr. O'Donovan, said this evening that it would be much better for this House to discuss some useful type of legislation than to deal with a motion of this kind.  No Opposition in this House have ever facilitated a Government to the same extent as the present Opposition have facilitated the present Government.  What Bills have been introduced that are of any special significance or importance that should be given priority over a motion of this kind?  Are they not all clarification or codification of existing laws?  None of them deals with any important subject. That is my answer to Deputy O'Donovan on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question is dried unmillable wheat versus undried unmillable wheat.  That also is worthy of consideration. It is too bad that the careful, thrifty farmer who went to the trouble of drying his unmillable wheat in an effort to preserve some of it should be placed in the same category and offered the same terms as the careless man or the man who, perhaps, was not careless but who lost hope in the situation and left the wheat there <Col N="891" /> untidy and uncared for, and who is now going to produce wheat much inferior both in moisture content and in general condition.  He will get the same benefit in the scheme the Minister has outlined to us as the person who took the trouble and went to the expense of having his unmillable wheat dried and brought to a safe condition. I am sure something can be done. There is no justification whatsoever for paying only 47/6 and at the same time giving the same benefit to the neighbour who has either through discouragement or carelessness failed to tend his wheat at all or take the steps his neighbour has taken.</P>
    <P>There were many points raised on this whole question of the motion we have put down.  It was suggested that the handling of the wheat in this particular type of season was something akin to a miracle.  There was nothing very miraculous about it.  I want to emphasise that again because I believe that it would be only a very simple problem if the proper steps had been taken at the proper time.  Thoughts have been expressed here about the wheat rancher and all the rest of it and the get-rich-quick fellow.  Perhaps, we have certain people of that mentality in the country who believe, when something comes along in which they see an opportunity, they can get rich quick.  Perhaps we have land owners in this country in the same position.</P>
    <P>My opinion is that there should be no ranchers in this country.  If there are ranchers who are not utilising their land properly, who are going into land and who are letting it to other <Col N="892" /> gentlemen, whether they be natives or foreigners, there is an institution in this State to deal with them.  It is, perhaps, an institution which does not carry on its work in a very speedy fashion.  Nevertheless, that is the type of person in my opinion to whom they should direct their attention instead of directing it towards some person who is an uneconomic holder and take his holding from him in order to relieve the other uneconomic holder.  If that happened we would not have so many ranchers of any type, whether beef ranchers or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I think the way this motion has been treated from the Government Benches shows callous indifference to the whole situation.  That is the position.  That callous indifference was represented here this evening, particularly by the Clann na Talmhan Party.  There was never more than one of them in his seat, and only one came in to make any contribution to this motion.  We are insistent in putting this motion.  I hope that the farmers on every side of this House &mdash; if they are interested in the farmers as they pretend they are &mdash; will vote to give the farmers a fair price in the situation in which they now find themselves.  I hope they will vote to the farmers of this country a price equal to that which they are prepared to give the farmers in outside countries in respect of imports of animal feeding stuffs which, I hold, are not of nearly so great a feeding value as the unmillable wheat we have been discussing here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The point in this amendment is that under sub-paragraph (n) of the section the Minister may make regulations providing for the supplementing of regulations by directions given from time to time by the appropriate Minister.  We repeated yesterday on all sides of the House much of what has been said in the past with regard to legislation by regulation and we have all agreed that it is a dangerous thing and something not to be extended unnecessarily.  Here, to my mind, is something which is exceedingly objectionable from that point of view.  It provides for the <Col N="895" /> supplementing of regulations by directions, and the very lack of definition in the particular wording used there seems to me to imply that you are going to give these directions &mdash; whatever they may mean &mdash; the force of a regulation, and that simply means giving them legislative force.</P>
      <P>The Minister should clear up a few points for us.  He should tell us what kind of direction is involved.  We are quite clear where we stand with regard to Statutory Rules or Orders made.  They are made duly under the authority of some particular statute, that is, directly under the authority of this House.  They are usually hedged by such a provision as the Minister proposes to put in his amendment to the section and it is generally thought to be desirable in all such cases.  This is about the only safeguard there is, namely, that this regulation will be tabled and can be annulled under certain circumstances even though that annulment is usually without prejudice to anything done under the regulation as it is.  That is to some extent a safeguard, but here it is quite clear that supplementary directions so given would not be captured by that clause which the Minister is later going to introduce. Furthermore, it is questionable whether such directions could be ever tracked down except they happen to be produced by the Minister or his Department in some relevant issue.  I think that is an undesirable situation.  If there are going to be directions I see no reason why these directions should be given the force of an Order instead of remaining as they have been heretofore, administrative directions but as such, of course, not carrying the force of legislation when it comes to a dispute between a citizen and the Department or even a question of a dispute within the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an oversimplification. In the ordinary running of Departments, there are, naturally, directions given in the course of administration.  The Minister may direct a secretary to reply to a letter in particular terms.  The Minister may tell his officers to do certain things, to carry out a certain survey or something like that, but in the ordinary course of administration we all know it is not necessary for the Minister to have statutory authority and sanction for giving that specific direction, or that that direction should carry the specific legislative force that attaches either to an Act of Parliament or to a statutory rule or regulation.  I cannot see that it is necessary so to do. In giving a provision like that to the Minister or to any Minister we are opening the way for all sorts of directions to acquire the force of law, to be irrebuttable, so to speak, in court, unquestionable.  They are law and that is all there is to it.  Surely that is going very much further than many of us have wanted.</P>
      <P>There are many of us on all sides of this House at the present moment who have questioned the idea of giving power to Ministers to legislate by Order, and a number of us have tried consistently to restrict that to cases of necessity.  That remark goes, as I have said, not only for one side of the House but for all sides.  Not only are we giving power to make Orders but giving a man <i>carte blanche</i> to give directions which, by virtue of this subsection, will carry the force of a Statutory Rule and Order without the safeguards with which we usually hedge those Orders in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from anything else, what does &ldquo;supplementing&rdquo; mean?  If there is not the thin edge of the wedge there, I wonder what would be.  What are directions?  There is no question &mdash; and the Minister himself, when talking to other Ministers from the side of the House I am on now, would have used the same expression; in fact, I think I can remember his using a phrase somewhat similar &mdash; of imputing to the present Minister, to his Government or Department, any improper intentions, but the fact is that there is that <Col N="897" /> danger there in principle and it is on principle that the provision is objectionable.</P>
    <P>The phrase runs: &ldquo;directions given from time to time by the appropriate Minister&rdquo;.  What does that mean?  In the ordinary course of work directions are given by the Minister through his Department officials.  Many of these directions will be given by officers of the Department lower than even the Minister's Secretary, the Secretary of the Department.  They will be given by officers in various parts of the Department and will be given for and on behalf of the Minister.  In practice, it will not be hard to invoke the point that such directions given by members of the Civil Service on behalf of the Minister are technically given by the Minister.  Does not this section mean in its stark nakedness that we are going now to provide in this Act that the Minister may make a regulation which in fact will empower officers of his Department to make Statutory Rules and Orders?  I know that is not intended; I hope it is not intended, but on a fair construction of the wording of this section, is that not the possibility?  If it is a possibility, then I think we should have the safeguard.  I still would object in principle but if the Minister were to be adamant and to use the majority which he could command to force this through, I would still appeal to him in these terms: would you meet us this far, to say that no such direction could be given unless it bore the signature of the Minister for the time being?</P>

      <P>I do not want to be unfair to the Minister.  What have I on the record now?  I have this.  He has been acting in a certain way for years, but he has not been legislating &mdash; when I asked the question, the Minister said &ldquo;no&rdquo;&mdash; but he will be if this is passed.  There is the position.  Now, I am asking Deputies to consider this. Deputy MacBride last night suggested it was not the first time this happened. Maybe Deputy MacBride is right, but that does not make me deplore the fact any the less and it does not make me feel that I should desist from opposing this position.  I may say, as a Deputy, that it is the first time I have seen this and appreciated it.  One may say I am remiss in not having appreciated it in other provisions, if it is there, but I can say I have not seen <Col N="899" /> any provision on all fours with this. The Minister tried to quote something to me last night but that was a different matter, that was a specific limit and a completely isolated and insulated matter.  Here is a general power being given to a Department to legislate &mdash; and I am not misrepresenting the facts when I say it.  I repeat, here is a general power given to civil servants in the Departments to legislate. If we are going to pass it, let this House be aware of what it is passing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no safeguard. The Minister may make a regulation conferring that power on civil servants, limited only by whatever interpretation may be put on the two very indeterminate words &ldquo;supplementing&rdquo; and &ldquo;directions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I conceive this to be a matter of prime importance to the public.  There is nothing in the regulation that says that they cannot even legislate retrospectively in that regard.  Already this Bill, at another section, holds a provision where there is retrospective legislation taking away the existing rights of citizens, to which we will come later.  Here we have an unqualified power of legislation, on the Minister's admission, given to civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister never said there was an unqualified power. Do not misquote me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very sorry to misquote the Minister.  He has admitted that this power of legislation is being given to civil servants and I say &mdash; let me be accurate &mdash; and I say it on the words &mdash; and I would ask Deputies to read the document for themselves &mdash; that that is in effect an unqualified power, because the Minister may pass on unqualified power.  There is nothing there to limit the power that the Minister can pass on.  Secondly, there is nothing even to limit the power of retrospective departmental legislation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> Now, let us see the type of thing that can arise out of that.  Supposing that there is a dispute &mdash; as we very frequently had and there are lawyers here who have had experience of that &mdash; where some individual comes up against the departmental machine and has a legal claim for something like salary.  I have seen these cases in the courts time and time again.  It may be for some remuneration or some right he claims he has under statute. These matters can come to court, as they properly do, and be there determined.  It very often happens that in such a case the Department is beaten just because there is some point that is not covered.  I do not think it is a bad thing that the Department should be beaten occasionally by the private individual in such a case and that the individual's right should be upheld.  That is the present position.</P>
    <P>What is the result of this section? The Minister will give a supplemental Order, giving sufficient powers dealing with certain matters.  Let it be clear that I am not charging the Minister or his Department with any improper intention.  I do not have to repeat here the whole gamut of argument as to why we have to be careful of what we are doing; there is no use in going on to a general constitutional discussion on these things and I hope the Minister will accept that I am not imputing to himself or his officers any improper motives.  However, we have to take the possibilities here in legislation in a case such as I have cited. Provided the regulations are broad enough, &ldquo;supplementing&rdquo; will be broad enough to be interpreted as &ldquo;relating to&rdquo; and I am bold enough to say that here.  &ldquo;Supplementing&rdquo; is so vague that it can be broadly interpreted as meaning merely &ldquo;relating to.&rdquo;&ldquo;Directions&rdquo;&mdash;Deputies can see the scope of that word.  There is there a chance of making an Order to cover the loophole &mdash; and that is that; and if that Order has the force of law, as it would have here, the court looks at it, takes it as conclusive, and that is that.  That is what we are doing here &mdash; and I can see no reason why such a direction could not even be retrospective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> I wonder if the Minister appreciates, and if Deputies appreciate, the appalling possibilities in this, in its unqualified form.  I know the Minister, with the best will in the world &mdash; and we appreciate it &mdash; has brought in a subsection to this section to provide that the Orders he would make under this section would be laid on the Table of the House; but even that does not cover this.  I must most strongly urge upon the Minister and the Government that, this having come to light in this way, he set his face against it &mdash; and, what is more, that he wipe out any such provisions, if any are found, in any other legislation no matter by whom passed.  Only a war or emergency conditions or something like that could justify provisions of this nature, and there are very many people in this country who would agree with me in that statement.  For instance I have talked about the rights of individuals, but that section alone by virtue of its phrasing, places every employee in the local government service at the mercy of departmental directions and we know the tyranny that a machine can be.  It even &mdash; so to speak &mdash; places the people who would make the Orders at the mercy of the Frankenstein that they have created.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <P>It is not, Deputy. Read the words of that section and take it in.  It is not brazen bluff.  I say that if these measures continue it would be the thin edge of the wedge towards wiping out the powers of this House.  Suppose you apply that type of thing to the regulations made by the Department of Education or those made by the Department of Justice, to take two very important cases.  But if it is applied to local government to-day you are creating a precedent for applying it to, say, Education or Justice in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Deputy Rooney supporting me in this?  Remember I have not changed my arguments.  I think this is a dangerous provision and, unfortunately, it is the Deputy and his Party who will have to decide as to whether the Minister will have this power or not.  Frankly, I do not object to giving the present Minister the powers he needs to carry on&mdash;or any other Minister, for that matter, but I cannot see why the directions and the things that have been working heretofore cannot continue.  If there are cases where a legal right is challenged, is not the individual entitled to have legal rights, and win on those rights?  No steamrolling provision should be inserted in legislation to ensure that the machine is going to win at every turn.  It can be local government to-day and it can be education or anything else afterwards.  As I pointed out last night, you had previously the dangers of this sort commonly inherent only in defence codes and when soldiers were subject to very strict discipline in defence acts and military law, and a whole heap of safeguards had to be built up to protect the unfortunate soldier.  Now we shall have to have regulations to protect the employees of the local government machine.  These are the people directly involved, but I am more concerned than that.  If that kind of provision is passed to-day in relation to that kind of Order it is relatively easy to come in to-morrow and pass that kind of provision in relation to a broader class of citizens and so on, as the thing widens.</P>
      <P>If I am wrong in expressing this fear I need only quote the things that have been thrown across the House.  Deputy MacBride was the first to say that this was not the first time this was done: that it was done before.  What is that but saying that there is a precedent? And what I am saying is that all these precedents are very dangerous and the cumulative effect of them is more dangerous still.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take the Electoral Act.  The Minister has shown how poor his case is by referring to that Act.  That was the very thin end of the wedge and it would not have been a bad idea if the people at that time could have foreseen this type of thing so that that should not be done. There is no comparison between the powers of delegated legislation given here and those in that Act and I know of no other Act which gives such wide powers, which will so vitally affect individual rights in these days of threats to rights of individuals, as this section does.</P>
      <P>The Minister must have discipline and administration and so forth but it has been perfectly possible to have those heretofore.  There have been occasional cases of, say, an officer on retiring, claiming certain rights which the Department says he should not have and he wins in court on the interpretation of documents.  I say, by and large, from the point of view of the community that is a very good thing and I think it would be very bad to provide that such a thing could not happen, because in this case if you take that approach you are virtually providing that the civil servant or the local authority employee has no rights whatsoever.</P>
      <P>I know I say these things vehemently but I am not attributing to the present Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <P>When you see these inherent possibilities in this measure it is intrinsically objectionable and for these reasons I am thinking it could go to Education or to Justice or to anything in the future with the danger of retrospective amendment of loopholes with all the rest.  I strongly urge the Minister to reject this provision.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the mechanics.  What are the mechanics for making a Rule or Order?  It only means drafting it, going through certain formalities of signature and putting it on the Table of the House&mdash;is not that all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason why that cannot be done.

      <P>Well, you can get a free decision from our courts so far, but this type of thing will muzzle the courts if they are confronted with legislation which they cannot get around.  I do object, and want to be recorded as objecting very strenuously to any provisions that will enable any person other than the Minister who is delegated by this House to legislate on behalf of the House by Order.  I strongly object to that.  I think it is an unnecessary provision and a dangerous one, and I am more than ever worried in view of the Minister's remark last night that this was a preliminary to codification.  To incorporate that kind of provision in a code by very slight amendment would simply mean that the whole code was eyewash.  It would simply mean the autocratic rule of a Department.</P>
      <P>I think I have pressed it as hard and as fairly as I can and I would again urge the Minister not to take this power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has spoken at considerable length and I wish to say I appreciate what he said and that he has spoken from conviction, but he does not appear to appreciate that the regulations to be made under this section and Section 19 of the 1941 Act are intended to be a reasonably permanent set of regulations without cumbersome details.  The Deputy will appreciate that and the House will.</P>
      <P>With regard to these regulations, certain directions must be given.  Very often they are given by letter; very often by circular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> The Deputy's suggestion is that they should be signed personally by the Minister.  I refer the Deputy to the section which provides for the making of these directions.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...providing for the supplementing of the regulations by directions given from time to time by the appropriate Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These regulations govern five different Ministries; they govern Local Government, Health, Social Welfare, Agriculture and Defence.  Within these regulations, certain directions must be given.  As I said, they may be given by letter or otherwise.  For instance, the regulations provide for the paying of travelling expenses to certain officials, but those travelling expenses change from time to time, and within the regulations directions may be given altering the scale of travelling expenses. I think it would be a ridiculous waste of time and would cause delay if every time the scale is changed, the regulations or the directions should be laid on the Table of the House.</P>
    <P>Again, certain officers are bound by the regulations to give security on taking up their appointments.  Those securities vary, depending entirely on the amounts of money handled by each officer.  For instance, rate collectors in some areas handle large sums and rent collectors in small towns may handle very small sums.  The regulations provide for the giving of security. The directions will provide for the amount of security to be given in each individual case.  I think it would be unreasonable that these directions should be laid on the Table of the House.  As Deputy MacBride has said, it would defeat the purpose of the laying of regulations on the Table of the House. There would be so many on the Table of the House that we would not even read one of them, and we would miss the important regulations.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate Deputy de Valera's point of view and I am prepared to meet him.  I am prepared to give him an alternative.  I am prepared to have laid on the Table of the House directions to more than one local authority because they would be more or less general directions given within the <Col N="906" /> regulations, or, alternatively, I am prepared to meet him between now and the Report Stage by amending this section.  The section as it reads at the moment provides for the supplementing of the regulations by directions given from time to time by the appropriate Minister.  I would be prepared to amend that to read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Providing for the supplementing of the regulations by such directions given from time to time by the appropriate Minister as may be necessary to give effect to the regulations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think either of those amendments should be acceptable to the House and I would prefer that the House should accept the second.  If Deputy de Valera and the House consider that that would give greater protection to the public, then I would be prepared to bring in that amendment between now and the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is being extremely reasonable with the House.  Deputy de Valera, in the course of his earlier remarks, made a strong case, and I think, like the Minister, Deputy de Valera spoke with conviction.  I regretted the fact yesterday that Deputy de Valera's viewpoint had not been accepted earlier by his Party.  I want to say this in fairness to Deputy de Valera. I am aware of the fact that he, as an individual Deputy, has consistently adopted and expressed the viewpoint which he expressed here in relation to legislation by Order.  It was particularly noticeable during the emergency years amongst the legal profession that legislation by Order was getting out of hand and a situation had arisen where a verbal Order made by a Minister had the force of law, even though the Order was never printed.  However, I do not think it is necessary to go back to the particular situation which arose here.</P>
      <P>The strongest argument made by Deputy de Valera was the danger which might exist of supplementary directions having the force of legislation and being made retrospective in a way which might affect the rights of persons before the court.  I do not know if that danger was ever real, even under the sub-section as it stood, but I urge on Deputy de Valera the view that the amendment suggested by the Minister, together with the addition suggested by Deputy MacBride, completely overcomes that difficulty.  If it were suggested that, with the amendment now proposed by the Minister, the situation has not altered, I think we would only be fencing with words and would not be facing the realities of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take an example with which <Col N="908" /> Deputy de Valera will be familiar. According to our legislation at the moment, there are very many cases which will come readily to his mind, where matters of procedure and so on are made and laid down by regulations which vary from time to time.  Even the procedure with regard to court hearings, court sittings and so on may be governed by regulations, not made by the Minister for Justice, or the Department of the Minister for Justice, but by such bodies as Benchers of the King's Inn and the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>You might just as well argue that the Law Society or the Benchers have vested in them the right to legislate without reference even to the Department of Justice, as to argue that the section, with the amendment as suggested, gives the right to officials in a Government Department to legislate.  I should like to express gratification that the Minister is meeting the House in relation to this Bill in the manner in which he has done so far.  Speaking before from Government Benches in this House, I expressed the wish that Ministers would meet the House in that particular way.  I think in the long run it makes for better legislation than if the House is simply divided and it is a question of counting heads.  I feel that Deputy de Valera will agree with me that if Ministers in relation to Bills of this sort, which do not necessarily contain any important aspect of Government policy, come into this House in the manner in which the Minister for Local Government came in this afternoon in relation to this Bill, it would help the House and in the long run make for very good legislation.</P>

As one of the signatories to the amendment which has given rise to this discussion&mdash;my colleagues can speak for themselves&mdash;it appears to me that the amendment to paragraph (n) meets the objection which we had to the sub-section as it was framed.  The wording of the Minister, under which such supplementary direction will be <Col N="909" /> within the scope of the regulations to which the particular draft refers, will, as far as I can see, satisfy us. I am not competent to argue the point Deputy de Valera argued on very high-grade principles.  If, for argument's sake, a direction were held to be in contravention of the scope of the particular regulation what redress would there be?</P>

We are a little bit away from the war and the emergency period now; we all hope that we are much further away from the next war. There is no use in referring to an Act of 1923 and somebody talking about the Commissioner for County Dublin when the Commissioner was appointed by an Act of the Minister, not by a clause supplemental to some regulation.

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will allow me to finish.  This is my fundamental difficulty and I am trying to explain my attitude to the Minister.  I am perfectly satisfied with the amendment as offered by the Minister and as supplemented by Deputy MacBride.  Perhaps I should not say perfectly, but I should be reasonably satisfied or sufficiently satisfied with the intention.  At first blush, it seems the wording might be adequate, but I still am in difficulty about the principle. I shall gladly leave it to the Minister to deal with it on the Report Stage, but at the same time, in so doing, I should like the Minister to appreciate very clearly that fundamentally what I am objecting to-and I think my colleagues will support me&mdash; is, even in the smallest degree, a question of principle.  What I am afraid of is the precedent, the extension and all that&mdash;the principle of delegating the power of legislation to somebody who is not in this House.</P>

      <P>I gladly acknowledge the readiness of the Minister to try to meet us within the wording of his amendment.  I think, in practice, that the present Minister would be scrupulous to keep to the intention and the amendment would be improved by Deputy MacBride's suggestion. There is, however, this possibility, a naked possibility in the present situation. The Minister might have a successor who might not be so trustworthy. There would be a regulation made, governing, say, superannuation and in making that regulation there would be a delegated power to supplement such directions.  In that regulation, there might be a loophole with regard to some condition.</P>

      <P>Quite.  A supplementary direction so given within the regulation might be sufficient to cure the defect but looking at it from the Department's point of view, to put it more realistically, it might take away the right that was there but for the supplementary direction.  Now, that is the type of danger of which I am afraid.  However, the Minister has asked us to leave it until the Report Stage.  The Minister has said he will accept this amendment and accept Deputy MacBride's suggestion, and I am happy to leave it at that.  I shall leave it to the Minister on the <Col N="912" /> Report Stage, with the qualification that no act of an officer of the Department, without the personal knowledge of the Minister, is to have the force of law.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to join with the other Deputies in congratulating the Minister in his attitude. I know, as do the other Deputies that have spoken, the vices in this particular type of legislation.  I think it is a healthy thing that Deputies on both sides should set their faces resolutely against this type of thing. Indeed, it would be useful if we could make a rule that we would on both sides strenuously oppose this type of delegated legislation and also this type of legislation by reference.  A tendency has grown up, not only as a result of the war, but generally, in the course of the last 25 years to have more and more bureaucratic control. I think that is dangerous and this discussion, though it has wasted several hours of parliamentary time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not saying that in derogation of members.  I am merely pointing out that if the parliamentary draftsman learned that this type of legislation would not receive the sanction of the House a considerable amount of public time would be saved. It is in that sense that I meant public time had been wasted in trying to force through the House legislation which obviously would not receive the approval of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words which I have suggested as an addition to the Minister's amendment are the following: &ldquo;provided always that such direction shall not extend or widen the scope of such regulations.&rdquo;  I am quite satisfied to accept the Minister's undertaking to examine the position between this and the Report Stage.  Not only in relation to this Bill, but generally, the time has come when it may be necessary on occasion even to vote against measures of which one approves if they are framed in such a manner, because that appears to be the only way in which members will be able to force their views on the officials who prepare this <Col N="913" /> type of legislation; they must learn that it will not receive the sanction of the House.</P>

This is the year of Our Lord 1954 and until now, and for the last 50 years, whoever has run the Custom House has not been able to write orders without coming here and getting the authority of law for every letter written by a civil servant.  The purpose of this provision is to give the authority of law to a letter written by a civil servant in the Custom House. Until this year of Our Lord 1954 the country has got on without giving these additional powers to civil servants. I do not see why we should not carry on just as well without them.</P>

A declaration and a direction seemed to me to be the same.  If so, the Deputy has some weight on his side when he says there is very much the same thing already in the 1941 Act.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Between lines 51 and 52 to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(II)  Section 19 of the Act of 1941 is hereby amended by the insertion in sub-section (1) of an additional paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;( )  Any regulations made in relation to paragraph (g) of this sub-section shall prescribe in relation to all permanent posts of a clerical nature that they be filled by written competitive examination only&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Whatever the result of this amendment may be I hope it will escape the bisecting of the legal luminaries in this House because it seems to me that, if it does not, we will either all end up as legal luminaries or we shall have no Local Government Act at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asking the Minister here to consider a problem which affects people in the rural areas in relation to entrants to local authority offices.  It is, I admit, almost impossible to get a perfect system but we believe that in connection with work of a clerical nature recruitment should be by means of written competitive examination. In our opinion recruitment by means of interview board is anything but satisfactory in many instances.  An interview board can be set up by the county manager.  Under the existing Act the manager has that right.  Members are given no information whatsoever. Now, candidates may sit for an examination and prove their ability but, when they go before the interview board, very often that ability does not count.  Deputies who are members of local authorities have had, I am sure, the same experience as we have had in Cork.  We are not satisfied that there is any sense of fair play in the interview <Col N="916" /> board system in relation to examinations and that is why we ask the Minister to accept this amendment. If we are to take the central government, how many posts in the Civil Service are available to boys and girls on a written examination only?  The Minister may say there is an oral test in Irish but, apart from that, how many hundreds of posts within the Civil Service are available on the results of a written examination?  In the case of the various local authorities, why should it not be correct to say that what is good enough for the Civil Service should be good enough for us in rural Ireland?</P>
    <P>I believe there is no need to dwell on this amendment.  It is clean-cut. The Minister might let us have his views on the amendment so that we may know where we stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>As mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Desmond, this amendment is specifically designed to get rid of an abuse that those of us who are connected with local authorities will readily admit is too prevalent in the filling of such posts as clerical officers in a local authority. We are all acquainted with the system that operates in the vast majority of local authorities when they are recruiting staff, particularly clerical officers and so forth.  We are aware that in many instances, first of all there is a written examination and then an interview, an oral test of general knowledge and it has been our experience that in very many instances indeed the marks allotted in respect of the oral interview after the written examination are out of all proportion to the marks allotted to the various subjects in the written examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, this system has led to abuse which we in this House and members of local authorities cannot afford to ignore.  Unfortunately, there have been instances where it has appeared to me and to some of my colleagues that political influence before the interview board has been the decisive factor in turning the scales in favour of any particular candidate. There is no reason at all for us to pursue that system and I would ask the Minister, who has wide experience <Col N="917" /> of the administration of a local authority, to accept this amendment. I see no good reason why people recruited for such posts as clerical officer to a local authority should not be recruited simply by a written clerical examination.  We should rid ourselves of the system which is highly suspicious, if not blatantly corrupt, as suggested to me by very many people attached to local authorities for many years.  I would seriously suggest to the Minister that he should accept this amendment unreservedly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this amendment is aimed at preventing anything more than merit filling these posts, it would obviously receive the support of everybody, but as I see it, there is one objectionable feature in it.  It is this: there is a tendency already extending outside local authorities and the local government law to a belief that a written competitive examination is the best test of the skill of a clerical officer.  That, as a general idea, probably can be subscribed to by the House but there must be a considerable number of positions under a local authority in which the general ability, the general manner and the competence of a person, which can best be assessed at an interview or oral examination and which very often does not come out in a written competitive examination, is the most important thing about the job.</P>
      <P>In so far as clerical officers of a local authority are concerned who are meeting members of the public, for instance, it is right to say that the experience of many members of the House, not possibly in connection with a local authority but in connection with other businesses, is that the person who comes out first place in a written examination is very often the worst person to deal with the man who comes to the office or the counter.  We should guard against preventing a local authority from properly staffing itself in that line.  In other words, the person who comes out first in the written examination is very often the worst person to deal with common-sense affairs and with the public as they come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" /> If the amendment in this form were added to the section one might easily find that local authorities were prevented from getting a number of very competent people for particular jobs in the clerical line because they could not compete with &mdash; I will not say the more bookwormish&mdash;but the least suitable applicants who would get first place in the written examination.</P>
    <P>In so far as the amendment is designed to try to prevent influence or any other form of wrong selection, it is first-class but in so far as it might hamper a local authority, acting genuinely, from employing the best man available for the particular job, I think it is going too far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Dublin Corporation the system is somewhat in between what is suggested in the amendment and what has been suggested by Deputy Finlay.  We hold examinations for clerical appointments and then there is an interview for all those who have qualified in the written examination so that, as far as humanly possible, steps are taken to guard against the type of individual against whom Deputy Finlay wants to guard against being appointed.</P>
      <P>I agree that it is not desirable that the person who gets highest marks in the written examination should be appointed without making sure that in all other respects he or she is suitable for the particular position.</P>
      <P>In Dublin Corporation we are keen to ensure that there will be possibilities of promotion for clerical officers and that some future will be assured to those who qualify and that, therefore, the best types will apply for the positions.  In the City of Dublin our attitude is in between what is directly suggested by the amendment and what Deputy Finlay has suggested as a result of observation.</P>

      <P>As the House is probably aware, there is a regulation under the Local Government (Officers Regulations) Act, 1943, that an office will normally be filled under a local authority after advertisement and written competitive examination unless it is decided that some other method of <Col N="919" /> selection is more suitable for that type of office.  Under these regulations, all offices are filled by open competitive examination with one exception, that is, unless it is decided that some other method of selection is more suitable.</P>

When the open competitive examination is held, it is a written examination in so far as clerical officers and library assistants are concerned. With regard to the clerk-typist, one will readily appreciate that unless certificates are produced there must be some sort of oral interview with regard to typing and shorthand.</P>
      <P>With regard to the clerical officer and library assistant, if the county manager decides that he has within his own staff some person who can fill these vacancies by way of promotion, then he is entitled to do so.  If this amendment is accepted it will debar all members of the staff of local authorities from promotion.  That is the effect of the amendment submitted to the House.  That is something I would not like to see.  I am sure that members of local authorities here would not like to see the staffs prevented from receiving promotion with the local authorities with which they work.</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting the Deputy has, but this amendment will prohibit promotion within the local authorities.  I know that some Deputies will suggest there are confined competitions held by county managers.  That is true.  Where a county manager decides to promote and finds that he has a number of personnel on his staff and he cannot make up his mind as to which of them deserves promotion, then he may himself hold an examination confined entirely to the members of the local authority's staff and he may promote one of them.  I feel certain that the Deputies who sponsor this amendment did not realise that it would bar promotion within the staff of a local authority.  I can assure them, when it is not a case of promotion, a written competitive examination is always held and must be held under the regulations.</P>

If that is so, why does not the manager exercise that power independently? Why does he set up a selection board whose selection from time to time convinces most of us that there is an element of injustice and unfairness and, perhaps, political influence in the selection?  We are not satisfied. The whole thing is an innovation. Those of us who have been 30 years in public life are not at all satisfied. There is a great deal of suspicion surrounding the selection board.  It is only used as a machine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Minister said &mdash;I think he is perfectly right&mdash;that the manager has discretionary powers, but in our opinion they are not being exercised.  Instead of exercising the powers he has, the manager selects a board in order to get rid of the responsibility himself.  From our experience in connection with many of these <Col N="921" /> boards, we are not satisfied with the justice, the fairness or the efficiency with which they are discharged.  To use a biblical expression: very often the last are put first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the statement made by the Minister on this amendment is far too alarmist.  I think it is designed to frighten those who placed it on the Paper.  For a long time I have been very doubtful as to the manner of making many minor appointments by the county manager.  I cannot for the life of me see how the acceptance of this amendment could affect existing service in regard to these minor appointments to which I think this amendment refers.</P>
      <P>We all know that in so far as the normal clerical staff is concerned these appointments are made as the result of a competitive examination but there is a tremendous number of appointments for which the manager is responsible and which are not made by competitive examination at all but by this system of interview board.  I am not so much afraid of the political influence that has been referred to here as I am of some of the far more undesirable influences in the making of these appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The managers are legally responsible. The managers in some cases after the extension of the managerial system to the country exercised that legal responsibility themselves.  For some reason or another as a result, perhaps, of public criticism and pressure of one kind or another or as a result, perhaps, of having their decisions questioned by members of local bodies, the managers resorted to the easy way of setting up  selection board.  Is it not a strange thing in relation to these minor posts because in the main they are minor&mdash; in fact, they are entirely minor posts&mdash; if the managers had themselves exercised these legal functions, then I would not support the amendment at all because in that case you could point your finger straight and direct, if some appointment was made which was <Col N="922" /> obviously open to criticism, and you could say: &ldquo;Why did you make that appointment?&rdquo;  You could at least call upon him to give his reasons for making it but the practice has developed of setting up what is called an interview board.</P>
    <P>The procedure followed in that case is that the manager tells the secretary of the county council that he wants an interview board.  Perhaps he also tells some other senior official the same story.  They finally decide on who is to compose this interview board.  The manager himself may be a member of it.  He need not be.  There will be an accountant from a neighbouring county and an engineer from another neighbouring county, and so on.  As a result of watching, not any more carefully than many other people, this system for some time, I have come to the conclusion that it is a bad and dangerous system.</P>
    <P>I am not terrifically keen on this amendment because I know, as Deputy Finlay stated, there are certain appointments that you cannot make as well, perhaps, through a competitive examination as you can otherwise make them, although in the main a competitive examination is something that you cannot challenge.  It is not perfect but it is the nearest thing to it.  If, as I say, the managers had continued to exercise their full responsibility themselves, to make their choice in relation to some of these minor posts that are filled from time to time by the authority, then I would be satisfied with it because you could always pin them down to what they had decided, to the person they had selected, and so forth.  Now, however, they can parade themselves before their local body and say, if something goes wrong or if an obvious injustice has been done in respect of the person selected: &ldquo;I set up a selection board.  Here is the list.  I selected the person placed first on that list.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not like the amendment, but I do not see that there is any other method by which I can give expression to my feelings in regard to this matter except by announcing that I would be prepared to accept it.  I do not feel wedded to it, but I find the system as <Col N="923" /> it is so objectionable that even though what is suggested is not ideal I would prefer it to leaving this power in the hands of a number of people to be scattered around by officials who can, in fact, convey to other officials who will sit on these selection boards their interest in a particular appointment or convey in one way or another the name of the person they would, perhaps, like to see appointed&mdash;and all this can go on even behind the back of the manager who is legally responsible and who, in many cases, knows nothing at all about it.  It is not the political influence side that I fear half as much as other sides that can operate to the detriment of justice and fair play.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a lot of sympathy with what Deputy Smith has said&mdash;but he has not read the amendment. The amendment refers to permanent posts of a clerical nature. Deputy Smith has told the House he has seen boards set up to fill such posts.  He has never seen such a board set up.  Under the regulations, it is impossible to set up such a board. There must be a competitive examination unless it is a case of promotion, and then it is only from the staff of that particular local authority.  Only when the county manager considers that he has more than one applicant for that particular post does he set up such a board.</P>
      <P>I would love to accept this amendment. I have a lot of sympathy with what Deputy Madden has said.  I know these things are going on.  I know that county managers have victimised certain individuals.  However, I also know that there are people who should get promotion and, if this amendment is accepted, we are debarring them for all time from getting the promotion.  Is it fair to ask a spinster who has been in the employment of a local authority for, say, 15 or 20 years to compete with a young person leaving school with the leaving certificate or even with an honours degree?</P>

He has another method and the second method is by promoting one of his own staff.  If the county manager feels there are two or three or four of the staff equal to the position which is vacant, and if he feels he should not decide on the merits of any particular individual, he may set up an interview board to interview the four applicants &mdash;but they must be from the staff and it must be for the purpose of promoting one of them.

      <P>I was almost inclined to rub my hands with glee when I heard the Minister's statement within the past five minutes that he favours promotion.  That is something for which we in the corporation have been pressing for many years.  We in the <Col N="926" /> corporation have been pressing the Minister for many years for promotion of our own servants&mdash;who also were competitive examination clerks.  At the end of 15 or 20 and in some cases 30 years' service, when our city manager saw fit to recommend certain of these officials for promotion, the Minister's Department turned them down.</P>
      <P>I want to say here that we have a splendid city manager.  However, when he saw fit to recommend good officials of 20, 30 or even 35 years' service for promotion&mdash;as I say, I heard with great pleasure what the Minister has just said about this examination system&mdash;the Minister's Department turned them down.  All the corporation clerical staff are examination men. They come in, in their youth, as examination men.  In two cases within the past few months, men with 30 years' service whom the city manager recommended for promotion were turned down by the Minister's Department.

      <P>I do not think the Minister, on reflection, will regard his last remarks as true to the situation.  What Deputy Byrne has said is quite correct. There is such an amount of interference from the Custom House in the day to day activities in dealing with staffs that it has become almost objectionable. The Minister thinks the city manager just picks an individual.  The city manager wants to pick a board of his higher officials to select from available candidates a person to be promoted to another position, but the Custom House says: &ldquo;No, you will have to bring in some outside people to adjudicate&rdquo;.  Who are brought in?&mdash; individuals who know nothing of the Dublin Corporation and know nothing about the candidates and their competency and efficiency.  In the housing department of the City of Dublin there was recently a retirement, through age of the director.  A man who had years and years of good service, who knew all about the workings of that particular section and who was regarded not only by the city manager but by the present members of the corporation as an efficient person to be promoted to that position, is turned down by the Custom House.  On what grounds is he turned down?&mdash;on the grounds that he has only three more years to go to retiring age and therefore: &ldquo;We are not going to promote him to this position&rdquo;.  Then we nominate a second man and we have almost a similar position, but I understand now from the letter Deputy Byrne has read out that he is acceptable.</P>

But we do take on our staff right from the beginning as clerical officers&mdash;and I think the Labour group will agree with this attitude&mdash;with the view that such persons can grow in stature in the service of the corporation, and not be taken purely to remain for all their lives as junior clerical officers.</P>

Quite a number of our clerical assistants or clerical officers come in and spend a lot of their spare time and their money in attending universities to qualify for higher positions.  Consequently, we feel that if we take in a clerical officer, say, the son of a poor working man, and that boy goes to a university and by study and hard work is able to develop himself to warrant proper advancement in his own lifetime, we should be entitled to promote him.</P>

      <P>I did not bring in the Dublin Corporation&mdash;it was well aired on this amendment before I intervened. As I said before, we have a competitive examination in the City of Dublin. The promoters of this amendment want to see the same type of method of intake into local authorities everywhere. I say that I welcome that, because of the future welfare of those who will be successful candidates for local authority positions.  I agree with Deputy Finlay's point of view that <Col N="933" /> there must be some amendment to this amendment, so that not necessarily the candidate who gets top marks is the person called.  That candidate must also have other necessary qualifications, which can only become apparent as a result of an interview afterwards. I hope the proposers will be prepared to amend it.  I think they would agree on that.  At a later stage of the Bill, we will be dealing very explicitly with promotion and the right of local authorities to promote their own officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is not an attempt by the Labour movement to stop promotion from within the employees of any local authority.  I welcome this without any question at all.  It is an attempt to stop the stultification of the results of competitive examination by the setting up of a foul interview board that can negative the whole of the examination results by having a fixed board.  Like Deputy Smith, I am not so sure that it is political influence that influences these cherries of the local administration, which are the equivalent of the plums of the Custom House.  There are organisations and associations that take a personal interest in the minor positions and use their endeavours through these interview boards to make certain that the competitive result is knocked out completely.  We in the Labour movement feel perfectly right in safeguarding the working people so that they may have a fair chance, without pull or favour from any organisation.  That is what we are trying to do and we ask the Minister to meet us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said &ldquo;clerical officers&rdquo;.  We very carefully did not use those words: we said &ldquo;permanent positions of a clerical nature&rdquo;.  We have in mind the very posts mentioned by the Minister, that of store-keeper and such minor posts which, appearently, are of such clerical importance that there is a standard of competitive examination up to leaving honours standard necessary before you may be considered.  Notwithstanding that, you can get through that and go to the top of the list, but there is then an interview board which can allocate so <Col N="934" /> many marks that they can destroy the whole result of the competitive examination. If the Minister will assure us that he will examine the position from the point of view of safeguarding that point, that is all the Labour Party wants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see, the important thing is whether the Minister is correct in what he stated or whether Deputy Smith is correct in saying that the Minister's views were merely alarmist views.  There is a clear-cut conflict between Deputy Briscoe's view on the one hand&mdash;to which, let me say, I subscribe&mdash;and the view expressed by Deputy Kyne.  It may be that in Dublin we have been fortunate in the particular method employed and that some other local authorities were unfortunate.</P>
      <P>Expressing a personal view, I believe Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Finlay are quite right.  I think that to get the proper person you must have something more than a written examination. The amendment makes it quite definite and clear that the proposers want the filling of permanent posts of a clerical nature confined to a written examination and a written competitive examination only, and they have deliberately used the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; in the amendment. It has been pointed out here by Deputy Finlay and by Deputy Briscoe that there are posts where more than academic distinctions or academic qualifications are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only feasible way that I know of of finding out whether or not a candidate is suitable for those posts is to see the candidate and interview him.  Let me give an example.  Any Deputy who is a member of a vocational education committee knows that at practically every meeting it is necessary to appoint teachers to particular posts.  In Dublin, we have that at practically every meeting.  There is a meeting of the vocational education committee in Dublin this evening. Where particular posts are to be filled, it would be a grave mistake, the Deputy will agree, for the members of that committee to allow themselves to be influenced in deciding who should be appointed, solely by the academic <Col N="935" /> qualifications and distinctions of the candidates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what happens in vocational committees.  They go out and canvass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt there is a lot of canvassing and I do not think the Deputy's group is very far behind anyone else in the race.  I believe I discharge my functions on that committee conscientiously.  If the Deputy cares to make inquiries he will find that anyone who has approached me whether in my Party or out of my Party got the same answer, and that was that I refused to commit myself to anyone before the interview and the making of the appointment. The Deputy can check that.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is this&mdash;that it would be a great mistake for members of a committee such as that to be influenced solely by the academic qualifications or distinctions of the candidates because they have to fill a particular type of post where the ability to control groups of students and ability to impart knowledge and information is necessary.  That is not going to arise in an exactly parallel way in the posts which we are discussing now, but as Deputy Finlay has pointed out there will be cases&mdash;certainly there are cases in Dublin every day&mdash;where it is necessary for permanent posts of a clerical nature&mdash;to take the expression used in the amendment&mdash;to be filled.  Those officers in those posts are men who in the discharge of their duties will have to work in contact with the public and deal with citizens over counters, and in one way or another, it is necessary to have an eye, if you like, to public relations in making those appointments, and I do not see any better method of doing it than the method which Deputy Briscoe has outlined here.</P>
      <P>But let us get back to the objection the Minister made to this amendment and to which no person so far has put forward an answer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has made the point that if this amendment were accepted as it stands it would debar the system of promotion with regard to any posts affected by it.  Let us take the amendment as it stands and I think on the simple reading of it whether we are lawyers or laymen we must admit that the Minister was right.  Assuming that there is a system of promotion now whether it is used or not and assuming that this amendment is accepted and put into operation must it not necessarily mean that whatever system of promotion exists in relation to permanent posts of a clerical nature goes by the board? After all the amendment suggests that any amendment made in relation to paragraph (g) of the particular section of the 1941 Act shall prescribe in relation to all permanent posts of a clerical nature that they be filled by written competitive examination only.  The issue is quite clear.  What the proposers of the amendment are doing is asking the House to state that any permanent posts of a clerical nature that become vacant must be filled by written competitive examination and by no other method.  That obviously cuts out any discretion by the county council or the county manager to fill such a post by promotion.</P>

It provides that any vacancies which occur and which are affected by this amendment will be filled in a particular way, by written competitive examination and by that way only.</P>

      <P>Deputy Alderman Byrne has made a plea to the Minister with regard to promotion and said that in a letter to Dublin Corporation on November 9th he had recommended promotion in accordance with the regulations which are there already.  We may have different points of view as to whether the particular methods by which the system of promotion can be implemented are good or bad, but taking this amendment as it stands, it is not expressed to refer to a confined or limited competitive examination. Taking it as it stands, quite clearly it cuts out any idea of promotion within the service.  The Minister has indicated that he is prepared to accept the wishes of the House on it.  I want to make this suggestion to the Deputies who moved the amendment&mdash;that if they feel this amendment should be accepted and that at the same time the principles of promotion should be preserved, quite obviously it is necessary to alter the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally I want to say there is a further difficulty which has become apparent in the discussions here. Again, I suffer from the disadvantage of not having the 1941 Act in front of me.  There is an expression used in this amendment &ldquo;permanent posts of a clerical nature&rdquo; and as between the two or three different Deputies who have contributed to this debate there has been a difference of opinion <Col N="938" /> already as to what that phrase would cover, whether it would relate to a storeman or to clerical officers as most of us would know them in the service of local authorities.  The final suggestion I am making is this: That if this amendment were to be accepted by the House it would seem to me to be obviously necessary that there should be some definition of what &ldquo;permanent posts of a clerical nature&rdquo; means. Taken in its broadest sense it is proposed to cover every single post to be filled by local authorities, or in the local authority service from the city manager right down to the street cleaner who may have to compile a return of the work he does or the implements he uses.  It may be that that was deliberately in the minds of the movers of this amendment but I think that some definition of that phrase is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point at issue here is recruitment to certain branches of local authority service and it is now sought to cover subsequent promotion in that service.  It ought not to be difficult, in the first instance, to frame an examination suited to the post to be filled and to make the appointment on the results of that examination, without interview, but covering the <Col N="939" /> qualities that would be brought out in an interview, by having a probationary period of, say, six months.  It would then be plainly seen whether the person who got the highest place in the examination was a suitable person for the post.  Many local authorities deal with that point by creating a panel following an examination which lasts over a period of a year and a half and recruitment within that period is from that panel.  That is a very clear and unobjectionable way of recruiting clerical staff.  It does not apply to other staffs perhaps who may require to have other experience and so on which will have to be assessed in a different way.  The point which is not covered is the matter of subsequent promotion, but I do not see that this amendment will be any barrier to subsequent promotions for those who have already entered the service and who have shown a competence, an assiduity and a skill in the performance of their duties.  Generally speaking, I think that, to guard against the operation of all other influencing considerations but merit alone, the amendment is worthy of very serious consideration and of support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with the terminology of the amendment, but, as one of the people who have had uninterrupted association and connection with public bodies, I should like to get from the Minister a clarification of a statement he made with regard to the promotion of clerical officers.  He told us that where there are three or four on a staff, with equal educational attainments and perhaps with the same administrative experience, the manager could not exercise his managerial functions and select one from that number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but he does not. I have known cases of a number of officials who were on a basis of parity, so far as efficiency and experience were concerned, and still the manager exercised his managerial functions and authority and made a selection.  Deputy <Col N="940" /> O'Higgins talked about the system of promotion.  A system of promotion is gradually developing which is receiving the silent condemnation of public bodies and I think it is possible to establish a clear and unmistakable case for the existence of certain corruption. We are all sick of the boards and some of us have from time to time abhorred the selected personnel of these boards and the philosophy of mind which they are invited and encouraged to bring into their work.  It is not always the most brilliant men who are selected, as has happened quite recently, to the dismay and disappointment of public men who value justice and recognise efficiency and capacity.  I feel that I would be wanting in my duty as a public man if I failed to draw the attention of the Minister to a growing evil.  I say that the system is bad.  I am not influenced by the terminology or phraseology of the amendment.  The principle is sound, but I believe it needs alteration to bring within its ambit the wiping out of a system which, if permitted to continue, will constitute a disgrace to the principles and security of democracy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Madden has made a far better contribution than any of the other speakers who found it so convenient to jump to conclusions and to see behind this amendment some of the hidden dangers about which we have been hearing so much.  The Minister did not go so far as Deputy Madden has gone, for which credit will be given to Deputy Madden.  The Minister did not even say: &ldquo;We may see dangers in it but we are prepared to try to do something towards improving it&rdquo;.  The Minister at the outset professed to see a lurking danger in the amendment and decided to have nothing to do with it.  I do not know why, in the middle of the discussion, an effort was made to change it completely by switching the words we had set down, &ldquo;clerical nature&rdquo; to &ldquo;clerical officer&rdquo;.  Apparently we differ as to what the phrase &ldquo;clerical nature&rdquo; may mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins has gone so far as to suggest that it may be thought that <Col N="941" /> everyone, other than an executive officer&mdash;I think he nearly said county manager&mdash;down to the man working on the street may be such, whereas the Minister clearly indicated that a store-keeper could not be.  Does the Minister know that in various counties there are clerks in deputy surveyors' offices?  It is true that they may not be permanent, but Deputy Smith was correct when he said that it is not the vacancies of a higher nature that we are interested in, because they are more or less on the established part of the local authority office where everything is, or is expected to be, somewhat above board.  In passing, I may say to the Minister that he is not one inch ahead of us in his views on promotion. It is farther down the line that our interest lies&mdash;the case of the store-keeper and many other such employees, in what some people might call menial positions but which we consider to be the ones where the good pickings are. It is quite correct to say, as has been said, that the trouble may not be political&mdash;we know that it can be the old parish-pump style of trouble, the strong man in the little parish who can use his influence.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about interview boards, on which Deputy Finlay has expressed his own views, as has Deputy O'Higgins.  Apparently, it is vitally important, as they say, that we should have these interview boards.  How do we know, as members of local authorities, anything about the qualifications of the people on these interview boards?</P>
    <P>They are the people who decide which candidate will get the post.  As Deputy MacCarthy knows&mdash;he will agree with me, I have no doubt&mdash;in Cork County, as in other areas, no member of the local authority may ask, even after 12 months, who was on an interview board.  Nobody dare suggest that he doubts the qualifications of those present on the interview board.  After a written competitive examination we know the ability of a candidate, but who knows, does even the manager know, does the Minister for Local Government&mdash;who has been so careful in saying how completely he is opposed to this amendment as it is <Col N="942" /> worded&mdash;know what is the ability of any man who may be on an interview board?  It all happens in a room where the interview is taking place and we know it from our own experience the various cases where these difficulties arise.  We are not satisfied with the system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith says the amendment is not perfect.  We agree.  It is difficult to frame an amendment of this kind, but is it any worse than the present system?  Surely anything that may contain some suggestion to improve the present system should be welcomed by the Minister, even if he is to come here on the Report Stage with some alternative suggestion.  After all, Deputies spoke here on the amendment who had not themselves put in amendments. They were entitled to do that, but at least we in the Labour Party, in submitting this amendment showed our interest in the problem.  Perhaps because we have not the legal training that other Deputies have, our amendment may not be water-tight, and because of that, we had to face the criticisms of some Deputies.  We do not mind that.  The intention behind the amendment is good.  It was not fair of the Minister to suggest that there is danger lurking in the amendment. Indeed there is no danger in it, and if the Minister, even at this stage is prepared to say that on the Report Stage he will offer some suggestions which will help to get away from the present system which very often breeds corruption of the worst type in rural Ireland, then perhaps despite all the bitterness evoked we shall have achieved something in our efforts to improve the system.</P>

      <P>I first of all want to avail of this opportunity to correct something I said earlier, which I cannot now remember very well, when I drew attention to the possibility that this amendment might be applied to the appointments made by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  It will only apply to those appointments not made by the commissioners.  I am not clear as to the appointments made and not made by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  It might be useful if the Minister could give us a picture of <Col N="943" /> the type of appointments made by the Local Appointments Commission and appointments made otherwise at the moment.  It did occur to me whatever system is operated in the Dublin Corporation at the moment there was general agreement among the Dublin Deputies that system was a satisfactory one.</P>

      <P>The system of the corporation.  What the Minister might be able to do would be to consider some arrangement which might be evolved to give effect to that system and to make it of general application to the country as a whole.  I do not know whether I am suggesting a compromise which is not acceptable.  I can see the drawbacks but the case made by the Labour Party is a very strong case.  Equally I can see the difficulty of appointing people solely by reason of their capacity as revealed in a written examination, but I think very often a written examination is highly deceptive and you may impose hardship by that system on deserving candidates, but if you have to weigh that drawback against the drawback of possibly improper methods of appointment I would be inclined to favour the Labour amendment.  I think it would be better to face the risk of occasional <Col N="944" /> hardship of appointment by written examination than to allow appointments to be subject to local pressure or influences of one kind or another.  It occurred to me that it might be possible to evolve some scheme which would operate in the country as a whole, a scheme with which the members of the corporation are satisfied.</P>

      <P>We have heard a very interesting discussion on this amendment. I must say that some speakers introduced matters that were not absolutely relevant to the amendment before the House and that the Minister has not been entirely blameless in that respect.  He raised a few hares which other Deputies followed.  I must say they were not much help.</P>

      <P>I shall readily admit, as one of the movers of the amendment, that it is not, and we do not claim it to be, word perfect.  There is perhaps some merit in the Minister's statement that it might cut across some system of promotion.  We are not against the system of promotion from within the ranks of local authority officers and employees.  We have been always for it and have always advocated it.  If our amendment as it stands at the moment could be interpreted as being against that particular type of promotion, we would be quite willing to have the wording changed. We are not sticking to the wording. We are sticking to the principle of it. I think it must be abundantly clear to the Minister, having heard a cross section of the opinion of the House, that there is a unanimous desire to wipe out any suggestion of corruption in the matter of appointing people to jobs of a clerical nature or of any other nature in our local authorities.  I do hope the Minister will indicate straightaway <Col N="945" /> that he accepts the principle we tried embody in the amendment and that he will, on the Report Stage, submit an amendment to meet our wishes.</P>
