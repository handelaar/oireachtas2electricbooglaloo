      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will use his good offices to ensure that the townlands of Largynaseeragh and Owenteskna are included in the rural electrification link-up at present being carried out in the Glencolumcille district, County Donegal, since these are two Fíor-Ghaeltacht townlands.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the townlands in question are included in the Glencolumcille area which has been selected for development under the rural electrification scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the Goleen area which has been considered on a number of occasions for development under the rural electrification scheme has not so far been selected due principally to the small percentage of householders who have agreed to take supply.  The board is unable to state when development of the area is likely to take place but suggests that a considerable improvement in the percentage of acceptances would be likely to advance the prospects of the area for selection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that when recently considered, in conjunction with other areas awaiting development under the rural electrification scheme in the board's Athlone district, the Croghan area was not selected due mainly to the fact that as the houses in that area are somewhat dispersed, more line would be necessary to supply prospective consumers than normally would be required in the average area.  The area will be considered again, but I am not in a position to state when development is likely to take place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent reduction in pig prices should result in a lower price for bacon for the consumer within the next week or so.  I am having the question of bacon prices kept under review so as to ensure that the consumer will benefit, at the earliest possible date, from any reduction in the price of pigs.  If, however, there should be any undue delay in passing on the reduction in prices to the consumer or if the reductions appear to be inadequate it may be necessary to take other steps in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that supplies of essential commodities are being withheld from wholesalers by a firm of manufacturing chemists for reasons connected with resale price maintenance although the Fair Trade Commission has made no order on resale price maintenance; and if he will ensure that supplies of these goods be resumed forthwith pending <Col N="769" /> the decision of the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the undertaking which I gave in the course of my reply to an earlier question by the Deputy on this subject on 15th June, 1954, I have brought the matter in question to the notice of the Fair Trade Commission and it is at present under consideration by that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>The point in my question here is that pending the Fair Trade Commission's ruling on the matter supplies are being withheld from wholesalers.  This is rather serious because the retailers who are suffering are rural retailers, the country chemists, and the commodities are baby foods and milk of magnesia. Could the Minister not give an assurance that until the Fair Trade Commission rule one way or the other these supplies will be continued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy in the second portion of my reply that I have brought the matter to the notice of the Fair Trade Commission and it is at present under consideration by that body.  I do not think it will be long until the particular point at issue has been dealt with.  If, however, the Deputy cares to furnish particulars of whatever complaint she has in mind, I will be glad to see that it is specifically dealt with by the Fair Trade Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, has the Minister any function in a matter like this?  Could he not give an order that supplies will not be withheld while the inquiry is proceeding? The commodities referred to have been held up for nearly four weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in the disadvantageous position that I have no actual complaint from the Deputy and no opportunity of ascertaining the merits of the grievance in this case.  If the Deputy will furnish detailed information, I will undertake to have the matter considered with reference to this particular case which the Deputy has in mind.  The other aspect of the matter is, as I explained in my reply, <Col N="770" /> at present under consideration by the Fair Trade Commission.</P>

Certain preliminary arrangements must be made before the Department will be in a position to sanction a grant towards the cost of the scheme.  These are being attended to.  When a grant has been sanctioned it will be a matter for the Commissioners of Public Works to prepare detailed working drawings and a specification and to arrange for the carrying out of the works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will indicate what steps he proposes to take to ensure the development of Irish-sponsored television in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not so far had an opportunity of giving any detailed consideration to the question of television and I am not, therfore, in a position to indicate when, or in what form, a television service may be established here.  I should like, however, to take the opportunity of mentioning some broad aspects of the problem which appear to me from a preliminary examination to be of particular importance.  First, there is the question of cost; all the information I have been able to obtain indicates that television is an extremely costly service to establish and run and it is very doubtful whether this small country can afford it at this stage, or at least whether the heavy public expenditure involved could not be used to better advantage in other directions.  Secondly, television is still very much in the experimental stage and there is much to be said for a policy of waiting and profiting from the experience of other countries.  A good deal of time, thought and money is being devoted elsewhere, for instance, to the international sharing of programmes, to the development of colour television, whilst the old problem of transmission standards still exists.  There is also the large question of commercial television and of its relationship to public service organisations. It would seem very desirable <Col N="777" /> that we should wait and watch what happens across the channel when the new system gets going there.  Thirdly, until the Government has had the time and opportunity to consider policy in regard to television fully, it is obviously undesirable that we should allow the position to be prejudiced in any way and it is accordingly proposed not to issue licences to commercial interests or others for television broadcasting, even experimentally. No useful purpose would, in our view, be served by having tests made at this stage.  We do not believe that such tests would add anything worth while to our knowledge of the technical problems.  Finally, I believe it would be premature to inaugurate an Irish television service until we are in a position to offer programmes with a distinctively Irish character and worth offering to the Irish people.</P>
      <P>Television has been the subject of close study by my Department for some years.  I propose to encourage the Department to continue this research, to maintain intimate contact with developments abroad&mdash;we are particularly well-fitted to do this by virtue of our membership of the Administrative Council of the European Broadcasting Union&mdash;and to furnish regular reports to me upon the position as it affects Ireland so that at the appropriate time I will be able to make recommendations to the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the coastal areas in West Cork are outside the first-class reception area of a central medium wave station and these areas, being nearest to the Continent, are also affected by interference from foreign stations, particularly after dark.  In the more distant places from Athlone it is necessary to have an efficient earth and aerial as well as a <Col N="778" /> good quality receiver to get reasonably good reception.</P>
      <P>The recent installation of a new transmitter should have improved reception from Cork in places not too far from the city and when we get a new transmitter in Athlone next year it may improve reception generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the duties on motor cars, musical instruments, clocks and watches and cinematograph films imposed by Section 12 of the British Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, and continued in force here on the establishment of the State in 1923.  Originally these duties were continued purely to raise revenue for national purposes and they still serve that end.  With the establishment of new industries here, certain of the duties, notably the motor car duty, have assumed also a protective character and, in fact, where necessary their structure has been altered to intensify their protective effect.</P>
      <P>The need for these duties is, in common with all other duties in the customs and excise tariff, reviewed annually in connection with the Budget statement.  If the Deputy cares to send me any suggestions, I shall consider them on the occasion of the next review.</P>

      <P>A grant of £260 was expended last <Col N="781" /> year on the repair of the existing accommodation road in Cruit Island, which is now, I am informed, in good condition.  The Deputy presumably refers to a proposal to extend this road across Cruit Island to a point opposite Owey Island, known locally as Dooghbeg. An application has been received for the construction of a pier at Dooghbeg to facilitate the Owey Islanders and until a decision is given on the pier proposal it will not be possible to decide whether the proposed road extension will be constructed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that tenants of labourers' cottages in South Kerry have been informed by the Kerry County Council that they are no longer entitled to have repairs to their cottages carried out by the council owing to the fact that they are deemed now to be vested tenants; whether he is further aware that the tenants concerned are thus placed in a very difficult position; and, if so, whether he will arrange to have a scheme introduced by local authorities whereby such tenants will be assisted in carrying out repairs for which they now have become responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before making an Order vesting a cottage in the tenant, the county council is required to see that the cottage is in good repair and sanitary condition and any doubt, dispute or question which may arise in this connection is determined by the Minister.  Once the vesting Order is made, the repair of the cottage becomes the responsibility of the purchaser, it being a statutory condition of every such Order that the cottage shall be kept in good sanitary condition and repair during the payment period of the purchase annuity.  I am not aware that this condition, which is an essential feature of the cottage purchase scheme, has the effect suggested by the Deputy in view of the provision regarding the repair of cottages prior to vesting and the very favourable terms on which cottages are purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the controversy which has centred on this point between the tenants and the county council, could the Minister see his way to arrange to have these cottages inspected?  The Minister may be in a position to look up the correspondence and, if he does so, he may find that on a previous occasion there <Col N="784" /> was a suggestion by the former Minister that an inspector might be sent down there.  I do not know why that suggestion did not materialise.  If the Minister can now see his way to arrange that an inspector will visit the county and make inspections in relation to the claims in question, we shall be very grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before a tenant becomes a tenant purchaser he is required to sign an agreement in which he sets out that the repairs have been duly executed.  Neither the Minister nor the local authority have any further statutory power to effect repairs after the purchase agreement has been signed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the tenants in question claim that they have not signed this purchase agreement and that they were deemed to have purchased on the report of the county engineer.  In view of that aspect of the matter, would the Minister not agree that some investigation should be carried out on behalf of the tenants concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Either the tenants signed the agreement or they did not. If they did, the Minister has no statutory function.  If they did not, there is a criminal side of the court to deal with forgeries such as the Deputy alleges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been speaking on the desirability, in fact, the necessity of increasing the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The grants given under this Act are very desirable and necessary particularly in certain areas in the West of Ireland. I think we all agree that agriculture is our greatest industry and that necessary and reasonable assistance should be given to promote increased production in agriculture.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act could be very instrumental in bringing about that increase in agricultural production if the Act were fully availed of and if the grants were raised to a worthwhile extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say that the country has lost a lot due to the fact that we are not deriving the full value from the land owing to neglect of one very elementary thing which is necessary not only to improve fertility and consequently production but to enable the land to be reclaimed.  I believe that the first essential is the absolute necessity of draining small rivers. <Col N="790" /> Numerous farmers in my constituency have told me that.  So far as I am aware there are no provisions to do this work except in and under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I myself know of one river in respect of which the grant is almost exhausted and work is likely to cease on the cleaning of the river within the next week.</P>
    <P>Only half of the work has been done. This means that the completion of the cleaning of the river must be postponed for another 12 months with a further loss to the farmers.  Most of these farmers are progressive small farmers who are anxious to proceed with the reclamation of those parts of their land adjoining this river which are water-soaked and water-logged. They must wait a further 12 months and all because a very small sum of money is not available.  On the other hand, we have stretches of roads torn up in the county.  I think it is wasteful and unnecessary expenditure to cut new portions of road through land where it would suffice to ease the corner and leave an island of land between the newly constructed road and the old road.  The money could be better utilised on drainage and reclamation.</P>
    <P>I only entered the debate with a desire to impress on the Minister the necessity of increasing the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  A Deputy on the other side of the House mentioned that there was an abuse in regard to the grants under this Act.  He mentioned the case of a man with 1,000 acres being able to avail of the provisions of the Act.  I do not see how a small farmer can afford on his own to drain a river which passes through ten or 12 townlands without the assistance given under this Act, which not only provides the means but brings about the co-operation necessary to have the drain cleaned over its entire length.  We must remember that there are 40 to 60 farms involved over the full length of some of these rivers.  I do not see why 99 people should suffer because a Deputy on the far side refers to the man with the 1,000 acres.  We have no man with 1,000 acres, or at least possibly we <Col N="791" /> have a very few, in the West, but the people I am referring to who would derive benefit from the Local Authorities (Works) Act are small holders ranging from 18 to 40 acres.  They cannot possibly reclaim their lands, they cannot avail of land reclamation schemes, until the preliminary drainage work is carried out.</P>
    <P>To my mind this is rather an urgent matter.  Each year it has been held up for a further year, and until such time as these grants are increased we are not going to progress very far in the matter of increased production.  We will just continue as we have been going.  There are whole groups of farmers anxious to improve their farms, and this is necessary preliminary work, so I would ask the Minister to seriously consider increasing these grants even this year if possible and not to wait until next year and if necessary I would ask him to look into the expenditure incurred by the Department in the cutting away of entire areas on main roads which I think is unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to answer what a previous speaker said regarding the Local Authorities (Works) Act. We all know the invaluable service given to the country by the implementation of that Act, and our regret down the years has been that the grant has been considerably reduced. In the first year of its operation the grant, I think, was £1,900,000.  It has been gradually reduced from time to time until to-day it is the very small figure of £400,000, as disclosed in the Book of Estimates for this year.  I do not think that that is the spirit in which to tackle this problem of drainage.  It means that the grant has been reduced since 1949 to one-fifth of what it was.  I would expect the grant to be increased rather than be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, in connection with the Local Authorities (Works) Act I have to complain about delays in notification to the county councils of the amount of grant they will get.  Every year since the Act became law there has been unnecessary delay.  To give <Col N="792" /> an instance, last year we in Roscommon did not get notification of the grants allocated until October.  The amount was very small&mdash;£7,000 or £8,000&mdash;a matter I deplore very much; and it is regrettable to tell the people of Roscommon that they cannot embark on their drainage schemes until the month of October.  I would impress on the Minister and his Department to give timely notice of the amounts of these grants.</P>
    <P>The amounts should be known now, as a matter of fact, so that the county councils could embark on drainage at the proper time of the year, which is during the summer or the early harvest months.  We have been discussing it at our county council meeting and last month when we inquired we were told that the amount of grant had not been made known by the Department. In all sincerity, I would ask the Minister to expedite notification of these grants so that drainage could be carried out in the dry months of the year and not in the winter, when drainage is ineffective and drains are flooded and inaccessible.</P>
    <P>In connection with housing, I would like to say a few words.  The payment of grants has been particularly slow for the last few months in my constituency. To-day I was looking up a list of cases having reached various stages of housing grant, and I have about 12 cases to hand in to the Department of Local Government of delays in payment of half grants and further grants.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give some further assistance to our local engineer, who is a most efficient man, a man I have seen working at 10 o'clock at night on inspection.  He is an ordinary human being and cannot possibly cover the ground and give the service the people want because he is so overworked. Some of these cases are months waiting.  I am not attaching any blame to anyone, but I say that more help is needed to assist the housing inspector in my area.  As the House knows, it puts a very great strain on builders' providers to have to wait for months and months for the money from applicants. They are a bit hesitant in giving credit to new applicants.  A contractor came to me the other day, <Col N="793" /> a man in very small cirmcumstances, and he told me that at least £3,000 or £4,000 was due to him from the country for grants which had not been paid by the Government.  That man has reached the limit of his credit.  The bank is beginning to close down on him and he cannot attempt any more work unless he is paid for what has been done.</P>
    <P>Further in connection with housing, and particularly with new housing grants, I have come across cases where complaints have been made about the fees payable when plans are handed to what is called the appointed officer. I always understood that his fee should be £2 2s. but for some small alteration in a plan I have known people to pay as much as £12 12s.  I think that there should be a check on that, that it should not be allowed to continue. There is something like fleecing of the public going on.  A reasonable fee would be a few pounds.  I know that it is obligatory to pay £2 2s. for joining a public utility building society, but it is unfair and unjust to charge anything in the neighbourhood of £10 for a plan for one of those houses.  I suggest that the Minister should have stock or standard plans in the Department which could be used by those inspectors or appointed officers.  He should have seven or eight of these plans on which no alteration would be necessary.  He has a few of them in the Department, I understand, but the slightest alteration, even drawing a straight line, may cost an applicant £10.  I would ask the Minister to look into that very seriously.  I could give him cases of where the most unjust demands were made for fees for plans.</P>
    <P>Another matter I would like to call to his attention arises out of our county council meeting in Roscommon &mdash;the question of wages of workers. Perhaps it is not the Minister's function, but I would suggest that he should consider it and make it a function of the Department.  I would suggest that wages of county council workers should be fixed on a regional basis, and fixed the same as wages for various other officials such as forestry workers and others are fixed by <Col N="794" /> Government Departments.  The Minister should take this in hands and fix wages on a regional basis, taking into consideration the conditions that prevail in each region and making an exception, of course, for county council workers residing in places like Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, where the cost of living is naturally higher than in the country.  There should be some uniform rate for rural areas such as the West of Ireland&mdash;Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.</P>
    <P>It is amazing to see how much diversity we have in the rates paid in those areas.  We have demands now from unions and when we try to make comparisons we do not know if we are treating them unjustly or not.  I would be the last in the country to do anything in the way of putting any burden on the workers, because workers on the roads are not overpaid by any means, but there should be some uniformity.  We find a different rate in Galway from that in Mayo; we find a different rate in Mayo from that in Roscommon; and we find that, in Cavan and Leitrim, the rates vary also.  I suggest that the Minister should take that into consideration and have a rate of a uniform type.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickPGogan" hpid="Mr. Gogan Mr. Gogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has covered every phase of the Department's work, without reference to Local Government officials.  May I be permitted to mention some of the grievances which concern these officials?  On Wednesday last, we heard Deputy Lemass speak of his efforts in 1947 to relate the cost of living to wages and salaries and of the conferences he held with the Federation of Employers, the Trade Union Congress and the Congress of Irish Unions.  I should like to appeal to the various Parties to do something in the shape of a united effort for a group of our citizens who, during the past number of years, have got very scant consideration from any of the Governments.  I refer to the retired local government official.  From the time of the war, no increase has been granted to this body of citizens, and I ask the Minister to consider granting an increase in the pensions of these men comparable with the various increases granted to existing officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> As the Minister is aware, local government officials, since 1939, have enjoyed an increase of 30 per cent. bonus on salary.  We can all agree that prices are becoming stabilised.  If there is a drop in the foreign market, there will be an equal drop in the subsidies we have to pay, with the possible result of a total abolition of subsidies, and, for some years to come, the cost of living will be stabilised.  I, therefore, appeal to the Minister to consider the consolidation of that 30 per cent. bonus on salaries.  This particularly affects the younger official in the service who is about to marry and who is anxious to purchase a house and undertake the commitments involved in that.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I ask the Minister to consider the granting of the marriage increment to all officials.  At present, the marriage increment and long service increment is payable only to clerical staff and I suggest that all officials should be given it.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Byrne in deploring the depopulation of the centre of the City of Dublin by the corporation under their housing schemes.  I refer particularly to the area around Meath Street, Mercer Street and Stephen Street.  Shopkeepers in that area have been brought to near ruin by the exodus from the city.  I want to make a strong appeal also for the erection in the satellite towns being created by the corporation of a public hall with proper facilities for enjoyment for the younger members of the population.  In that regard too&mdash;it may seem a small point&mdash;there is a body known as the National Garden Guild, and, though I do not know whether the Minister has any power in the matter, I suggest that, if he has, a small grant might be made to that body which has for its object the beautifying of the various districts around the city.</P>
    <P>The system of differential rents has been in existence for three or four years and the Dublin Corporation should now have sufficient information available to enable the Minister to modify the scheme.  As I have seen it <Col N="796" /> operating in Ballyfermot, Crumlin and Cabra, it presses very hard on the tenants and I would urge a modification of the percentage rent, which at present is one-sixth of the total income, to at least one-eighth.  I, too, wish the Minister every success in his new office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertLahiffe" hpid="Mr. Lahiffe Mr. Lahiffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lahiffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with those Deputies who say that a large amount of good work has been done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, but I also agree with those who say that an amount of money has been washed down the drain under that Act.  I cannot understand why any Minister, no matter who he is or what Party he belongs to, can sanction the expenditure of hundreds of pounds on a drain when the work on that drain must stop in the flood season.  Such money is wasted and it should not be sanctioned.</P>
      <P>The Minister should ensure that, when he sanctions the expenditure of money on such works, the workmen will at least be able to see the drain. I believe that, if this work could be tackled in the dry season, hundreds of pounds could be saved on every drain and five times greater effects achieved, both from the point of view of relieving flooding and assisting the reclamation of adjoining holdings. I have had experience of seeing men fishing for a drain before getting into it to cut the sides and then they merely cut the sides into the body of the drain and could get no further. They have not gone any further since and the result has been that the situation is five times worse.  Weeds which never were in the body of the drain grew up the following year and local landholders whose land adjoined the drain and even those several miles away found their reclamation works nullified by the fact that the condition of the drain is worse than before. Moneys should be made available in time for these works and local authorities should not be held up for lack of these moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to transfer from the roads to drains in the dry season, and, while a dry season this year may come at a different time from a dry season <Col N="797" /> the following year, it should be left to the local authority engineers to draft their men into a certain drain at any time of the year at which it can be easily tackled.  If they can tackle a drain in June this year, they may not be able to go near it until September the following year and it should be left to the discretion of the county engineer to get his men working on the drain at a time when they can get down into the drain and make a job of it.  There is a more important point. A drain that is done this year may relieve flooding and assist reclamation next year or the year after.  What about the year after that?  If a sum of money could be left aside to maintain the drains, say, every three years&mdash;a very small sum would be necessary&mdash;the effect would more than pay for the amount of money it would cost.  I feel sure Deputies on all sides of the House will agree with me on that.</P>
    <P>Another small point I wish to mention is in connection with housing.  At every meeting of our own county council, and, I think, of every other county council, we have complaints that there is a hold-up in the building of labourers' cottages, due principally to the lack of suitable sites.  It is hard, we know, for adjoining towns to get people to agree to sell sites for cottages but, at the same time, in every small town and village we can find derelict sites right, left and centre that are merely an eyesore to the public. Why are these not acquired by the local authority for the building of suitable houses?</P>
    <P>There is also the question of title which comes up now and again in this regard.  The people who have owned these places for the last 20 years cannot furnish proper title.  Surely the Minister could take this House into his confidence and get the necessary legislation passed, and thus be in a position to acquire these sites without spending years and years trying to clarify the titles to them?</P>
    <P>In my own town there is a long street which has a string of derelict sites with nice plots attached to them. Why could not some semi-detached houses be built there with plots behind them rather than that we should go <Col N="798" /> into the so-called town planning business which is most involved?  If the people in those areas have to wait until the local authorities get sites, I am afraid it will be Tibb's Eve before some of them get houses.  If the matter of acquiring the sites could be simplified, we would have houses more cheaply and more quickly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beirne, I think, mentioned the delay in the payment of housing grants, a complaint which I have also received.  I know of a number of applicants who have been held up for months for payment and they are being pressed by their contractor for payment of the grants.  I would ask the Minister to try to expedite payment of grants for new houses and for reconstruction, in both of which cases delay has occurred.  I wish the Minister every success while he is in office.  I have known him a good many years now, including the old campaigning days of the emergency, and I wish him the very best of luck.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority, I would like to support the views expressed by the Deputies who have spoken especially with regard to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It was a retrograde step to reduce the amount allocated to one-fifth of the 1950 sum.  It renders the scheme practically useless now because the local authorities are not in a position to undertake any worthwhile scheme such as they were able to do in the 1949 to 1951 period.  I would impress on the Minister that if the sum could be increased up to the 1950 figure a great benefit would accrue to the local authority.  The local authority should also be allowed to set aside a small sum for maintenance of drains and streams which were done during that period.  You have banks slipping in, the free flow of water retarded and sand and silt setting up again, so that in a year or two our streams will be just as bad as they were when this Act was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also support the Deputies who spoke with regard to the system of inspection of houses, especially grant houses.  If the attitude of inspectors were changed a little and if they were of more assistance to the <Col N="799" /> people rather than the opposite, it would be a step in the right direction. Another point is that their address should be known.  Applicants come to members of local authorities and Dáil Deputies to find out about Inspector So-and-so.  Their address should be public so that applicants who have business with them from day to day would know exactly where they are. It is no exaggeration to say that people were in fear and trembling when these inspectors came along like mystery men; they appeared out of nowhere and raised Cain about this, that and the other.  If they were a little more co-operative and imparted the benefit of their experience and knowledge to the unfortunate small farmer or labourer who was providing himself with a house, that would do much to improve the position.  I would ask the Minister to look into that particular matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few matters arising out of the Estimate on which I would like to speak.  I am sure the Minister is tired listening to requests made to him that he should, in addition to fixing rents, lower the rents of various houses.  I heard Deputy Beirne a while ago suggesting that he should fix wages for road workers.  It is rather significant, seeing there is an attempt side by side with that to give more powers to local authorities, that some Deputies want to get rid of some of the powers they have and hand them over to the Minister.  If the Minister could lower the rents of all the houses that have been built in recent years he would be a miracle man.  Deputies suggest that the Minister has it in his hands to lower these rents.  I do not see how he could do it except by legislation or by providing more subsidies.  Neither can he fix wages without legislation. I am sure he will not take that power on himself.  I do not think he requires it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion about the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  A number of Deputies seemed to think more money should be given to local authorities under that Act.  I am one of those who hold <Col N="800" /> a somewhat different view in the matter.  I believe all land drainage should be under one authority.  At the moment we have three or four governmental authorities looking after land drainage.  The Office of Public Works looks after main drainage.  The Department of Agriculture looks after drains running through fields in connection with the reclamation of land. The Department of Local Government looks after minor drainage of a certain type.</P>
    <P>It may be no harm to advert to the fact that originally this Local Authorities (Works) Act had nothing to do with the general drainage of land at all.  It was meant for the purpose of draining and improving roads.  Its primary purpose was ostensibly to relieve unemployment and at the time, I think, that was its major object.  I can never understand why local authorities, their staffs and engineers should be asked to go in and drain land.  Local authorities are more than fully employed in relation to housing and roads and all the other activities they have to perform.  They have in their hands the spending of a considerable amount of money and they have to supervise that expenditure during the year.</P>
    <P>While an amount of useful work was done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act there was also a colossal waste of money, a waste over which no Government Department or local authority could stand.  If the Minister is prepared to give us more money, I have no objection to taking it.  I am sure every local authority will do its utmost to spend any extra money to the best advantage.  A good deal of money in the past was not spent to the best advantage.  Its expenditure was not justifiable.  It gave much needed employment, admittedly.  It took men off the dole and gave them a weekly wage, but the output and the results left much to be desired.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should use his influence in order to have all land drainage brought under the one authority.  At the moment if the Department of Agriculture sees a stream running through three or four farms, those responsible for land reclamation <Col N="801" /> will not touch that stream or drain those lands.  They will wait for those responsible for implementing the Local Authorities (Works) Act to come along and drain that particular stream, two or three miles long.  Once they engage in land drainage, they should do the entire job.  Better results would be achieved if the available moneys were handed over to one authority, the authority already dealing with land drainage.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to do something in relation to the delays that occur through local authorities having to await sanction of the Department of Local Government.  Any speeding up will be of advantage.  There are many minor matters off which the Department might take its hands altogether and leave full responsibility to the local authorities themselves.  When departmental grants do not enter into it, local authorities should have full responsibility.  That would be an advantage in many directions.  Provided local authorities spend the money within the law, there is no reason why the Department should insist on having its say in every aspect of local administration. There is considerable delay in relation to minor works which could be carried out by the local authority without waiting for sanction from the Department.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are, after all, composed of responsible men.  They are spending their own money and they will not try to justify expenditure which is neither necessary nor desirable. Greater freedom would make for a more active interest by local authorities in local government.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I wish him well in that very big Department of which he has control, a Department whose activities affect the lives and interests of so many of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarMaher" hpid="Mr. Maher Mr. Maher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary, on taking up office. I wish them both every success in the tremendous task that lies before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Local Government is one of the most important in  State.  As far as the people in the rural areas are concerned, it is the <Col N="802" /> most important.  If it is properly administered, it can confer very great benefits on the people living in rural Ireland.  Unfortunately, it seems to have been the policy of successive Governments to load the dice in favour of the people living in the built-up areas in the bigger towns and in the cities.  Far too much has been done for the people in these areas and far too little for the people in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes from a rural constituency, and there is not much that I can say to enlighten him further in so far as conditions in rural Ireland are concerned.  I appeal to him to reverse to some extent the tendency that has grown up to improve the lot of the people in the built-up areas and neglect the people in the remoter parts of the country.</P>
    <P>There are two problems in relation to rural Ireland.  The first is the question of culs-de-sac.  Last year a measure was passed here enabling local authorities to improve these roads.  It is the policy of county engineers, however, to do those roads for which they are already responsible before they go ahead with the improvement of cul-de-sac roads.  I believe it will be many years before any benefit will be conferred on the people living on these roads if something is not done to encourage the county engineers to give some consideration to the plight of those people who have the misfortune to live on cul-de-sac roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be well advised if he could see his way to encourage county managers and county engineers to set aside a specific sum every year for the purpose of meeting the local contribution towards the financing of the rural improvements schemes.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are members of local authorities know that, when we recommend a rural improvement scheme, the people living on these cul-de-sac roads, who are obliged to contribute 25 per cent. of the cost of the work, are reluctant to do so.  They say that they are paying their rates, that they are getting nothing by way of return for them and that they are not being treated as fairly as the people who live on the main and county roads.  Therefore, they are reluctant to put their hands in their <Col N="803" /> pockets a second time to make a 25 per cent. contribution towards a rural improvement scheme of the kind I speak of.  The Minister would be taking a worthwhile step if he were to arrange with the local authority, or if he were to encourage the county manager or the county engineer to set aside each year a specific sum, so that when a rural improvement proposal comes forward the council would be in a position to make a local contribution.  That would overcome the situation we have at present whereby the people living on a cul-de-sac road have to put their hands in their pockets and contribute towards the cost of its improvement.</P>
    <P>This problem is a very big one in most county council areas.  There are a couple of hundred miles of these cul-de-sac roads, and the hope is a very thin one that we shall see the improvements that we would desire in this respect carried out in the foreseeable future so long as the present system is allowed to remain.  The improvements that need to be carried out in this respect, certainly the urgent ones, could be made if the county councils would co-operate to the extent that I think they should. If anything appreciable can be done for the people who live on these cul-de-sac roads to bring about the improvements that are so urgently needed, then I believe that the Minister will be doing something which will earn both for himself and his Parliamentary Secretary the appreciation of the people who live in these backward parts of the country.  They feel that they have been forgotten and neglected for too long a period altogether.  The conditions under which they are living have not been improved in the last 50 years to any extent whatever.  They still have to flounder in the mud and the muck on a Sunday morning on their way to Mass as have their children day after day when going to school.  I am of the opinion that their health is being impaired as a result of the conditions under which they are obliged to live, and of the difficulty they experience in getting out to the county roads.  In <Col N="804" /> my opinion they are deserving of better consideration than they have had up to the present.  I would therefore appeal to the Minister to try and do something worthwhile for them.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of houses for small farmers.  I have said here before that the county councils should have power to build a cottage type of house for a farmer whose valuation does not exceed £15.  I know, of course, a council can, in certain circumstances, build houses for people in that particular category.  I want to say, however, that in my opinion more encouragement should be given to county councils and that, in turn, the county councils should be more generous in meeting the housing requirements of the uneconomic agricultural holder.  The two grants that are there already are entirely inadequate to meet the needs of an uneconomic agricultural holder.  Even if he avails of the full State grant and the supplementary grant, the total of both will still only meet half the cost of erecting a cottage type of house.  Most of these people are unable to undertake the financial liability involved, even if they were fortunate enough to get a loan, in making the repayments.  If you have £15 or £20 tacked on to their half-yearly annuity then these people will be unable to face up to that financial liability.</P>
    <P>I believe that the county councils should come to the rescue of those people by building the cottage type of house on their holdings for them.  It is a problem that deserves the active and sympathetic consideration of the Minister, and I feel that he will do what he can for them.  I am certainly of opinion that it would be a good thing if the county councils were encouraged to build the cottage type of house for the uneconomic agricultural holder whose valuation does not exceed £15. Those people are not in a position to do it themselves, despite all the assistance that is given under our housing legislation.  They are unable to go ahead with the building of houses for themselves because of the fact that the gap between the amount of the grants available and the total cost of the house is too wide.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> A lot has been said, and many opinions have been expressed in the House, on the merits or demerits of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I, personally, at any rate think that it was a good Act, and that our county derived much benefit from it.  Perhaps some of the improvements carried out could have been administered in a more efficient manner.  Without going into details, I would say that if the Minister could see his way to increase the allocation under that particular heading we would certainly welcome it, provided it is not done at the expense of the Road Fund.  I do not think it would be wise to reduce Road Fund allocations for the purpose of increasing the allocations under this Act.  If, however, the county councils are given additional moneys for this type of drainage work, it would certainly be welcomed in the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly, as would any system that can be devised, whether under the Arterial Drainage Act or any other Act, for the carrying out of urgent drainage work.  Any step that is taken towards alleviating the lot of people whose lands are subject to flooding will be welcomed, whether it is done under the Arterial Drainage Act, the Local Authorities (Works) Act or any other heading.  Anything which is done to ensure that more money will be spent to bring about an improvement of the conditions under which the people in rural Ireland are living at the moment will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by emphasising the points which I have already made.  As far as the rural areas are concerned, I respectfully ask the Minister, during his term of office, to load the dice in favour of the people living there.  If he does that, he will earn their appreciation and will at the same time be doing sound national work, because if the present trend is allowed to continue, if the people are allowed to continue running away from rural Ireland, it will be just too bad for all of us.  In my opinion, the two main factors which are operating at the moment as regards that trend are those which I have already mentioned &mdash;the cul-de-sac roads and the old thatched houses which we have in so many places, almost all of them <Col N="806" /> occupied by uneconomic agricultural holders.  I am of the opinion that if some improvement can be brought about under these two headings it will go a long way towards making life in the rural areas much more attractive. It will help towards keeping the people on the land and in the rural areas, a thing that we are all so anxious to do. My last word is to wish the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell) Patrick O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, on behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary and myself I should like to thank sincerely the members of the House for the very good wishes which have been extended to us from all sides.  It was quite apparent to us that these wishes were quite genuine, and I should like to say that we are indeed most grateful for them.  We are also most grateful for the non-Party spirit in which the Estimate and the administration of the Department were discussed.  As a result of this debate, I personally have received a very liberal education in local government.  The ramifications of the work of local councils have also, as a result of this debate, been brought very forcibly to my notice.  I think I know more about them now than I did before.  Another aspect of local government which has been unfolded to me during my very short time in office was revealed in the wide variety of pleadings put before me by a number of deputations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that ministerial responsibility for local government is twofold. First of all, it is the duty of the Minister to receive deputations from local authorities, to hear their complaints and to accept advice from them for the betterment of the services which they administer, as well as to seek and procure advice from them in cases where they are contemplating additional expenditure. In considering these various matters, the Minister, of course, has also to bear in mind the capacity of the taxpayer to bear the additional expenditure urged on him by local authorities. He has the further responsibility of acting, as it were, as a liaison officer between the local authorities and the <Col N="807" /> national administration, to see that the moneys allocated to local authorities are not only properly spent but spent to the best advantage.  At the outset, I should like to say that my primary task will be to ensure that no urgent social service will be stinted&mdash;that is, in the light of what I have already said about my responsibility to see that local authorities will give the best possible service for the least possible amount.  Many matters raised in this debate are matters which could better be raised in the local forum.  They are matters which should not be debated here&mdash;I respectfully say&mdash;in Dáil Éireann, because they are matters of local and not national significance, and I do not propose to follow the Deputies into the various culs-de-sac, laneways and, as somebody said, the hills around Cork City. And if I do not, it is out of no disrespect to what they said.  It is merely that I think these are matters of local importance which should be discussed in the local forum and not here. Certain matters were mentioned by the various Deputies which I consider deserved to be discussed and are of considerable national importance.  In my opening remarks on this Vote, I mentioned the general principles of county management and the manner in which county managers generally perform their duties, and I think it is reasonable to debate these matters on this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the relations which exist between local authorities and the county managers and I am most anxious to find out at first-hand what these relations are.  Not only am I anxious to find them out from an official point of view, but I am also anxious to find them out from a local authority point of view.  I propose to make myself informed at the very source and within the next few months I intend to visit every county and county borough in this country and interview in each case at least the chairman of every local authority and the county manager.  I want to have the county manager's point of view and I want to have the point of view of the local authority and as <Col N="808" /> many members of it as I can on the question of county management.  I propose to go on a useful summer course by interviewing these local authorities and the county managers, as soon as I possibly can, because I do not want second-hand information as to the relations that exist between them.</P>
    <P>A considerable portion of this debate has been taken up on the question of roads, as you know, and as I have already mentioned a sum of £1,400,000 has been voted for main road improvement grants and county road improvement grants amount to £1,700,000. This shows a small differential in favour of county roads and that is a development which has taken place over the last few years.  I think it was in 1949 that the first programme of county road improvement to be financed out of State funds was initiated by one of my predecessors, the late Mr. Tim Murphy.  The technical advisers of the Department of Local Government and the county engineers quite properly emphasise the importance of the national capital asset which is represented by our main road system and which must be conserved to meet the various needs of modern traffic.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies also referred to the voters' lists.  I think in opening on this Estimate, I too referred to the lack of faith in the present method of compiling voters' lists.  Deputy J. Kennedy mentioned it here during the course of the debate and I would like to add to what I have already said on the Estimate, and in reply to a parliamentary question some days ago, that I have already taken steps to ensure that something will be done to rectify the omissions which occur whether it be through malfeasance or non-feasance of the rate collectors in compiling voters' lists.</P>
    <P>I have instructed departmental inspectors to go down the country and interview each and every rate collector and remind them of the fact that there are pecuniary penalties attached to the compilation of the register and that these penalties will be enforced if some of the omissions whether through malfeasance or non-feasance are not rectified.  It will also <Col N="809" /> be a matter for discussion between me and the representatives of the local authorities when I go, on the proposed visit I have already mentioned, through the country.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of time was taken in discussing housing problems. I have no hesitation in saying that our aim will be the completion in the shortest possible time of the programme of rehousing persons living in slums or in overcrowded and insanitary conditions.  After all, the slums are the hard core of the housing problem and while I appreciate that slum clearance and the rebuilding in the slum areas are not sufficient to house the families or the populace displaced from these particular areas, it would go a long way towards easing the problems referred to by the former Lord Mayor and the present Lord Mayor of Dublin, Deputy Butler and Deputy Alfred Byrne.  The Department appreciates, and I appreciate, the difficulty from a school or church point of view, of having people removed from slum areas and put out on the hinterland of cities, and the educational and ecclesiastical problems it creates.  We would like to see the slum areas redeveloped in conjunction with the demolition of existing insanitary houses.</P>
    <P>With regard to the housing problem in Dublin, I have had a memo made out on it, and I find that in the current year work has commenced on 1,048 houses and contracts are about to be placed for 325 dwellings. Between now and the 31st March next, the corporation proposes to advertise 1,158 further dwellings, making a total of 2,531 for 1954.  The corporation's programme for 1955 embraces 737 flats and 1,835 houses to be put out for tender, or to be undertaken by direct labour, a total of 2,572 dwellings for the year.</P>
    <P>With regard to Cork, Deputy Barrett suggested that the estimate of 2,600 families still to be rehoused in Cork is conservative.  It may be so.  And it may also be so that there is a possibility of some families being rehoused in the neighbourhood, or as Deputy Barrett said, in the hills <Col N="810" /> around the city.  One scheme is intended to meet the demand for some rehousing.  It is a small scheme of 12 maisonettes and six flats.  I was very much impressed by what Deputy McGrath and other Deputies said as to the corporation being allowed to proceed with this work without having to wait for detailed plans or lay-out for what is known as the &ldquo;marsh&rdquo; area in Cork.  I am sure that the planning of centre city sites presents unusual difficulties and these are completely different from the difficulties of planning open sites.  A reasonable standard of housing density has to be preserved and there must be a reasonable allocation of open space to preserve rebuilt areas and adjoining central city areas.  The considerations I have already mentioned in regard to Dublin apply to Cork also: you can never rehouse on the old sites as many families as you displace, but a serious effort should be made to rehouse as many families as possible and as soon as possible, on these derelict sites.  We are not going to look at this stage for a detailed town plan for the whole of the central part of Cork.  All I would ask is that the minimum requirements of density standards be met.  If that is done, I hope that the impending visit of the chief housing architect and the planning officer to Cork will make for an early clearance of any obstacles in the way of an early commencement of the work.  That is in regard to the marsh housing site.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin referred to housing finances in Dublin.  As Deputies are aware, Dublin Corporation is one of the few bodies which rely on sources of capital other than the Local Loans Fund.  Deputy Larkin asked me to refer to the rate of interest on loans but I think he will agree, being himself a member of the corporation and the housing committee, that it is a matter for the corporation itself to determine the rate at which money may be advanced from the recent corporation loan.  It is a matter for the corporation itself to regulate or determine the rate at which money will be lent to borrowers under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, subject, of course, to the condition that the <Col N="811" /> rate will not be greater than one half per cent. more than the rate at which the corporation itself has been able to borrow the money.  That is the regulation and I am sure the Deputy knows it.  I do not think there is anything further I have to say at this stage on the future programme of my Department. It merely remains for me to present the Vote as it stands and to ask the House to agree to it.</P>

    <P>A Statutory Order to come into operation on 23rd August, 1954, will be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce reducing the maximum retail price of creamery butter by 5d. per lb. and corresponding Orders will be made by the Minister for Agriculture reducing the maximum wholesale prices of creamery butter by 46/8 per cwt.  The reduction in the prices received by creameries on sales of butter on and after that date will be made good to the creameries by a subsidy, as above, paid by this Department on the creameries' sales of butter.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is necessary to pay a subsidy on stocks of creamery butter held by the Butter Marketing Committee, wholesalers and the larger retailers, such as multiple shops, at the close of business on 22nd August, 1954, for the reason that the value of their butter stocks, on sale, will have been reduced overnight.  Such subsidy or allowance on stocks is only paid where the quantity of butter held is 3 cwt. or over.  In the case of retailers who normally hold smaller stocks, it would be administratively impracticable to pay them an allowance on their stocks.  The adequate notice already given of the reduction in the <Col N="813" /> retail price should safeguard the position of these traders who, in their own interest, will obviously reduce their butter stocks to a minimum before the 23rd August.  It is not necessary to pay a stocks allowance to creameries because an allowance will be paid on the butter when it is sold in due course.</P>
    <P>There is no money available in the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund out of which a contribution could be made to relieve the Exchequer of any portion of the cost of this subsidy.</P>
    <P>The cost of a subsidy in a full year is estimated at £1,725,000 on the basis of a consumption of 740,000 cwt., which represents an increase of 15,000 cwt. on the actual figure of 724,782 cwt. consumed during the financial year 1953-54.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, in accordance with practice, I have circulated for the information of Deputies a White Paper which gives in succinct form notes on some of the activities of the Department during the last 12 months.  I hope I do not trespass unduly on the indulgence of my predecessor, Deputy Walsh, if I say that I have circulated this White Paper subject to his correction as, naturally, it deals very largely with matters of administration arising out of the last 12 months, when he was responsible for the Department of Agriculture, and is more or less a report to the House of how the Department went on during that period. If anything appears in it which Deputy Walsh considers requires amendment, I would advise the House that I think his amendment should be accepted but I do not imagine that he will find anything in this White Paper which conflicts with his view of what transpired during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I am presenting the Estimate prepared by my predecessor.  It, therefore, does not behove me to dwell at length on the Estimate on this occasion. Deputies will recall that by the procedure and rules of this House we must discuss on the Estimates, not matters of policy, but matters of administration. However, it may be permitted to me briefly to inform the House of certain matters of which they will wish to have knowledge in respect of the immediate future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> The House is aware that the Department of Agriculture has been concerned for some time to eradicate bovine T.B. from the herds of this country.  Accordingly, on the 1st of next September, we propose to initiate a scheme to that end.  We will take the County of Clare and the County of Sligo as areas of intensive eradication. We will also take the area immediately adjoining the parish of Bansha in West Tipperary.  The reason we elected to pursue the matter in that area, in addition to the two other counties I mentioned, is that we had a gratifying measure of success in a pilot scheme which was launched in that parish in the year 1949.  I think we could claim that we reduced the incidence of T.B. in the herds of that parish from about 40 odd per cent. to below 18 per cent. and we think it would be a pity to abandon that degree of progress. Accordingly, we propose to extend the Bansha scheme to each parish adjoining the parish of Bansha and, in addition, to the parishes in East Limerick which adjoin these adjoining parishes.  I hope before my statement is concluded to be in a position to furnish Deputies with the actual names of the parishes which will constitute this island area which will be an area of concentrated activity in the campaign for the elimination of bovine T.B.</P>
    <P>I should mention for the information of Deputy Walsh, who has just come into the House, that we are dealing with the question of the eradication of bovine T.B.  I have said that we propose to initiate a scheme on the 1st September in the Counties of Sligo and Clare and that we propose to deal with an area of the parishes adjoining the parish of Bansha and the parishes in East Limerick which adjoin these adjoining parishes, the names of which I hope to be able to give the House before I sit down.</P>
    <P>In addition to these, we hope to provide facilities on a voluntary basis for individual farmers or groups of farmers anywhere in the country who would wish to collaborate with the Department of Agriculture in advancing their own farm or groups of farms to attested status.  I am not in a position <Col N="815" /> to announce to-day all the details of the scheme as it will apply but would hope that I will be in a position to publish these in ample time to inform the public generally of the details of the methods by which we propose to proceed.</P>
    <P>I have asked the collaboration of all voluntary bodies in the area to help in doing the job.  I have the assurance of Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tíre that they will do all in their power to expedite the achievement of the purpose we have in mind. I want to say also how glad I am that I believe we have the enthusiastic and unqualified support of the veterinary profession in the country for the effective prosecution of this campaign. Without it, it would be virtually impossible to achieve success.  With it, I do not doubt we shall be able to make rapid and effective progress towards the end we have in mind which is, ultimately, the complete eradication of bovine T.B. as an animal disease in this country.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, last week we initialled an agreement with the American Ambassador for the use of the Marshall Aid Grant Counterpart Fund, details of which were supplied in a parliamentary answer in this House last week and, as soon as that has received Congressional approval, we may proceed with the schemes to be financed under that head.</P>
    <P>First amongst such schemes the Government would put the establishment of the Institute of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Science and this we hope to erect as the fountain head of agricultural education in future in this country.  We believe that it can be made something worthy of Ireland and we plan over the years to make it as good an institute of its kind as is to be found in any country in the world.  I believe that we may legitimately claim, though in comparison with other countries we may be looked upon as relatively poor in material riches, that in regard to ability and intellectual capacity we have as rich a store of it available as <Col N="816" /> any country of our size in the world and we would hope, availing of that and providing an institute where the native ability of our people will have full scope, to build an educational and research institute that will command the admiration of agriculture all the world over.</P>
    <P>The names of the parishes adjoining Bansha which will be joined with the Bansha area for the purpose of bovine T.B. eradication are Galbally, Lattin, Oola and Solohead, Tipperary, Golden, New Inn and Cahir.</P>
    <P>We hope to see the land rehabilitation project developed and expedited in the performance of its work.  How best to achieve that end will take some inquiry and examination of the situation as I find it, but the House may rest assured that every effort will be exhausted to make the land rehabilitation project operate as efficiently and as rapidly as all the circumstances will allow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope to do even a little better than my distinguished predecessor.  I will not dwell on the unhappy days when my distinguished predecessor and some of his colleagues were apprehensive lest the operation of the land rehabilitation project would leave farmers open to the danger of an increase of rateable valuation or other damage to their land.  It is a source of great satisfaction to me to discover today that we are vying with one another in the expedition with which we can put the land rehabilitation project on its way.</P>
      <P>I think it right to inform the House that it is the intention of the inter-Party Government to provide a guaranteed price for wheat each year for the next five years.  Our successors in office, be they ourselves or others, will no doubt answer in due course for what the Government's intention may be in the ensuing five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it right to direct the attention of the House to the fact that, in the changing circumstances of the world to-day, we are faced with the certainty that our export markets will <Col N="817" /> grow more and more competitive every year.  I think it places a peculiarly heavy burden on the Minister for Agriculture, whoever he may be, to ensure that the raw materials of the agricultural industry are secured to the agricultural community at the lowest possible penny at which they can be purchased so that our farmers may be placed in the most competitive position possible in comparison with those with whom they have to compete in their export markets.  I think it is the duty of any Minister for Agriculture to do all in his power, not only to reduce the cost of their raw materials but to reduce all their costs of production in so far as within his power lies because should the costs of production of our farmers rise above those obtaining for their competitors in foreign markets there can be no escape from the ultimate disaster that our farmers would lose their foreign markets.  If we lost those foreign markets or failed to be able to earn a profit in them, that would be a disaster not only for the farmers but for every other person who is earning a living in Ireland, for in the last analysis everybody in this country depends for his standard of living on the land.</P>
    <P>If agricultural exports cease to be economically possible, the imports of raw materials for our industries would cease to be possible, too, for we would have no funds from which to pay for them.  We purchase the raw materials of industry with which the bulk of our industrial employment is provided with the proceeds of our agricultural exports. We will continue to export agricultural produce only so long as the farmer who produces it gets a profit on what he is producing for export and the farmer's profit consists of the difference between the price he realises for his produce and what it has cost him to produce it.  If we can indefinitely raise the price which the farmer gets for his produce, his costs of production cease to matter very much, but we cannot control price levels in foreign markets for our produce, and that will become more apparent with the passage of every month and year.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we wish to widen the <Col N="818" /> gap between what the farmer gets for his produce and what it has cost him to produce it, and we are no longer able to raise the price he gets, we are forced back on the device of lowering his cost of production in order to widen the gap between the price he gets for his produce and his cost of production, which is his profit.  Therefore I think it right to tell the House that I regard it as one of the principal charges committed to me to procure for the farmer the raw materials for his industry at the lowest possible price at which they can be found, so that he may be in the most competitive position possible to secure for himself and his family a fair margin of profit on what he produces for export now and hereafter.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt on the competitive character of the markets in which we will have to trade in the future because I regard it as a very vital matter for every section of our community, but I think it right to add this: that I believe&mdash;and, mind you, my forecast is perhaps a little better than anybody else's&mdash;that there devolves on me a duty to say openly on an occasion such as this what my belief is, and my belief is that the market for cattle and for pigs has in it every prospect of stability, for the next two years in any case.</P>

      <P>The market for cattle and beef, sheep and lambs has in it the prospect of stability, begotten of the fact that there are 50,000,000 people in Great Britain eager to consume meat and that one of the most convenient and satisfactory sources of supply is Ireland.  Inasmuch as we are now in a position to deliver into Great Britain live stock of incomparable quality, we are in a peculiarly strong position to meet competition from all quarters in that sphere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, alive and dead. Mind you, our pre-eminence in the one is not as great as our pre-eminence in the other.  It would be folly for us to suggest that we enjoy the same degree of superiority in the dead meat trade as we enjoy in the live-stock trade. Our dead meat will bear comparison with the product of any other nation in the world: our live stock are superior to any live stock available to the British market from any other nation in the world.  That is the only distinction I would make.  However, we would make a great mistake indeed if we did not claim and assert that fact as being incapable of challenge, that the quality of our live stock has been built up to a point which makes us unquestionably the unique exporter in that field, in that we have better quality and better stuff to offer than any other exporting nation in the world.  It is on that fact that the prospect of stability that I foresee rests at the present time and I think I should add that it is a pretty solid foundation.  Will I be forgiven if, in rejoicing that that concrete fact is proved and that this prospect of stability rests soundly upon it, I say it is very largely due to the work of the Department of Agriculture, over <Col N="820" /> which I have the honour to preside at the present time, which has consistently gone forward&mdash;from a period long before that in which either Deputy Walsh or I entered the public life of this country&mdash;and which is bearing fruit in our day to the great advantage of all our people?</P>
      <P>Might I suggest to some of the more eloquent critics of the Department of Agriculture inside and outside this House that when they compare their circumstances to-day with that endured by their grandparents 50 or 60 years ago they ought to ask themselves what is the principal economic foundation of that change.  I think they will find themselves constrained to admit that the principal economic foundation of that change is very largely the live-stock industry of Ireland. Then they may ask themselves what is it that changed the live-stock industry of Ireland from the somewhat mediocre thing it was three-quarters of a century ago to the uniquely excellent thing it is to-day; and I think they will be forced to answer that it is co-operation between the farmers of Ireland and their own Department of Agriculture.  Those who reach that conclusion with me will listen in a somewhat more critical attitude than has been their wont heretofore to the ill-informed, ignorant, and often envious criticisms that are launched at the Department of Agriculture and all that it has done in the agricultural life of this country, by those who believe they could do better but who are quite unique in that conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some years I have forecast to the farmers that with the return of competitive conditions in the live-stock industry they would find that the traditional policy of the Department which has been urged on our people for many years would be vindicated by the event.  That is especially so in so far as our live-stock export policy is concerned, where the Department recommended the special excellence of the shorthorn bullock and even more so of the Aberdeen Angus shorthorn cross. There were many wiseacres in this country who rejected this advice as antediluvian and obscurantist and assured our people that the Hereford <Col N="821" /> bull was the proper cross with the shorthorn cow if the ideal export dry stock was to be evolved.  They have got a great shock in the course of the last six months, and the result is that everybody now suddenly wants Aberdeen Angus bulls.</P>
    <P>Four years ago no one would take Aberdeen Angus bulls: they wanted white-faced.  Now everyone wants Aberdeen Angus and there are not enough to go around.  We have bought all of them we could get&mdash;and my predecessor did the same while he was administering the Department&mdash;and with the best will in the world sought to provide Aberdeen Angus bulls of suitable quality to all applicants who fulfilled the necessary conditions. Despite our best endeavours, we were not able to get sufficient to meet the demand.  I venture to say that if those people had listened more closely to the advice of the Department and those who spoke for it during the last five years, we would have been able to accommodate this demand much more easily, that is, if people had taken Aberdeen Angus bulls when advised to do so and had eschewed Hereford bulls.</P>
    <P>It happens this is a free country and any man in Ireland can do what he likes and if he does not want to take advice no one in the Department of Agriculture claims the right to thrust the advice upon him.  The attitude of the Department to-day&mdash;as I hope it was under my predecessor&mdash;is that while we have no desire to thrust ourselves upon any farmer we are eager, willing and anxious to offer the best advice we have to give to any farmer who comes to us and asks for it.  We will cross no farmer's threshold except on the invitation of the farmer to us to give advice.  This is a free country and if people want to keep Friesians or Ayrshires or Herefords or Jerseys or Guernseys or anything else they like, they have a perfect right to keep them, so long as this country remains free. We have no ambition whatever to acquire any power to coerce them in any way.  But if they ask me and, I believe, if they ask my predecessor, what, in our judgment, is the most suitable general purpose cow for the <Col N="822" /> average small farmer of this country I would join with my predecessor in saying that, all things considered, the dual purpose shorthorn cow is the best for the average small farmer in this country.  If the small farmer wants to breed them for the purpose of producing exportable dry stock, I say that if he crosses them with the Aberdeen Angus bull of the right quality he will not go far wrong.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture never claimed, do not claim and never want to become the custodian and the mentor of any farmer in this country who does not want their advice or counsel.  Where a 1,000-acre farmer or a man with 100 cows takes the view that he knows better than the Department of Agriculture will ever know how to run his own farm, I welcome his spirit of independence and tell him to go forward on whatever lines he thinks best.  There will be no hard feelings in the Department of Agriculture. If he believes he can do better for himself, his wife and his family out of his holding with some other breed of cattle then let him fire away, but if he wants any help from us we shall give it to him within the limits of our capacity.  However, if we are asked our opinion we do not intend to allow ourselves to be intimidated, blackmailed or persuaded to advise the farmers of this country in any sense but in the sense which we believe to be right.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate what I have said. The best breed of cattle is the dual purpose shorthorn cow, and if a man wants to cross them for exportable dry stock and looks to a good quality Aberdeen Angus bull he will get as good a product as it is possible for our farmers to produce.</P>
    <P>I am glad to inform the House that litter testing of pigs is now proceeding in most of the pedigree herds of pigs in the country.  We are erecting, near the Munster Institute, an up-to-date progeny testing station to conduct fullscale progeny testing of pigs for the purpose of improving the stock of pigs we have in the country.  In that connection, I want to remind people of this fact.  We have in this country&mdash;<Col N="823" /> and I think we are almost unique in the world in that we are in this happy situation&mdash;one breed of pigs, the large Irish white breed.  We believe that that breed of pigs, by careful selection, can be made to produce as fine a type of bacon pig as is produced in the world to-day.  We have a stock of pigs which is disease free.  There is nothing so good that it cannot be improved. We have got the co-operation of 90 per cent. of the pedigree pig breeders in this country in the matter of litter testing.  We propose to add to that effort the full resources of an up-to-date progeny testing station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>But will you not go outside the pedigree pig breeders?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes, for the litter, which is an interim step.  I endorse my predecessor's decision to confine that to pedigree pig breeders from whose herds we would mainly draw the boars and breeding sows.  The progeny testing will be available to all who wish to avail of the service, but that is a project that will not be put in hand until the premises are available at the Munster Institute.  If it can be put in hand any sooner at an alternative premises I am prepared to do so, but I am not satisfied that it can.  However, I hope to have examined the question as to whether or not the existing installation at one of the agricultural schools might do, <i>ad interim.</i>  In my view, what we have to do must be done the right way: it would be a mistake to do it the wrong way at the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told from time to time that we ought to get the Landrace pig.  The British Government eventually gave way to that storm about the Landrace pig&mdash;and God help the British pig breeder now!  They managed to import into the country atrophic rhinitis, and it will take them all their time to eradicate it.  I venture to say that if they had to do again what they did&mdash; to bring in not only the Landrace pig <Col N="824" /> but atrophic rhinitis&mdash;they would never have seen a Landrace pig in England. If we were faced with a situation in which we had some inferior breed of pig indigenous to this country, we should have to take some risks to improve it and even to contemplate bringing in a foreign blood.  That is not the case.  We have a first class breed of pigs.  We are fully conscious of the necessity of improving strains so as to get pigs of better conformation and of a more consistently high capacity to produce and rear young.  All this will be done.  We are profoundly convinced that we have, within our own resources, the material wherewith to carry out these improvements&mdash;given the equipment and time wherein to do it.  I shall be interested to hear from Deputies on all sides of this House whether or not they agree with me that, having a pure strain of pigs in this country, undiluted by any miscegenation of blood, we are right to maintain that position and concentrate on the improvement of the strain rather than breeding, as is our present intention.</P>
    <P>With those relatively conciliatory and abbreviated observations, I propose to leave this Estimate confidently in the hands of the House.  I do not invite protracted or acrimonious discussion but I need hardly say&mdash;occupying, as I do, the exalted position of servant of the people&mdash;that I am unreservedly at the disposal of Deputies who wish to address any question they think proper to me and to give the assurance that I will answer such questions as exhaustively as I know how.</P>

      <P>I expect the Minister is surprised to see me standing up and talking on agriculture, immediately after his introduction of this Estimate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Minister made some very severe remarks about the supply of milk to Cork City a couple of years ago, when he was in <Col N="825" /> opposition.  He even went so far as to say that the producers were living on the corpses of their neighbours' children.  I think that was a very harsh statement to make.  While he was in Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the Deputy has not got the reference is that the Minister never made that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says he did not make the statement, I will withdraw what I have said, but I was listening to him.  I think the Minister has a very good idea of the milk situation in Cork City.  On a few occasions he has spoken to me about it in private conversation.  I know that he did believe, at any rate, that it was not up to the best standard.  I should like to say here that last year we had very little reason to complain about the milk supply to Cork City and one of the reasons for that was the county council appointed a veterinary officer to inspect the source of the milk supply to the city.  The corporation had no power to do such previously.  The veterinary officer was seconded from the corporation to the county council for a period of about 12 months.  We were all satisfied that that was, at least, an improvement, and that there was a pretty good attempt made by the producers to improve their premises in order to give a good milk supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular man appointed was, in my opinion, one of the most suitable men to be had, because he went round and met the farmers and spoke to them.  He asked for co-operation and said that if they would not give a good milk supply to the city, and if they did not get coolers, they would probably not be allowed to supply milk to the city.  About the middle of last year, I was asked to meet a deputation from the milk producers.  There were two veterinary surgeons from the county council and also one from the corporation <Col N="826" /> present.  The producers told me they believed that there was more improvement in the milk supply to Cork City during the previous six months than there had been for 20 years before.  They realised, when it was brought to their attention, the necessity for those improvements.  As a city representative, I can say that there were practically no complaints made last year.</P>
    <P>Some months ago, the time of the man to whom I refer was up and he had to go back to his original post in the corporation and no appointment, temporary or permanent, has since been made.  Requests were made for a permanent appointment but so far no sanction has come down for the making of this permanent appointment of a veterinary inspector to inspect the sources of supply to the city.  I am aware that while this man was in office the cases of dirty milk were reduced by more than 50 per cent. and we were looking forward to a continuance of that improvement.  Everybody, consumers, veterinary surgeons and public representatives, who met those people were quite satisfied that a good attempt was being made to improve the milk supply for Cork City.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago, I was informed that there were advertisements in the paper regarding coolers for sale by some of those farmers.  Whether that is through laxity of supervision or not I do not know, but we are again getting complaints about the milk supply. I spoke to the Minister when he was in office before asking if he could do anything to ensure a twice daily delivery to Cork.  I thought that would at least help the people in regard to not having to drink sour milk.  At that particular time he said he would do all he could and he was sure that the decent farmers of Cork would respond. I suppose the decent farmers of Cork did so but there are a good many who did not.  Those people who are not making an honest attempt to give a good milk supply to the city, who are not prepared to give the twice daily delivery and who are not prepared to put in a cooling apparatus are getting the rest of the producers a bad name and getting the Cork City milk supply <Col N="827" /> a very bad name, because if there were only three out of every ten refusing to co-operate you would get almost the same complaints.</P>
    <P>The officials in the Department who are delaying sanction for the appointment of this permanent veterinary officer are doing a great injustice to the children and people of the City of Cork.  There is no doubt that the man I mention did an awful lot to improve our milk supply.  I would direct the Minister's attention to the state of the milk supply in Cork City.  I know he was fully conversant with the whole position when he was in office before. I would sincerely ask him to improve the matter and do his best to find some means of ensuring that in the close heavy weather which we are having at present and which will probably be worse in July and August some steps would be taken to see that the citizens of Cork would get that supply, whether by pasteurisation I do not know.  I was told by the ex-Minister that pasteurisation was coming without any doubt but the point is that there is a great deal of doubt in the minds of producers in Cork.  They do not know whether or not it is coming&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or when it is coming.  They do not know whether it would be better for them to set about starting a pasteurisation plant or whether to procure coolers now.  They do not know whether they ought to get out of producing milk altogether. In fact, they do not know where they are.  I think it is about time that something was done to straighten out the matter and that we ought to know what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that over the next couple of years every attention will be paid to this scheme of T.B. attestation which is about to commence because it is one of the most important things from the point of view of our cattle industry.  Over and above that, it is most important where the health of our people is concerned and I think <Col N="828" /> money should be made freely available for it.  I am afraid, however, it is because very many areas in England are becoming what is known as T.B. attested areas that we are following in their footsteps.  We are compelled by circumstances over there to get into this, but whatever has compelled us it is a good thing, and something that should be pushed ahead very quickly.</P>
      <P>I am surprised, though, that some of the creamery areas have been chosen as the first areas to be tackled.  My understanding of the position is that the West of Ireland in the main supplies the young cattle for the other parts of the country.  In the creamery areas the farmers are compelled to go outside and purchase at least a good part of their cow population, and they go to the western counties for the young heifers.  I think it is there that any scheme of T.B. attestation should be commenced, because it is more or less working against the tide to start in creamery areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How much further west can I go than Clare and Sligo unless I take to the sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean that.  I mean that the creamery areas are the areas at the end of the cycle, that farmers in those areas are continually going outside to bring in heifers for the purpose of keeping their dairy stocks up, and it is wherever those heifers are supplied from that the start should be made in T.B. attestation. That is one of the reasons why I advocate that Donegal should be tackled, because large numbers of cattle are produced there and sent to those areas.  Again, we have a special problem in Donegal, where instead of being shipped from Dublin our cattle are shipped from Six County ports, especially from Derry, so it would be a great advantage if we had that in Donegal.  As a matter of fact, a number of farmers are at the moment doing it on their own.  I was glad to note that some assistance would be given to those farmers or groups of farmers who hit out on their own and did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing I would like to mention is the agricultural worker, because <Col N="829" /> I am sure the Minister will admit that the agricultural worker is an important factor in the agricultural industry.  He is in all respects an industrial worker, and the question of the fixing of wages for these people and of settling other disputes arising should be transferred from the Agricultural Wages Board to the Labour Court.  I would urge the Minister to consider that the farm worker should be put on the same level as any other industrial worker, and where disputes arise or questions have to be settled in regard to wages, working hours or other matters, they should be decided by the Labour Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also glad to learn that the guaranteed price for wheat will be in operation for another five years.  That is only one half of the story, of course.  The price is important, because I did not like the tone of the <i>Irish Independent</i> editorial of two weeks ago which discussed the growing of wheat and among other things stated that there were wheat conacre racketeers.  I think the conacre man who goes out and gets his hands on land that has not been cultivated for a long number of years, cuts away scrub and brings that field under the plough, does not, in the first place, make an unreasonable profit.  In the second place, even if he is making a profit he is not a racketeer, and is doing a good job of work and helping to plough land which badly needs to be ploughed up, and also carrying out other operations like cleaning away scrub and so on. I do know that in Donegal where farmers and conacre farmers have availed of the advice of the Department in the growing of wheat they are producing excellent wheat.  This year the crops of wheat are very good, just because they have learned what to do, and especially what not to do, and the Department's advice has been very sound.  I hope that the guaranteed price which we <Col N="830" /> are promised will be a price that will not cause any lessening of the area under wheat.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about our live cattle exports.  I agree with what he said on that, but we have over the past few years begun to build up a dead meat trade which is very useful and should be encouraged because it has many advantages.  It keeps the byproducts of the cattle at home, it gives employment here, and the price which this meat is sold at is as good as that received by the farmers for the live cattle exported.</P>

I think I am also right in saying that the people who state that agriculture is stagnant in this country are wrong.  We have been making progress.</P>

      <P>The wheat area, from 1951 to 1953, increased by 72,000 acres, barley by 21,000 acres and sugar beet by 5,000.  Total tillage was up by 35,000. Our agricultural exports, inclusive of commodities of high agricultural content, were £20,000,000 higher in value in 1953 than in 1951, an increase of 34 per cent.  We have increased advisory services.  The number of agricultural inspectors has been increased by 45 per cent.  since 1950.  We have doubled, trebled, quadrupled, multiplied by <Col N="831" /> seven, the amount of money spent on land reclamation in 1950-51, so that I can say truthfully that agriculture has not been stagnant from 1951 to 1953, and let us hope that during the term of this Government stagnation will not again set in as it did from 1948 to 1951.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the T.B. scheme, the Minister and the House know that that scheme has been cut and dried for a long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The only change that has been made is that the area has been transferred from Limerick to Sligo.  I wonder why.  Limerick has the greatest cow population of any county and more calves are sold from County Limerick than from any other county. It is the replacement ground for most of the cattle areas and, in my opinion, that was the place to start.  Deputy Cunningham has said that we get most of our replacements from the West of Ireland, but, in my opinion, we get most of them from Counties Kerry, Cork and Limerick.  I understand that Clare is being reserved for the Marshall Aid moneys, although I am not too sure of it, together with portion of East Limerick, Bansha and Sligo.  The suggestion I made was that we should start in Limerick, awaiting approval for the spending of the Grant Counterpart Fund, and, when we had got the approval, we were to go on into Clare.  The scheme, however, was cut and dried and the only thing I regret is that the Minister has thought well to go from Limerick to Sligo, because it is not really a good change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will notice that we have not gone out of Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Grant Counterpart Fund, in the course of a reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, the different schemes which it was proposed <Col N="832" /> to introduce on the basis of these moneys were cited.  There has been no change whatever in the scheme put before the American authorities a year and a half ago and which was announced by me in this House over 12 months ago.  I am glad of that, because, after giving it very careful consideration and going into it very minutely, we decided that these moneys could be allocated in this way to the best advantage of the country.</P>
      <P>As regards land reclamation, it is unnecessary for me to say that we have made wonderful progress.  We are now spending between £2,250,000 and £2,500,000 a year.  If the country can continue to afford to spend that money, we are doing pretty well, and, in time, the land of the country will be fully reclaimed.  I suggest to the Minister that, in respect of land reclamation, one thing is still necessary&mdash;an insistence that the land be put into cultivation after reclamation. That is the only way in which it can be kept clean.  In connection with drainage, where there are open drains, there should be some compelling provision to compel farmers to clean drains at least once every two years. Otherwise, all the money spent will be wasted in a period of ten or 15 years. The scrub lands will have gone back into scrub, unless cultivated, and these drains will again be choked up.  I suggest some clause be introduced to compel farmers who have availed of the generosity of the State to get their land reclaimed, on the basis of a gift of £30 per acre, to do this cleaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister say we are to have a guaranteed price for wheat over a period of five years, but the Minister neglected a very important aspect of wheat-growing, in that he has not told us what size of market we are going to have. That is really the important question to be answered&mdash;what size is that market going to be and how much wheat is going to be grown at a guaranteed price.  There is no use having a market for 20,000 acres or for 100,000 acres.  We want to know the size of the market and then we will be very well satisfied with the guaranteed <Col N="833" /> price.  While I was Minister, we announced that we were guaranteeing a price for a market of 450,000 acres, and I am now asking the Minister if he is prepared to subscribe to our policy.  Can the farmers be told here and now that they are going to get a guaranteed price for the produce of 450,000 acres over the next five years? That is the important point.  Price is not half so important as the size of the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the price not control the market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It may control the market, as it did before.  It was the one thing that controlled the market from 1948 to 1951, because there was no increase in price and, consequently, there was a diminishing acreage.  It certainly controlled the market, and it controlled the market over the past three years, because, with an increase in price, there was an increase in acreage.  It did so then and will do so in the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of the pig progeny testing station being erected at the Munster Institute, but he said that the pigs going into that testing station were to be taken from the pedigree breeders.  I do not altogether agree that the Minister should confine himself to the pedigree breeders, because most of these people are breeding for show purposes and not for bacon.  That has, I think, been pretty well proved.  Of 50,000 pigs going to the factories last year, 55 per cent. had 16 ribs and they had also to commend them a uniform distribution of lean on the shoulders and a pretty good distribution on the bellies.  That is the type of pig I would have put into the pig progeny testing station&mdash;the sows with 16 ribs, with uniform distribution of bacon on narrow shoulders and with a good distribution on the bellies, well-shaped animals, in order to give a high quality bacon.  I would not confine myself to the pigs being produced for show purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I misled the Deputy.  I think I said that the litter testing at present in progress was being confined to the pedigree <Col N="834" /> breeders, but that no such restriction would apply when the progeny testing station was built and in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to be dealing with the pig progeny testing station at the Munster Institute which was designed for the purpose of testing progeny and not litter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not built yet.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Minister not tell me that he has been sitting down on the work since I left.  It should have been completed by now&mdash;in the past three weeks or month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy expects a lot from us, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should concentrate on that type of pig, if he wants high quality bacon.  We have as good a bacon in this country as is produced in any part of the world and we can get that bacon from our Large White Yorks, which are as good as the Landrace.  I have no hesitation in saying that.  We have a better pig than the Landrace because I believe the Large White pig is better than it. For that reason, we should use every endeavour to give the Large White an opportunity of proving itself to be the best.  There are pigs going into the factories, uniform in every respect, which are better in many respects than the Landrace pigs and we should concentrate on them, if we want the best quality bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody has referred&mdash;the Minister also mentioned it in his opening address&mdash;to competition in the beef trade.  Seeing that we have a free market for our cattle, I think we should now adopt a policy of encouraging our factories and our meat producers to put up special cuts, to sell them at home and to export them in order to command the highest prices, by ensuring that there would be no restriction placed on them if they are anxious to engage in that trade.  It is <Col N="835" /> only in that way that we, with the superior quality beef we have going into the market, properly put up and made attractive for the public, can maintain our prices and enter into competition with other people producing beef.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer and that is the statements which the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary has been making about a cattle tax.  The Minister knows these statements are untrue.</P>

      <P>When did the Leader in. Seanad Éireann, whoever he may be, decide policy for the Government or the Minister?  Will the Minister not at some time give his Parliamentary Secretary a lugging in the ear and tell him to stop spreading untruths throughout the country?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This thing was fired around the country during the election campaign that the Department of Agriculture or the Government were planning to introduce a cattle tax.  The Minister knows well that there was no such intention and he has access to all the files in his Department.  All I want him to do is to tell his Parliamentary Secretary to cease repeating this untruth.</P>

I will give him a week&mdash;I will not ask him to do it to-night&mdash;to answer my challenge and to produce a tittle of evidence that it was ever even suggested.  It is one of the most untruthful statements that has been made in the country that there was any such suggestion of a cattle tax. It is untruthful; the Minister knows it is untruthful and the Parliamentary Secretary knows it is untruthful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the second time the Deputy has said that the Minister knows it is untruthful and the Parliamentary Secretary knows it is untruthful.  That is unparliamentary language and cannot be used.  It is tantamount to saying that the Minister is telling a lie and the Parliamentary Secretary is telling a lie.  To say the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary is making a statement he knows is untrue is charging him with telling lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>Not by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as much concerned for the character of the Parliamentary Secretary as for that of the Minister, and if he says the Parliamentary Secretary made a statement that it untrue, and knows it is untrue, it is saying the Parliamentary Secretary is telling a lie.  That statement cannot be allowed to stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw the statement. There is no evidence, the Minister knows, regarding any plan being made in connection with a tax on <Col N="837" /> cattle.  Professor Johnston mentioned it in the Seanad, and the Leader of the Government Party in the Seanad mentioned it afterwards.  That is all.  It was taken up and sent around that the Fianna Fáil Party were planning to impose such a tax, but there is no truth in it.</P>
      <P>The next matter I would like to deal with is the parish plan.  Much thought has been given to this, apparently, by the Minister over a number of years, and I would like to see it in operation, but I have pointed out time and time again that it is not feasible at the moment because of the want of personnel. We have not the technicians to put this scheme into operation, unless you select one small county at the present time.  The number of graduates coming out of the university in 1954 is about 14.  Other commercial interests may require some of these graduates, and all of them may not be available to the Department of Agriculture.  Last year we were anxious to get more graduates for the Milk Costings Commission. Unfortunately, they were not available; but if they were, there is no doubt that we would have advocated, as I have done on every possible occasion, the provision of more technicians in the counties.  The number has increased from something in the 80's to 130, but telling people that the parish plan is going to be introduced to the country is deceiving them.  We have over 900 parishes and, on my calculations, having regard to the number of students that are now attending the university, it would take until 1957 before we could have sufficient personnel to provide every three parishes with a technician.  There is nothing wrong with such a scheme, but it is wrong to say we can operate it overnight. The personnel is not there; if it were, there is no reason why we would not put the plan into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the Milk Costings Commission. I would be interested to know what is the Minister's and the Government's attitude to their report, which should be available within the next couple of weeks.  That commission was set up over a year and a half ago to find out the cost of producing a gallon of milk.  Possibly later on we <Col N="838" /> will know what the Minister's attitude will be, but I just mention it here. However, I hope that when the report does become available and when it is to be considered by the Government it will be presented to the country then.</P>
    <P>In any event the people who are compiling the report are independent of the Department of Agriculture.  I saw to that when I was setting up the commission so that it could not at any time be said that there was any wrong done to the farmers, that the figures were cooked or anything else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Deputy's attitude towards the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated my attitude in this House in reply to a question by the Minister.  There was one matter about which I was very concerned when I was in the Department.  I refer to the much-needed extension of veterinary services.  I reckon we are losing from £10,000,000 to £15,000,000 worth of cattle every year through disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Every year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Every year.  We are losing between 70,000 and 80,000 calves, mainly through white scour.  If one takes these calves to maturity that loss represents a loss of between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000.  Experiments were carried out in County Limerick over the past two years and the incidence of the disease has now been reduced from 17 per cent. to 2 per cent.  We are also losing cattle from parasitic diseases, such as husk, hoose, stomach worms, and so on.  Of course, since the introduction of phenothiazal and hexachorathane these diseases have been reduced.  Losses from aphosphorosis are considerable.  The principal losses, however, are due to abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have studied this matter, and I reckon that, taking all these things into consideration, our losses are well over £10,000,000 in cattle.  The only way in which we can stop these losses is by expanding our veterinary services and I hope that the Minister will give very careful consideration to that question in the near future.  It is one of the really important aspects of agriculture which should be dealt with. <Col N="839" /> We have, too, Johne's disease.  We have oedema and other diseases in pigs.  All these are causing considerable losses, and I hope the Minister will seriously consider expanding our veterinary services.</P>
    <P>Seeing the favourable position the Minister is in in relation to the qualifications of his Parliamentary Secretary to produce money easily, I would like to give him a little work to do over the next five years.  In case it might be said that we are sitting back as stagnant as agriculture was supposed to be, I would like to give him a few schemes that he should tackle.  The first is an extension of the demonstration and advisory work in connection with lime and fertilisers.  Last year I introduced a scheme at a cost of about £40,000, a mere bagatelle.  There is, too, the question of buildings and equipment and the position of the existing schools at Clonakilty, Ballyhaise and Athenry.  There are the private agricultural schools at Pallaskenry, Mount Bellew and Warrenstown. All these schools need money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would not rebuild them all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Warrenstown should be rebuilt completely.  It was suggested we should have a live-stock progeny testing station at Grange for cattle, and at Athenry for sheep.  We want more research work done and bigger grants given to the universities in order to carry out this research work. We were caught because of money.  If I had had money at my disposal, I would have gone ahead with this work; but I did not have the advantage the Minister has in having a monetary reform man for a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>With regard to the control station for eggs and poultry, our trouble here is that we must improve the quality of our exports.  If we do not do that, we may lose the market.  We have about 2 per cent. of the 15 per cent. of imports into Britain at the present time. Unless we are very careful in our exports and the quality of them, we may lose that.  It is necessary, therefore, to have a proper control station set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> The most important step at the moment is the provision of increased credit for farmers for the purchase of lime and fertilisers.  The Minister will remember that last spring I introduced a scheme to enable farmers to obtain loans to buy fertilisers.  There is an air of independence about a man who has the money with which to buy.  We made the money available, but the amount at our disposal was not sufficient. I ask the Minister to make £1,000,000 available.  If we are to increase production, there will have to be a greater use of lime and fertilisers. The only way to encourage the farmer to use lime and fertilisers is by making more credit available for him.</P>
    <P>Another important scheme is the reclamation of marginal land and the improvement of hill grazing, particularly in the Gaeltacht and congested areas.  Experiments are, as the Minister knows, still going on in that direction. It would be a good thing to have more work of that nature carried out.</P>
    <P>With regard to improved facilities under the farm building schemes and the farm water supply scheme, the money available now is not sufficient to induce farmers to build.  It does not cover a quarter of the cost of labour or a quarter of the cost of building materials.  It was the Minister himself who introduced the water supply scheme to enable farmers to bring water into their houses.  That scheme should be extended to make water available for cattle.  Many farms are dependent upon rivers for watering their cattle but it does not always suit a farmer to reserve land bordering on rivers for grazing purposes. If he had a piped system it would be a great advantage to him.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the disposal of sewerage from creameries.  From the fishery point of view this is important because of the pollution of rivers.  At the moment there is no proper system, in the case of many creameries&mdash;I do not say all&mdash;for the disposal of sewerage.  The matter is very important having regard to our export trade.  It is important that we should take every precaution to see that sewerage is properly disposed of and so eliminate the danger of pollution or contamination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> I would also suggest to the Minister that grants be made available for the purchase of machinery, for lime spreaders in particular, and manure distributors.  Some years ago there was a scheme whereby grants were provided for lime distributors.  That was done under the land reclamation scheme.  I think, however, that the Minister should make grants available for lime spreaders, irrespective of whether they are engaged in delivering lime for land reclamation, for grass or tillage.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of providing facilities for the drying and the storage of onions.  Last year, because we were unable to have proper drying facilities, considerable quantities of onions were lost in the County Kerry.  If grants were made available for the erection of drying sheds and the provision of proper storage facilities, we might be able to avoid losses in that direction.</P>
    <P>I should also like if the Minister would use his influence with other Ministers regarding the condition of cul-de-sac roads.  It is necessary, if we are to have mechanisation on the land, that the old cul-de-sac roads be got rid of because, as the Minister knows, no machines can travel up the old laneways and boreens.  I suggest to him that he should use his influence and see that grants are made available for the putting of these roadways into proper condition.</P>
    <P>I think that is all I have to say on the Estimate.  It is actually the Estimate that was prepared by me, with the exception of the one or two matters which I have raised in connection with the cattle tax and progeny testing.  There is no other matter that I want to deal with at the moment.  I do hope, however, that when the Estimate is placed before us in four or five years' time that we will not have the same stagnant position that we had in 1951.  That is all I have to say to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of discussing the Estimate at any length, except to say that agricultural conditions to-day are flourishing and are being handed over to the Minister in a very sound and good condition. <Col N="842" /> We hope that he will maintain them so.  There is only one matter that I want to deal with.  The Minister asked Deputy Walsh, when he was speaking, a question in connection with milk costings.  I would like to tell the Minister that the agricultural community expect this Government to give them the same treatment in regard to the findings of any commission on milk costings as they are now giving to the civil servants.  If the tribunal on milk costings finds that the farmers are, and have been entitled to an increase in the price of milk, we expect that the Government will go back over the specified period in the same way as they are doing now at the expense of the taxpayers in connection with the £1,000,000 back pay to the civil servants.  I expect that the tribunal will say how long the farmers have been underpaid on the question of milk prices.  Therefore, we expect that the Government will go back over that period in the same way as they are doing in the case of the civil servants.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is the principal industry of the country.  The agricultural community are expecting the self-same treatment from this Government as they are now giving to other sections of the community.  I do not think that is asking too much.  There are many men engaged in tillage schemes to-day who at present have troubled minds, men who have, for example, their all invested in harvesting machinery.  I hope that the Minister's guarantee in regard to a five year plan for wheat, and other grain crops, will be carried out in the knowledge based on this fact, that it is very nice for any Government to come along and say: &ldquo;Yes, we will give you a price; we will give you a five year guarantee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the Minister's guarantee in respect of wheat the last time that he sat on that side of the House, and the tragic results which that guarantee had over a period.  I also remember the Minister's guarantee as regards oats which was given in 1948, and the tragic position in which the agricultural community found themselves at harvest time in that year.  These are things which <Col N="843" /> farmers do not forget.  They are present in their minds to-day when their crops are in the ground growing and, thank God, look very promising. But they are wondering and they are nervous.  I am endeavouring to ease their minds as best I can, and I am sure that the Minister will help to ease their minds also.</P>
    <P>As I have said, agriculture is our principal industry.  If the Minister has any nervousness as regards price, I want to suggest to him that the agricultural community are at least entitled to as much protection for their industry as those in other industries are receiving.  I do not think we are looking for too much in asking for that. We, in our time, paid, and we are continuing to-day to pay, a little more in order to give employment to our people in Wexford for the agricultural machinery which they produce.  We are paying a little more for iron and steel. I take it, too, that we are paying a little more for our artificial manures in order to give employment to people in this country.  Therefore, I say that the agricultural community are entitled to the same measure of protection for what they produce.  I would suggest to the Minister that if he approaches the matter along that line, we will have a fairly happy time here.  I also suggest to him that, within the next few weeks when the costings tribunal will report on milk prices, he will have the opportunity of seeing that the findings of that tribunal are put into force so that the farming community will, at least, get the back pay due to them in the same as this Government have decided to give back pay to the civil servants.  I do not think that that is going beyond bounds and I do not think it is an unreasonable thing to look for.  It is on that line as I said that I judge every Minister and every Department and I am sure that I shall have a pretty happy time here with the Minister while we agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I was not in the House when the Minister made his statement and I am glad to have an opportunity of putting in this House a viewpoint which I have put for a long time in the dairying end of the <Col N="844" /> constituency which I represent.  I would like to preface my remarks by quoting an extract from an interview given by Mr. David Gray, former American Minister to this State, on his return to Washington after he had relinquished his post here.  He said a number of things which most members of this House, I am sure, resented but he did say one thing about our dairying industry.  He said: &ldquo;The standard of living among the rural community is very low.  They have robber cows that eat much and give little&rdquo;.  I think that in that short sentence he crystallised a statement of the truth of which anybody in the House who has made a study of the position in the dairying areas, is long ago convinced.</P>
      <P>I want to say this: If that was the impression he had gathered with his fishing-rod on the banks of the Blackwater at Carysville what would have been his impression had he gone into the dairying recesses in the counties in the South?  I have always maintained that our trouble began with the introduction of the Livestock Breeding Act away back in 1926.  I never saw anything that was written of it to indicate that there was any particular demand ever made by the dairy farmers for the introduction of such an Act and I have no idea who conceived it but I do know that the Minister for Agriculture who reigned when the Act was introduced is on record as having said: &ldquo;We can take this too far.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Dr. Hammond, who is a well-known geneticist, said down in Kilkenny some time ago that it was as logical for a farmer to go to a show to select a bull passed at a bull inspection to mate to his dairy cows as it would be for a bachelor to go to a beauty contest to select a domesticated wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen peculiar things happen in the operation of this Act.  The only basis on which the Act operated is contour.  Calves are presented at the cross-roads and in the market squares of the towns and in post office centres all over the country and they are inspected purely from the contour angle. There is no reference whatever to the milking propensities of the dams of these bulls.  As a matter of fact there <Col N="845" /> is no record whatever in most cases of the dams.  All that is required by the bull inspector is contour and formation. That business has been going on since 1926 and there has been promiscuous crossing of dairy herds by those animals and we have now reached the stage when, instead of dairy cows, we have a beef cow&mdash;a phenomenon.  This phenomenon is known as the dual-purpose shorthorn.  Some time ago one of those bulls bought at Reading, a bull with some repute, was seconded to Mitchelstown and was used in a breeding station there and the following spring some of the progeny of that bull appeared before the bull inspector and, as far as I am aware, four of them were rejected outright.  When this anomaly was brought to the notice of the Department&mdash;what happened? An inspector was sent down and the bulls were passed&mdash;re-inspected and passed.</P>
    <P>We have those bulls, and we have officers of the Department of Agriculture going, year after year, to the Reading bull sales and buying with the taxpayers' money those bulls. They are bought on repute.  They are not proven and they are brought into this country and distributed to premium bullholders and now to the A1 stations.  There is no record whatever kept.  And it is still the same even in the A1 stations; there is no attempt to prove or progeny-test those bulls and it is only&mdash;now the Minister is disturbed, but I am not aware that we have in any station a progeny test.  I am aware, in my own home area, we have a progeny-testing of the heifers but that is an incomplete type of test of heifers which are fed and kept under varying conditions.  It is some indication, but not a true indication, and it is not worth a whole lot.  All we have in the stations that used to be operated by the Department of Agriculture, the stations now operated by the Dairy Disposals Board, I think, is what I describe as purposeless, mechanised mating of cattle.</P>
    <P>I am aware that to one other station in the South was sent a bull with the very formidable name of Napoleon. The noble emperor was sent south and <Col N="846" /> we heard a lot of him.  He was put into service there and a crop of heifers produced but of what they did nobody ever again heard.  I doubt if the figures ever saw daylight.  And so another one passed out.</P>
    <P>Again I heard the Minister in University College, Dublin, last December&mdash;was it not?&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;being cheered to the echo because in apologising for the Livestock Breeding Act he made use of the words Belsen and Buchenwald in describing the conditions under which cattle were housed in the spring.  We all know that cows are kept in many places in conditions far from ideal but we also know of places where cows are kept under ideal conditions and we see very few figures produced from these institutions.  I have not seen any, at any rate.  One would think that these would be the places where figures would be compiled to defend the dual purpose shorthorn but we have no such figures.  I have seen none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, but I have never seen any figures which would give any reliable guide on the economics of the thing&mdash;I mean something that would give us a record of what is put in at one end and extracted at the other, and the profit accruing from the transaction. That is what the dairy farmer is concerned with.  If the Minister or his Department has any figures of the nature suggested, I should like to be provided with a copy of these figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again Dr. Hammond said as far back as 1946:&mdash;&ldquo;A cow to be a dual purpose animal to-day must produce in the region of 1,000 gallons and, at the same time, a good steer.&rdquo;  The Minister objects to the word &ldquo;steer&rdquo; so I shall say &ldquo;bullock&rdquo;.  I say that we have not had a chance.  We have tried, down through the years, to get something approaching that figure but so far as I can see&mdash;and I hope to prove it before I conclude&mdash;it is an impossibility. <Col N="847" /> I can see one hope and that is from the introduction here of Dutch Friesian bulls.  The Minister, I believe&mdash;I was not in the House&mdash; made reference to the use of the Aberdeen Angus.  When we have a national average in Holland of between 800 and 900 gallons, why not now think in terms of black and white?  Why not remove the black and white spots from our eyes and cross these cows with Aberdeen Angus bulls?  That is my suggestion.</P>
    <P>Again, up to 1947 there was being imported into this country, by officers of the Minister's Department, Scotch beef bulls.  I think the greatest crime committed on the dairy farmers of this country was committed through the importation of these Scotch beef bulls. I have seen myself instances where these Scotch beef bulls were distributed in the dairying areas.  They found their way in there and there was no effort made to control their progeny.  What happened?  Unscrupulous people came along and they put heifers in calf to these bulls and they sold these heifers in the fairs of Munster to small dairymen.  When the unfortunate people expected to be provided with milk from them, they got as much milk as you might get from an Angora goat.  That was the position that went on, I believe, up to 1947, when the then Minister for Agriculture &mdash;I think it was Deputy Smith&mdash;with-drew the premiums on the Scotch beef bulls.  Then we had a voice raised in protest from the vested interests.  In Seanad Éireann we had a motion by Senator Counihan indicating the then Minister for this embargo, but few knew that Senator Counihan was one of three brothers who were Kerry cattle dealers.  I trust I am within the rules of the House.</P>

      <P>I believe that was one of the first documents signed by the present Minister&mdash;the restoration of these premiums&mdash;when he became Minister away back in 1948.  At least I accuse him of it.  I have seen some <Col N="848" /> records somewhere that the present Minister did sign a document very early on in his previous term of office restoring these premiums.  I think the greatest menace, while we have the dual-purpose shorthorns, is these Scotch beef bulls.  It would be all right if these bulls were brought in and their progeny controlled but unfortunately they do not colour mark like the Hereford or the Aberdeen-Angus.  I would say to the Minister that as long as we trick about with the dual-purpose shorthorn, one thing we should ensure is that these bulls are not distributed in the dairying areas of Munster.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mention any specific Minister.  I do not know what Minister was in office when these bulls were first imported, but I am making the very case now I would have made if a Fianna Fáil Minister was sitting where the present Minister is now sitting. It is a viewpoint I have expressed irrespective of what Government was in office.  It is a viewpoint which I am glad to have an opportunity of putting to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I want to make reference to the system by which the record of a dam here is assessed.  So far as I am aware, all you need here is the record of a registered cow for one year.  If I am wrong I should like to be corrected, but that is the impression I have got from various statements I have seen.  I think that is all wrong. Surely we are all aware of the racket carried on by vested interests who call themselves breeders.  I know there are breeders who are extremely honest people but I know that there is a very big percentage who have racketeered <Col N="849" /> in this matter.  It is one of the reasons why I object to shows.  I have stated in another place that I have a strong objection to shows.  The show serves a double purpose.  The show is the unholy temple where these racketeers ring the changes and pass over their shoddy goods on these small dairymen.  I know how the records are assembled.  I am sure the Minister knows.  The cows are fed. There is no reference at all to the law of economics, no reference to the law of diminishing returns.  It is a case of feed, feed, feed, produce that label at any price.</P>
    <P>A certain farm manager visited a certain breeder at milking time.  He was astounded when he saw the yield of each cow being weighed meticulously and then passed up to the cow's head, passed back to the cow.  That is how, in many instances, those bogus labels are produced.  When some of our honest people read a catalogue and see the yield of a dam, they buy the progeny and put the progeny into operation on their herd.  A relation of mine, who had been tricking about with these for years and years, had a herd of 24 cows.  After about ten or 12 years he got an average yield of 650 gallons.  Then he went to a Cork show and bought a labelled bull.  He bred from this bull and the yields of the heifers collapsed.  There was a sudden collapse and he was back where he began.  He threw up his hands in despair.  Do not we all know that that is the reason why people just nod their heads when you suggest their joining a cow-testing society?</P>
    <P>I have not many cows.  I have five shorthorns and six Friesian crosses.  I make a record.  It is very useful to me. It is one of the ways by which I can know which one to eliminate.  In some cases there may be a flush period of five weeks and a particular cow may fill the pail for those few weeks and then they say that she is a good milker.  It is amazing how deceptive that can be.  It is the animal that milks over the lactation period, not in a spectacular way, but in an even way, that gives you the decent figure and in many instances the animal that has a flush period of a few weeks may be at the end of the list at the end of the lactation period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> Lush, the American geneticist, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Forty per cent. better progress is made in breeding for milk when selections are made on the result of four or five lactations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are aware that the Dutch system insists on four or five lactations, insists on double inspection, insists that, when the bulls have been in service for two years, if they show any mal-development or mis-confirmation, they are removed.  Why could not the Minister here examine this whole position and try to seal off the loopholes?  It is not outside the bounds of possibility to have a thorough examination of this system and the Minister would have the praise of every dairyman in the country if he were to do something to eliminate the racketeers who have got in on this thing.</P>

That is specific and I <Col N="851" /> hope this table will give an indication of the three breeds, by comparison. The first breed is the Dutch Friesian: yield of butter fat per cow, 310 lb.; food units consumed, per lb. of butter fat produced, 21.1; butter fat per acre produced, 105 lb.  The second breed is the New Zealand Jersey: yield of butter fat per cow, 250 lb.; food units consumed per lb. of butter fat produced, 18.7; butter fat per acre produced, 119. The third breed is the Danish Jersey: yield of butter fat per cow, 270 lb.; food units consumed per lb. of butter fat produced, 19.8; butter fat per acre produced, 112 lb.

    <P>(2)  That there shall be charged, levied and paid a duty of customs at the rate of 60 per cent. of the value of the article, on every of the following <Col N="852" /> articles imported into the State, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>component parts of boots and shoes which are shaped soles, shaped heels or shaped uppers, or shaped parts of soles, heels or uppers, made wholly or mainly of leather and skin or either of them.</P>
    <P>(3)  That whenever the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, so thinks proper, the Revenue Commissioners may by licence authorise any particular person, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, to import without payment of the duty mentioned in paragraph (2) of this Resolution, any articles chargeable therewith or, in the case of any such articles already imported, to take delivery thereof without payment of the said duty either, as the Revenue Commissioners shall think proper, without limit as to time or quantity or either of them or within a specified time or in a specified quantity, but so that no such licence shall be exempt from the provisions of Section 15 of the Finance (Agreement with United Kingdom) Act, 1938 (No. 12 of 1938).</P>

    <P>This Resolution is necessary to comply with Standing Orders.  The purpose of Section 17 of the Bill to which this Resolution relates is to revoke six of the seven customs duties imposed on boots, shoes, and component parts by Section 9 of the Finance Act of 1934, as amended.  The operation of these six duties is at present suspended by Orders made under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act.  The remaining duty which is not suspended is to be continued in force.  From the point of view of drafting convenience, it has been decided that the simplest course is to terminate all seven duties and to <Col N="853" /> re-enact the duty on certain component parts.  This procedure, even though the over-all effect is merely to maintain the <i>status quo</i> as regards the duties concerned, necessitates the introduction of this Resolution.

      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 15 and 16, to delete &ldquo;seven shillings and sixpence&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;six shillings and sixpence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment, which relates to income-tax, and all the other amendments on the sheet appearing in my name, have for their purpose the reduction of certain taxes to the level at which they were before the Budget of 1952; not merely to reduce the income-tax to the pre-1952 level but also to reduce the taxes on beer, spirits and tobacco.  These are the taxes which members of the present Government stated at the time and on many occasions since were unnecessary, the taxes which they undertook during the course of the recent election campaign to repeal, the taxes which they stated could be repealed immediately.  However, the legal members of the Government may parse and interpret the phraseology that was used during these election speeches, there is no doubt that they caused the people to believe that the Fianna Fáil Government had imposed unnecessary taxation, and that it would be the function of the new Coalition Government to rectify that situation by revoking these unnecessary taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of submitting these <Col N="855" /> amendments to the Dáil is to give Deputies opposite an opportunity, if they want it, of redeeming their election pledges, an opportunity, if they do not want to redeem those pledges, of withdrawing them, and an opportunity to the Government of explaining why it is not possible to do now what a few months ago they were saying they could and would do.  These amendments, of course, pose to Deputies opposite a question which affects the reputation of the Government and of each individual supporting them.  What is that question?  Perhaps it would be better if I were to put it in words other than my own.  I think it will help the Dáil to realise the character of the question they have to answer on these amendments if I put it in the words of a member of the present Administration, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  When these taxes had been put into operation and were subsequently under discussion by the Dáil, the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donnellan, spoke as follows in Dáil Éireann.  I am quoting from Volume 131, column 639, of the Official Debates, and this is the quotation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I notice in a Sunday paper that a certain question was asked by Deputy McQuillan.  The same question was asked by Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll.  The question was that if there was a change of Government would the same taxes be left on or what would be done?  That was an intelligent question and I congratulate both Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll on it.  As Deputy John A. Costello, the ex-Taoiseach, and Deputy McGilligan, ex-Minister for Finance, explained, the answer is that there is an overestimate here of, roughly, £10,000,000.  With a change of Government and with the help of men like Deputy McGilligan again, taxation to the extent of that £10,000,000 could be reduced.  That is the answer to the question that was asked.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the answer of Deputy Donnellan before the election.  Are <Col N="856" /> we going to get the same answer from the same Deputy or from his colleagues in the present Administration to-day?  Do they still contend that the taxes to which these amendments relate were unnecessary and can now be revoked?  Are they going to adhere to their undertaking to the people who elected them to revoke these taxes immediately ?</P>
    <P>I note that when we discussed this matter last week there was some doubt raised as to whether the undertaking of the present Government was or was not to revoke these taxes immediately. The present Minister for Finance stated earlier that the present Government had not promised to reduce taxation at all, but Deputy McGilligan last week qualified it by asserting that the Government had not promised to reduce taxation immediately.  He said last week&mdash;I am quoting from Volume 146, No. 4, column 506:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We made no promises about immediate reductions in taxes. Nobody who now holds ministerial rank&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I want Deputies to note the subtle qualifications inserted there&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and that is what is referred to in the motion&mdash;made any such promises and we will ask the ex-Tánaiste to go through any quotations in every newspaper and nowhere will he find a promise of that kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the exact significance of a promise to effect a reduction of taxation immediately.  I asked how quick was &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; and I got no answer to that question. But we find on examining the records that a specific time had been mentioned by the present Taoiseach and by some of his colleagues in the present Government within which they would effect these reductions in taxation.</P>
    <P>On the same occasion as that upon which Deputy Donnellan, the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, gave that specific reply to a question which some Deputies had asked, Deputy MacEntee, the then Minister for Finance, made a rather remarkable prophecy.</P>
    <P>He foretold that if it should happen that Deputy Costello was transferred <Col N="857" /> from the Opposition to the Government Benches there was not a single measure, a single tax, imposed in Deputy MacEntee's Finance Bill that he would repeal.  Whether that was an accurate prophecy or not will be demonstrated, no doubt, in the next couple of hours.  It was made, and perhaps it is worth quoting now because immediately Deputy MacEntee had made that prophecy&mdash;the prophecy that there was not a single one of those taxes that Deputy Costello would repeal if, in fact, he was transferred from this side of the House to the other side&mdash;Deputy Costello intervened in the debate and he said, as reported in Volume 131, column 1439:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would repeal every one of them if I were over there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Immediately afterwards, Deputy Mulcahy, the present Minister for Education and Chairman of the Fine Gael Party, intervened and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He would remove £10,000,000 in ten minutes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on in the same debate, Deputy Costello again intervened and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would resign the next minute, rather than proceed with any single provision in the present Budget.  I would be no party to any provision in this Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I urge Deputies opposite to consider carefully before they decide this afternoon to put the Taoiseach in the embarrassing position of either having to eat his words or resign.</P>
    <P>Nor were the present Taoiseach and the present Minister for Education alone in that declaration.  Deputy McGilligan spoke at a public meeting which was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and said the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we could get the present Government out by July 1st, a new Minister for Finance could in a ten-minute speech save £1,000,000 a minute and thus wipe out the £10,000,000 that was being asked for. I do not even despair of being able to save another £5,000,000 as well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said that members of the present Administration made no promises about immediate reductions <Col N="858" /> in taxation.  He said that nobody who holds ministerial office at the present time made any such promises.  He went further than that last week&mdash;and Deputies sitting behind the Government will note how definitely their election speeches are now being repudiated.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We do not believe that...there was anybody on this side foolish enough to say that big reductions in taxation, immediate reductions in taxation, were practicable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it true that no member of the present Administration stated that neither big reductions nor immediate reductions in taxation were possible? I have shown that the present Taoiseach has said that he would resign the next minute if he became Taoiseach and found himself unable to repeal these taxes.  I have shown that the present Minister for Education and Chairman of the Fine Gael Party said that these taxes would be repealed in ten minutes after the change of Government. I have shown that Deputy McGilligan, the former Minister for Finance, even put a figure on the amount of the reductions that would be achieved in ten minutes&mdash;£10,000,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan last week challenged me to show that any member of the present Administration promised immediate reductions in taxation. Well, I have covered two of them already.  I do not have to remind the House of the very formal declaration made by the Chairman of Fine Gael in his election address:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The first task of the new Administration will be to lighten the burden of taxation which is now crushing the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us get down to other members of the Administration.</P>
    <P>The present Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking at a public meeting in Naas, reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 5th May, said the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil Deputies by voting for the increased prices of tea, bread, butter, sugar and flour and for the higher taxes on cigarettes, <Col N="859" /> beer and tobacco, have been active conspirators in the attack on the people's standard of living.  In this reactionary policy Fianna Fáil was implementing the policy which the Central Bank had sought to induce the inter-Party Government to adopt but which that Government had spurned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are the Deputies in this House who support the present Government now becoming active conspirators in the attack on the people's standard of living?  Is this &ldquo;reactionary policy&rdquo; attributed to the Central Bank now being accepted as the policy of the present Administration?</P>
    <P>During the course of the election campaign, the present Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, issued a circular to all the licensed traders in his constituency, on the 3rd May, from his election headquarters at the Railway Hotel, Kildare.  This is the circular:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    <P>As you are an elector in the County Kildare constituency, I take the liberty of enclosing herewith a copy of my election address and would kindly invite your attention in particular to the portion of the programme set out in page 3 under the heading &lsquo;Reduction in Prices.&rsquo;  In view of the serious effect of increased taxation on cigarettes, beer and spirits, which no doubt has had an injurious effect on your trade, I trust you will find it possible to give me your No. 1 vote in the forthcoming election and kindly ask your relatives and friends to do likewise, so that with the aid of the Labour Party I may advocate in the new Dáil a reduction of the taxes which so adversely affect your business and consumers generally.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, this is the day of testing.  Is the Leader of the Labour Party, and are his colleagues here in this House, going to avail of this opportunity to advocate a reduction of these taxes upon cigarettes, beer and spirits? Either this afternoon or to-morrow, <Col N="860" /> they will have to advocate them and vote for them, or they will have to vote against them.  No doubt those who, in response to the circular, gave Deputy Norton their votes&mdash;and their relatives and friends&mdash;will be very glad to see precisely how these election pledges are going to be redeemed.</P>

      <P>We prefer to be honest with the people.  No member who now holds any ministerial rank, said Deputy McGilligan here last week, made any such promises.  The present Minister for Defence, Deputy MacEoin, made an abundance of promises.

      <P>With or without the authority of his portfolio and whatever his military rank, he is now in this House as an important member of the present Administration, sharing collective responsibility with all the other members.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our policy is to relieve once again the penal taxes which have been imposed by Fianna Fáil in their 1952 Budget&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, to carry into effect the amendments which I am now proposing to the House.  That was the policy of Fine Gael as declared in the election&mdash;to make in this Finance Bill the changes which these amendments represent.  The Minister for Defence and his colleagues will have an opportunity in the very near future either of fulfilling that policy or, finally, abandoning it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretaries&mdash; those who are now Parliamentary Secretaries&mdash;were far more flamboyant in their promises and far more definite <Col N="861" /> in their statements in regard to a new Government than even those who hold ministerial rank.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance just took Deputy McGilligan's declaration at a public meeting and repeated it with slightly more emphasis. Addressing a Clann na Talmhan Convention in Ballina, Deputy Donnellan, as he then was, said: &ldquo;If there is a change of Government we will put in a Minister for Finance who will remit £1,000,000 for each minute of a ten-minute talk in the Dáil.&rdquo;  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is not here now, I know, but perhaps he will come in here in time to deliver that ten-minute speech and remit £1,000,000 in taxation in each minute of it.</P>
    <P>I do not know if we have to take the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Oliver Flanagan, any more seriously now that he has been raised to the dignity of a Parliamentary Secretary. However, he was equally emphatic in his view of the justice of carrying through the amendments which I am now proposing.</P>
    <P>Here is a quotation in point.  &ldquo;It is, indeed, a crime to rob the poor man of his beer, and it is, indeed, a laughing-stock to remove the tax of a farthing per pint, which will have no bearing on the price paid by the consumer.&rdquo;  The report of Deputy O. Flanagan's speech appeared in the <i>Leinster Express</i> of the 24th April, 1954.  It continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Declaring that there was no hope for the brewing and distilling industries, only greater unemployment and lack of business in the trade, Mr. Flanagan said the income-tax concessions given in the Budget only referred to the people from whom the Minister for Finance, Mr. MacEntee, could not collect tax at present, owing to the high cost of living, and many other commitments, which the middle class have to face.  &lsquo;In my opinion,&rsquo; said Mr. Flanagan, &lsquo;the Government cannot boast of taking a halfpenny off the loaf, after having put 3½d. on it without any justification whatever.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> I find that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Davin, repeated on more than one occasion the pledge which I have already quoted for the benefit of the members of this House.  I think that pledge is worth repeating in the context of the discussion on these amendments.  He said: &ldquo;So far as the Labour Party is concerned, the principal item in our programme in this election is the reduction of taxation on all essential commodities to the same level, or as nearly as possible to the same level, as that at which they stood before the Budget of 1952.  I pledge my word of honour to the people of this area that if I am re-elected, as I hope to be, I will undertake with my colleagues to use that power given to us by the votes of the people to force whatever new Government is elected on the 2nd June to bring down these prices to the lowest possible figure.&rdquo;  That quotation is taken from a report in the <i>Midland Tribune</i> of 15th May, 1954.  The value to be placed on Deputy Davin's word of honour will be demonstrated during the votes on these amendments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crotty, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, also in the course of his election campaign, spoke at a meeting at Castlecomer, as reported in the <i>Kilkenny People</i> of 15th May.  &ldquo;They had, he said, unjust and unnecessary taxation and, in the Budget of 1952, £6,000,000 tax was put on beer, tobacco and cigarettes.  Their food subsidies were slashed to the extent of £8,000,000.  Fianna Fáil said the people were living too well.&rdquo;  I do not know if the Government are serious in trying to convince the House or the country that they did not promise to reduce taxation.</P>
    <P>Every voter in the country considered that that promise had been made and every voter was left under the impression that it was not a problem for another inter-Party Government and that taxation could be reduced and reduced immediately.  The impression was given to the voters that there was an abundance of money.  When Deputy McGilligan was making his bid for the votes of the civil servants&mdash;his cash offer&mdash;he was <Col N="863" /> at pains to emphasise that this was not a budgetary problem at all.  He said that there was plenty of money available.  In a letter to the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 17th May, 1954, the eve of the election, he said: &ldquo;There is abundant money to pay the arrears and Fine Gael is pledged to that payment.&rdquo;  He also said that it would be immediately available to make that adjustment in Civil Service salaries.</P>
    <P>Deputies, I think, know that these promises were made.  They know that the people expected some effort to fulfil these promises at least in part.  It is no answer to these expectations to say that the Government need time. They do not need time, if what they said is true.  In his wireless broadcast, Deputy McGilligan said that the economies were there to hand: &ldquo;They are immediately available for any Minister who cares to see them.  There is little doubt that savings in the cost of Government amounting to several millions a year can be secured without much effort.&rdquo;  Is it not reasonable, therefore, to ask the Government to make the effort and to fulfil the promises which were made?</P>
    <P>The Government claim they have not had time to prepare amendments to this Finance Bill.  Well, I have done it for them.  There was nothing difficult about it.  I drafted the amendments in a bus on the back of an envelope.  They can be carried through without any change and will achieve what every Deputy opposite promised the electorate he would vote for, that is, a reduction in taxes on beer, spirits and tobacco and a reduction in income-tax to the pre-1952 level.</P>
    <P>If it is not possible to reduce these taxes now, the onus is on the Government to explain the reason.  Again, I do not want the House to be under any misunderstanding about our view on the matter.  As I have already said, if the Estimates prepared for the various Departments of this State are accurate, if the expectations of revenue, upon which the Budget was framed, are sound, there is no surplus and these taxes cannot be remitted if <Col N="864" /> enough money is to be available to the Government to meet the ordinary cost of administration.</P>
    <P>We did not say these taxes were unnecessary or unjust.  We did not contend that they were imposed for any reason except to bring into the Exchequer the minimum amount required to pay for Government services. Those Deputies who are now on the Government Benches argued that these taxes were unnecessarily imposed&mdash;that they were imposed not because the Exchequer needed the money but because the Central Bank wanted a restrictive policy applied.</P>
    <P>If these taxes are unnecessary, they can now be remitted.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> has stated that if these amendments are carried it will, of course, be necessary to effect immediate reductions in social welfare services. Government Deputies will not fall for that.  They know that if what they said in the election is correct, the <i>Independent</i> cannot be right.</P>
    <P>At Sligo, on 1st May, as reported in the <i>Sligo Independent</i>, the Taoiseach in the course of an election address was emphatic in asserting that there was no reason why taxes should not be got down while the same or even improved services, would be provided. That was the case made to the public &mdash;that, without any reduction in services, and even with an improvement in these services, it was still possible, because of the action of Fianna Fáil in imposing unnecessary taxation, to remit some taxes immediately.  If what was said is true, there is no reason now why the Deputies on the Government Benches should not vote for these amendments.</P>
    <P>If the Minister says that he cannot give the whole of the reductions I am asking for in these amendments this year, because three months of the financial year have already elapsed, then I shall be prepared to consider any compromise he may have to suggest. However, we do think that the pledges which Deputies opposite gave during the election campaign require them, in this Finance Bill, to make some contribution towards the reduction of the taxation on beer, spirits and tobacco&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy has put his finger on the point.  I think the Deputy is correct in his view that the result of the recent election was due to the fact that the public were led to believe that the Fianna Fáil Government had imposed taxation unnecessarily.  It was not.  I do not believe&mdash;this is my own personal opinion&mdash;that it was the level of prices which put us out of office.  It was the belief, carefully inculcated by Fine Gael and Labour Party propaganda, that the level of prices was unnecessary that was responsible for the result.  It is the soundness of that belief I am testing now.  Do you think that the present prices of beer, spirits and tobacco are unnecessary?  If they are, then obviously you will vote for a reduction.</P>

      <P>The case made, as I understand it and as the public understood it, is that unnecessary taxation was imposed and that the Fianna Fáil Government had imposed that unnecessary taxation for some reason other than the needs of the Exchequer, that we had obeyed the behest of the Central Bank or that we were following an austerity policy or had an idea that it was desirable to reduce public spending upon these classes of goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the case you made to the public and you even argued that a reduction in these prices would not result in a loss of revenue, that the increased consumption, following the <Col N="866" /> reduction, would mean that the Exchequer would not suffer any contraction of income on that account.  If that is so you can have no hesitation about voting for these amendments.  If it is not so, you have got, as I said, either to formally repudiate these election promises or explain why they cannot be fulfilled.  It is that explanation I am waiting to hear.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Lemass for the last half an hour, I was struck afresh with his ability to make bricks without straw and to talk for 32 minutes about pure &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.  The Deputy spent 32 minutes trying to prove that every member of the Government and every Deputy sitting behind the Government made promises during the election.  With his leader, he spent the whole of the election campaign trying to extract promises from the members of the present Government. He and the then Taoiseach complained bitterly, day after day, as the campaign went on, that they could not extract a promise, that they were making no promises.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass came in here with newspaper cuttings.  We could bring newspaper cuttings to show that if one took up the newspapers every day and read the speech of Deputy de Valera, there was not a word of policy in it or a word about Fianna Fáil.  The whole speech was devoted to an effort to extract from the Leader of the members of the Government promises so that he could then play his own tune on them.  At some of his own meetings, Deputy Lemass was rempant from the platform and at one meeting in particular, where the present Taoiseach was due to speak, he became almost hysterical on the Fianna Fáil platform. He said: &ldquo;He is there now.  Make him answer me.  Make him promise you.&rdquo;  The <i>Irish Press</i> came out the following morning with a streamer headline: &ldquo;Fine Gael refuses to promise.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is no doubt in the world about that.  By the way, when the Deputy was reading I noticed that he read a circular which was circularised by Deputy Norton. Perhaps the Deputy would also read the circular that he himself circularised to the manufacturers and tell us the result?</P>

That was sailing pretty close to the wind, very close to the wind.  Truth in public life!  With regard to all the extracts Deputy Lemass read a while ago there was one thing missing, one thing which did not appear in any of the extracts and that was that those reductions would be made immediately.</P>

      <P>The same as the election promises.  I am going to say what I set out to say and I am not going to be deterred from saying it.  I am telling Deputy Lemass that he is wasting his time and is doing no harm to the Government or to those who support the Government.  He is not only doing no good to his own Party but doing it positive harm.  There is no use in Deputy Lemass getting up, as he did last week, and telling us that they would be helpful in their criticism, that they would be constructive and would only criticise the Government where the Government was doing something wrong.</P>
      <P>You are not going to shift from your own shoulders by a series of amendments like these the responsibility for the position we are in.  Why did you not let Deputy de Valera do the right thing when he wanted to do the right thing for once at least?

They voted in this House against a motion framed for the purpose of giving the people an opportunity of expressing their views and returning a new Government, and giving that Government sufficient time to bring in its own Budget and its own Finance Bill, and all the blather you are going on with there, with a series of amendments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy cannot get out of it.  He cannot say that he is being misquoted because not merely was it given verbally, but it was written into the Budget.  If it had been given only verbally, no doubt he would get out of it&mdash;he would have been misreported, misrepresented or something else&mdash;it is always one or the other.  That was written into the 17-point programme and Deputy Lemass cannot get away from the fact that both he and Deputy MacEntee did give to the people of this country an assurance that these duties would not be reimposed, and so false was that statement that it was written into the Budget speech that not only were they being reimposed but they should never have been removed.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader of the Opposition still think, even after the results of the recent general election, that he can fool all the people all the time?  Does he think for a moment that anybody, either inside or outside the House, is going to be fooled by this childish&mdash; to describe it as childish is to dignify it&mdash;attempt to fool?  What the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Lemass are trying to do is to see if they can create any division between the Parties supporting the Government, if they can create any split.  That is the whole aim of this, but it will not succeed.  This Government will carry out its promises.</P>

      <P>It is a pity the Deputy does not resist temptation.  It is a great pity for everybody on that side that he did not resist the temptation to put down these amendments. I doubt if he himself was the person who thought of this scheme and I am sorry he allowed himself to be talked into being the spearhead in this House of other people.  I grant you that, when something like this has to be done, the Leader of the Opposition has not got a very wide choice as to who will do it, but it is going to fail.</P>
      <P>It has one object and one object only.  These amendments are not framed in the interests of the people; they are not framed with any belief in them or in the honesty of their sponsors; they are not framed with any idea of doing any good.  They are framed deliberately and put forward here for the purpose of trying to do harm.  There is no question about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite ought to realise that the people in this country cannot be as easily fooled now as they were in the past years, that we are dealing with a different outlook in the country, <Col N="877" /> that we are dealing with a younger generation, with a generation that wants to get away from the type of politics we have had in this country for many years.  We are dealing to-day with people who are concerned with getting an opportunity to live in their own country and to get a living in it. We are dealing with people outside who do not believe that we can afford the millionaire mentality which has been disclosed by Fianna Fáil down through the years.  We are dealing with those outside and inside who are concerned that first things should come first.</P>
    <P>This Government was elected on a 12-point programme.  That programme was framed and circulated and that programme will be carried into effect. There is nobody in the House, or outside it, on this side or on that side, who believes for a moment or expects for one second that that programme can be fulfilled within a month or 12 months of the Government taking office.  But the programme will be fulfilled; the savings will be made; the extravagance will be cut out; the waste will be eliminated; and the crazy, unproductive schemes will be liquidated.  We showed from 1948 to 1951 that we had a constructive programme.  We showed that we were not afraid to spend money in this nation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows much better than I that the spending of money in itself is not the important point, but the way in which it is spent and on what it is spent.  I said we spent it on constructive programmes, on constructive projects, on something which was going to pay it back to us and the nation and we demonstrated that.  Deputies on the opposite side should get this into their heads, that the Irish people have a lot more sense and intelligence than politicians are sometimes inclined to give them credit for.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can also say &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo;  when I give him <Col N="878" /> the piece of evidence upon which I base that point.  I showed how the Deputy got his majority in 1951 with his 17 points and how the desire of the people for the continuation of the inter-Party Government was flouted on that occasion.  The people, when they got the chance&mdash;and it took a long time to get the Deputy to give them the chance&mdash;showed beyond yea or nay that they wanted inter-Party government and they showed&mdash;and this is where I mark their intelligence and wisdom&mdash;not only that they wanted inter-Party government from now onwards, but, in no unmistakable way, their detestation of those primarily responsible for depriving them of inter-Party government in 1951, because the four Deputies who were primarily responsible for that deprivation were rejected by them.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>His case was against the inter-Party Government.  I want again to repeat this, that the word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; was the one word that was missing from any of the quotations which he gave.  But when the Deputy is again talking about promises and when his colleagues are talking about promises, there are two promises I want them to address themselves to, the promise not to touch the subsidies and the promise not to reimpose the duties on beer, spirits and tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say the Fine Gael Party are good pickers when they want to throw out a smokescreen.  Deputy Morrissey is the Labour man who was swallowed by Fine Gael and he was a good selection to put forward to cover up the Fine Gael Minister for Finance to-night in the Dáil.  When you boil down Deputy Morrissey's speech the only excuse he had for voting against the amendment put down by Deputy Lemass was that it was not really fair to ask Fine Gael to change the Budget in the middle of the financial year or when three months of the financial year were gone.  By inference, Deputy Morrissey wanted to convey to the people who are still left in the Labour Party, after he departed from it, that if this had been the first month of the financial year in which we were <Col N="880" /> discussing this thing we would reduce beer, spirits, income-tax, and so on, down to the 1952 level.</P>
      <P>But that was not the attitude of Fine Gael in 1948.  They did not complain when they came in in February. 1948, that the year was so far advanced, as Deputy Morrissey said, that they really could not change the financial structure, that they could not, because there were ten months of the year gone, reduce the tax on beer or cigarettes.  They did it even though there were ten months of the financial year 1948-49 gone.  This time there are still nine months to run if the Fine Gael Party wanted to reduce the taxation on beer, cigarettes, income-tax and all the rest.  If they wanted to do it it could be done now as it was in February, 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxes then were only put on as a result of the Supplementary Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins was not in then.  Will he keep quiet for a moment?  The reason was given by Deputy Morrissey.  It was also given by the Minister for Finance here on the last occasion we were discussing this matter, that we were not reducing beer, cigarettes, tobacco and income-tax to the 1951-52 level as was promised because two months of the financial year had gone and it could not become operative in this financial year, but it could become operative in 1948, even though there were ten months of the financial year gone.</P>
      <P>Another point of Deputy Morrissey's was that during the election the people voted not to throw high taxation and high prices overboard as they were promised on every hoarding and on every platform in the country by Fine Gael but to have a Coalition Government.  There was more than a Coalition Government promised.  It was not a single-purpose cow that was for sale; it was an all-purpose cow. It was not only a Coalition Government that was promised but a Coalition that would reduce taxation back to the 1952 level, and do it in ten months&mdash;reduce prices back to the 1951 level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the tri-purpose cow that was for sale and that the people <Col N="881" /> bought and now they find it is only a single-purpose cow, an old screw that will give no milk and put no beef on her back; all she has is a few bones. You have the bones of a Government but the meat that was promised and the milk that was promised of lower taxation and lower prices are gone by the board and they have the old screw left.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party were really in earnest when they promised the tri-purpose cow during the election they would produce it, but the fact is that they were trying to fool the people into the belief that we could have a certain level of Government expenditure here, we could have a high standard of life, that nobody need work and that nobody need pay for it.  All the people would have to do was to elect any of these groups in sufficient numbers to form a Government and then the sky was the limit.  Everything would fall into their lap&mdash;lower taxation, lower prices.  The people can see now that that was just so much hoodlum and that all the Coalition groups wanted was their votes, not an opportunity to lower prices and lower taxation.</P>
      <P>The reason that we put on these taxes was because we had to put them on.  At least the voting on these amendments will show the people that the Coalition groups now realise that the present level of taxation is necessary and they are prepared to take responsibility for it.  If they do not think that level of taxation necessary, then let them vote with us.  If, however, they vote for it we will know, and the people will recognise, that what they said all around the country was untrue and that they knew it to be untrue when they were saying it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Aiken used the one word I believe most suitable for this whole masquerade of political hypocrisy introduced by Deputy Lemass in connection with these amendments.  The word used by Deputy Aiken was &ldquo;hoodlum&rdquo;.  Nothing could <Col N="882" /> describe so perfectly the contribution of Deputy Lemass, the interjections of his leader and the follow-up of Deputy Aiken.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass spent some time in drawing attention to the fact that, in their belief, it is not possible to give this remission of taxation.  Encouraged by their leader, Fianna Fáil are going so far as to say that if they were in Government to-night there would be no question whatsoever of a reduction in taxation.</P>
      <P>Already an hour and ten minutes has gone in quoting speeches made by candidates during the election campaign, including those of members of the Labour Party as well as all the other Parties, in an effort to draw attention to allegedly false statements made by Deputies who are now members of this Assembly.  Does it not strike Deputy Lemass that he is equally proving the case against himself for every word that he is trying to prove against us?  Does Deputy Lemass not realise that he is now trying to say the reverse of what he said during the election campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>He will have on the amendment that he has just moved here the support of Deputy Aiken and of his leader.  Deputy Lemass is the one member of Fianna Fáil who is now proving himself politically incompetent in relation to the statements he made during the election campaign.  Indirectly, perhaps, they are saying to the members of the Labour Party that Fianna Fáil has 60 odd seats; we have only 18 or 19. It is obvious that the line of attack is directed towards one group on this side of the House; Fianna Fáil is endeavouring to cuddle the Labour Party in order to get that Party's support.  For three years I believed Deputy Lemass to be politically honest and sincere.  Truly, experience teaches. May I ask the Leader of the Opposition if the members of the Labour Party to-night voted with smug members of the Opposition Front Bench&mdash;and we know that under the Constitution a Government must, as it were, hand in <Col N="883" /> its chips if it is defeated on a Financial Resolution&mdash;would they then tell the people that we were political hypocrites?</P>
      <P>I do not think it necessary to waste time on this except to pin the attention of the Leader of the Opposition.  I do not worry about Press advertisements. I believe all that is just so much cheap talk, unworthy of this national Assembly in which we should interest ourselves in trying to get on with the work of the country rather than waste money paying 2d. or 3d. for daily papers out of which to cut and file certain things.</P>
      <P>On the 2nd June last, the first day this new Dáil met, at column 47 of Volume 146 of the Official Report, Deputy de Valera referring to the miserable 13 per cent. that kept himself in power for so long, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As far as we, as an Opposition, are concerned, if we at any time are appealed to in connection with matters of that sort&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is, to oppose the will of the 13 per cent. that he thought were going to overrun the country,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;we will support what we think right and give support to any people who stand out against being driven in that particular way.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On 2nd June, Deputy de Valera was telling the members of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;not of the Labour Party&mdash;that if there was a danger of the miserable 13 per cent. making too many demands, Fine Gael could be assured of the support of the Deputy and his Party.  The tables are turned now.  He is now speaking as if we would be prepared to go with him.  Let Deputy Lemass put that on his file and let the Leader of the Opposition realise that the less time wasted on political humbug and fraud in this Assembly and the sooner we get on with the work of Government and Opposition the better it will be for the country and for the Fianna Fáil Party themselves.</P>

In the <i>Midland Tribune</i> of the 5th <Col N="884" /> May there appeared the following advertisement: &ldquo;They are making you pay through the nose.  The Fianna Fáil Government increased the price of cigarettes by 8d., of the pint by 9d., of the loaf by 3d., and so forth.  The two Fianna Fáil candidates who are seeking your votes in this election stand for these increases.  You can get rid of them by voting for Dan Morrissey.&rdquo;  In another advertisement it stated.  &ldquo;The Labour Party seeks the support of the people in the forthcoming election so that they can bring about a reduction in the price of tobacco, cigarettes, beer and spirits&mdash; Vote No. 1 Dan Desmond.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We have now got from Deputy Lemass a very clear explanation of the purpose of these amendments.  The Deputy did not utter a single word in the whole of his first speech or of his second speech about income-tax.  Neither had we a single word about it from Deputy Aiken.  That shows what little purpose they had in considering constructively the material that had been put down. I do not know whether it would be parliamentary for me to use the only word that I think I could use as regards the performance that we have had from the Opposition.  I will content myself by using two words which describe, I think, the attitude that has been adopted here by the Opposition.  The words are very <Col N="886" /> popular amongst children, and they are &ldquo;sour grapes&rdquo;.  This whole performance has been nothing but an exhibition of sour grapes by the Deputies beyond.  Deputy de Valera, when speaking here on 15th June last, at column 146, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government Parties having made, as we believe, false promises to the electorate, we are not going to force them to a still bigger crime against the country, that is, the keeping of the false promises.&rdquo;</P>

When he is challenged which way he would wish to have the debate, he runs away from the particular amendment that is in question.</P>

The Deputy's Party has chosen the cheap line, and the only words in which I can adequately describe that are, &ldquo;sour grapes&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>All these amendments up to amendment No. 7 stand or fall together and have one purpose which I am sure will appeal to Deputies opposite, namely to reduce the tax on beer by 3d. per pint, that is, to the level at which it stood before 1952.  If Deputies opposite will help me by repeating in this debate the relevant extracts from their election speeches, the case for this amendment will be overwhelming. Every Deputy opposite during the election campaign promised a reduction in the tax on beer and will, no doubt, be anxious to redeem that promise now if the Party Whips will let him.  I urge even a brief revolt from the tyranny of the Party Whip, if Deputies want to fulfil their election promises.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Davin, was one of those who gave a most specific pledge in that regard.</P>

They are now <Col N="892" /> apparently going to vote against the reduction and they say there is no obligation on them to explain why.  Why is there not?  Is this taxation necessary?

It is a Bill produced by the present Coalition Government and brought to the House by the Coalition Government.  It is being passed on their recommendation and by the votes of Coalition Deputies.  Is that not so?  So far as I am personally concerned, as a member of the previous Government, I never saw this Bill produced to the House until I was in opposition.  It is true that the main purpose of the Bill is to implement the Budget which Deputy MacEntee introduced last May, but is that what you said to the electorate&mdash;that you were going to implement the Fianna Fáil Budget?  Is there one of you who said it?  Did not every Deputy opposite give the electorate to understand in his election speeches, in his election address, through canvassers and through advertisements in the newspapers, that he was seeking election for the purpose of reducing the level of taxation which that Budget involved?</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, surely all the Deputies who were so voluble around the country have something to say about the price of the pint?  How many hours were spent and how many millions of words were spoken in these last three years on the price of the pint?  How many tears were wrung from the thirsty citizens around the country about the iniquity of Fianna Fáil in raising the pint?  I wish the people who voted and who heard the Deputies opposite since 1952 complaining about the iniquity of Fianna Fáil in raising the price of the poor man's pint could be here this evening to see their sneers and their jeers and their sniggers when they are reminded about what they said to the people whose votes they hoped to get, and did get in some cases, on those speeches and on their promises to reduce the price of the poor man's pint.  The speech was: the working man was entitled to it; Fianna Fáil were criminals, they were unjust, when they increased the price of the poor man's pint and they were going around in their high-powered motor-cars.</P>

I would like that the voters who heard these people ranting about the Fianna Fáil injustice in raising the price of the poor man's pint could be here to see the sniggers at the wonderful fellows they are at having so deceived the people that they would reduce the price of the pint.  It was not in the distant future that the price of the pint was to be reduced.  That was to be done immediately.  It was not in the dim and distant future that taxation of all kinds was to be reduced; it was to be done as quickly in 1954 as it was done in 1948.  All round the country they said: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil will tell you that taxation cannot be reduced.  Of course it can be reduced.  They put on unjust and unnecessary taxation.  We will reduce it and we will reduce it as quickly in 1954 as we did in 1948.&rdquo;  What was done in 1948?  There was no excuse made then that the financial year was too far through to reduce the price of beer, cigarettes and tobacco.  Even though the financial year was ten months through, it was not too late to reduce taxation.  This financial year is only a couple of months through.  The people are getting a lesson from the sniggers of the gentlemen who went around the country saying that this taxation was unnecessary and unjust. They are getting a lesson from seeing the gentlemen who so proclaimed it voting for it.</P>

      <P>I do not think I have ever heard more shamelessly political speeches on a financial matter than we have heard here to-night. Deputy Lemass and Deputy Aiken accuse us of going back on our words. We have not gone back on our words but they have gone back on the Budget that they brought in themselves.  They accuse the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party and the other Parties who are associated with the Government. Did they accuse them during the election of being extravagant in their promises?  Yes, they did.  They said that.  They said in connection with the Budget that they brought in that not one halfpenny could be taken off and yet now they are walking into the Lobby in defiance of their own words for a purely political reason.  There is <Col N="896" /> no financial probity or financial sense associated with that.</P>
      <P>We have to administer the revenues as we find them.  We have been in only two or three weeks.  We will reduce costs but what we first have to do is to reduce the extravagant set-up which has been built up here over years of Fianna Fáil administration. That cannot be done on this Budget but will be done by this side of the House as quickly as it can be done. That is what the country will listen to.  We on this side of the House have laughed at the effrontery of a Party who brought in a Budget, said it could not be reduced and now walk into the Lobby and calmly vote against their own propositions which they assured the electorate could not be reduced in any way.</P>

      <P>One of the things outstanding in the election and which was to copperfasten the promises made was the continual reference to the fact that if there were a change of Government there was going to be an end to starvation by these reductions.  If starvation is rampant, how long can they people exist; how long can they remain alive in circumstances of starvation? If it were true then and true now, then something must be done to bring down the cost of living in order to end starvation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell ought to realise that Fianna Fáil were abused throughout the whole campaign for what was called their iniquitous Budget.  It was described as an austerity Budget.  It <Col N="898" /> was stated that there was no need for austerity and that in various ways reliefs could be brought in to make it easier for the public.</P>
    <P>When we were contesting the election, we tried to advise the people not to fall for these false promises.  In the summing-up by the electorate of the position they were faced with, if the inter-Party Government could find ways and means of doing all the things they said they were going to do, then I say the public, in making their choice, were quite right.  If the inter-Party Government were to reduce taxation and bring down the cost of living, reduce the beer and spirit taxes and balance their Budget without imposing hardships in future on the people by so doing, the people would have been perfectly right in making the choice they did.  But what we are doing here is to show the public, by this effort of ours to get the inter-Party Government to do what they led the people to believe they were going to do, that they either did it or did not do it.  If we can get that shown, then the public will know whether they chose wisely or well, or whether in fact groups of Parties were bought purely for the sake of office, having sold the public down the river.</P>

      <P>I have been 21 years in this House and I always said Fianna Fáil were dishonest.  I cannot stand listening to such hypocrisy.  In 1949, they said they could not get along without putting an extra 6d. on cigarettes and so much on the pint.  We took these off in 1948.  They came back in 1951 and said that the country could not exist except they put back these penal taxes.  Where are you now?  I never saw such dishonesty.  I went into politics because I was driven into it by the farmers to fight the dishonesty of Deputy de Valera.  It is coming out now.  <i>(Interruptions.)</i> Where are some of these farmers now? Some of them have the grass growing over them as a result of what happened in 1934, 1935 and 1936.</P>

      <P>I represent the intelligent voters who were not bluffed by the manoeuvres and the leaflets with the 1/2 pint on one side and the 1/- pint on the other side.  These were shoved into every door in my constituency. On top of that, we had Deputy Morrissey down there.  What was Deputy Morrissey's reply when he was asked whether this could be done or not.  He said: &ldquo;Did we not do it in 1948?  In 1948 we removed the penal taxes on beer, cigarettes and tobacco.&rdquo; Was that a guarantee that they were going to do it again?  Certainly, it was a guarantee.  Much play has been made about the numbers in the Government Party now.  Deputy O'Malley hit the nail on the head the other day when he said it was a &ldquo;Tale of two Cities&rdquo;.  It could not be described in any other way than as a &ldquo;Tale of two Cities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the 1951 election there was a purchase price of £2,000,000, or 1/8 in the £ on the back of every ratepayer, to buy the votes of the local government officials.  In 1954, it was £1,000,000 to buy the votes of the civil servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>How many times, a Cheann Comhairle, have you and I listened to the wailing of these boys about the poor man's pint?  How many times have we seen them weeping and moaning about the poor man's pint?  How many times have they talked about the iniquitous Budget?  How many times did they walk out of the House in anger because of the burden which they said was being put on the ordinary working man by the increase in the price of the pint which they claimed was a necessity for him?  The Government were elected on certain pledges.  They gave a number of them and the only pledge which apparently they are prepared to keep is the pledge about the bribe to the civil servants.  They have forgotten the <Col N="900" /> ordinary worker and the price of his pint.  He has been put to one side and is not to be talked of.  He is out of the way now.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to restore the price of the pint to 1/&mdash;in fact, to 11d., which is better still, as they will have 1d. out of the bob now.  Now we are providing a fair opportunity for the gentleman over there who has been telling us here, doubtless on the inspired advice that he got from the Licensed Vintners' Association, about the reduction of the value of the pubs in Dublin, how the value has fallen by thousands of pounds on account of the poor man's pint.  Now we are giving those gentlemen, whose election funds were well fattened at the recent general election and at the election before it by the Licensed Vintners' Association, an opportunity to keep their word to that association and do their part now by reducing the price of the poor man's pint.</P>
      <P>It will not cost that enormous sum that Deputies think.  I had this matter out here a few months ago when we were over there on that side of the House.  The farmers have already contributed to the reduction of the poor man's pint some £2,000,000.  The breweries had authority to increase the price of the pint and when barley went up to 84/- a barrel the price of the pint was increased by 1d., with the authority of the Government.</P>

We have seen that condition of affairs.  Deputies over there are getting an opportunity now to keep their pledges.  If it was such an outrageous thing for a Government to increase the price of the pint in the last three years, or during the last six years, surely it is time for that outrage to end?  This is the manner in which they can end it.  We are doing this because we consider that there should be honesty in political life.  We do not believe that a Minister of this State should write a letter in February 1951 refusing to sanction increases in the price of barley and on the 4th May increase the price.</P>

      <P>There was £17,000,000 that you borrowed and squandered. That is part of the reason why the present Minister for Finance is endeavouring to keep this tax there to-day. When they came in, the principal and interest on public debt was £4,000,000 a year and when they went out there was a load of £10,000,000 a year.  That was the reason why those taxes had to be imposed at that time. That is the reason why every Deputy over there now has to swallow every word he said in the last six years here and crawl around to the Lobby and vote against the reduction of the price of the pint.  The burden and the load those opposite left after them has now fallen on their own shoulders and they have to carry it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry has addressed himself to this House from the point of view of our forgetting the promises we made to the people.  I want to refer to some statements made by Deputy Corry not so very long ago.  In 1947, when Fianna Fáil introduced the Supplementary Budget and imposed taxation on beer and tobacco, a by-election was fought in County Waterford.  I well remember Deputy Corry speaking during that election at Ballymacoda and Killaugh and promising the people that if Fianna Fáil won the by-election the pint would be reduced as a result of that general election.  Deputy Corry is not in a position to contradict that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it a general election or a by-election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a by-election and the Deputy with the late Mr. Ahearne went around to Ballymacoda, Inches and Killaugh.  I was there in the presence of the late Minister for Local Government, Deputy Murphy. Deputy Corry made this statement and promised the people that, if they won that by-election, immediately after the by-election the price of the pint would be reduced from 1/2d.  He did not say he would reduce it to 10d. but he said he could give a guarantee that it would be reduced to 1/-.  That is quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What exactly was the campaign of the Fianna Fáil agents in the recent general election?  I cannot be contradicted on this.  The agents of Fianna Fáil in my constituency told the old age pensioners, the infirm and the blind people not to believe the statements we were making but, rather, to believe them.  They told the old age pensioners that if they voted for those people they would lose their old age pensions or they would be drastically reduced.  Is it not far more honourable at this moment to support the present Government and to vote for them tonight&mdash;this Government which has already announced a reduction of 5d. per lb. in the price of butter on the poor man's table?  I should much prefer to consider the point of view of the housewives of this country at this <Col N="904" /> particular time than sit on the seat on which Deputy Lemass is sitting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Not alone were you dishonest during the general election campaign but you are dishonest in the policy which you are pursuing in this House to-night.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In case anybody might, for one moment, believe the figures that were given by Deputy Corry, I had better put the correct figures on the record of the House. Deputy Corry suggested that the figure for service of debt in 1948 was £4,000,000.  As a matter of fact it was £4.8 million, but that is pretty good for a person who is as inaccurate as Deputy Corry.  Then he went on to suggest that the figure for the service of debt in 1951 was £10,000,000; in fact, the figure was £7.2 million.  Furthermore, the figure for the three years in question rose by £2.4 million.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of anybody who might be foolish enough to believe Deputy Corry, let us take that and put it in juxtaposition to what occurred during the period from 1951&mdash;when Deputy de Valera took over the reins of office&mdash;to 1954, three years in which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the embarrassing position of having the policy adopted by Fianna Fáil during those three years contrasted with that of the three years of inter-Party Government. The liabilities of the State in each of the three-year periods increased by exactly the same amount&mdash;£71.9 million in one case and £72,000,000 in the other case.  These are gross figures. In our three years of inter-Party Government, the assets side of the balance sheet showed an increase of £68,000,000 but in the three years of Fianna Fáil Government the assets side showed an increase of only £57.3 million&mdash;in other words, £11,000,000 less.</P>

      <P>Sit down and take your medicine.  I was very careful not to interrupt Deputy Lemass even once. <Col N="907" /> The Deputy can put a question and he will get all the information.  I was very careful not to interrupt Deputy Lemass, except in accordance with the rules of the House, because I remember hearing Deputy Lemass say on another occasion that he never interrupted anybody.  I wanted to see if the Deputy would keep to his expression of hope if he was not prompted, so far as I was concerned.</P>
      <P>As I said on the debate on the earlier amendment, this, in fact, is sour grapes.  Deputy Lemass did say one thing that was true when he spoke on the earlier amendment, though it was not relevant to that amendment&mdash; perhaps I can deal with it now&mdash;and that is that it was not the level of prices which affected the people in the last general election.  What affected the people in the last general election &mdash;and it was not merely a question that arose in Dublin: it arose in my constituency and everywhere else&mdash;was that they knew they had been promised by Fianna Fáil in 1951 that if only Fianna Fáil were elected at that time they would get reduced prices.  The people knew that not merely had Fianna Fáil failed to keep their promise in that regard but, of their own deliberate action, increased the prices after that.  It was anger against the Fianna Fáil administration for the manner in which the people had been duped in 1951 that is responsible for those Deputies being on the other side of the House.  It was anger against the Fianna Fáil Deputies for issuing in 1951 the type of leaflet that was issued by my colleague, Deputy Harris, in Kildare in that election and for the way in which that Deputy, as other Deputies who did the same thing came along and threw their promises overboard in 1951 which had the effect of putting the Fianna Fáil Party on the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the whole course of the general election they were at pains on every possible occasion to indicate, show, shout and publish in the <i>Irish Press</i> and wherever else they could get it printed that the Fine Gael Party and leaders were promising nothing.  Now they have changed their tune and the <Col N="908" /> people see quite clearly, judging by the comments which come to me, through the shallowness, the hollowness and duplicity of the type of thing we are hearing now.</P>

      <P>I had hoped that the Minister would have answered my question.  I do not think it is fair that the Minister for Finance should, by his method of accepting the case made for the amendment, attempt to put on record further misleading figures which, if they are not questioned now, can afterwards be quoted as facts.  When the Minister was comparing the three years of Fianna Fáil Government succeeding the three years of inter-Party Government, he referred to a substantial increase in the service of debt charges.  If the Minister will not give those figures now, I will give notice that I will put down a question for a parliamentary answer which must be in accordance with the facts, asking him to state the amount of money borrowed from the Americans under Marshall Aid, the amount of money or goods they got gratuitously in their three-years' period in office, the repayment that must be made, when that began to be made and if it had, in fact, to be included in the Fianna Fáil Budget as being free in their period of office for repayment.  We can ask that.  If the Minister wants to be fair, I think he should be factual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister in his statement just now indicated that as a result of borrowing by Fianna Fáil in their three years of office, succeeding that of the three years of the inter-Party Government, the service of debt charges increased far greater than those the inter-Party Government <Col N="909" /> had brought about by their own borrowing in their time.  I say that is not correct.  That is definitely misleading, because in the service of debt charges in the succeeding three years there had to be interest payments made to the Americans in dollars as a result of the borrowings made by the inter-Party Government through the Marshall Aid Loan.</P>

Now the Minister says he has commitments without the money. I should like to know what commitments he has.  Deputy Lemass interjected that in his opinion it will not be necessary for the Minister to borrow in this financial year.  Let the Minister say whether that is so or not.  If he has to borrow, he will again add to the service of debt charges.  I should like to know what are these commitments. If the Minister will not give me those figures now, I will spend an hour this evening drafting the questions to get as comprehensive and as detailed a reply as I can on all these items.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 15 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Finance Act, 1920, as amended by Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1952 (No. 14 of 1952), shall, as and from the 1st day of October, 1954, be amended by the substitution in Part I of the First Schedule to the said Finance Act, 1920, of the matter <Col N="913" /> set out in the Fourth Schedule to this Act for the matter inserted therein by the said Section 8, and sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the said Finance Act, 1920, shall have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>(2)  The duty of excise imposed by sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Finance Act, 1920, shall, as and from the 1st day of October, 1954, be charged, levied and paid at the rate of £6 17s. the gallon (computed at proof) in lieu of the rate chargeable by virtue of sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1952.</P>
    <P>(3)  Nothing in this section shall operate to relieve from or to prejudice or affect the additional customs duties or the additional excise duty in respect of immature spirits imposed by Section 9 of the Finance Act, 1926 (No. 35 of 1926).</P>
    <P>This amendment stands in a somewhat different position from that of the others I have moved.  Is the Minister accepting it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought he might, because it is true that the increased tax on whiskey imposed in 1952 did not produce, in that financial year, the revenue anticipated.  In fact, Deputy MacEntee, as Minister for Finance, had to concede in his Budget statement of 1953 that the whiskey duty had yielded £1,500,000 less than the estimated amount.  During the course of the recent election campaign, many references to this duty were made by leading members of the present Government and particularly the Taoiseach. He certainly gave the indication that, in the interests of the revenue, the tax on whiskey would be reduced, and, in fact, I think the only speech I need make in favour of the amendment is a quotation from a speech delivered by the Taoiseach during the election, on 7th May, at Wexford and Enniscorthy.  On that occasion he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I may not be a mathematician, but I am able to add up, and I now challenge the Taoiseach to deny that the meaning of the fresh figures he <Col N="914" /> has disclosed is that, in each of the two years 1952 and 1953, the Government got an average of £50,000 a year less from the higher rate than we got when whiskey was 5d. a glass cheaper in 1951-52.</P>
    <P>In 1953-54 the Government only recovered £500,000 of the £600,000 they lost in 1952-53.  What good did that extra tax do?  The Government got less revenue; the price went up savagely to the consumer; the consumption dropped over the two years by 80,000,000 &lsquo;half-ones&rsquo;; the incomes of the publicans and distillers dropped and accordingly the income-tax they paid fell; people in public houses and distilleries lost their jobs; and it had been calculated that the farmers got from £150,000 to £200,000 less for their barley.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is such an overwhelming case for this amendment, if it is true, that I need scarcely add anything to it.  If the Taoiseach and his colleagues believe there was sense in that argument, surely they must accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's remarks, of course, must be taken as part of a picture.  I have already made it perfectly clear why the picture cannot be disturbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who tries to deal with a matter like the Budget and general financial policy in that piecemeal way will find himself very quickly in difficulties.  A matter like financial policy for a whole year should be dealt with as an entity and I regret that I cannot accept the Deputy's contention that we should take one sector and deal with it alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is asking the Chair to decide upon the validity of Deputy Costello's argument.  I will admit that if we cut income-tax, the Government would lose revenue.  They said there was a surplus in the Budget and that is why I moved my amendment in that regard.  I admit that if the tax on beer were cut, the Government would lose revenue, although there are Deputies opposite who, during the campaign, said that the tax on beer could be reduced without loss to the revenue; but it is undoubtedly the case for this amendment that, if the Taoiseach's arguments are sound, the tax on whiskey can be reduced and the Exchequer will get more money.  That cannot possibly upset the Budget&mdash; getting more money into the Exchequer. The rejection of this amendment by the Government means that they agree that the present Taoiseach, when speaking at Enniscorthy and Wexford, was talking nonsense.</P>

      <P>I want it to be noted that the purpose of this debate is to get the people to realise that the smart Alecs who went around the country promising them the sun, the moon and the stars&mdash;a reduction in beer, whiskey, cigaretes and income-tax on the nail&mdash;did so with their tongue in their cheeks.  When they said that the Fianna Fáil budgetary policy was unjust they did not believe it because if they did they would be forced now to curb the injustice; and when they said that the Fianna Fáil budgetary proposals were unnecessary they did not believe it because if they were unnecessary it would be up to them to abolish the unnecessary taxation. They did not believe it when they told the people that our proposals were unjust, unnecessary or immoral and they made these statements simply from the point of view of fooling the people.  It will be a good deal harder for them to fool the people the next time.</P>

      <P>We have been listening to two ex-Ministers wasting the time of this House with amendments, men who were in office for almost 20 years and who were the cause of the high cost of living.  Deputy Aiken did not tell Dáil Éireann that he was going to introduce a Supplementary Budget in 1947, and when the election came we went to the country and told the people we would support an inter-Party Government, and his Party were put out of office.</P>
      <P>The last election was a bread-and-butter election.  We want to see food put before whiskey because the poor people are not interested in whiskey. We welcome the announcement of the new Government in regard to the reduction in the price of butter and were it not for the request made to the Government by R.G.D.A.T.A. to give timely notice before any reduction took place, I believe the date of the reduction would have been earlier than that announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the ex-Taoiseach is sitting there with his hand on his head listening to his ex-Ministers <Col N="917" /> holding up the business of this House while people outside are waiting for some work to be started? It is regrettable that the people who were in Government so long and had increased the price of all essential commodities, should be play-acting, putting down amendments and asking a new Government who must work on their Budget to do everything overnight?</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass and Deputy Aiken will not humbug the working-class people of Ireland by their tactics here.  I have every confidence that if the inter-Party Government is given a chance the programme which they put before the people will be carried out.  In all fairness, I think the Government should be given a little time.</P>

      <P>It will not be 20 years, anyhow.  After 20 years of Fianna Fáil rule, our country is in a worse condition than ever and it will take the new Government some time to get to the straight road, towards which the ex-Taoiseach was pointing his finger, for better times and lower taxation. I heard Deputy Lemass speaking in my own town of Enniscorthy on many occasions as far back as 1932.  Fianna Fáil have forgotten all the promises they made.  The people are disgusted with the present Opposition, the Opposition who said they were going to be helpful but who, after three or four weeks, introduce amendments to reduce the price of whiskey.</P>
      <P>For whom?  For Americans?  The poor man is not interested in the bottle of whiskey.  We were glad to see the price of butter reduced and we will be twice as glad when the price of the loaf comes down because these are the necessaries of life and Deputy Lemass will not change one member of the Labour Party by his tactics.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words about this particular amendment. A very good friend of mine who happens to be a representative of a whiskey and wine merchants company came to me during the election campaign and told me that the retailers in County Mayo refused to take any orders from him because they had been specifically promised by the canvassers of the Fine Gael Party that whiskey would be reduced in price. They not only promised that but they were given the exact date on which whiskey would be reduced from 1/9 to 1/6 a half glass.  The date given to the people of South Mayo, to the people who refused to give orders to my friend, was the 10th June, 1954.  I wish to issue a challenge to the Minister for Finance on this particular point.  If he wishes me to prove the assertion I have made now I can obtain 40 letters from 40 different retailers in County Mayo who were given that specific promise, and I can refer to them during the debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>There used to be abroad in this country, a very foolish illusion that in the person of Deputy Lemass we had a clever and able politician. It was one to which many people subscribed, many people who voted against his Party.  But I am happy to see that he has dispelled that illusion in the last few days for all time.  I do not think this Dáil has seen for a <Col N="919" /> long number of years, so brazen an attempt to make political capital in a weak and futile fashion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass has moved amendments which, if put into effect would mean that the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party would be completely negatived and a complete reversal of Fianna Fáil policy would take place. Everybody knows&mdash;I hope Deputy Lemass is under no illusion about this, and certainly I think the more practical members of his Party are under no illusion about it&mdash;what Deputy Lemass is trying to do; he is trying to embarrass the present Administration. There is no sincerity whatsoever in the amendment he has put before the House.</P>

      <P>He is endeavouring to use this Parliament in order to buttress up the failing fortunes of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In the past he might have succeeded in his object but, with God's good help, he will not succeed in the next five years.  I have referred already to the chagrin evidenced by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party. To-night there has been a bit of a rally. It is obvious that this effort on the part of the deputy-Leader is to try to put some life back into the corpse that once was Fianna Fáil; there has been some slight evidence of resuscitation, but that is only of a very passing nature.  The people are not, although many slick politicians may consider them to be, political neophytes</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are not fools.  The people when they went to the polls on the last occasion voted for a change of Government. I have taken an opportunity of consulting as many of those who voted for me with whom it was possible to get into touch since the election.  I find they are very satisfied with the progress that has been made in a few weeks.  Mark you, in a few weeks! They are very satisfied with the progress towards a reduction in the cost of living.  The proposal to reduce butter by 5d. per lb. is a satisfactory one.  It is a far more important proposal <Col N="920" /> than the one we are discussing now.</P>

I understand I was the subject of some comment on the part of the deputy-Leader of the Opposition earlier this evening.  Though the question of the reduction in the pint may not be entirely irrelevant on this amendment, it has a certain relationship to it.  Deputy Lemass may not be acquainted with the gravity of that particular beverage, but I assure him it is not possible to reduce the pint with one Act.  As a Labour Party representative and as one who told the people that I stood for a reduction in the cost of living, I am satisfied this Government will reduce the cost of living; that it will reduce not alone butter, but bread, tea, sugar, tobacco, cigarettes and the workers' pint.</P>

It is very obvious that these amendments are introduced here in a fit of pique. It amazes me that we should have elected in our Parliament a group of politicians which have shown themselves to be such obviously bad losers. The people are sitting back and laughing at Deputy Lemass and the Fianna Fáil Party.  They are laughing at the idea that those now in Opposition should think that the electorate are so foolish as to believe there is one ounce of sincerity in what the Opposition is trying to do here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They know this is a political stunt and is not intended for the good of the nation in any direction.  The people are the final masters and they will eventually give their decision upon the actions of this Government and the actions of the Labour Party.  I have no doubt what their decision will be. I do not think the Opposition Deputies have any doubt either.  This is merely <Col N="921" /> a time-wasting effort on the part of a broken and beaten Party.</P>

      <P>This is what the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> reports Deputy Dunne as saying on Saturday, May 14th last:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before Labour would participate in a Government with any Party, or group of Parties, they would insist that the price of bread, butter, tea, sugar, cigarettes, tobacco and the workers' pint must be reduced, and reduced immediately.  Unless they got agreement on that point they would not take part in the formation of a Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what Deputy Dunne said in the Market Square in Navan a month ago.  We are not getting these reductions immediately.  Yet, the Deputy is quite pleased about the whole situation. I wonder is the large audience which listened to him at Navan as pleased as he is.</P>

      <P>The supporters of the Government are very bitter in this debate.  It is not at all surprising that they are so bitter because they have been found out.  They are now being exposed as the political hypocrites they are.  I listened to them at the crossroads making promises knowing that they were telling lies. They were making promises that they had not a notion of fulfilling.  They were telling the people that they were to reduce the price of the pint, the fag, the bit of tobacco and of course they always ended up by assuring the people that they would have to pay only half what they were paying then for tea, sugar and butter.  The fact that they are not fulfilling the promises they made and that they are being exposed as people who made false promises is naturally causing resentment amongst them.</P>
      <P>I suppose they thought that we were going to sit on this side of the House and forget what they said in the same way as they are now trying to forget that they fooled the electorate one short month ago.  There can be no doubt but that if they had not promised to reduce taxation and the price of stout, whiskey and cigarettes they would not have been able to form a Government.  It was these promises that swayed a small percentage of the people in their favour so that now they sit on that side of the House.  The fact that they are sitting there is because they did make false promises.  Is it any wonder that they should feel ashamed of themselves here to-night.</P>

      <P>The one difference that I see between the supporters of the Government and the Opposition is that while both sides spoke in an equally positive way on the question of subsidies and prices during the election campaign, it is quite obvious now that that has been dropped by supporters of the Government.  The eloquence with which the Government Parties advocated their programme of reductions is now being replaced merely by sound, vehemence and resentment that their promises are not being forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been asked by Deputy Lemass to accept this amendment for a very good reason, namely, that he wants more money to subsidise a reduction in the price of butter and that he wants it, as his Party and other Parties indicated during the election, to maintain schemes of national development and of public works so that employment may be continued.  It was the reference to employment that induced me to rise to my feet.  I want to tell the Minister for Finance that by the direct action of one of his Ministers people have been thrown out of their employment in my constituency within the past week.  It is all very well for Deputy O'Leary, Deputy Dunne and others to tell us that the price of butter is to be reduced by 5d. per lb., but <Col N="924" /> what about the people who have lost their weekly wage packets and are now on the dole?  Was it not better for them to have butter at 4/2 a lb. and to have their weekly wage packets than to have a reduction of a few pence in the price of butter?  These were the considerations which induced Fianna Fáil to speak as positively as they did during the election campaign.</P>
