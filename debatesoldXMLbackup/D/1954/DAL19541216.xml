    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in order to ensure continuity of employment, he will request C.I.E. to reconsider their present policy of replacing timber wagons by steel ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of wagon to be used by C.I.E. is entirely a matter for the board to whom the Deputy's representations should be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that 75 wagon makers in Limerick will at some future date become redundant and, in fact, 200 employees in all, including sawyers and labourers connected with the wagon building industry will eventually suffer due to the policy of C.I.E. in manufacturing steel wagons?  Is the Minister further aware that great waste of public money is taking place due to the policy of C.I.E. because many timber wagons are scrapped for the sake of the expenditure of some £5 or £6?  Is the Minister aware that I could cite specific cases where for the sake of 16ft. × 12ft. × 4ft. sole bars, some six to eight wagons were scrapped?  Is the Minister further aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is making a very long speech by means of questions.  I cannot allow that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained, these are all questions which should be addressed to C.I.E., which, under the relevant legislation, has the responsibility of deciding what type of wagons will be used on the system.  I may mention for the Deputy's information and to correct the erroneous impression <Col N="1836" /> under which he appears to suffer, that there is as much employment given in making steel carriages and wagons as there is in making timber ones and that far from there being a curtailment of employment in Limerick there is likely to be much more employment given by C.I.E. in the Limerick area.  If the Deputy will make further inquiries he should be in a position to confirm what I am now saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I do not agree with what he says? The chairman of C.I.E., when he was approached by representatives of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, stated that the reason steel wagons were being used at that time was because no long lengths were available for the upper structure of the wagons. Would the Minister put inquiries in hand with C.I.E. and use his good offices to have the whole question reconsidered?  In fact, we would be satisfied if, in regard to any wagons that can be reasonably repaired, that would be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware the Deputy does not agree with what I say but I am satisfied at the same time that if he makes further inquiries he will agree with what I say.  The Deputy is under a misapprehension in putting these supplementary questions because they are not based on facts or on any reasonable forecast as to what the employment position will be at Limerick with C.I.E.; neither is he aware of the fact that the employment in the building of steel wagons and coaches is as good as the employment provided in producing timber wagons or coaches.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether it is proposed to make a grant from the National Development Fund for the construction of an overhead bridge to carry the branch railway line to Castlemungret Cement Factory, Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to construct an over head bridge to carry the branch railway line to Castlemungret and the question of a grant from <Col N="1837" /> the National Development Fund for a bridge does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the quantity of native wheat required annually for the bread requirements of this country, assuming that 25 per cent, foreign wheat is used in the grist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of using 25 per cent. imported wheat in the grist, it is estimated that, at the existing rate of 80 per cent. extraction, the quantity of native wheat needed annually to meet the bread requirements in this country would be 322,000 tons of dried wheat, equivalent to 360,000 tons of green wheat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Liam Mac Cuinneagáin Liam Mac Cuinneagáin">
      <NameTxt>Liam Mac Cuinneagáin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of the serious shortage of fuel in County Donegal, and, if so, if he will make arrangements to have extra allocations of coal and/or machine-won turf made available to the fuel merchants there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in common with many other areas the fuel supply position in County Donegal has been affected by adverse weather conditions.  There is, however, no official control over the importation and distribution of fuel supplies and the securing of adequate supplies for any particular area is a matter which should be taken up through the usual trade channels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is going to treat the failure of the fuel crop in Donegal and in other areas <Col N="1838" /> of the West as an emergency just the same as the loss of other crops is about to be treated, we expect, by the Minister for Agriculture and by other Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained to the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, I heard that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there is no official, control over the importation and distribution of fuel supplies.  There are normal trade channels for securing fuel and these trade channels are available in Donegal and there is fuel available and there is turf available in Donegal from Bord na Móna.  I suggest that the Deputy should ask those who need fuel to get in touch, through the usual trade channels, with those who have fuel for sale.  If that breaks down, then we can have another look at the situation to see if it requires to be remedied.  But there is fuel there at the moment and there are trade channels available for its distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was prompted by the fact that there is almost a complete loss of the hand-won turf crop in Donegal.  I think that is going to create a situation of emergency and what I am asking the Minister to do is to treat it as such before the actual emergency sets in, either by providing or seeing that a supply of coal is made available&mdash;not free&mdash;but available for purchase&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Coal is available for purchase to-day and turf is available in Donegal.  There are traders who distribute in Donegal both coal and turf and supplies are available to them to-day.  There is no difficulty in getting either or both classes of fuel.  If, however, there should be a breakdown in the supply of fuel in Donegal or anywhere else, then we can look at the whole situation.  But both types of fuel are available to the traders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the Clashmore area, County Waterford, which includes Villierstown and Aglish, has been considered by them on a number of occasions for development under the rural electrification scheme but that it has not so far been selected as its returns have not compared favourably with those of other areas still awaiting development in the board's Waterford district.  The selection of the area will be considered again by the board but I am not in a position to state when the development of the area is likely to take place.</P>

Bills of quantities will then have to be prepared by a quantity surveyor before tenders can be invited for the erection of the schools.</P>

Is it the practice of the Land Commission to give replies which are not exactly true to Deputies when they make inquiries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The information that I have got from the Land Commission is that I understand several have been to see this estate but nobody has been selected.  As regards the question of relieving local congestion, it is always the practice, and it is the policy of the Government that all local congestion in the vicinity of a farm in any county will be relieved before land is given to any migrants.  I am sure that the Land Commission will not deviate from that policy in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Garda Síochána have controlled traffic at this bridge for about 25 years.  Some time ago, however, it was decided that as there is now very little horse-drawn traffic over the bridge and as it is extremely difficult for Gardaí at either end of the bridge to co-ordinate their signals, their presence was only slowing down traffic and that they should be withdrawn for an experimental period. Gardaí still attended at special times, though not as pointsmen, to ensure a safe crossing for children and others.</P>
      <P>In deference to the views of the Cork Corporation, the Commissioner has decided that pointsmen should be replaced at the bridge during rush hours.</P>

As regards the third part of the question I understand that the delay in presenting the report is due to the fact that the work of checking and collating the large volume of data collected on the farms covered by the investigation has proved more tedious than was anticipated by the committee. I am hopeful that the report will be furnished to me within the next few months but the Deputy will, I am sure, appreciate that having regard to the independent nature of the investigation I am not in a position to give a specific date.</P>

      <P>According to the information which I have received from the Condensed Milk Company the answers to parts (1), (2), and (3) of the Deputy's question are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  One hundred employees, comprising 76 general workers, four firemen and 20 lorry drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The rotational employment of these workers commenced on the 18th November, 1954, and during the four-week period from that date to the 15th December one half of the 100 <Col N="1844" /> workers involved have been employed during the first and third weeks and the other half during the second and fourth weeks.  For the period from 16th to 24th December the whole 100 workers will be employed full time and the factory will be closed from the evening of 24th December to the morning of the 6th January.  During the whole of the latter period the workers will receive full pay.  Rotational employment will recommence on the 6th January and, provided that there is sufficient repair and maintenance work to be done, will continue until the date of resumption of manufacture of condensed milk which normally occurs in April.</P>
    <P>(3)  The manufacture of condensed milk is not carried on during the winter months and rotational employment of workers at the factory has been in operation for many years in order to avoid having to disemploy some workers for the whole of the non-manufacturing season.</P>
    <P>As regards the final part of the question, it will be seen from my reply to part (2) of the question that the Condensed Milk Company have already arranged, as has been their normal practice, to employ these workers full time during the Christmas period.  It would not be reasonable to expect the company to employ all the workers on a full-time basis during the remainder of the slack season as the company would not have sufficient work for them to do.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state whether an allocation of £600,000 from the National Development Fund for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in County Limerick was approved on 8th April, 1954, and, if so, the amount of such allocation to be spent in the current financial year, and how, and when it is proposed to spend the balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government Information Bureau announced on 10th April, 1954, that as the beginning of a comprehensive scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, the <Col N="1845" /> Government had authorised the expenditure of moneys out of the National Development Fund on intensive eradication measures in County Limerick. So far as I can ascertain the sum mentioned by the Deputy was not specifically allocated for the purpose in the approval given by the Minister for Finance on 8th April, 1954.</P>
      <P>On further consideration and after discussion with the veterinary profession, I came to the conclusion&mdash;which I am convinced was a sound one&mdash;that it would not be practicable to initiate intensive measures at that stage in an area such as County Limerick.  I therefore arranged that general eradication measures would be applied in County Limerick and that intensive measures would at the outset be applied in County Sligo and County Clare, and also in an area surrounding the parish of Bansha, County Tipperary, where much eradication work had already been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any undue delay in the hearing of appeals in Limerick City.  The employment exchange at Limerick is visited at regular intervals by appeals officers and I do not think that it would be practicable, as the Deputy suggests, to have an appeals officer appointed specially for Limerick since there might be weeks with no appeals or a very small number to be heard.  The Deputy will also appreciate that in arranging a sitting for the hearing of appeals reasonable notice must be given to the appellants to enable them to attend and also to the assessors who sit with the appeals officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Limerick City would be an ideal centre or location for the vast area around?  Is he further aware that these notices to people who are drawing unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance as to whether or not <Col N="1847" /> they are genuinely seeking work are issued solely in most cases to justify the employment of the individuals who send out such notices?  Is the Minister further aware that there are cases&mdash; I can furnish him with particulars&mdash; where individuals are waiting from six to seven weeks?  It is not a fact that appeals are heard every three weeks, and the present position is most unfair. Is the Minister further aware that some months ago he promised on the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare to do something about this anomaly, an anomaly which he admits exists?</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied that the appointment of a special appeals officer for Limerick would be warranted. I do not think the Deputy is correct in saying that there have been delays of six to seven weeks in the hearing of appeals because the evidence I have is that on an average there have been two sittings per month in Limerick City.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state what proposals have been received in his Department for the erection of labourers' cottages in County Louth, and if he will indicate generally the reasons for the delay in dealing with these proposals, and, in particular, those which concern the area of Dunleer, County Louth.</P>

      <P>Proposals received in the Department on 23rd March, 1954, from Louth County Council to accept tenders for the erection of 112 labourers' cottages were approved on 14th April, 1954.  Two hundred and seventy four tenders were involved and the Deputy will observe that they were dealt with expeditiously in the Department. No proposal for the erection of further labourers' cottages in County Louth has since been submitted for my consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1852" /> I understand that the county council are at present negotiating for the purchase of a site at Dunleer on which to erect a group of eight cottages.  Further progress in this area depends on the availability of a suitable site.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1853" /> I am not aware of difficulty in securing medical attention at night in Cork City and consequently the remainder of the question does not arise.  In any event, however, I have no functions in this matter except in regard to persons to whom Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, applies, that is persons who are unable by their own industry or other lawful means to provide such services for themselves and their dependents.  There has been no change in the arrangement under which the services of district medical officers are available to such persons at any time, day or night, as needed.</P>

In view of that, would the Minister undertake to take the matter up with the I.M.A.?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The maternity cash grant is payable by the appropriate local authority under Section 23 of the Health Act, 1953, to women in the lower income group who are <Col N="1855" /> entitled to the services made available under Section 14 of the Act, i.e., women who are, or who are the dependents of, persons unable to provide by their own industry or other lawful means the medical or surgical treatment necessary for themselves or their dependents.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not authorised, under the Health Acts or otherwise, to prescribe a scale of income for the purpose of determining eligibility for the grant.  Eligibility is a matter entirely for the local authority having regard to the circumstances of the individual applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickPGogan" hpid="Mr. Gogan Mr. Gogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if the Minister is aware that great dissatisfaction exists in regard to the present system of deciding eligibility for maternity grants on the basis of family means during the week of confinement? Further might I ask the Minister is he prepared to make representations to the local authorities to see that cognisance is taken of periods of unemployment recent to the date of application as far as the bread-winner is concerned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising out of the reply, I wonder would the Minister make available particulars of the different schemes adopted by local authorities in the administration of these grants?  Each local authority has a scheme of its own apparently and it would be helpful to Deputies to know how the different schemes are operated in relation to the means test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to that supplementary question, the position is that under the law no local authority has any right to deal with the payment of these cash grants or to provide for services under the Health Act on any rule of thumb or any scale.  In fact, in a circular of 27th April, 1954, sent out at the direction of my predecessor it was suggested to local authorities that the scale adopted by the county manager in Westmeath might be a useful <Col N="1856" /> guide in the administration of these services elsewhere in the country.  Following that circular, apparently, the local authorities did adopt such a scale. I am satisfied that a rigid adherence to such scales works injustice in many respects and I have, accordingly, taken steps to ensure that local authorities will regard all these cases in accordance with the individual merits of each case and not otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 24 of the Health Act, 1953, health authorities may arrange for the supply of milk to expectant and nursing mothers who are entitled to the services provided for in Section 14 of that Act and to children under five years whose parents are unable from their own resources to provide such children with an adequate supply of milk.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £4,400 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for contribution to the Council of Europe and the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation and towards certain projects of the United Nations Organisation; and for other expenses in connection therewith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I introduced this Vote on the 16th June last, I mentioned that it would be necessary later in the year to take a Supplementary Estimate for the payment of a contribution of £5,000 towards the technical assistance programme of the United Nations.  I explained that a commitment had been entered into with the United Nations for payment of the contribution and that provision for the contribution had been made in the Estimate as <Col N="1862" /> originally drafted but had been inadvertently struck out when the Estimates were being printed.</P>
    <P>In order to meet the commitment to the United Nations it becomes necessary to pay this sum of £5,000 now.</P>
    <P>Since then savings to the extent of £600 are now expected to accrue under other sub-heads of this Vote.  It has, therefore, been possible to reduce the sum required by that amount so that the amount of the Supplementary Estimate which the Dáil is now being asked to grant is £4,400.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1955, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture including certain services administered by that office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose is to enable me to make grants towards expenditure incurred by an organisation to be established to alleviate distress caused by abnormal flooding of the Shannon area.  A payment out of the grant will be made subject to conditions to be laid down by me with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Before proceeding any further I consider it my duty to say that I visited the flooded areas on two occasions and I have been deeply impressed by the manner in which the farmers in these areas are <Col N="1863" /> standing up to their difficulties.  Really when you do visit people in distress such as the people in the Shannon area have been labouring under since last October you would not be in the least surprised to find them querulous and very short and I am glad to be able to boast that no such spirit prevails in that particular part of the country.</P>
    <P>When it was my privilege to meet them during my visits some of them had actually been displaced from their homes and were the guests of our Army in the camp at Carnagh, near Kiltoon. When I sought to talk to them of their distress their primary concern was to sing the praises of the Army and all the Army had done and were still doing for them.  We cannot blind our eyes to the real suffering through which they have gone and are going and I know that the House will be sympathetic with those people who have been suffering from flooding since last October.  They have managed to struggle along with wonderful resource and admirable perseverance through all the reverses which they have faced and with which some of them still have to contend.</P>
    <P>I recall the bad weather throughout the year, the great difficulty of harvesting, the difficulty in cutting and drying turf, and it is no small testimonial to the ability of our farmers that they have been able so successfully thus far to meet the damage caused by the abnormal flooding in the Shannon Basin this year.  I had been keeping careful observation on the effects of the rainy weather throughout the country and was impressed by the relative freedom from losses of any magnitude up to the end of November.  It has been a record year as far as flooding on the Shannon is concerned.  I think it is true to say that the floods in the Shannon area have reached record proportions, even going back to the 1800s. In November the flood gauge at Athlone stood at 16 feet 9 inches.  That was the highest recording since 1925 when it stood at 17 feet 1 inch and that was before the Shannon scheme came into operation.  The estimate which I have caused to be made of the damage sustained by farmers up to the <Col N="1864" /> end of November has, of course, been completely nullified by the disastrous rains of this month and particularly by the two inch downpour which occurred on the 8th December.  Since the 8th December the Shannon floods have gone slightly above the 1925 level.</P>
    <P>So far as our information goes up to the present about 50 square miles in the area of which Athlone is the centre have been affected by flooding.  It is estimated that, so far, about 1,880 farms have been affected to some degree by flooding.  These farms lie in an area stretching from Swanlinbar in Cavan to County Clare.  It is further testimony of the ability and common sense of the farmers affected that virtually no live-stock losses have occurred.</P>
    <P>We have evacuated some 150 head of cattle and have installed them on high ground in the possession of the Army or the Land Commission or neighbouring farmers.  There is, of course, a great number of cattle still on flooded lands but these are being tended under improvised arrangements and fed with fodder very largely by their owners.  In many cases floors of stables and out-buildings which had become flooded have been raised by planks and other material supplied by the Army authorities.  Many isolated farms still have their own fodder and boats have been provided to enable other farmers to get from place to place and to bring fodder to their live stock.  The tenacity with which these people cling to their holdings is most impressive and praiseworthy.</P>
    <P>It has been found necessary to evacuate about 50 families and these are accommodated in quarters provided by the Army or by neighbours.</P>
    <P>Good neighbours in many cases also have made land available to which marooned cattle are being moved.  C.I.E. are making available supplies of old sleepers which will assist the people in lifting their live stock above the water level.  It is necessary to lift the live stock to the higher ground which is still available for those who wish to avail of it.  The Army is ready to remove all cattle to unflooded land.  We are taking fodder by boat and in some cases where we <Col N="1865" /> had evacuated the farms we are taking the menfolk back by boat when the necessity arises, to attend their stock.</P>
    <P>I think the House would wish to know that under the various headings of relief a great lot of the responsibility fell on Colonel Collins-Powell and I cannot pay too high a tribute to the success achieved through his work in helping the people.  Under his direction we now have five or six travelling units moving over the flood area in Army lorries equipped to pass through any flood that exists on the roads.  All these units are accompanied by a technical officer of my Department qualified to give the appropriate advice and counsel and in addition to this we have now sent a veterinary officer to the area who will complete a survey of all the live stock in the flooded holdings with a view to providing curative and preventive treatment for any cattle which have passed through and are still passing through the ordeal of the floods.  The most important thing we have to think about at the moment is fodder for animals because fortunately we have been able to make adequate provision for a great many of the people affected.  We must not go a step beyond and force people to leave their holdings against their will when it is perfectly clear that they have prudence and a right to decide for themselves what is best to do.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the only immediate outstanding problem which is causing us some little anxiety is the provision of fodder for live stock and to meet that I have sent an initial supply from the agricultural school at Athenry.  Of course, that is not going to provide for a very long period.  Still out of evil there often comes good because I think I am now in a position to report something to the House which restores one's faith in human nature.  In many cases crude advantage might be taken of the fact that people were in dire need and proportionate attempts would be made to keep famine prices for fodder which it was known was urgently required to relieve the great <Col N="1866" /> difficulties with which we have to contend. Far from that happening I should like to express publicly the thanks of the Government&mdash;and I feel sure I speak for the Oireachtas&mdash;to one farmer in North County Dublin, Mr. Bergin of Ballyboughal who without any request from anybody loaded his lorry with hay, drove it down to Custume Barracks, dumped the hay there and said: &ldquo;Use that now for the relief of those people who are short of fodder&rdquo;, turned his lorry and drove back to Dublin.  If we had a few more people of that kind in this country&mdash; and I do not doubt we have&mdash;we need have no fear of people being able to meet emergencies of this kind out of our own resources.</P>
    <P>Might I suggest to Macra na Feirme and to other agricultural organisations such as that, that if they would care to make an effective gesture of solidarity amongst farmers in this country that no more edifying opportunity could present itself than that the branches of agricultural organisations should ask their members to make some token contribution of fodder for the relief of farmers in distress in the Athlone area, and if they will assemble and deliver it to Custume Barracks it will be used to assist those who badly need assistance?  If they are not able to provide transport to bring it to Custume Barracks themselves, if they will gather it at any point, we will gladly arrange transport to go and collect it.</P>
    <P>I need hardly tell the House that if voluntary effort makes no contribution, an event which I do not care to contemplate, then the Government has charged me to see that fodder will be provided from some other source.  But I think it would be something of which we would all feel proud if in that one particular, the farmers of this country would make a gesture of solidarity by placing at our disposal such fodder as may be required to get these poor people over the next couple of months while difficulty continues.</P>
    <P>It is not possible in the present state of the floods to estimate with any degree of accuracy the amount of actual distress that these floods are going to leave after them and so I cannot tell the House what measure of <Col N="1867" /> assistance will effectively relieve the distress.  But I do propose that I should appoint a committee comprising Colonel Seán Collins-Powell as chairman, the chief agricultural officers or the secretaries of the county committees of agriculture, as the case may be, of the adjoining counties, the county managers of the adjoining counties and an inspector of my Department to certify sums proper to be paid out of issues from the Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>At present I think the counties most affected are Longford, Westmeath, Offaly, Galway and Roscommon.  The chief agricultural officers of these counties have their fingers on the situation in every part of their counties and they would be, in my opinion, of the utmost value in alleviating immediate distress.  The county managers of these counties would also be of inestimable value in the disposal of home assistance and such other forms of relief as may be found possible and would be of great value as members of the committee.  I am aware that other counties have been affected by the flooding in the Shannon area, and I think that if any question of assistance for the victims in these counties arises it should be disposed of by the central committee in Athlone which I propose to set up, and that that committee should have liberty to call to their deliberations on any occasion on which they find it necessary to do so the chief agricultural officer and the county manager of another county, but for the present I think it most desirable to keep the committee as small as possible.</P>
    <P>The immediate work, as I have said, of this committee will be to relieve as far as possible the distress which exists in the district and to ameliorate the condition of live stock in the area. No more can be attempted at present. When the floods recede it will be possible to carry out a systematic survey of the flooded lands and to estimate the extent of the damage which has been incurred.  When that can be done, and I hope it may be possible to undertake it soon, different considerations will prevail, and I hope to have the advice of the committee which I propose <Col N="1868" /> to set up in dealing with that problem also.  There will also remain the offer which I made and the arrangements which were put in train some months ago to grant loans, free of interest, to farmers in this area to enable them to restock their land and to make good losses of fodder and fuel.</P>
    <P>Here I think it is my duty to refer to one rather regrettable feature of these events.  We have been&mdash;and I am sure Deputies would wish us to be&mdash;earnestly concerned to carry the people through these distresses with the minimum of upset to them. Naturally there is much solicitude on the part of people in that area lest their live stock should be lost or irretrievable damage be done.  I am able to report to the House that, so far as we know, no live stock has been lost and yet in the middle of our most difficult period an Irish newspaper publishes a report that one of its correspondents has seen the carcases of cattle floating down the Shannon.  I need hardly tell you that the publication of such a report in the area causes the utmost possible concern and confusion and it took us two or three days to restore confidence and persuade the people that nothing of the kind happened, that nobody had the slightest intention of allowing such a thing to happen, and that for long before any such catastrophe could conceivably mature, abundant resources were mobilised in the area to go out and take the cattle out.  In fact we kept every holding under review; in some cases we went in with boats and swam the cattle out.  If that had proved impossible, we were prepared to go in with boats or lorries to take them out.  It does add greatly to the difficulty of maintaining the people's morale and getting the job effectively done if irresponsible people publish wild and false rumours in the newspapers because it sets up at once a very natural apprehension and people who have so far been full of confidence that everything is under control begin to get worried and you might easily get thrown upon you suddenly an unnecessary burden which would break down the organisation which was working quite smoothly if the people were only left alone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1869" /> A further consideration which you must take into account is what permanent improvement can be effected in the Shannon area.  I am bound to tell the House now, as I told the people whenever I went to visit them in the area, that it is my opinion and it is not without authoritative backing, that it would take an altogether disproportionate sum to attempt to embank the Shannon for the purpose of retaining that river in its summer bed.  The plain truth is the Shannon is a river which has a summer and winter bed.  If you wanted to keep the Shannon, summer and winter in its summer bed, the only way to do it is to erect long embankments over a large part of the river, and it has to be borne in mind that when those embankments have been erected at immense cost, that that is only the beginning of the story.  They must be maintained year in, year out, flood or no flood, and you have always got to bear in mind that as the British people discovered on the east coast of England, as the Dutch discovered in their experience erecting sea dykes that no matter what margin of safety is left on the embankment, something utterly unforeseen may turn up in some particular year; then one breach in the embankment and you are back in a much worse position than you were before the embankments were built at all.</P>
    <P>If you build long embankments in an area like that, embankments which are effective to restrain a river in spate and you get a breach through which the river passes out into the country it becomes phenomenally difficult to drain the water back into the river off the flooded country because you have only got a narrow gap through which to let the water flow back again.  If the water flows out in spate it may flow into hollow areas or areas where there are hills and hollows in the flooded country from which there is no natural drainage back, because it has been closed off by the high embankments. Therefore I am not going to hold out to these people, even in this hour of extreme distress, the prospect that this or any Government can be reasonably expected to retain this <Col N="1870" /> river within its summer bed year in year out.  Nevertheless we will look at it again though it has been looked at many times before.</P>
    <P>It is true that there are certain sand bars in the river&mdash;and here is a queer kind of thing that can happen.  When I was in Athlone many people came to me obviously in good faith and said: &ldquo;Minister, if they would only open the Meelick weir it would relieve the flooding.  Why will they not open it?&rdquo; I must confess that as I was going through land on which there was a foot of water, the thought that a weir being closed affecting these floods filled me with amazement.  And some people said to me: &ldquo;If you did open these sluice gates it would make no difference.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;For heaven's sake, do not ask me to go into the house of a person who has a foot of water on the floor and argue about hydrostatics. If there are sluice gates closed and they can be opened let us have them opened even if it does no good.  At any rate it can do no harm.&rdquo; Then I came steaming back to town feeling that some misguided individual was insisting on keeping the sluice gates at Meelick closed while there was a foot of water in the flooded country.  I was then told, on the 8th December, that the Meelick sluice gates were opened early last October and were never shut since, and so it proved to be.  But I have great sympathy with the people because I began to get hot under the collar myself and I could understand how these people were becoming exasperated at the thought that these sluice gates were closed and holding back the floods. Actually they had been opened long before the floods had arisen at all.</P>
    <P>I am told by the engineers&mdash;and God knows the engineers of the Board of Work and the E.S.B. are just as anxious as anybody else to avert the kind of floods we have in Athlone at the present time&mdash;that the Meelick sluice gates have no conceivable connection with the type of floods we are dealing with now.  You can control the flooding in the Shannon when the Shannon is flowing at its normal depth. You can raise it or lower it by a couple of feet by manipulation of these sluice gates but when you are talking of the <Col N="1871" /> kind of floods we have now the sluice gates have no effect.  But whether they have or not, they have been opened since the month of October and have never been closed and they will not be closed until every trace of flood has disappeared from the whole area.</P>
    <P>The last thing I have to say is this: that my colleague, the Minister for Lands, is already in a position to make this offer to all farmers in these flooded areas&mdash;if they want to migrate out of these flooded areas they will get an exchange of holding in an area where no floods take place.  I do not think anything fairer than that can be done, but I want to remind this House that neither this nor any other Government will go to the people who have had their home in this area for generations and say: &ldquo;We are sick of your worries and troubles; you will have to come out of this.&rdquo;  Certainly I would not be party to that, but I do think we ought to put within reach of farmers who have experienced distress this year and for many years past in the callow lands of the Shannon the opportunity, if they are tired of that kind of life, to move out.  I think you will find that a great many will reply that they do not want to go.  That may be difficult for Deputies in this House to understand.</P>
    <P>I do not think it will be difficult for some of the other Deputies to understand. In the country we get very attached to our homes and if we have to suffer inconveniences at times in order to stay in our own homes we work out ways of getting over them. Even if we have to ask a neighbour to take us in and put us up for a night or two in an exceptional year we know that the neighbours will understand and we will find ways of returning thanks in our own time.  I quite agree it is right and prudent that we control all our resources and say to these people: &ldquo;If you want to go, an alternative place will be found for you and the Land Commission will take over your holding and will give you as good a holding elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

      <P>There is a golden rule when you are faced with a problem large enough to tax the capacity of the teeth to bite on it that it is better to bite on that problem and then move on to the larger one when you have mastered the problem which you are first grappling with.  I am now dealing with the Shannon valley and I am not extending to Deputies on behalf of the Minister for Lands a general invitation to the farmers of this country to institute a general exodus all over Ireland because great as are the resources and powerful as is the energy of the present Minister for Lands I do not think he could stimulate the Land Commission into facilitating that operation all at one time. I think the Minister for Lands, on the direction of this Government, rightly resolved that for the moment we will concentrate our resources of the Land Commission on the floods in the Shannon valley and say to the people whose homesteads have been subjected to abnormal floods in this crisis: &ldquo;We are now offering you alternative holdings to which you are free to go.  If you elect to go we will make good our offer and if you choose to stay there is no hard feeling&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Doubtless I have failed to deal with some aspects of this problem in the Shannon valley on which Deputies will want further information.  My colleague, the Minister for Local Government, knows a great deal more about the problem involved in the case of the Tolka but I feel bound to say this on behalf of my friends in the country&mdash;we have been grappling with floods now from October down to to-day and we have every prospect of living with them for another two months until they are gone and it is a source of consolation to us that the people in the Tolka area experienced the floods for only 48 hours.  We only wish that our experience had been as abbreviated as theirs has been.  We know that we have the sympathy and condolence of the residents of the City of Dublin and on behalf of those who are suffering in the Shannon valley I offer sympathy and condolence to those who also suffered from floods in the North Strand.  I am happy in <Col N="1873" /> conclusion to think that the resources of our own country and our own people are equal to this emergency and equal to relieving whatever distress has been caused by it.  I ask Dáil Eireann with every confidence to give this Government such authority as it may require financially to deal with these distresses and effectively to alleviate them.</P>

In the event of farmers from the flooded areas of the Shannon Valley accepting transfers, what does the Government propose to do with the land?  Is it proposed to let other farmers into these houses, as has been the practice in the ordinary transfers from congested districts where the lands are not subject to flooding?</P>

I do not know if the Deputy suggests this should be declared a black spot in which no human creature should ever live again.  I do not take such a dramatic view about it at all.  I think if anybody wants to go and take callow land to live on, and take the rough with the smooth, I would not say: &ldquo;No. Sorry, it is not good for you.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>Unlike the area with which my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture has to deal, this disaster came upon the people of the North Strand overnight. Down in the country the floods rose gradually but, as a result of the collapse of a railway bridge over the Tolka, portions of Dublin City became flooded overnight.  The people had very little opportunity of preparing against it.  They had no opportunity of seeking relief, and it is a tribute to the organisations to which I have referred that they were able to come to the assistance of those people in such a very short time.  Fortunately the emergency that occurred in that area lasted very, <Col N="1875" /> very shortly, and at the moment that particular emergency&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; for want of a better word&mdash;has ceased.  I think it is only right that we should pay tribute to our fellow-citizens whose lands and homes have been flooded down through the years, be they either in the Finn Valley of Donegal, the Barrow Valley or in some part of Galway or Mayo, who have never yet sought aid in the distress which Providence has inflicted on them; with those, too, we have sympathy.</P>
    <P>We have reason to think that the recent flooding which has occurred is not just the ordinary flooding that occurs from year to year and it is because of that that we are moving these Estimates here.  The House will appreciate that we do not want to see any of our people impoverished as a result of circumstances over which they have no control and anything we can do to relieve the distress in which they now find themselves we are only too anxious to do.  As I am not moving the actual Estimates I am curtailed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I know the House is anxious that we should do all we possibly can for these people.

The extent of the individual losses varies in degree.  The damage to roads and other public services has not yet been estimated.  We have already expressed our profound sympathy with the people who have found themselves in such distress. Further than that, I am not in a position to give details to the House.

      <P>We join with the Ministers and the Government in expressing our very deep sympathy <Col N="1877" /> with those who have suffered loss or hardship as a result of the recent flooding.  We sympathise also with the Government in having to face a problem of this sort.  The difficulty for the Government is, of course, that they are anxious not to create precedents which might possibly be abused and they are also anxious to ensure that any relief given is equitably distributed. Now, the entire problem is one of proper administration.  We understand, of course, that the Government cannot at this moment form any just estimate of the total sum of money that will be required.  Therefore, we understand why they should use this device of a token Vote.  When one has to deal with disasters of this sort there are two things obviously to be done. The first is that some organisation or organisations should be set up to deal with the immediate rescue work and to provide the necessary food, clothing and shelter for those who are displaced and have to leave their homes. Then there is the second problem of how to give compensation for the more permanent losses that are sustained on such occasions.  My own view, when I saw this disaster occurring, was that the Red Cross should be equipped immediately to deal with the first problem, that is the urgent problem of rescue work, getting first aid from many State services such as the Army, etc., and that the necessary funds should be made available or voted in this House by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second problem of how to deal with the permanent losses is much more difficult.  What form of organisation can be set up that will give relief equitably?  The Minister has indicated that a committee will be set up but what directions will he give it?  He has not indicated the directives that are to be given to that committee.  They will have to act on directives.  I do not think that anybody will find fault with the constitution of the committee but we have been given no idea&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister himself or Ministers collectively have any idea&mdash; as to the type of directive he will give. Is he going to leave the matter completely at the discretion of the committee to say: &ldquo;We shall compensate <Col N="1878" /> in full those who have suffered,&rdquo; or is he going to give directives of a less extensive kind?</P>
    <P>The trouble of estimation is very great in these cases.  Consequently it is a matter really of directives and of a proper administrative body after that.  I am putting myself in the position in which I would be if I were a member of the Government and I do not think it is possible to do very much more at the moment than the Government has done in setting up an organisation to deal with the matter.  I am surprised that the Minister for Local Government has not some idea as to how he proposes to administer the funds that will be available for relief. I daresay the idea would be to make provision for the replacement of such furniture as had been destroyed and for other losses of that kind, but how far will you go in the way of considering consequential losses?  It would be helpful if we knew the form of organisation intended by the Minister for Local Government.  It appears he has not made up his own mind on that.  The matter with which we are most concerned is the equitable distribution of compensation so that the losses and the needs of the people will be promptly taken into account and so that, as between one citizen and another who has suffered loss, there will be no discrimination.</P>
    <P>Besides the two areas of the Shannon and the Tolka we have all over the country problems for the individual.  A number of individuals are collected together in areas like the Shannon and the Tolka and the total loss makes an impression on everybody but individuals in other parts of the country have suffered as much perhaps as individuals in the case of the Shannon and the Tolka and the Government may be sure that there will be pressure to try to have these cases taken into account also.  Whether the Government proposes to do that I do not know.  It is all right for the Minister for Agriculture to say: &ldquo;Let us deal with the immediate problem and deal with it properly.&rdquo;  I think we all agree with that but still, as regards the funds to relieve those who have suffered very severe losses due to the <Col N="1879" /> altogether exceptional weather and the exceptional flooding in other cases, the same problem arises in many isolated districts.</P>
    <P>You might say: &ldquo;We shall deal only with the widespread destruction that occurred in a certain area.&rdquo;  I am afraid you will not be able to stand on that.  When the Government comes in with community aid to assist individuals who are in groups in the Shannon area or the Tolka area, they will find that they cannot resist the pressure that will be brought to bear on them to deal with individual cases in other parts of the country.  One of my colleagues, I see, stood up to raise a matter of that sort and the Minister for Agriculture replied that it was a wise thing if you have a problem to start tackling it and to try to do that well.  In this case, the Government, I am afraid, will have to widen the scope of this relief and consider a number of other cases throughout the country. We, of course, are supporting the Government in providing this fund.  We sympathise with them in having to deal with such a problem and we sympathise also with all the victims.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to congratulate the Government in coming to the assistance of people who have met with great losses in the recent heavy flooding. My sympathy, and I suppose the sympathy of the whole House, goes out to all these people who had to leave their homes as well as to people whose live stock has suffered enormously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed that the Minister for Agriculture has confined his investigations to the Shannon area.  I live in an area where 17 families have had to evacuate their houses.  That has not happened to-day or yesterday.  In some cases it happened early in October.  As far back as the 17th November I asked the Minister for Lands what he was prepared to do to assist those whose homes were flooded and if he would direct the Land Commission to carry out a survey.  I cannot understand why only the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government have come into this problem.  I know the Shannon area well, and the people there have my <Col N="1880" /> whole-hearted sympathy but the problem that exists along the Shannon is not one of to-day or yesterday.  It is a very old problem.  It could be described as a hardy annual.  The people there have been driven from their homes year after year.</P>
    <P>The same applies along the Suck. Within a stone's throw of my home there are roughly about 2,000 acres of land that at the present moment resembles a huge lake.  I have travelled over that area a few times since the flooding started.  Because the Government had promised to bring in the Estimates I took the precaution of making a tour of the whole area during the last couple of days.  The papers may give their estimates but I can stand over this one, that 17 families are out of their homes; they are on the high road.  One family still reside in a two storey house where there is two feet of water underneath.  In one thatched cottage only about a foot of the top of the chimney can be seen. In another house the walls are burst to pieces.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Agriculture does he think that the Red Cross are the proper people to deal with these families?  These are some of the best small farmers in Ireland.  Yesterday I visited a farmyard where there were seven stacks of corn in the haggard which had been brought in the perfect condition.  Each stack was thatched, as is the custom in the West of Ireland, down to the eave.  There were four cocks of hay, each containing about five ton, with the water to the eave.  There was a huge pit of potatoes and there were turnips, mangolds and cereal crops in that haggard.  The pit of potatoes was completely submerged. In one house the water was more than one foot higher than the lower limit of the thatch.  These people are not looking for sympathy.  They are looking to see in what way a home can be provided for them.</P>
    <P>There is another problem.  The stock owned by these people has been housed for the last two months.  The stock had to be let out.  Their lands are flooded.  The stock is now wandering around the road.  Does the Minister think that the Red Cross will be able to deal with this problem?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1881" /> During the course of his opening statement I asked him if the question of migration applied only to the Shannon area.  We heard his reply&mdash; deal with the big problems first.  This is as big a problem as any in the Shannon area, but because Ministers had not thought it worth their while to see it for themselves, because even the Parliamentary Secretary who lives in the area has not come down to see it for himself, it does not appear a big problem.</P>

      <P>The question should be taken up by the Office of Public Works to see what can be done by way of drainage there.  I want the Minister to ask the Office of Public Works to investigate the area immediately.  In other areas the people had to tear up a gullet across the road and widen it. I would be anxious that the Minister for Lands should introduce here tomorrow morning another token Estimate to deal with this very urgent problem.  I want to go as far as I can in forcing the hands of the Land Commission <Col N="1882" /> to deal with the whole question, not merely of the Shannon but of every flooded area immediately.  I can bring them to a number of houses to-morrow morning which when the flood disappears will be flattened out. There is no place for the families concerned to go.  Their friends have been good enough to take them in for the moment.</P>

      <P>But even the Minister might not be prepared to take on a little job like that for all time.  Immediate relief must be given to these people.  Every help should be given to the people along the Shannon but I also want to insist that the Minister should face the problem of the Belclare and Caherlistrane drainage immediately and that the Land Commission be asked to see what can be done there.</P>
      <P>I am not exaggerating when I say that the problem there is equally as bad as it is in any part of the Shannon. In some cases one can see only the chimney of a house, which gives a good idea of what the position is like.</P>
      <P>The problem is very serious and should be faced up to immediately. I suggest that engineers from the Office of Public Works and the Land Commission should go there without undue delay and carry out a thorough investigation and see what relief can be afforded immediately and to house the people as early as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with every other Deputy I realise there is a problem facing us in this country from the point of view of flooding from time to time, but this token Estimate is on the basis of the very serious problem in two areas.  I am concerned mainly with the area with which I am familiar, the area of the Tolka Valley and the results of the unprecedented flooding there.  Deputies familiar with the position in the Shannon area are more than capable of outlining <Col N="1883" /> the difficulties there.  I would submit to the House that there is a great deal of difference between the Shannon and the Tolka on this particular occasion.  I think that never before, in history or in the memory of living man, has a flood taken place in the Tolka area as occurred on this occasion and Deputies will be aware that the Minister has told them that 1,500 houses were affected by this flooding.  In an area not much more than one mile long, by less than half or maybe a quarter of a mile wide, approximately 2,000 families have been affected to a greater or lesser extent.  In addition to that it was estimated that some 400 families had to be evacuated from their homes within a period of hours.</P>
      <P>This was no flooding.  It was a river rising gradually and watchers could see the extent of this expansion growing, growing.  This was a flood from which men, women and children were called upon at a moment's notice to get out of their beds and in many cases be taken out of the windows of their homes without getting an opportunity of putting any proper clothes on them. Deputies in this House and particularly Deputies from the area affected cannot speak too highly of the rescue work and of the assistance given by members of the voluntary organisations such as the Red Cross, the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the Knights of Malta and from our own municipal undertakings like the Fire Brigade and, of course, the organisations of the State the Garda&mdash;and the Army&mdash;on that Wednesday night and early Thursday morning.  Nobody in this House or outside it can realise fully the efforts made by the neighbours of those people affected and it is no exaggeration to say that in many cases the efforts of the rescuers saved a definite loss of life.  It is regretted that one poor old lady lost her life but it is due to the efforts of the rescuers working on that first night that many more lives were saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem, as I understand it, which is now before the House, is that the Minister is seeking powers&mdash;a token Estimate&mdash;for the purpose of relieving distress.  I am sure it will <Col N="1884" /> get the support of every Deputy, but we would be all anxious to know what that term &ldquo;relieving distress&rdquo; means. To get some idea of what the term may mean we would first of all have to have a picture of what has happened in the individual homes.  As I already stated with only an hour's notice in many cases people had to evacuate.  Families, large and small, had to be taken out at short notice.  Many of those families, particularly in this area of the North Strand, Ballybough Road and Richmond Road, resided in accommodations which are semi-basement and when they were evacuated the flood water took possession and in many cases the result was that every personal possession&mdash;clothing, the footwear, the bedding, the blankets, the furniture&mdash;all the personal belongings were ruined beyond any hope of actual replacement.</P>
    <P>Most of the families in these areas were people who have to rely on their ordinary weekly wage or fortnightly income or monthly salary.  Not very many of them are very well endowed with the world's goods and when they have seen the furniture, accumulated by hard work and prudence and savings over the year, and in some cases obtained through the system now so familiar to all of us; ruined completely within a matter of hours, you can get some picture of the position.  The emergency is not over yet.  It is correct to state that it has been found possible to hand over the relief of the urgent cases from the Red Cross and from the St. John Ambulance Brigade to the Dublin Board of Assistance, but to-day there are still something between 80 and 100 people in the central model schools being cared for by the Red Cross, and even at this present moment I think we have a number of people who cannot yet return to their homes, being compelled to stay with friends and relatives in other parts of the city.</P>
    <P>The cause of the flooding is not a matter on which I can give any views, but the Minister in his opening remarks referred to the fact that the collapse of the railway bridge over the Tolka resulted in the flooding of a considerable portion of the Tolka Valley. Whether the authority who control <Col N="1885" /> that bridge can be made to accept some responsibility for the result of this collapse I do not know.  What I am mostly concerned with is that even at the present moment there are hundreds of families in dire need of assistance. There are hundreds of families who have lost everything and who, up to the present moment, have been supplied with only the most urgent necessities&mdash;one or two garments, some bedclothes and bedding.  Consequently I, personally, would like to get a clear indication from the Minister, in replying to the discussion, as to what are the actual proposals, not the total sum of money that may be made available&mdash; that is too much to expect&mdash;not even the amounts that have been made available individually, but I would like to be informed by the Minister whether it is the Government's intention, in dealing with this Grant-in-Aid, to ensure that the people affected by the unprecedented flooding shall be afforded such assistance as will replace the losses suffered by them.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of providing housing accommodation. Deputies may have seen announced from time to time in the Press that up to 200 dwellings can be made available if required by the local authority, Dublin Corporation.  But aside from the accommodation of people whose houses are condemned as being unfit to live in, there is the problem of the damage caused to the structure of the houses affected.  Many hundreds of those houses were flooded to the extent of five or six feet of water, and it is estimated that the structural damage caused by the storm and flood may not show up at once.  I do not want to delay the House on this particular matter because I think the urgency of the matter is to have the Vote moved by the Minister adopted and so enable the Government to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>In connection with the distribution of any money made available from central funds in the Dublin area, I would submit that the appropriate body would be the local government of the city.  I want to inform the House <Col N="1886" /> that while all voluntary bodies cooperated, the direction and control of the organisation dealing with the problems arising immediately from the flood was taken over by our city manager and his technical advisers on the flood because of the fact that possibly, unlike other areas, we were faced with the immediate question of delivering fuel, of making arrangements for the pumping out and the clearing of houses and also for the examination by the health inspectors under the corporation's control.</P>
    <P>There is another section of the population in these areas which has been very seriously affected.  There are large numbers of trades people, shopkeepers and some others relying for their livelihood on the distribution of vegetables and other goods from door to door.  Many of those shopkeepers suffered enormous losses. Goods specially taken in for the Christmas period just vanished as the flood waters entered their premises. People relying on motor transport to deliver goods in the area found their cars under water with no possibility of getting them to work again.  It is true, I understand, that in many cases manufacturers and wholesalers are coming to the assistance of some of the traders concerned by replacing stocks free of charge.  I think in all such cases we in this House, as well as those traders concerned, must express our admiration of the public-spirited action of those people.</P>
    <P>To conclude, the picture I want the House and the Minister to see is a picture of urgency at this time.  Like my colleagues in this House representing Dublin Corporation in the area, I have gone down narrow basement stairs to find chaos, tables overturned, bedding soaked, wardrobes warped and twisted and the personal possessions that people acquired over years just ruined beyond redemption.  I am sure this House will support the Minister in voting this Grant-in-Aid and in addition I hope this House will endorse the appeal that this Grant-in-Aid should not be made on any basis of small percentage losses.  A large proportion of those concerned have not suffered losses that can be replaced in <Col N="1887" /> a question of weeks or months; they suffered the loss of practically everything they had and this House, this Government and the Minister would receive the gratitude of those people, not for expressions of sympathy or sorrow for them but gratitude if we come to their rescue in a material way by providing that they be relieved and assisted in their troubles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to intervene for a very short space of time now and I do so very largely for the purpose of supplementing the remarks that were made by the Minister for Local Government and endeavouring to give the House perhaps a little more detail than he felt himself entitled to give the House in his opening statement. I would like at the outset to express my appreciation and the appreciation of my colleagues for the manner in which Deputy de Valera, Leader of the Opposition, has received these Estimates and&mdash;I think I am entitled to say&mdash;the sympathy which he has shown towards the problems with which we are faced in dealing with the difficulties created by the Dublin situation and the Shannon situation in considering what amount of money should be asked for from the taxpayers out of the people's resources and on what principles those moneys should be allocated to those who have suffered as a result of the unprecedented storms and rainfall of the last few weeks and months.  It seems to me at all events almost incredible that it is only a week ago since the Tolka overflowed its banks causing disaster along its banks and in the Glasnevin area which brought such havoc to the residents of the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the House to remember that we were faced with the problem of dealing immediately with a very widespread distress caused in the City of Dublin area at the same time as we were dealing, as we had been dealing for some time past, with the problems along the Shannon and elsewhere.  We took the decision at the earliest possible moment we could, that it was our duty to come to the Dáil and ask the Dáil to grant us public money to enable the situation to be dealt with, at least in some sort of way, so as to <Col N="1888" /> alleviate distress caused both in the Shannon and Dublin City areas.  We had to come here to the Dáil to-day, in a sense unprepared with details or principles or even guidance for the House, because the Dáil is getting up to-day for the recess, and I am sure Deputies will realise that it was not possible for us, in the space of time that we had available to us, to get sufficient details either in Dublin City or in the Shannon area to enable us to assess, not merely the size of the problem but the manner in which the settlement of the problem should be approached, and the principles to be applied to its solution.  So far as Shannon is concerned, the Minister for Agriculture has dealt with that and will, I am sure, deal with any further questions, or give any further information that Deputies may require, in his closing speech.  Deputies should be aware of this that, as to what machinery we propose to set up to allocate whatever money is given or what principles will be applied to its allocation, I want to admit frankly that, as far as Dublin is concerned I have not, nor have my colleagues&mdash;despite the fact that we have had intensive consultation with all the parties concerned &mdash;been able to lay down the principles on which those public moneys should be disbursed.  But so far as a guiding principle can be laid down it is laid down in the title or particulars given in this Estimate.  The money that will be granted by the Dáil following these Estimates will be granted for the purpose of alleviating distress.  That is the only guiding principle we can give at the moment.  I cannot say for what kind of damage, what kind of compensation or what kind of grant will be given to relieve that distress nor can I say what Deputy Larkin asked me to give&mdash;detailed particulars of the percentage of losses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, so far as Dublin is concerned, I do not think there is any question of a loan at all. That is the way my mind is running at the moment&mdash;cash grants.  There may be some question of loans in the Shannon area as was indicated by the <Col N="1889" /> Minister for Agriculture some weeks ago when he was speaking on the problem as it existed then.  Circumstances may have changed since and may require a different plan for the Shannon area at the moment.  So far as my mind and the minds of my colleagues are concerned&mdash;having gone into the matter in the last few days&mdash;the way we are going at the moment&mdash;and I would ask Deputies if we have to change later that they will not hold it against us hereafter if we have to alter our plans&mdash;our intention is to form a committee somewhat analogous to the committee for the Shannon area, presided over by Mr. Justice Lavery, who has agreed to preside over it, and to be assisted by the city manager and one of his principal officials who has a knowledge of the area.  I do not want to mention the official's name because the matter has not yet been mentioned to himself. There will be some other people, not picked or selected because of their representative capacity but selected because of their knowledge of charitable work and because, in particular, of their knowledge of the people who live down in the North Strand and generally of people in the City of Dublin.  The people I have in mind are from St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Catholic Social Welfare Conference or the Legion of Mary, not representative of those bodies but persons selected from them.  Without actually coming down to personnel they will be people who will know the people of Dublin and, without prejudice to Deputy Traynor's constituency, who will not allow anyone to put it across them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid there will be efforts in that direction, and while we want to have a committee able to deal with exaggerated or false claims we also want a committee which will deal sympathetically with the problems that are there, people who will deal first with the poorer sections of the community in general and deal generously with them, and will then deal with the other sections.  We are working out this in consultation with the city manager and his officials with whom we have been having consultations, but up to the moment they are not <Col N="1890" /> able to give us details of the claims or types of claims or of the persons affected or the type of persons affected such as would have enabled us to chart a course or fix principles on which we could act.  It will take them some days to do it.  They have had experienced assessors going through each of the houses, and up to yesterday they had done hundreds of houses, and I have seen some of the reports.  I have also seen some of the reports from the Red Cross organisation.  But it is quite hopeless at the present time for us to try to see the extent of the problem or the nature of it, the different types of people involved and the principles on which we will have to act in accordance with justice and equity.</P>
    <P>I cannot give any further direction than that.  I hope it will assist Deputies, particularly those interested in the City of Dublin area.  I hope it will give them some indication that we are approaching this problem sympathetically and endeavouring to know the extent and the nature of it and, at the same time, realising that there is a limit to the resources of the taxpayer and that we just cannot hand out money indiscriminately or perhaps even to the full extent which might be desired.  I shall be glad to answer to the best of my ability and knowledge any questions that Deputies may wish to ask on that subject but I really have not got any more information than I have disclosed.  The Minister for Local Government, Deputy O'Donnell, probably did not wish perhaps to disclose even that information that I have disclosed up to the moment, because it is rather indeterminate and in a state of flux.  I felt, however, having regard to the manner in which Deputy de Valera and other Deputies approached the matter that I should give an indication of the way we are approaching the problem, stating at the same time that we had not yet finally determined the exact way in which we would set up this committee or what directives we would give it.</P>
    <P>The main principle is the alleviation of distress.  If there is any person, as I understand Deputy Larkin says there is, in urgent and immediate need I think the resources even at the <Col N="1891" /> moment are sufficient to enable us to deal with such a case.  If Deputy Larkin will give us particulars of such cases requiring urgent attention we will endeavour to have them dealt with.  We have been informed by the City Manager and his assistant that so far as the North Strand area is concerned&mdash;and I think that goes for the Tolka Valley generally&mdash;the emergency finished either some time yesterday or the day before.  The real seriousness of the situation has ceased.  Most of the people have now returned to their homes, though they are facing on their return pretty stiff problems.</P>
    <P>As I understand the Leader of the Opposition, the Dáil is now prepared to vote public moneys for the relief of distress both in Dublin and along the Shannon.  I have no doubt, as Deputy de Valera said, that we will be pressed all over the country; we have tried to deal with that through the medium of the Red Cross.  We have given specific instructions to the Red Cross to deal with any cases of distress immediately in any part of the country and we will stand behind that organisation in any expenditure it may have to meet or which it may properly or necessarily incur for the alleviation of distress in any part of the country.  We do not at the moment know the extent to which public money will be required, but the amount will be considerable no matter what way we work.</P>
    <P>I would like to say now that the fact that public moneys are being voted and that the resources of the taxpayer are being availed of and called upon to meet the distress occasioned by these excessive storms and rains should not dry up the wells of private benevolence and I appeal to all those who have not yet subscribed to either the Lord Mayor's Fund or the Red Cross, or the other charitable organisations dealing with these problems in Dublin, along the Shannon or elsewhere to subscribe generously, adequately and quickly.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, paid a well deserved tribute to-day to a farmer from County Dublin, Mr. Bergin, for his spontaneous and generous gesture towards the relief of <Col N="1892" /> the farmers in the Shannon area. Deputy Larkin referred to some public spirited wholesalers who are contributing, at their own expense, to the relief of traders who have suffered loss. I suggest that that kind of voluntary public-spirited effort should be the headline on which our citizens throughout the length and breadth of the country should act, and act quickly. The fact that the taxpayer is coming to the rescue should not be regarded as an excuse for individuals who have the means to do so refraining from contributing to the Lord Mayor's Fund, to the Red Cross or other charitable organisations.</P>
    <P>We have had many offers of help from countries abroad with accredited representatives here.  We have had sincere expressions of sympathy from them on behalf of the nations they represent here.  On behalf of this House and on behalf of our people generally I would like to express our gratitude to the countries which are accredited here for their ready response with sympathy and offers of practical help towards the alleviation of the distress caused.  We are dealing with this problem out of our own resources; nevertheless, we are grateful to them for their offers and we appreicate the sympathy and generosity they have displayed towards the Irish people.</P>
    <P>It would not be proper not to pay a special tribute and mark especially our appreciation of what was done or offered to be done had we wished to avail of it by our own people in the United States of America.  Generous offers came from Irish organisations throughout the length and breadth of the United States.  It is a great source of comfort to us to know that that solid unbreakable link exists between the Irish people here at home and our fellow countrymen in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>I have spoken almost entirely on the Estimate relating to Dublin City. That does not mean that, while our sympathies go out to the City of Dublin, we are not fully alive to the necessities of those who have suffered such loss and privation in the valley of the Shannon and elsewhere throughout <Col N="1893" /> the country.  I think Deputy Larkin is right: the people like the sympathy, but they also want a little bit of cash. I have given the sympathy.  I hope the House will give them the cash.</P>

      <P>As one of the Deputies representing the district affected, namely, North East Dublin, I would like to express on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Harry Colley, who is unfortunately indisposed, our deep sympathy with those who have suffered so grievously in this disaster.  We have to consider here this evening the ways and means of alleviating the suffering which this disaster has inflicted upon the unfortunate people and the Taoiseach has outlined the means by which it is proposed to deal with the particular problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I have lived in the North Strand area practically all my life.  I know it exceedingly well.  I know the type of avenue that has been inundated.  I know the type of house that has been flooded and made uninhabitable. Personally, I believe we will have to go much further than merely providing relief.  We shall have to endeavour to provide the ways and means of preventing continuous repetitions of this type of flooding.  In my boyhood days I well remember the cottages up around Drumcondra Bridge being flooded very often to a depth of two and three feet, the homes rendered uninhabitable and the families having to evacuate.  That went on from year to year.  An attempt to provide some relief was brought about some years ago by what I shall describe as an abbreviated form of diversion of the River Tolka.  That brought relief to some extent but it did not provide anything in the nature of permanent relief.  I had the honour to be a member of the Dublin Corporation during the years 1933-36 and on one occasion when this periodic flooding had taken place, I and some of my colleagues were discussing the ways and means of preventing a repetition of such flooding.  I made a suggestion, merely as a layman since I have no technical experience, that the course of the Tolka should be diverted up around about Finglas.  It could possibly be <Col N="1894" /> diverted into the canal.  I see the Minister for Agriculture looking at me with a certain amount of doubt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>On one famous occasion when I had the temerity to intervene in a debate on agriculture, the Minister described me as the agricultural expert from Ballybough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would expect a citizen of Ballybough to know all about the Tolka and I would listen with respect to his opinions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Now probably, he will describe me as the engineering expert from Ballybough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what value can be placed on the proposition. Engineers, I have no doubt, would drill holes in it but I discussed it afterwards with people of some experience and I was assured that the canal could take the overflow, in view of the fact that in the canal there is a very severe fall and that there are also sluice gates which could be opened at any time when the flow became very heavy.  I had a dual purpose in making the suggestion. Apart from the fact that flooding in the various districts, which are annually inundated, could be averted, we would be able to reclaim the large amount of land which is at present unreclaimed and quite possibly a number of houses could be erected on the site of the filled-in course of the Tolka.  I am putting forward that suggestion again for what it is worth.  If it could be put into operation it would certainly obviate flooding and avert the possibility of a disaster of the type which we have recently experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that I was very pleased to hear the Taoiseach say that the intention is to deal with the effects of this calamity, not only here in the City of Dublin but also in the Shannon area, out of our own resources.  I think that in doing that the Government has done what is right and I should like to congratulate them on that fact.  I should like also to compliment both the <Col N="1895" /> Taoiseach and the Minister for Local Government on their announcement of the fact that they would suspend all regulations which would in any way impede immediate action in respect to relief in the serious situation brought about overnight in the crowded city area.  I think that that was facing up to a serious situation in the proper way.  I feel it my duty as a member of the Opposition to pay that tribute to them for that action.  I should like to say also, so far as the views of individuals in the city are concerned, that they have the same sympathy with the people in the Shannon areas as they have for the people in the North Strand areas.  They realise fully the terrific inconvenience which this type of disaster entails for the families concerned. I, of course, do not know what relief can be afforded in the way of prevention of the continued annual flooding in the case of the Shannon but I have no doubt that the Government is completely aware of the situation there and that they are taking the necessary steps to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Once again, I should like to express my own sympathy with the people and my congratulations to the various bodies&mdash;it is not necessary for me to name them&mdash;and the individuals whom I saw working in water up to their hips on the occasion of the flooding in the North Strand this day week.  This day week marked the highest point of the disaster.  I felt, looking on at these people as they worked there to help this stricken community, that it is disasters of this kind which bring out all that is best in the individual, as certainly happened in this particular case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with other Deputies who have expressed sympathy&mdash;their real sympathy, I know &mdash;with all the people who have suffered hardship as the result of the recent floods, irrespective of whether these people are from the City of Dublin or any other part of Ireland.  I know that this question of flooding and the problems associated with it present great difficulties to any Government, and the remarks I have to make here will be made in a friendly fashion towards <Col N="1896" /> the Government in so far as the efforts they are now making will meet the problem.  I would say this, though&mdash; quoting the words of the Minister for Agriculture a few moments ago: &ldquo;out of evil cometh good&rdquo;&mdash;that were it not for the fact that the unfortunate citizens of Dublin suffered flooding due to the Tolka changing its course, the citizens along the Shannon or of any other area of Ireland would not get the benefit that we understand they will get as a result of the measures now before the House.  Three weeks ago the Minister for Agriculture toured my own constituency, accompanied by many of his advisers and supporters. He met representatives of the people in the Shannon area, from the area between Athlone and Meelick.  I am sure he will correct me now, if I am wrong, that he put the case very fairly and squarely to those people and told them that he could see his way only to provide interest-free loans.</P>

It was a help to the Minister for Agriculture in his effort. I know he is genuine in connection with relieving the situation along the Shannon.</P>

    <P>The centre of all this flooding is Athlone, and in the last two or three weeks we have had sightseers gawking over the bridge in Athlone watching to see will the river rise another inch.

      <P>I want to suggest that there are very practical steps that the Government can take with regard to flooding in general in rural areas.  It is a good sound suggestion of the Minister to make these interest-free loans available and it is appreciated by the people in rural Ireland.  The second suggestion, and I think it is one that will appeal to the Minister, is that the problem the farmers must face next spring is the question of seed, which is of grave importance to farmers in Roscommon and other areas.  I am afraid that if this matter gets into the hands of some of the speculators in the country the farmers will be charged very dearly for next spring's seed.</P>

      <P>I want to deal separately with the Shannon problem. The House has faced up to this problem in a frank manner.  It is very difficult to see what can be done to remedy the winter flooding in the Shannon area every year.  That flooding will be there for all time and the Minister gave the reasons why that will be so.  The embanking of the Shannon has been mentioned on numerous occasions and again the question of the money involved will arise and the question as to whether it would be an economic proposition, having regard to the large expenditure involved, must be taken into consideration. There are of course alternatives and one of these is the question of the removal of families from the flooded areas.  I do not think anybody in this House would suggest&mdash;and the Minister for Agriculture looked at me two or three times as if I had&mdash;that people should be forcibly removed from the flooded areas.  I think that would be a crime in the first place, but the general impression in rural areas and probably in the city is that these people in Clonown and elsewhere have already been offered alternative holdings in areas not subject to flooding but that they did not go to these new homes.  A number of people have been approached by the Land Commission authorities and asked if they were willing to be removed to Westmeath, Meath, or Kildare.  Some said &ldquo;No, I will not go because my father's father was here before me.&rdquo;  He apparently did not want to leave his holding and immediately the whole area was blackened because one individual decided not to go, and the Land Commission have used that excuse for years to delay taking people away from the flooded areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three years ago a list of names was submitted by me to the Department of Lands of individuals in the flooded <Col N="1902" /> area along the Shannon who were most anxious to leave, and I was informed at a later stage by officers of the Land Commission that these people were not going.  I let it go for a certain time but later I went back to meet the people concerned and as a result of questioning them I discovered that of 15 only two had been approached and both of those individuals said they were willing to leave.  It was not a private affair at all.  I was talking to these individuals outside the church grounds in a crowd and I said in front of all these people: &ldquo;Say straight out here if you were asked by the Land Commission.  If you were say yes and, if not, say no.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now discussing the administration of the Land Commission and I do not think that can be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I am endeavouring to point out how essential it is to remove these people if they are anxious to go.  Up to the moment the Land Commission have not taken the necessary steps in this situation and I hope from now on the Minister will throw his weight behind this problem and arrive at a situation where he will ensure that all farmers who want to go will be removed.  Unlike Deputy Traynor I do not profess to possess any technical knowledge or to be able to give any great advice on engineering problems but I have been informed by men who know the Shannon that when the power station was erected in Ardnacrusha the main thing taken into consideration was power.  I have been told that the question of the land above Ardnacrusha in the rest of the Shannon area where people might be subject to flooding did not greatly interest the people concerned&mdash;those who were responsible for setting up the dam at Ardnacrusha. We all know the tremendous advance that has been made in the supply of electricity since then.  We now have a number of power stations throughout the country and the number is increasing each year so that as far as the Ardnacrusha end is concerned we are not as dependant on power from Ardnacrusha as we were years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1903" /> The Minister, and others here are, I am sure, familiar with the stretch of water between O'Briensbridge and Limerick and above Limerick where the Ardnacrusha business is situated. Where the water is held up to drive the turbines there is a 100 foot drop into the tailrace below and the House could picture that at Ardnacrusha a number of sluices might be erected beside the turbines so that when there was danger of flooding the sluices could release the water backed up at the turbines.  This would mean that the flooding would be reduced very quickly for a considerable distance upriver.  The main thing in drainage is to get the water away quickly and I feel sure that if the E.S.B. are properly tackled in this problem the cost of doing the work that I have suggested would not be anything like what it would cost to build an embankment along the Shannon.  And my suggestion would do a lot more good. I am offering the suggestion because I was told that a number of American engineers looking at the turbines at Ardnacrusha said that more consideration should have been given to the land upstream.</P>
    <P>There will be a number of other speakers here so I do not want to delay the House further.  I will say this to the Minister for Agriculture: he is going to leave every Deputy in rural Ireland in a very awkward spot from now on and he should appreciate the difficulties with which most rural Deputies will be faced.  We are all very sympathetic with the people along the Shannon and I particularly should be very sympathetic because I got more votes in that locality probably than did the Minister or possibly the Party on the opposite side.  But I say there are other areas which deserve very careful consideration.  There is quite a considerable amount of danger, too, to people living along other rivers and those people are going to say to me now and to other Deputies: &ldquo;How is it that compensation will be paid to people in the City of Dublin and to the people along the Shannon and that although we have lost crops and so forth we will get nothing?&rdquo;  That is a problem I can see created and that is <Col N="1904" /> why I should like the Minister to take this as an all-over picture rather than in two separate Votes, one for Dublin and the other dealing with the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The question of flooding should be treated on a national basis.  I feel also that the Red Cross must be complimented for the help they have given up to the present and for the help they are giving, but I feel that this is a task of far greater magnitude than can be handled by the Red Cross in rural Ireland.  Voluntary organisation workers can help more easily in Dublin and other such cities than in rural areas.  The Minister himself is from rural Ireland and should realise that it is very difficult for the Red Cross to do effective work in a place like Cloheen or other such places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a question? Is it not true in the circumstances that practically every field in the whole of Ireland has been flooded this year? What we are trying to deal with now is the problem of the land that has been abnormally flooded.  We could make a case that every farmer's land was flooded.  We are trying to deal here with the abnormal inundation.  It would, of course, be very nice if we could help everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

Still I wish the Minister luck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to this debate and it is gratifying to know that some assistance is being given. Everybody who spoke in this debate has expressed sympathy for the flood victims either in the Shannon area or in the Tolka valley.  I join with the people who have spoken and extend my own individual sympathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, in fact both sides of the House, deserve to be congratulated. <Col N="1905" /> We find there is a spirit of co-operation, which is a very satisfactory state of affairs.  There is a lot of credit due to the voluntary bodies, the Red Cross, the Army, the Gardaí and others who have co-operated in this emergency.  To the people who have supplied goods and materials or helped in any way, this House and the people of Ireland are indebted, not to mention the gratitude which is due to people abroad who have offered assistance.</P>
    <P>As other Deputies have said, out of this perhaps some good will come.  It has helped, even if it is an expensive way to do it, to focus the attention of this House on the importance of drainage in this country.  It is the first time we had an emergency of this kind in the City of Dublin, and at any rate it will have the effect of focusing the attention of the city people on the plight of people in rural areas when an emergency such as this arises.</P>
    <P>I would like to agree with the principle adopted by the Government with regard to handling this situation. The Minister for Agriculture has pointed out, and rightly so, that the most urgent problems were dealt with first.  Where lives were in danger it was only right and proper that such cases should be dealt with as an emergency. At the same time, that does not rid the Government of responsibility in dealing with problems in other areas.  Deputy Killilea, speaking here to-night on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, pointed out cases where 17 families were affected.  I can say that in my area there are hundreds of families affected.  I have scores and scores of letters from constituents.  I have gone out and seen the flood damage myself.  There are many farmers in the Moy valley who have lost everything.  Across from the Sligo border through Killasser, to Toomore, down by Foxford and on towards Ballina, everything is lost, hay, oats and potatoes.</P>
    <P>We must keep in mind so far as these small landholders are concerned that when they lose an area or two of tillage they have lost everything because the majority of those people have only an acre or two of tillage <Col N="1906" /> altogether.  In some of those other areas, even the Shannon area, the majority of landholders are much bigger and if they lose a few acres&mdash; although I agree that some of them have lost everything this time&mdash;they may not be as hard hit as people in areas such as I represent.</P>
    <P>I know of people who would be glad to help their neighbours if they had anything to help them with but unfortunately they have not.  It is a case where everybody lost less or more. Some people's stocks of hay or oats are substantially lower than they were in other years and they are not in a position to help their neighbours. Although we in the Moy valley have not been as vocal as people in other parts of the country, although we have not got as much newspaper publicity about our difficulties, we have suffered very seriously.  I have already spoken briefly on this question in recent times when I got an opportunity but as the matter has not been debated as it is being debated to-night I had not an opportunity of speaking at length on it.</P>
    <P>Our people are not grumblers.  They have been traditionally accustomed to suffering hardships and difficulties and there are few Deputies in this House who can appreciate that fact more than Deputy Dillon, our present Minister for Agriculture, because he himself and generations of his family who came before him&mdash;go ndeanfaidh Dia trocaire ar a n-anamcha&mdash;have played a great part in trying to help those people, the small tenant farmers of Ireland.  I seriously suggest that the people of Mayo will be disappointed in the present Minister for Agriculture if he in his time does not try to play his part in helping the people that generations of his family have helped in years gone by.  They look forward to the present Minister for Agriculture, being a western himself&mdash;we can claim he comes from County Mayo&mdash;considering their case sympathetically.</P>

Although we sympathise with the people in the Shannon area and the Tolka valley and agree that the principle adopted by the present Government was a good one in regard to emergency cases, I am here to speak on behalf of my own constituents, and realising that for generations our people have suffered not alone from flood damage but as a result of the fact that their holdings are small and uneconomic, we feel we have a particular case, a particular problem to which we are entitled to draw attention.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan has spoken about the question of seed for next year.  I am sure that as a result of all this flood damage a considerable amount of seed, or what we had in mind would be fit for seed, will now be unsuitable. I know the Minister has been a busy man for months past but I would urge him to do everything humanly possible to have seed-testing stations established even if only makeshift stations to test seed for farmers and see if it would be suitable for putting into the ground next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that all this has arisen as a result of flooding, I think I am entitled to mention it in passing.  People would be well advised to avail of veterinary services at the present time because there is always the danger that animals grazing on flooded lands will get fluke or other disease.  If the Minister would consider making free veterinary services available to people whose lands have been flooded I think it would be a very important step, because all this is linked up with our national economy and it is, as the former Taoiseach pointed out, a very serious problem for the Government.  It is a problem which is not easy to get over, but, with goodwill and co-operation, I feel confident that, with God's help, we will get over it.  We have seen a grand spirit among our people in recent times and I sincerely hope, in the difficult time that lies ahead, that we will see more of that spirit, particularly in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture referred to an incident where a farmer in the eastern counties, somewhere in the neighbourhood of Dublin, kindly came to the rescue of his neighbours perhaps 100 miles away.  That was a very fine gesture, and I think it was only right and proper that the tribute paid by the Minister for Agriculture to that gentleman should have been paid, because it is a spirit which has prevailed here in Ireland for generations, and a spirit that helped to keep our country going in dark and difficult days.  I would like to see, as far as possible, that spirit encouraged.  I would also like to think that people would not turn this whole scheme into a racket, that people would not send forward claims to the Government claiming for damage that has not occurred, and I would say it would be necessary for the Government to be vigilant in matters of this kind, because there are always the few who will avail of any opportunity to cash in on something of this kind.  I fully <Col N="1909" /> appreciate in that respect, too, the Government has quite a difficult job.</P>
    <P>I would like to wind up by saying again that we in Mayo expect the same treatment to be meted out to us as to the people in the Shannon valley. Although our holdings are not as big as those other holdings they are in their way very important.  It is worthy of note that in recent times it is from the congested areas such as those I represent myself that the thousands of people are fleeing from the land.  All that has happened in recent times as regards flooding will not encourage them to stay.  It is up to the Government now to show their sincerity with these small landowners.</P>
    <P>I would say to our own Minister for Lands, Deputy Blowick, that if he were to extend the offer of holdings of land to some of the congested district tenants along the Moy valley, I would say many of those people would be prepared to avail of the offer.  There are many congested villages along the Moy valley and I would ask him to extend that offer to the people of the constituency of North Mayo&mdash;or of South Mayo, if they are affected by the flooding of the Moy.  We do not hope to see those lands free of water for three or four months, so that although the people pay rates and rent and taxes many of them have no place to graze their cattle.</P>
    <P>Having mentioned these matters, I again appeal to the Minister for Agriculture to pull his weight with the Government&mdash;and he can be very forceful when he wants to.  I am confident, with his expert knowledge of conditions in rural Ireland and with his ability and forcefulness, if he does pull his weight, we can look forward to the day when something will be done to alleviate the distress and suffering of these smallholders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice in commending the work that is being done by the Army and other organisations, and in commending the Government for the way in which they have grappled with this problem.  In speaking of the flooding of the Shannon valley, I would like to make it perfectly clear that in my view any statement <Col N="1910" /> to the effect that the flooding this year bears any relation to the flooding in any other year is ridiculous.  The flooding of the Shannon valley is of a completely unique and unprecedented character.  There has always been some flooding in the Shannon valley and there has been a number of different types of floods.  There has been flooding which came at the wrong time and removed the hay, and which if it came later would have no ill-effect but might in fact leave a silt of good character in the ground.  There has been flooding which flooded a number of buildings about three times in the last 15 years and a considerable amount was done by reconstruction grants, by raising roads, and levelling by the Land Commission, to help the people whose houses were flooded, when the flood was at a much lower level than it is to-day.  But as the Minister has said, the flooding at present is unprecedented.  I should like also to congratulate Colonel Collins-Powell and the Army in Athlone on the work they are doing.  They are doing a very splendid job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister one or two questions in regard to the steps he intends to take in the form of rehabilitation. The Minister has said that the Land Commission would offer alternative holdings to those persons who have been badly flooded, but the view has been expressed to me in the area that as an alternative to that there are people who perhaps are prepared to see another flood at another period entering their homes, but who, having seen this flood come and destroy their crops, might like a small holding in an adjacent area to add to their existing holding in which they could grow some of their more essential crops in perfect safety and at least diminish the losses they would sustain in the event of the rainy periods growing in number.  Some might prefer also to build a new house on the smaller holding rather than remain along the Shannon.  The proof that that idea has some value lies in the fact that a number of smallholders along the Shannon have already taken steps of that kind.  As the Minister knows, some of them <Col N="1911" /> have small holdings away from the flooded area and some habitually take land away from the flooded area. I have a feeling that the people of the Shannon area, many of whom have a natural, traditional, family devotion to the Shannon area, and who have shown, as the Minister said, quiet dignity and great fortitude in the face of disaster, might prefer not to leave their traditional abode along the Shannon, but would like to have some sort of additional resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy to say that that position will certainly be examined, but perhaps the Deputy will realise with me that it is not quite possible to make a categorical offer of that kind to all of them?  You can say to all of them: &ldquo;We will give you alternative holdings,&rdquo; but there may not be enough plots to carry out the device the Department has in mind for all those who would wish to avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is considering that favourably. There is another problem which is arising now for consideration, namely, the effect of the water on the roads leading to the flooded areas.  A good deal of money will eventually be saved if the Minister for Local Government will consider giving some additional grants to the affected county councils for the repair of those roads used for ordinary traffic upon which there are patches of water; these roads will be in a very serious condition if they are not repaired in the immediate future and there ought to be some sort of arrangement made whereby county councils will know that in the case of roads that have been flooded they will be able to get an extra grant from the Road Fund for their repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to ask the Minister whether he has included in his special claim the tributary areas to the Shannon.  Are the five families, for example, who had, I <Col N="1912" /> think, to vacate their homes on the River Inny, close to the Shannon, included and what exact geographical area does the special assistance cover? The Minister has already been asked about assistance in other areas, but there will be a sort of border line position along the Shannon, particularly where some of the tributaries flow into the Shannon, where the Shannon has backed up into them, where the people have had fairly severe losses of crops and where some people have actually had to vacate their homes.  The Minister will be provided with a difficult problem in deciding whether the backing of the Shannon into those tributaries brings such areas within the sphere of his operations and I would like to know from him whether he has made any decision in regard to that matter up to now.</P>
      <P>In so far as the long-term project, which has so often to be considered for the prevention of flooding along the Shannon is concerned, I agree with the Minister that the solution seems to be a very, very difficult one indeed. There have been various suggestions in times past.  I believe there were some Swiss engineers on the Shannon at one time who proposed the creation of a vast reservoir into which the water would flow.  That, of course, would in turn create additional problems in the displacement of people from their holdings.  I think the Minister should consider this whole question not only in the light of the very extreme flooding that has taken place this year but also in the light of the more moderate flooding that takes place very, very frequently and which has a bearing on the general problem. The Arterial Drainage Commission, as the Minister knows, regarded the deepening of the channel between Athlone and Meelick as being prohibitively expensive.  That was at a time when earth moving techniques were very much less advanced than they are today. I do not think the Minister should say he can do nothing because he cannot face the prospect of preventing this very extreme flooding this year if, at the same time, some steps could be taken which in nine cases out of ten might effect some improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1913" /> I would also like to express my very great support of the Minister in his effort to promote not only State aid but local effort as well.  Everyone in the Athlone area is making a tremendous contribution to the people who have been deprived of their crops.  The voluntary committees are working well. It would be a tragic thing indeed if we were ever to see the day where the State would have to provide 100 per cent. of all the aid required in circumstances such as those we are discussing now.  I am very glad that an appeal is being made for the co-operative effort to be a joint one, between the State authorities, the local authorities and the voluntary associations.</P>
    <P>As I have said, one of the principal difficulties will be the rehabilitation of these flooded holdings in the spring season.  From what I hear there are a great many families who are sufficiently conservative not even to want to borrow money if they can possibly avoid it.  They will make every effort to avoid borrowing money.  There are others in circumstances in which they will be compelled to accept aid in the form of loans such as those which are being offered by the Minister.  I do not know whether the Minister would consider in certain cases offering loans to smallholders in the form of kind rather than cash.  Would he, for example, consider providing seed oats and the other seed requirements in a scheme analogous to that which is now being operated in the congested areas? Would he consider that a better way of giving relief rather than asking the people to borrow money through the aegis of the Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Credit Corporation? Possibly he may find that the two systems will be an advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Estimate before the House.  My first-hand experience of the position in the City of Dublin is confined to a smaller area of flooding than the area affected on the north side.  It is an area, however, which in its own way was just as seriously affected.  The flooding to which I refer occurred in Kilmainham as a result of the overflowing of the Camac.  Out of that experience, which <Col N="1914" /> is somewhat smaller as compared with the general experience over the City of Dublin, I have only one suggestion to make and that is that, in addition to any aid in the way of kind or cash for the relief of the distress of the persons affected, there should be an immediate wiping out of any restriction or delay in the provision of houses for people who, as a result of this flooding, are either living or have been discovered to be living in houses unfit for human habitation.  In the area to which I refer there are houses, not a great number, which manifestly, as a result of this flooding, received &ldquo;the last straw that breaks the camel's back.&rdquo;  Whatever doubts may have been entertained as to whether these houses were or were not habitable hitherto, once the waters had receded, or even before that time, all such doubts disappeared.  The people who have suffered know as well as any architect, engineer or expert that these houses are no longer fit for habitation. To these people alternative accommodation provided now will be worth three times such accommodation provided three weeks hence.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister for Local Government to take all the steps available to him to ensure that all the people affected will get alternative accommodation and that no system of priority, no formality, no fear of legal consequences will prevent the corporation from making houses available to house these people now rather than to-morrow.</P>

      <P>I would like to bring some northern water to bear upon this problem.  It is satisfactory to know that in a situation such as this our Government can take steps to deal with it effectively in a short time.  That is something that gives to all a feeling of security and confidence.  It is certainly comforting to be aware of that. We hope the efforts being made will be successful.  There is one point on which I and many Deputies outside the two areas under discussion are not clear about; what will happen to the persons or families in the areas where, to use the Minister's words, exceptional inundation has taken place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are areas in our county where <Col N="1915" /> such has happened, where there have been losses due to exceptional flooding. Exceptional flooding in parts of Donegal, as I am sure in other parts of the country, has caused dire distress. I understand this token Estimate is being provided for the relief of cases of dire distress.  To take one example, about which I have written to the Minister, giving him a list of names of persons who were affected, we have the case of a breach of the Foyle embankment somewhere below Lifford.  A large area was flooded and crops were destroyed.</P>

The Office of Public Works say that this job can be included only if the Department of Agriculture make money available for it first.  I want the Minister to include that.  First of all, I should like to impress upon him that the flooding, which is exceptional this year, is causing unusual inundation in the Deel and Swillyburn areas.  I would impress upon him that steps must be taken to remedy that.  Those affected are as severely hit as many in the Shannon area and their losses are fairly severe. I know one individual, not in the Swillyburn or Deel areas, but in another area along Lough Swilly, whose losses between wheat and barley amount to about £700.

These people have suffered very serious losses.  They will not be able of their own efforts to replace their boats unless the Minister comes to their assistance.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just trying to back up the representations already made with all the force I can because not alone is there a question of present loss.  There is also the fact that in the past ten years they lost 30 fishing boats in all, including the five lost last week.  The danger now is, and has been for some years, that these people will become discouraged and that the fishing tradition which exists there will be broken, with the result that many of them will have to emigrate.  Some of the younger people have done so already.  As the Minister is aware, it is very hard to revive the fishing tradition in any area where it lapses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall let it go at that.  I know the Minister is aware of the situation and I am glad that he has promised to take steps to ease matters for these people.  These are the two points I wanted to refer to in regard to our constituency, that is, that there is flooding; there is distress from flooding and losses.  I want those cases to be considered in this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to express my sympathy with all the people who suffered loss due to flooding and storm.  I must admit that I am rather disappointed to find that there is a differential, if you like, against certain people.  What I mean is that in the Vote for Agriculture the River Shannon is given as the distressed area and we all know that in the Vote for the Department of Local Government the River Tolka is regarded as having caused the damage but, strangely enough, the Tolka was not mentioned here; it just says Dublin City.  There must have been a reason for that.  The Tolka flows through Dublin City but it also flows through a couple of villages in County Meath and the inhabitants of those villages have suffered every bit as much as the citizens of Dublin.  In one village, Clonee, the water was almost six feet deep and the people lost everything they had, just as they did in Dublin.</P>
      <P>There is the question of whether or not the Red Cross Society will be able to deal with the situation.  While I have the greatest respect in the world for the Red Cross Society and the great work they did since the storm, it is just too ridiculous to suggest that the Red Cross Society can deal with the problem. In my opinion they cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for instance, a number of areas in County Meath, where people were depending for their winter supply of fuel on turf which they must take from the bogs.  The turf was ruined or, if it was not, the laneways into the bogs were ruined.  Is it suggested that the Red Cross Society will be able to have the lanes repaired or to have fuel supplied <Col N="1920" /> to the people?  I do not think that comes within their province at all.</P>
    <P>In Mornington, at the end of the River Boyne, there are fishermen whose families have engaged in fishing for generations, and who have made a living out of it.  The Boyne overflowed and took the entire mussel bed and destroyed their livelihood.  I do not think it can be suggested that the Red Cross Society can supply a remedy for these people.</P>
    <P>I do know that in the towns, Navan and Trim in particular, they can possibly make some small recompense to the people who have lost their household property, but so far that has not been tackled in a big way.  I was in these towns to-day and I know that the people who were flooded, some of whom lost everything they had, got second-hand clothing, second-hand blankets and mattresses and stuff like that which would not normally be used by these people.  I do not think it was right.  I would imagine that it was something in the nature of taking advantage of these people to offer them something which they had to accept because they had nothing else.  I do not think it is right, if the Government are to be responsible for relieving the people who suffered by reason of the flooding, that they should try to do it through the medium of a second-hand clothes shop.  I am not trying to cast a slur on the Red Cross Society. They are doing their best.  The organisations dealing with these matters were treating it from a local angle and they did more than their share, but the Government must do something more than say that the Red Cross Society will deal with the rest of the areas.</P>
    <P>The River Boyne runs through County Meath.  Flooding on the Boyne is not a matter which need recur every year.  It can be remedied.  The river can be drained but it has not been done so far and I understand from a reply to a parliamentary question that it will be five or six years before it is done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Traynor talked about working a miracle and making the water flow up from the river into the canal but, in regard to the River Boyne, it <Col N="1921" /> is merely a matter of having the river cleaned and eventually it must be done.  The Government, let it be this Government or whatever Government is in power, should face up to this fact.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the responsible Ministers whether or not it is proposed to give some kind of relief or to do something for the people whose fuel is still on the bogs and who cannot get it out.  Will there be any attempt made to put the roadways to the bogs in fit condition so that the turf may be taken out?  That is a fair question.  I would like to know if the people who have lost a great deal of their property, small farmers in County Meath who have lost much of their crops, will receive any compensation. I am sure they will not receive it through the Red Cross Society.</P>
    <P>I notice that some Deputies from the West stressed the fact that there is a big flooded area in the West of Ireland. It can be taken from me that there is a big flooded area in County Meath and even yet one quarter of the county, good land and bad land, is under water and will be for a considerable period. I do not know whether or not it is proposed to introduce a special Estimate.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to see that the Government has taken such immediate action in relation to the floods in Dublin and in the country, and I congratulate them on having moved so quickly.  But there are a few matters to which I should like to draw the attention of the House.  The Deputies here have read and heard a lot about the floods in the North Strand and in the Fairview areas, and I should like to inform the Deputies that there are 750 houses alone affected by those floods in the Drumcondra area from Glasnevin village right down Millmount Avenue, and Clonturk Park, on to Fairview Strand and down as far as St. Lawrence Road, Clontarf, as well as the East Wall and Anglesea Place areas.  The Minister for Local Government said he believed there were about 1,500 dwellings affected by these floods.  I suggest that the figure is 4,000 and also that there were about 500 people in business premises affected in my area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a question for which I cannot see any great remedy and that is the unemployment that has occurred in this area as a result of the floods. One man living in the North Strand Road who carries on an undertaking business has lost cars and motor-hearses to the value of approximately £7,000 and the men employed in his <Col N="1923" /> business have lost their jobs.  What compensation can be given to these people?  Several Deputies have stressed the necessity of housing people that were affected by the floods.  As a member of the Dublin Corporation, I should like to say that last Thursday morning, when the floods came upon us so suddenly and catastrophically, the Dublin Corporation had 200 houses and 60 flats to cater for nearly 4,000 families affected.  A lot of people have been criticising the Dublin Corporation for their efforts to house these people.  The problem confronting the officials of the corporation was one that was really very frightening.  The area affected by the Tolka flooding was, I agree, a lot smaller than the area affected by the Shannon floods, but the number of people and of houses concerned was far greater.  For the information of the Minister for Agriculture, it does seem strange when you realise that more animals lost their lives in Dublin North-East than were lost in the Shannon floods.  In Dublin North-East, a considerable lot of dairying is done; people inside the city rent lands in County Dublin in the summer for dairying purposes.  One man, Mr. Byrne, at Leinster Avenue, had 18 cows and he lost ten.  The Foleys lost 18 of their 27 horses and even this morning on the railway embankment I saw the bodies of these animals floating on the water.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the St. John Ambulance for the work they did in the North Strand when the floods occurred.  I should also like to thank the Fire Brigade men, some of whom worked two days and two nights without a wink of sleep. These things are not generally known by the public.  I want to say a special word about the Garda.  One of them who had worked all night in his shirt sleeves and trousers collapsed at 8 o'clock in the morning.  That man is still in the Mater Hospital.  These are the unsung heroes of the floods. The Army also deserve tribute for the manner in which they speedily erected field kitchens to feed the people.  These kitchens and their stocks of food were all lost later in the floods.  The Great Northern <Col N="1924" /> Railway also deserve thanks.  They opened their restaurant in Amiens Street Station that night to feed the people and they sent railway engines up the embankment to bring people from the floods to dry land.  We should also pay tribute to the officials of the corporation who worked day and night and to the boat owners who lent rowing boats.  It may sound strange to a lot of people to hear that I saw row boats being rowed through the North Strand and into Fairview Strand.  The people who sent their lorries to evacuate the local residents who were victims of the floods also deserve our thanks as do the residents who worked right through the night carrying people in their night attire on their backs and shoulders.</P>
    <P>The people are asking three questions; the first is, what steps will be taken to prevent a recurrence of these floods?  To the people affected this is the most important question of all.  It is far more important than any Grant-in-Aid, or any relief, or any compensation that may be paid to them.  The bed of the river Tolka is the same now as it was when I went to school in St. Patrick's, Drumcondra approximately 30 years ago. But that river and its tributaries are now taking the flood water from the built-up area of Mobhi Road, Glasnevin, and from the corporation schemes in Walshe's Avenue and Donnycarney and other places along the river.  All the waters are now coming into the river which has the same bad as it had 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>The water falling on the concrete and tar macadam roads in these schemes is denied, if you like, the ability to be absorbed in the virgin soil and it runs directly into the river. The volume of water now entering the river is four or five times greater than it was 30 years ago.  Yet the bed of this river is exactly the same.  Factories and other premises have been permitted to be built right up against this river so preventing the widening of the river.  From Glasnevin village down to within a little over a quarter of a mile where the Tolka enters the sea, to my mind something can be <Col N="1925" /> done at once and must be done.  The remedy for the North Strand and East Wall areas is a different matter.  My personal belief is that these houses have been built over the last 60, 70 or 80 years on ground that was too low. Any local authority or developers building any housing scheme will naturally avail of the nearest possible place to discharge surface water drainage and in this case the nearest possible place is the River Tolka. When the places they are trying to drain are lower than the flood water level of the river, and when you have flood water coming down the river and a big tide coming up the river, it is natural to expect that flooding will be created.  On this occasion, we were unfortunate to experience exceptional floods, a spring tide and an east wind. On East Wall Road the water cascaded across the wall of the River Tolka.</P>
    <P>The second question that the people are asking is: what help will be given? In putting that question to the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government I realise that at this stage it is difficult for them to say what help will be given but it is not so difficult for them to answer the third question that the people are asking: when will this help be given? These people do not want this help next March or next February.  This help must be given immediately.  This help must be given if possible before Christmas.  These people lost all their family goods, their furniture and their clothes.</P>
    <P>I heard a statement from a councillor of the Dublin Corporation, Councillor Phelan, and I thought that he really hit the nail on the head when he said that he was talking to a man at the corner of Northbrook Avenue, a man of 60 years of age who had reared his family; he stood at the end of the street and said: &ldquo;Is it not a shocking thing to see, after my 60 years of toil and endeavour, my house ruined and to stand here in a borrowed suit of clothes?&rdquo;  That was the position of these people.  These are the people we are seeking to help.  A lot of those people have not got clothes to wear. They have ill-fitting clothes that have been given to them, I agree, by the <Col N="1926" /> Red Cross Society but these are proud people.  They want their own clothes and they want the money to get them. You must appreciate that all last week these people were not working.  They were endeavouring to clean out their homes, homes which were flooded to the extent of about ten feet.</P>
    <P>A lot of Deputies have been in those houses and have seen the extent and the height which this flood water reached.  I was in a house in Spencer Street last Saturday evening where a young man and his wife were living. The young man was from Bailieboro', County Cavan but was working in Dublin and I could see nothing but compliment in the manner in which they had cleaned their house, but the lack of furniture was very conspicuous there.  It was thrown out in the back garden, destroyed and broken up.  How are these people going to get the few essential sticks of furniture they need to make their home reasonably comfortable?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon stated that people in the Tolka area experienced the floods for 48 hours.  I disagree with him there.  They still experience the floods. There is foul sewage backed up by reason of the flood water and in 50 per cent. of the houses that have been affected by the flood you can still get a foul smell the moment you walk in the hall door.  Because the flood water has abated does not mean that these people are not still experiencing the effects of the flood.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that there were approximately 500 traders affected by flooding in the North Dublin area.  A man who had a small grocer shop at the corner of Fairview lost, apart from butter and other commodities, 90 tins of biscuits, the Christmas stock.  Through the goodness of some firms, they are meeting some of the loss incurred by these people.  There is a shoe shop in Fair-view&mdash;and we all know the price of shoes pretty well&mdash;and the owner lost 850 pairs of shoes.  There is a shop at the corner of Hollybrook Road in Clontarf where the trader lost £300 worth of tea.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for Agriculture when he expressed the opinion that certain people should not be looking <Col N="1927" /> for this aid, they are not the people for whom this Vote was introduced in the Dáil.  This Vote was introduced in the Dáil to help those people who are so affected by the floods that they needed some assistance other than their own efforts to enable them to bring themselves back to the conditions or as near as possible to the conditions which existed before these floods occurred.  It has been suggested that the collapse of the G.N.R. bridge was responsible for these floods.  At 9 o'clock last Wednesday night in Drumcondra there was three feet of water; at midnight in the middle of the street at Fairview Strand there was three feet of water; and at about 11 o'clock last Wednesday night the water was flowing down East Wall and into the North Strand.  The bridge collapsed at 2.30 in the morning.  A lot of statements have been made concerning these floods, a lot of them incorrect, and a lot of them true.  But the true picture could only be seen by a visit to the flooded areas while the floods were there.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by putting again to the two Ministers concerned the three questions that the people of my area, at least, want to have answered.  I put this to the Minister for Local Government: what steps will be taken to prevent a recurrence of this catastrophe? The people, I think, are not asking too much, and if the Minister can use all his powers to get a survey or a report from the proper engineers and tell the people what can be done, if anything can be done at all, he will be doing something worth while.  There are several opinions as to a possible remedy, and there are several opinions as to the cause of these floods.</P>
    <P>My second question is: what help will be given?  And the third is: when will it be given?  I hope that some of this help will be given to these people before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I join with the House in extending my sympathy to the people in those areas of the Shannon and the Tolka on the severe hardships they have endured due to extensive and severe <Col N="1928" /> flooding.  However, measures' now before us indicate that those two areas which, admittedly, have been hit worst, are being, and will be, looked after.  Having said that, I will turn to those areas which are not being catered for and for which no actual promise of material help is being held out.  A number of items has already been mentioned concerning my own county and cases have been made for other counties throughout the State, where severe hardship and distress have been occasioned by unusually heavy flooding.  There are in County Donegal four or five rivers, all of them small, as we regard rivers, but nevertheless causing very grave flooding which was particularly heavy this year.  We differ from people in Mayo, where a case has been mentioned in regard to the Moy, in that there is no real hope being held out to us that these rivers because they are relatively small in size and relatively unimportant will be dealt with in the future.  In the case of the Finn, the Deel, the Swillyburn, the Leannan there is evidence, as there has been for months past, that grave losses are being suffered not by the large ranchers with 400 or 500 acres of land but by the 20 and 30-acre farmers who have lost in some cases all their potatoes or oats or possibly both.  They may have also lost their hay.  And the possibility is that as a result of these losses earlier in the season, if the weather is anything but of the mildest type in the early spring their stocks of sheep or pigs or farm animals may also be lost through starvation because they would not have the crops to feed their animals. In addition to the losses they have already sustained there is every likelihood of further severe losses in the future unless aid is brought to them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To counteract any idea in the House or outside it that I and my colleagues in our county are now climbing on the band wagon because there seems to be something going for nothing I would like to point out that at our county council meeting some months ago we directed to the Minister for Local Government a resolution unanimously <Col N="1929" /> passed by a very mixed council&mdash; politically speaking&mdash;pointing out the very grave emergency that had arisen in our county as a result of floods as it affected the roads, particularly roads leading to our bogs in which was the fuel we needed and which has not yet been got home.  At a meeting on Tuesday that resolution had not been answered.  We have again asked that something should be done or a special grant made available to enable us to get out some of the turf that is so badly needed from the bogs.  To add to this trouble we now find that, although taking the country as a whole there are sufficient stocks of coal, stockpiled in some cases as in the Phoenix Park, and the quotas from the National Coal Board in England are fairly substantial and seem to be adequate at the moment, in our county, where we have been depending on turf to a very large extent, the turf this year due to the very bad weather is in very poor condition&mdash;any of it that was brought home; part of it is still in the bogs as it was not possible to get it out on account of the roads being torn up by floods&mdash;we now find we have to fall back on coal much more than we would have done in the normal way, but that coal is not available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the county&mdash;that there were adequate stocks of turf and coal available for merchants in County Donegal and that if there were not he would take steps to see that they were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has said that and I take it he said it in good faith, but I want to point out to him that whatever stocks he talks about as being available are not available in Donegal.  Although he may cover himself by saying that stocks are available to merchants in Donegal they are not available in Donegal.  So far as my information goes there are about <Col N="1930" /> 300,000 tons of coal in the Phoenix Park and the Dublin merchants are still importing their total quotas from the National Coal Board.  The offer we got is that: &ldquo;We will send some Phoenix Park coal from Dublin on which you will pay a freight of something over £2 a ton,&rdquo; that before it would reach the merchant in Donegal that extra charge would have to be paid, whereas the simple operation of transferring part of the National Coal Board quota from Dublin to Donegal merchants and shipping it direct to Donegal would have the effect of making coal available at recent prices rather than bringing the coal in from England to Dublin and then sending it from Dublin to Donegal at an extra cost of £2 per ton.  Our institutions at the moment are looking for over 800 tons of coal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been pointing out that our roads into our bogs have been torn up by the flooding and that in fact it is not just the last flood we are talking about because we have already made representations to the Minister for Local Government to try to relieve the situation.  Now I am pointing out the way the matter is being dealt with by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in, as I say, all good faith, but at the same time it is not a very suitable way to meet the <Col N="1931" /> needs of the people.  A resolution has now been sent to the Minister concerned asking him to do something and possibly the information I have given now may help him to do something useful.</P>
      <P>In regard to the position of farmers generally in the county another situation has arisen in relation to which a resolution was passed on last Tuesday by the Donegal County Council calling on the Minister for Local Government and the Department concerned to relieve the farmers who have suffered hardship in this particular flooding, not from paying their rates entirely for the year but from the pressure of the rate collectors in trying to collect the rates at the proper time.  That resolution has gone forward to the Minister asking for permission to set aside the requirements of the regulations so that no pressure will be brought to bear and no prosecution taken against people who have suffered hardship until 1st February.  I hope that this little facility for the relief of our people will be granted.</P>
      <P>It has been stated that the Red Cross will deal with any cases of hardship arising outside the Shannon and Tolka areas.  While the Red Cross is an admirable body in the areas in which it is functioning fully and extensively the position in Donegal leaves room for comment.  It is not thought that that body would be in a position in Donegal to assess the damage done; neither would it be regarded as the proper body to do so.  I suggest to the Minister that he put that view before his Government. Some other organisation should be available.  If necessary, such an organisation should be set up to deal with the problem of the losses incurred by the farming community outside of the Shannon area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to another matter which has been mentioned here this evening and which it has been stated is under consideration by the Minister. I refer to the wrecking of the boats at Glengad.  The recent losses have brought to a head the pressure exerted over the years to get something done for these people.  Successive Governments <Col N="1932" /> have failed to remedy the situation because they are tied up waiting for reports from their engineers.  The reports have invariably been that no engineer would stand over a proposal to provide safe anchorage in Glengad.</P>

The Government, while possibly finding itself forced into a situation in which it has to deal specifically with major problems arising from the overflowing of the Tolka and the Shannon, would want also to take cognisance of the fact that once the door is open every part of the country will put up an incessant clamour for attention.  I want in an objective way to make some constructive proposals in relation to the speedy administration of relief.  It is unfortunate that, distressing as the floods are, they should have occurred right on the very eve of Christmas.  I appeal to the Minister, even though he will have this admirable type of committee to deal with the problem, to establish some basis on which a primary initial payment will be made to deserving cases as early as possible.  Some method should be designed whereby something in the nature of an instalment might be paid on foot of claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Government, and the various members of this House, will be faced by insistent representations from people within and <Col N="1935" /> outside the areas affected, in the way of demands on the national purse to alleviate their condition.  I do feel that if the Government is to act courageously&mdash;and it seems to be the unanimous opinion of the House that the Government has acted effectively and courageously in this matter&mdash;where real distress is found&mdash;and there are thousands of cases of real distress in Dublin and I understand a tremendous number of cases of acute distress in Athlone&mdash;an effort should be made to make an initial instalment available practically forthwith of such compensatory grant as the Government proposes. I feel that unless some very effective definition is laid down as to the basis on which a claim can be made, we shall find ourselves immersed in a situation where the compilation and the investigation of claims will delay the ultimate administration of such aid as the Government desires to give.</P>
    <P>I think that some real investigation must take place in a preliminary sense before distribution is effected through any particular committee because time, in this particular season, is running against the Government.  The clamour for compensation or for alleviation will be even greater to-morrow morning than it was this morning because people will have seen the spontaneous gesture of the Oireachtas in its unanimous support of the Government's effort to alleviate their distress.  There is the problem of which I am anxious to get an elucidation in the Minister's reply.  Where is the line going to be drawn in relation to distress?  Is it to mean compensation for people who are not in a position to get immediately the essentials to rebuild their homes, whether it be bedding, furniture or a Grant-in-Aid to enable them to make their houses habitable again?  I should like some little elucidation as to what form the Grant-in-Aid to these people will take.  Is it going to be purely a monetary Grant-in-Aid or, as in cases that have been raised by Deputies here where there has been substantial loss of trading stock or a substantial loss of certain types of chattels, is it going to be a <Col N="1936" /> replacement of that particular type of goods to enable these people to carry on?</P>
    <P>This will be an extremely difficult problem and I intervene in the debate to try to direct the attention of the House to the immensity of the difficulties that are involved and to get it to preserve that unanimity which is leading to helpful inquiry without any wish to introduce an acrimonious atmosphere.  These floods have certainly, to my mind, brought into the forefront of consideration of this House the whole problem of drainage throughout the land.  Fortunately, my constituency in the main escaped the rigours and hardships of the most recent devastating storm, but the fate of the Tolka to-day and the Shannon yesterday may be the fate of any of our own areas to-morrow because of the extraordinary lack of progress so far as the general plan of the drainage throughout the land is concerned.  The Minister may well say to me that the flooding in the Shannon and in the Tolka is unprecedented.  That is true, but the effective answer to that is: no matter how unprecedented it may be, were the beds of these rivers substantially deepened?  Was the Tolka suitably cleaned and drained to meet the development that has arisen all round it?  Unprecedented as the floods were, I suggest that these rivers should have been in a far better position to discharge these flood waters than they were.  Therefore, I feel that when we are dealing with distress arising from flooding due to the conditions of these rivers, we should tackle again the general problem of drainage throughout the land.</P>
    <P>We have occasionally flooding occurring in very small rivers in our own constituencies.  I can think of many occasions where adjacent to the Island River in Skibbereen houses were inundated.  There the problem, we know, can be relieved by dredging, deepening and cleaning the river.  That brings to the forefront of our deliberations the whole question of our approach to the problem of the drainage of rivers.  You get an answer here in this House that a particular river might be reached in 1976 or even <Col N="1937" /> in the more distant future.  Surely we may say that out of evil cometh good, if these disasters have forced a reorientation of the administrative mind on the necessity of getting down to the problem of deepening our rivers generally so that they will be in a position to carry abnormal quantities of water.  I make that suggestion to the Ministers who have to deal with this problem.  There could be just thought and valuable reflection on the general problem so that we may adopt the old adage of being prepared by doing something the day of the deluge.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Ministers responsible for the administration of the token Estimates that in order to help themselves in their administration, in order to make the situation of members of this House bearable, they will have to find as soon as possible some method of definition and distinction as to the degrees of priority of claims by people who will suggest that they are distressed.  I sympathise with the Government in the difficulties they will have in administering these token Estimates. I commend them, as all other speakers have commended them, for taking the courageous line of introducing these token Estimates to enable them to do something to relieve distress but they should know in advance, and I am sure they do, that no matter how they try there will be people who will say that they did not do enough and, no matter what their best may be, it will ultimately be described as inadequate.</P>
    <P>The action of the Government, commendable as it is, is no more worthy of comment in this House than the spontaneous voluntary action of the many organisations throughout the State that helped in the crisis, whether they were the Red Cross Society, the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the Knights of Malta, Army personnel, fire brigade, Gardai or any other organisation.  It behoves this House to commend them most earnestly for all they have tried to do.</P>
    <P>Mixed views have been expressed here with regard to the function the Red Cross Society will perform in relation to other parts of the country. <Col N="1938" /> I may be wrong, and I would like to be corrected if I am, but I feel that the Red Cross Society will be used by the Government solely as the agent to relieve immediate distress in the sense of providing bedding, clothing, food and essential commodities for families that may, in fact, be distressed in areas outside the two areas specified in the token Estimates.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Government ever contemplated, as suggested by the last speaker, that the Red Cross Society might be the agency through which certain reliefs might be granted to farmers in relation to losses in crops or stock.  I would like, when the Minister is concluding, that he would tell us what the Government regard as priority claims.  I would like to know whether it will be possible to effect an instalment payment immediately to people genuinely distressed. I would be grateful if the Minister, or Ministers, could indicate to what extent the Government propose to make a free Grant-in-Aid to people and to what extent they intend to make other benefits such as interest-free loans, etc., available. Unless a clear indication is given at the beginning there may be in connection with the relief so urgently needed and so spontaneously given by the House, inordinate delays through administrative difficulties created by an overflow of claims, and consequent delay in investigation.  This is a problem which might be dealt with on the basis: &ldquo;If it were done when it is done, then it were well it was done quickly&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I compliment the Government in coming to the aid of people who have lost their property and whose homes have been flooded.  I also want to compliment the various voluntary organisations who assisted so much in the emergency.  I have been in the flooded areas in the North Strand and in the county.  The various voluntary organisations played their part very well.  First I want to compliment the Gardaí.  The full brunt of the crisis fell on the Gardaí in the North Strand area.  There was a great spirit of co-operation amongst the <Col N="1939" /> people themselves in trying to help one another.  All the organisations and everybody concerned tried to do their best.</P>
      <P>Everything that has been said in favour of the people on the North Strand is worthy of emphasis.  The people have suffered a great deal.  In my own constituency over 200 homes were badly flooded.  Only yesterday some of the homes were still flooded and the water had to be pumped out. There is the problem created by the overflowing of the Liffey.  In some houses in Lucan there were three or more feet of water.  That was the case also along the river valley, in the Strawberry Beds and the Lower Road. In the parish in which I live about 12 families had to be evacuated.  In Finglas, Mulhuddart, Clonsilla, there was flooding.  In the Mulhuddart area people had to be evacuated before the flooding took place at the North Strand.  I do not want to deal with all the areas affected because I do not want to delay the House.</P>
      <P>While the Red Cross Society have tried to relieve people who have suffered, their relief was of a temporary nature and we cannot say that it was all that the people desired.</P>
      <P>I want also to mention the case of people who have lost their furniture as a result of houses being flooded to the extent of eight and nine feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a pile of correspondence as a result of a check-up made in County Dublin through the Red Cross Society during the last week.  The Taoiseach stated that he would set up an impartial committee to go into all these matters.  A number of shopkeepers have lost their stocks.  In the Swords area one woman lost about £60 worth of cigarettes alone.  In other areas, in farms in North County Dublin especially, along the Broad Meadow River, people lost fowl and pigs and in one case a few young cattle were lost. All over the county as well as in the city we have been badly hit in a number of areas and I should like the Minister to take the city and county together for the purposes of any relief that may be given.  While the officers and men of the Red Cross went from <Col N="1940" /> the county areas into the city where they were so badly needed, we are still getting appeals from the county for help and there are still many cases of distress in the Rathcoole area where a number of houses were flooded out. My rough estimate of the effect of the floods in that area is that there were over 200 houses flooded very badly.  A number of families have lost their furniture.</P>
    <P>In cases of this sort, I would like the Minister to remember the county is very near the city and that he will treat them both on the same basis.  I think the Minister should also remember the problem in Howth where many of the fishing fleet were destroyed. Some of the boats were broken as a result of being beaten up against the harbour.  There was one man in my parish whom the Minister complimented and he was Mr. Bergin who gave help towards the relief of the flooding in the Shannon area.  I am not a bit surprised at the same man and I should like to add my thanks to those of the Minister.  In 1947, when the cattle were dying on the Dublin mountains and when we wanted to get fodder and turnips and mangolds to them, Mr. Bergin gave me £100 worth of hay for the cattle.  He is well worthy of having his name mentioned in the House for his work in the relief of distress of this kind.  I promised that I should not delay the House and the only reason I got up to speak at all was to ask the Minister to consider the County Dublin area as well as the city and to treat the people there on the same basis.  Some of them in the county are deserving of as much assistance and relief as they are in the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Declan Costello Mr. Declan Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Declan Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  It is only natural in this debate that Deputies should refer to their own constituencies because it is with those that they had direct contact with the distress that has been caused by the floods.  Therefore, I make no apologies for referring to the Chapelizod area and for bringing the conditions there to the notice of the Minister.  The last speaker referred to the flooding in the Liffey Valley and I think it should not be forgotten that when the authority which it is proposed to set up, and the <Col N="1941" /> various voluntary authorities which are working already, are dealing with the distress in Dublin, any relief which is given should not be given merely to the North Strand area.  There can be no doubt that they have suffered in the North Strand more than in any other place in the whole country I would say, but there is equally no doubt that in the Chapelizod area in a restricted way there has been a number of families who have suffered as much as some of the families in the greater district of the North Strand.</P>
      <P>It is true that surveyors have been out in Chapelizod and that an effort is being made to get out bedding, mattresses and blankets to the area.  It does, however, seem to me that we should not forget that in Chapelizod there are 50 small houses in which the flood waters rose to a depth of five or six feet and that as a result in one particular case with which I am personally acquainted, one man with his wife and eight children are living in one room, the roof of which he has tried to prop up with timber from the yard.  I am bringing these matters to the notice of the Minister because I feel that the problem is a nation-wide one and it is possible that in a restricted area conditions might be overlooked.</P>
      <P>It seems that the present problem can be divided into two parts&mdash;the immediate vital one of getting bedding and fuel to some cases and of giving food to the people who have suffered in this disaster.  It is true that the emergency, like the waters, has receded, but it has not gone in Chapelizod. There they were still facing the effects of the flooding this afternoon. The second aspect is what you would call the long term one of compensation, and we have been told that the basis of compensation is the relief of distress, but I should like to stress that it is not such a very long term aspect at all.  Speed is very essential in the relief of this distress which will only be aggravated by delay.  Some delay may be necessary and must inevitably follow the setting up of what must be a complicated machinery to deal with the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One last matter I should like to refer to, and that is that some <Col N="1942" /> speakers have referred in the course of the debate to the necessity for investigating the cause of the flooding. I should like to raise my voice also with those speakers who have already suggested that some investigation should be made.  I am not thinking primarily of fixing any legal liability on any person or any body or any company but only referring to the natural anxiety which I know is felt, certainly in the Chapelizod area and also surrounding the Tolka, that though this sort of thing has not happened in the memory of most people living, it could happen again.  There have been rumours that it was not completely the work of nature that brought the river to the high point which it reached in the Liffey Valley near Chapelizod.  As I say they are only rumours, but it would be well that they should be investigated, particularly from the point of view of giving an assurance that such steps as are possible would be taken to see that weirs are kept clean and that a proper and adequate warning could be given in the event of any similar happening such as we have experienced in the last two weeks.  I want to say in conclusion that the experience which I have had&mdash;and it was much less than that of the other Deputies who have spoken during the debate&mdash;of the work of the voluntary organisations as being a very happy one.  I refer not only to the work by the voluntary organisations but by the officials of the corporation.</P>
    <P>I think their work demonstrates what our own people are capable of when faced with an emergency.  We have had a fine example of civic spirit, put into operation to help the people who have suffered from what amounts to an act of God.  It is good to see that this emergency and this great distress have been met in the way that they have been met&mdash;on a non-political basis &mdash;and it is proper that we in this House should thank the people who have worked so hard and, by our unanimous decision, do everything possible to assist those who have suffered so much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody here agrees with the tributes paid to the <Col N="1943" /> various services and organisations that assisted in relieving and in dealing with the disaster which occurred in various parts of the country.  I think there is a lesson to be learned from all this, that is, the value of such organisations as, say, the Red Cross and the Army, quite apart from war emergency conditions with which most people have associated them.  These disasters have shown that bodies of this nature, some of them State bodies like the Garda Síochána and the Army, others, voluntary bodies like the Irish Red Cross and the St. John Ambulance Brigade, have a rôle to play in certain extraordinary circumstances, and that they can be of such value in these circumstances to the community as to amply repay any expenditure that has been incurred on them in years when apparently we were getting no return.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I would like personally to join with other Deputies in a tribute to those services, whether State or voluntary.  Certainly I would like to join in pointing out their usefulness, but most of all I would like to take up a thread I think the last speaker unravelled, namely, the question that this can happen again, and what is the best way of dealing with it.  It is perfectly obvious that if you have these organisations at a high pitch they can be most flexibly ready to deal with such a situation.  It is, therefore, not at all away from the subject matter of this motion to remark that it would be very good policy for the State in each and every year to pay some attention to the fostering of these voluntary organisations and to the developing of the State organisations even to the extent of spending a little more on them for the purpose of insurance against such contingencies as we have had to face within the recent month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of the Army, the Army Engineering Corps and other units of the Army can prove themselves extremely useful to the Government which happens to be in office in dealing immediately with such a problem.  Because of the nature of their training they can be efficient in dealing with it and that in itself is something to justify the annual expenditure <Col N="1944" /> on these bodies over and above what is justified by mere defence against a possible war emergency.</P>
    <P>In connection with the point raised by Deputy Costello as to the future would it not be a good thing, in dealing with emergency problems such as the Government is dealing with at the moment to have the Army Corps of Engineers and similar bodies at the disposal of the State&mdash;not unco-ordinated, I hasten to add, with, say, the drainage department in the Board of Works and so on&mdash;strictly related to this question of the protection of what I might call in this connection dangerous waterways? Would it not be an economic and useful task for Army engineers to have them spend some of their time studying the problems of a tributary of the Shannon that could be the cause of a big emergency intake in the Shannon in times of great rainfall and be a contributing factor to flooding.  Would it not be a good idea if these specialists, trained engineers, with certain troops at their disposal, which would be there in any event, devoted some of their time to examining and working on such a problem and giving a useful return on it?  Would that not go a long way towards justifying their existence and their establishment?</P>
    <P>Let us consider the valley of the Tolka.  Ever since I was a little boy in Dublin everybody in Dublin had heard of the Tolka and its floods.  It was notorious, particularly in the Drumcondra area, but anyone who cares to look at the record of the past week will find that the Tolka right back as far as Fairyhouse, anyway, is a dangerous river and has frequently proved itself to be dangerous.  There is obviously an engineering problem posed in respect of that river.  Fortunately, the calamity does not always reach the dimensions it reached this time in the North Strand area but people with a fair knowledge of this river will remark that it was not as dangerous in other regions this time as it had been on previous occasions.  There is a river that would repay some engineering study for the purpose of finding a solution for the problem of flooding.</P>
    <P>I am making the suggestion here <Col N="1945" /> that perhaps the Government would consider the relation between, say, the Engineering Corps of the Army and the Board of Works or whatever other bodies are available.  In the Shannon area we have already seen the Army in another role.  They have a certain amount of training in combined action in dealing with problems which apparently no other body could deal with, even if it were only sandbagging to save a local area in a town, and so on, work with which armies are fairly well familiar.  In the suggestion I am making I do not want to take from the value of the present move on the part of the Government.  If we are looking at the long term aspect here is something we can examine, the provision of facilities for them in the future for their development.  Giving them a definite task with a definite interest would be a good thing and I need not delay further on that.</P>
    <P>In regard to some of the voluntary organisations, let us consider the Irish Red Cross.  We know that body had a very useful history during the emergency and I have no doubt that during the emergency, had it been necessary, that body would have been a very useful service in the city at any rate.  Since the war there has been a tendency to forget about this except on the part of a few enthusiasts or some people who have a long view of things.  Is it not obvious to us now that such a voluntary organisation as that is valuable and should get every encouragement?  However, we must be realists and understand that mere encouragement is not enough, that an organisation of that sort, if it is to be effective must have certain equipment, at least certain facilities, and that translated into plain language means funds.  The present surprise, for which one must pay them tribute, is that on this occasion they should have been there in such an organised form and so immediately ready in spite of the adverse conditions in the years since the war.  In saying that I do not mean in any way to minimise the good work that has been done by the St. John Ambulance Brigade.</P>
    <P>All this again is simply directed to this long-term point.  Our rivers are <Col N="1946" /> our rivers and our climate is our climate, and if we have a heavy rainfall and perhaps storm conditions, that may mean flooding and disaster for some.  We provide against other contingencies and we should, therefore, insure and provide against this particular contingency and prevent it as far as we can.  The answer is, I think, survey first, positive engineering to minimise anticipated risks, and eliminate them if possible.  That can be done economically by using the services that are already there like the Army Engineering Corps in particular and thereafter the insurance of having bodies like the Red Cross Society up to pitch so that they can be relied upon to deal with these contingencies. That is the main reason why I have intervened in this debate.</P>
    <P>There is one further point on these voluntary organisations and peculiarly enough those organisations which have a local basis have a very great advantage over any State organisation in the cases of distress such as we have had and that statement has more force where the distress is widespread than where it is localised for the reason that those organisations, especially those that have local branches can get right down to the root of the matter, can get to the individual cases more effectively and more expeditiously than can any large impersonal body under the immediate control of the State. That is why, for instance, a society such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which is well known to all of us, and societies like that, may perhaps, be the most useful agents we can have at the stage we are dealing with now.  The immediate emergency stage called for the Army, the Red Cross, the ambulance service and the Fire Brigade&mdash;and while talking about that I think a tribute to the Dublin Fire Brigade is very much in order. Now we are at the second stage&mdash;the relief of distress that has been caused, and a society like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul as well as the Red Cross and the St. John Ambulance Brigade in Dublin City&mdash;I am not presuming to talk for the country because I have not sufficient experience of conditions there, but I would imagine similar remarks would hold&mdash;the <Col N="1947" /> Catholic social services and bodies of that nature should be availed of, I would submit to the Minister, for these reasons.  They can establish personal contact: they can bring relief in the most palatable, efficacious and most charitable way.  They can also bring relief in the most economic way.</P>
    <P>The Minister will, I think, appreciate what I mean when I put it this way&mdash; if one were to set up a statutory fund, for instance, it would become a matter of law and administration: it would be an impersonal matter: you would have claims, not <i>bona fide</i> as well as <i>bona fide:</i> you would have all the complications of administration, as we know, in connection with claims against public funds: the same type of need of investigation: the same unfortunate situation in which very often the least deserving receives help before the most deserving and so on.  All that can be eliminated in one stroke if use is made of parish or local organisations like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Catholic Social Service Conference and the Red Cross.  These units are severely local but have the advantage of knowing the local area, knowing the facts and knowing who is hardest hit and who is not so hard hit, of knowing the priorities and strains.  I would suggest to the Minister that in the administration of any moneys the Government is going to put forward that every means of using such societies in such a way should be explored and considered as far as possible. I want to emphasise that as far as I can.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  I know it is already agitating certain people who are concerned with local government administration.  It is the difficulty that if the Government attempts to administer the aid completely as a State-controlled matter, they are to a certain extent inviting legal actions.  It is not easy for a Government to avoid charges &mdash;if they give public funds directly to one person as against another&mdash;of unfair discrimination on the grounds that all citizens are equal before the law and so on.  I need not expand on that, but I think the Minister will appreciate the possible difficulty I see here in this <Col N="1948" /> connection.  Perhaps the most expeditious, economic and efficacious way of administering funds of this nature is to use such voluntary organisations as I have mentioned in the implementing of the Government's decision and in the distribution of funds.  If the funds cannot be given directly to them to dispose of, at least these agencies should be organised as a rapid means of operating the more cumbersome administrative methods that must of necessity attach to State machinery.</P>
    <P>This damage and distress is very widespread, but still it can be sectioned up into areas, and obviously it can be more quickly dealt with by taking areas individually, rather than having one fund to deal with the whole lot. These are all matters of administration and there may be difficulties that I do not see in the approach I am suggesting and, if there are, they will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>Deputies have talked of their own constituencies but there is one particular area&mdash;Glasnevin&mdash;that should be mentioned in connection with the damage that has been done by the Tolka.  In the Glasnevin area, and in fact along the whole line of the Tolka, people would be vitally interested in the preventive measures I have mentioned. I think it is no harm for us to realise that although the disaster in Dublin City and the widespread destruction along the line of the Shannon have attracted most attention, there are probably widespread throughout the whole country other areas and other patches which must not be forgotten in this.  This is not a question merely of disaster along the Shannon and in Dublin.  There are other areas of which I have heard also involved. Deputy Killilea has drawn attention to an area in the vicinity of Tuam.  We all know that in the vicinity of some of the coastal areas some material damage has been done.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be very fair to press the Minister too far for his intentions because it takes a certain amount of time for the whole picture to evolve, and, as I say, this is the Government's first, shall I say, immediate measure to deal with the situation, and they would have to see what the whole picture is <Col N="1949" /> before there can be any finality about their plan to deal with it.  There are, as the Taoiseach said, the problems of relieving distress and rehabilitating people affected in their personal lives, houses to be cleaned up and made habitable and repaired, essential things like bedding to be replaced, hospital accommodation to be provided for people who have suffered consequential illness and so on.  In the long term there would be other types of claims to be met, for instance, the question for the farmers of the rehabilitation of land seriously damaged in certain areas by floods&mdash;although I understand that sometimes flooding brings a silt which is in fact not detrimental but beneficial.  There may be the question of providing fertilisers or replacing stock, replacing some forage that has been lost&mdash;all these things come into the second stage.</P>
    <P>We can understand that this poses a very serious and difficult problem for the Administration which has to face it. There is, too, the question of boats but, since other Deputies have dealt with that, I shall not delay the House any further in the matter.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the first two phases. Possibly there will be a third phase and now is the time to think out the measures for ensuring either that that third phase will not eventuate or that, should it materialise, we will be in a position to take steps to cope with it. I do not know how far the climatic conditions of the present flooding affect the prospects of agriculture in the coming year.  I am told that if the rainfall continues in the new year for any appreciable time a serious problem will develop since certain more or less acute food shortages may occur the year after. This is the time to take precautionary measures in that respect.  No such measures can be taken unless a proper survey is made.  The Government would be wise now to have some kind of survey made to ensure food supplies for both man and beast in the coming year.  We know that this year has not been a good year for potatoes.  I do not know how far the wet conditions from July onwards have affected the crop but there are rumours that potatoes will probably be very scarce before <Col N="1950" /> next year's crop comes in.  A question arises as to whether it is likely that next year's crop will be safe because of weather trends.  What steps can be taken now in that regard?  Frankly, I do not think I should develop that any further.  It is no use being gloomy. We should look at the bright side of things.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister needs it.  I do not raise this from the point of view of being merely gloomy.  I mention the matter not from a sense of gloom but from a sense of urgency.  Now is the time for the Government to deal as expeditiously as possible through these voluntary organisations with the immediate distress and then go on from that to deal with the rehabilitation or compensation of the people affected.  Since we are here acting for the people let us spread the burden that has fallen so heavily on the people in the North Strand and the Shannon area over the community as a whole because, otherwise, it is the community who will have to carry the burden anyway and rehabilitate these people.  Let us then try to prepare schemes and take action to prevent such a thing happening again, at least on the scale on which it has happened recently.  Lastly, I would urge the Minister and his colleagues very earnestly to make a sober survey of the prospects on the lines I have suggested in relation to agriculture generally and food supplies for the coming year.  The Government should take action to ensure that we will safely negotiate sowing and harvesting so that weather trends will have no adverse effects.  If all these things are done the country will be the better for them.  Services like the Army, the Garda Síochana, the Fire Brigade, the Red Cross and the St. John Ambulance Brigade have given good service.  The way to recognise that service is to make further use of such organisations so long as the problem exists, to build them up and make them strong to meet such problems if ever they occur again.</P>

      <P>Coming from a constituency that is flooded almost yearly I hasten to add my voice to the other voices raised here in sympathy with the people who have been visited with such material damage of such a great magnitude.  In my constituency of North Mayo there is flooding from the River Moy and from the lesser rivers in that area every year for many years past.  If there is one lesson to be learned it is the lesson that the time has come when the Government of the day, whatever Government it be, should take immediate cognisance of the fact that the drainage of our rivers, big and small, is a major problem and should be given the priority it deserves, the priority which the people living in proximity to these rivers deserve from any Government.</P>
      <P>For too long in my short experience in public life has the drainage problem here been made the subject of political fiddle-strings, played to the best advantage as election succeeds election. It is from such dire calamity as that with which we have been recently visited and from the effects of which we are still suffering that we must learn our lesson.  Some of our people have learned it the hard way.  Some have learned it to a lesser extent than others.  When the immediate problem of relieving present distress has been satisfactorily dealt with the Government, with all the forces at its disposal, should get down at once to the task of reviewing our drainage problem.</P>
      <P>It is true, as previous speakers have said, that we must admire the civic spirit of our people and their capacity for endurance.  If given a proper lead the people in this country, big and small, have the necessary civic spirit and the capacity to endure, to live and to work, in order to bring about a situation wherein such dire calamity as that which visited us recently can at least be relieved, if not stopped. Someone said this can happen again. Of course it can happen if the necessary precautions are not taken and the lesson learned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major de Valera has asked that the voluntary organisations be ready.  It <Col N="1952" /> must be said in tribute to such organisations, to the Army and the Gardaí, that they were ready in this recent emergency.  They did commendable work, and are still doing it.  He also urged a survey of conditions.  That could be tied in with my earlier exhortations. I disagree with the Deputy when he urges the Government to cast upon the shoulders of these voluntary organisations the administrative work necessitated by this calamity, a calamity which springs from drainage, or the administrative functions of drainage itself.  The voluntary organisations must survive for the most part on the enthusiasm and energy put into them and on the popularity which they are able to retain.  I think it would be grossly unfair to saddle these organisations with work which is primarily the function of this Assembly or the local authority.  Voluntary organisations fulfil their own purpose. That has been admirably demonstrated in this recent emergency.  The Government has acted with commendable promptitude.  Everybody, from the Taoiseach down, has expressed gratitude to those countries and organisations which so readily offered help and assistance.  I should like to add, if it has not been already mentioned&mdash;and if it has been mentioned I want to add to it the more vehemently&mdash;that our thanks are due as well in no small way to our brethren in Northern Ireland who stood by with their ambulances, ready to cross the Border and come to our assistance if required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>In this debate, no doubt we are likely to be influenced by the abnormal condition of things with which we are confronted and which we are trying to redress.  The abnormal weather conditions have been such that not only have they resulted in severe hardship to the community but they have brought fear even into the minds of people who are accustomed to such calamities and a feeling that there may yet be something in the form of some disastrous visitation the extent of which they may not be able to determine with reasonable certainty beforehand. Therefore in discussing this problem as it exists to-night, we must bear in mind the fact that any effort <Col N="1953" /> we make or any decisions we may reach must be limited, to the extent that we are unable to estimate what the next few months may bring forth. We are dealing with conditions that are not measurable or that cannot be estimated by any mathematical calculations. We are dealing with the unknown and faced with uncertainty in regard to the hardships that future weather conditions may create.  We are likely no doubt to be influenced very strongly at the moment by the damage we have seen, by the abnormal flooding and the extent of the lakes that now exist where green fields of crops grew a few months ago and where for centuries back cattle grazed leisurely. In some cases these areas are now turbulent lakes.  The extent to which we can alleviate that situation is very limited indeed, even if we were to devote all our resources to it.  They are insufficient to deal with the problem of the continuous rain which brings about abnormal flooding, a condition that even terrorises and drives to dismay the deepest thinkers and scientists we have.  Such is the position with which we are confronted now.</P>
      <P>To form any rational decision under these circumstances is I think to expect too much from us.  All that we can do, and all that is proposed to be done is to launch a campaign to assist our more immediately distressed neighbours and to say to those who have suffered most, that we are prepared to share with them, so far as the resources of the State will permit, the losses which they have suffered and to spread the loss evenly on the shoulders best capable of bearing the burden.  That is really the most any Government can do at this juncture.  It is a grand thing to see the unanimous support accorded to the Government's efforts to come to the aid of these people but the Government in no way are doing more than is due from them.  It is true they are doing nothing less than their best but there is no special thanks due to any Government for doing their best in these circumstances.  No Government, I do not care what Government was in office, confronted with the same situation would do less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate problem that confronts <Col N="1954" /> us is to ensure a fair administration of the aid which it is proposed to provide.  We must not allow ourselves to be stampeded into the notion that because the calamitous condition of the flooding has brought such sorrow and distress to certain people, we must rush out lavishly to compensate them or more than compensate them. I have mentioned that we have not been able to estimate the extent to which damage may yet occur in the stricken areas and we must face the possibility that a period of flooding may yet arise which may require even more stringent measures than, in the exuberance of our sympathy for those who suffered in the recent floods, we are prepared to provide for them now. It must be remembered also that there are people living in backward districts who have suffered severely also but these people have no access to the publicity which is afforded to centres such as the Shannon area is and the basin of the Tolka river.  People living along the Shannon and the Tolka are in close proximity to institutions which afford them the widest publicity.  There are journalists anxious to fill their newspapers with thrilling stories of the disaster which befell these people and photographers to provide striking pictures of the ensuing hardship.  I speak for an area that has no photographers or no journalists to ventilate their grievances.  We have in that district the continuous bog and the mountainous stretch that at all times make life hard and existence very strenuous for those who live there.</P>
    <P>What is the difference between those people and the victims of the floods in other areas?  The people in these backward districts live in an area that has been perhaps in no way subject to intense flooding but they have a condition of continuous rain and small flooding which has destroyed their crops, their turf, their oats and their hay.  Surely the measures to provide relief for distress will not be withdrawn from them because they have no pictures in the papers to show intense flooding in these areas?  They live under conditions as difficult as any that exist along the Tolka or the Shannon.</P>
    <P>I hope that in considering what is reasonable help for those afflicted by <Col N="1955" /> the recent flooding, those responsible for distributing aid from the resources of the State will bear in mind that it is not always the big headline that conveys news of the greatest sacrifice and that the small unwritten story is often as poignant as the most graphic description that can be penned by the hand of a journalist.  The Government have taken responsibility to meet the situation generously and quickly.  The water that has flown under the bridges left the crops rotting on the fields, turf on the bogs or conveyed the crops with it.  The situation must be remedied to the extent that it is possible to remedy it and that will be a very moderate extent.</P>
    <P>Consider the situation in a frontal way.  What can be done now to save the situation?  The stock that was taken off the fields this autumn was in a very poor condition.  Grazing was poor.  The quality of hay is poor.  The quantity of feeding oats available is almost negligible in many parts.  What is to substitute for these?  Cattle in poor condition that are left to wander in the open and that have poor feeding are very vulnerable to all the diseases that afflict animals.  I admit that the Government are as anxious to do what is right as any other Government could be but as one coming from the poorer parts of the country it is my opinion and it is the opinion of experienced farmers that the reserve of feeding stuffs is insufficient.  We know the value of our cattle and the contribution it represents to the revenue and to our very existence.  We should not content ourselves with dealing on this occasion with the damage that has been done to crops but we should try to estimate and to deal with the consequences that may accrue to live stock by reason of the poor harvest.</P>
    <P>The Government should make a contribution in the form of a loan, in the form of cheap feeding stuffs.  Let us not depend on the meagre quantity of poor quality feeding stuffs available this year.  The Government should make available subsidised feeding stuffs to ensure that at least one mash a day will be made available for cattle to every farmer who is prepared to <Col N="1956" /> make some effort.  Give him interest-free money.  Give him feeding stuffs at reduced prices.  Remember that the live stock is the salvation and the lifeblood of the nation and that it has kept us in existence and was the means by which we were able to import essential raw material for factories and essential feeding stuffs.  The animal that is lost by a small farmer in Leitrim represents the loss of a fortune to him and he has no means of replacing it.  The Government should try to preserve that stock for him.  That can be done by giving the farmer some assistance at this stage to enable him to feed the animals during the coming three or four months.  If the farmer is left without the means of giving that additional ration to his animals he will be impoverished for many years.</P>
    <P>With regard to seeds, the quality available after the last harvest for spring sowing either of potatoes or oats is very poor and it would be the duty of a Government to make provision that seeds, wherever procurable, of good quality, should be made available for the coming spring.</P>
    <P>There is a great shortage of fuel on many farms throughout the country. Were I capable of describing the conditions that I have witnessed in the past few months in some homes I could draw tears from even the most hardened Ministers.  It is a dreadful thing to see a home without a fire.  I have seen such homes and they exist not in small numbers.  If a farmer has not his own fuel he goes without.  He must depend on whatever piece of timber may be found on the farm and saw it up.  Very often it is only whitethorn. In view of the widespread loss and the difficulty of procuring a turf supply from the bogs, whether at high elevation or low elevation, this year, the Minister should consider asking the Department of Social Welfare or some other branch of his Department to do something to relieve the distress that impoverishes more than the absence of food very often, that is, the lack of fuel.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that every Deputy is well aware of what the situation is and is endeavouring to do his best to alleviate the distress.  We appreciate <Col N="1957" /> the efforts of those in the front line who have taken the lead.  We thank them.  We wish them good luck and we hope that conditions next year will leave us in a more favourable position so that we may do without the help that was necessary this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening for five hours to this debate, awaiting an opportunity to remind the House that there is such a place as County Monaghan on the map of Ireland.  One would think that there are no hardships anywhere in this country outside Dublin City and the River Shannon.  Some of my Donegal colleagues told us about conditions there.  As the Minister for Agriculture knows very well, there are flooded areas in County Monaghan, too.  Take for example, the Glyde drainage.  The Glyde was drained very well right down through County Louth, into County Monaghan in the parish of Killina, but stopped there, jumped about two miles up river, and cleaning commenced again.  They cleaned well back the river, but the rains came and all the water from up-stream came down into the portion that was not cleaned, with the result that many acres are flooded in the Carrickmacross area.  People there have lost their crops and their crops to them are just as valuable as the crops of the people on the Shannon or the stocks of the shopkeepers on the North Strand.  I would like to remind the Minister that there is a duty to compensate these people just as much as there is to compensate the others.</P>
      <P>I am not going to add anything to what the other speakers have said during the past five hours.  It would be an endeavour to push through an open door.  I realise fully that all sections in this House are prepared to do the best they can to relieve the hardships of the recent floods.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I know that the matter was brought to his attention, and I know he sent the Board of Works <Col N="1958" /> engineers to that area and that inside 24 hours the flooding had ceased for the time being, thanks to the Minister. In connection with that matter there have been considerable losses in the potato crop and I should like if the Minister could see his way, when distributing the funds for the relief of distress, that the poor people of that particular area who have suffered the loss of their entire crop, should get some compensation.  Up in County Monaghan at a place called Tullygloss near Ballytrain, a large area has become flooded. I passed through the district the other day and I found many acres under floods.  The Blackwater, north of Monaghan town, about 35 miles from where I live, is, I believe, a swamp for miles and miles.  Then there is the Ballybay area, which the Minister knows very well.  You would think it is a seaside place at the moment.  There are acres and acres under water there. I do not blame the Minister for these conditions; they are due to the River Erne drainage, and until the Erne is drained properly in Northern Ireland, any scheme on this side cannot be a success.  I have been some time trying to get something done locally there, but to no avail, and now I hope that these unprecedented floods will direct attention to the position and will speed up the relief of the people there. I live on the borders of County Louth &mdash;in fact with one foot in Louth and one in Monaghan&mdash;and I was speaking to Mr. Aiken this morning about a flooded area in Rosslough, one mile from where I live.  There is an individual there who has suffered from five feet of water.  Fortunately for him he lives in a two-storey house and he was able to go upstairs with his family until the floods disappeared, but he cannot get out of his place.  This is only seven or eight miles from Dundalk town.  I am glad to see that Deputy Coburn is in the House at the moment.  I merely mention this case to show that the hardships are widespread and that it is wrong to think that the hardships are confined to either Dublin or the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard some talk during the debate about co-operation by voluntary organisations and I should like to say that if any one wished to see voluntary <Col N="1959" /> organisations working to perfection to come down to the County Monaghan or to go to Donegal or Cavan, three Ulster counties, where we all work on the co-operative system.  In emergencies such as this we do not run for the Red Cross or the Army or the St. Vincent de Paul Society or any other of these voluntary organisations.  We help one another and when we are in distress we have not to go to the neighbour.  He comes to us to save our crops and we go to him to save his.  For a perfect example of co-operative spirit you have to go down to rural Ireland and forget the paid and moneyed organisations.  I suggest to the Minister that compensation would be paid to those people whom I have mentioned as well as to those along the Shannon and in the North Strand.  I suggest that the flooding all over the country be examined and that something be done to help the people affected particularly in the County Monaghan.</P>

It is also obvious of course that the Estimate must go through to-night and that some arrangement would be made whereby the Minister would be given authority to deal with the distress in the flooded areas.

      <P>I should like to join in the vote of sympathy to the victims of the floods in the various parts of the country.  I think however that we largely deserve what we got but I also believe that it was the innocent who suffered most from the floods.</P>
      <P>It took such a calamity to shake us out of our national complacency.  We squabbled and fought in this House on small matters for 25 years.  It is only a few weeks ago since we had here a hot and bitter debate; a short while later we had a flood on the North Strand. It is a pity the flood that reached the North Strand did not reach this House at the time of the wheat debate so that this House would have been the victim instead of the North Strand.  We have wasted millions and millions of pounds in trying to build big highways in this country while we have neglected our rivers, the source of all flooding.</P>
      <P>This flooding may be new to many people in the North Strand but it is nothing new to the Shannon valley or to the several families in County Meath.  There is one widow within two or three miles of Dunboyne who was flooded out not once but four or five times in the last ten years and people had to come to the assistance of herself and her family.  She had to suffer silently.  No national Government or local government came to her. This flooding has been taking place over a long number of years but very little is done about it or about the flooding in Trim, Navan and Kilcock and flooding in Dunboyne over the last 12 or 15 years.  But now that we have a real flood we are all going to do everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say the Government has acted promptly in this emergency and has got the nation's thanks for doing so. National funds are necessary and the nation is entitled to put its funds at the disposal of the victims.  I do not want to see private enterprise squeezed <Col N="1962" /> out and every person, rich or poor, should be encouraged to come forward with subscriptions.</P>
    <P>There is much distress in County Meath and I know that not one of those people will get a penny out of the national fund because they do not come under the North Strand or Shannon area.  They need money badly because they are mostly poverty-stricken people.  There are two or three dozen people living in the town of Navan who were flooded out and their furniture and bedding have to be left there rotting.  This has happened for the fifth or sixth time and I hope the Government will see that the Red Cross who are disbursing the money in the country areas will have the money in readiness to alleviate sufferers in this area.  I realise no Government could put the whole country under national funds because it would take the whole Budget for the year to alleviate all the suffering.  It would mean taking the money from the people and giving it back to them again.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the voluntary organisations throughout this country.  Those silent workers have done a great job, the Order of the Knights of Malta, the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Ambulance Corps, and so on.  We never hear about them but they are always there when distress is around.  I will give them the nation's thanks.  I do not give the nation's thanks to people who are paid.  It is their duty to do it, but I am glad we have organisations in this country, whether they are paid or not, which act competently, but I give credit particularly to those silent societies which have done so much.</P>
    <P>There are certain problems for the future.  There is one poor man living beside me on a 12-acre farm.  He has six or seven children and his house was flooded to a depth of three feet of water and the neighbours had to come to their rescue.  He has tried to get a county council cottage built but without success; he has tried to get the Land Commission to help him to build a house but there was nothing doing.  I am seeing to-night that this man's case is brought before the Minister <Col N="1963" /> for Lands immediately so that something will be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very active and vocal in seeing that the Shannon valley is cleared out, but I want him to pay attention to County Meath so that people who have been flooded out there are provided with houses.  I hope when this emergency is over, when the floods are allayed and the victims are reasonably satisfied, that the nation's resources will be concentrated on eliminating flooding for the future. There is too much money being spent on the highways of this country.  We all like good roads but we do not want these skating rinks on which the money is being spent.  I would ask the Government to concentrate on seeing that the rivers of this country are cleaned up no matter what the cost is.</P>
    <P>There is a question of the River Boyne.  I want to see red tape cut and the engineers surveying that river not in three or four years but in one year.  The Boyne has given endless trouble for a long number of years.  It has flooded the two Black-waters. Of course this is the worst flood we ever had and I hope the Government will see that money is raised in the interests of the people for clearing out the debris that is choking these rivers.  I have been told that the River Boyne has islands growing on it with large trees as big as was ever grown in the Phoenix Park.  That is a disgrace to the nation.  There are seven miles between Trim and Navan and those islands should be taken out&mdash;we have enough bulldozers to do that now.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;I know he is the strongest member in the House&mdash;to use his influence with the other Ministers to tackle the problem in these areas.  He tackled this problem some six or seven years ago and he has done great work but I am satisfied that he started at the wrong end.  He should have started at Drogheda and cleaned the Boyne from there and then dealt with the tributaries.  Flooding has occurred in half the County of Kildare and in half of Meath and still nothing is done about it.  I hope the Minister for Finance, who comes from Kildare, will <Col N="1964" /> see that the town of Kilcock gets its share of the National Fund for this purpose.</P>
    <P>These rivers are deliberately neglected for the simple reason that money was being spent on vote catching and I blame Fianna Fáil for that. They spent 20 years of national wealth in sucking people to their camp to get votes.  There were inducements such as free milk, free fuel, free everything, when they should have given men a decent wage, given them a spade or shovel, abolished the dole and close down the labour exchange and give the people work and in that way strengthen the Irish economy.  Of course, that work would not be seen. They had to go to the houses of the poor and hand them in the money.</P>
    <P>That is as far as I am going to go on this.  I want to say that the flooding to-day was caused by the tomfoolery of yesterday when we had millions of pounds squandered in this country, and if the money had been spent in the right way it would have meant that the rivers would have been drained so that no matter how big the floods were in the Tolka or in the Shannon they would abate themselves in 48 hours because the water would have a means of getting away.  It is not we who are sitting in this House who are paying for the damage caused by the floods but the poor unfortunate people living in basements and the people who had three or four cattle and saw them floating out in the water.  What about all the money that is spent on the high roads to bring in the Jews and the Gentiles and the tourists from abroad so that they could enjoy themselves and have a good time here?</P>

There would be no need to worry about the victims of the Tolka and the Shannon floods if the £50,000,000 or £100,000,000 that was wasted had been spent in putting proper beds into those rivers.  Now, we have hundreds and thousands of victims.  Some people in the Dublin and Shannon areas will get a reasonable amount of compensation although they may not be fully compensated, but what about the men in the Midlands who will not get a bob at all? What about the men in County Meath who saw their stooks and stacks floating away?  No Red Cross will come to the people in the Midlands.  They will have to get their brooms and clean out their own houses.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Government and the House to wake up to their responsibilities and ensure that before another flood comes money will be spent in the right way.  I know an enormous amount of money will be spent now, and I know that a lot of tricksters and thimbleriggers who are not entitled to it will try to get some of it.  Some of them are now going around with new suits on their backs that they got from the Red Cross, and I know that in the Midlands some men who sold their turf a few weeks before the flood said that their turf was lost and had the Red Cross rushing to them with a ton of coal.</P>
      <P>I hope the committee that is to be set up will go very carefully into everything and will put on oath people who are trying to &ldquo;chance their arm.&rdquo; When the committee meets people who have genuinely suffered I hope they will meet them fully and 100 per cent. The tricksters should be put into Mountjoy.  The Government will have many headaches before they alleviate all the distress caused by these floods, and the people who are suffering now are not really victims of the floods but are victims of mean and cheap politics in this country in the past.</P>

      <P>Other speakers <Col N="1966" /> have made no apology for talking about their own areas and I make no apology for talking about County Mayo.  I feel sorry for the people of my native county to-night.  Thousands of them have been looking for exchanges of land for the past 20 or 30 years, and it is not much consolation to them to know that a Minister for Lands from their own county is now putting the people of 50 square miles of land before the people of Mayo on the priority list.  We do not grudge the people of the North Strand or of the Shannon anything that they get from money voted here for relief of their distress, but I cannot help feeling that the farmers of Mayo who suffered very great distress, too, must feel sad to-night to know that the Government can offer the people of 50 square miles an exchange of holding while they as individuals have been looking for an exchange for the past 20 or 30 years.</P>

      <P>The people of my county, of East Mayo, were told this very evening that they can wait until the Moy, the Corrib, the Suck, the Finn, and goodness knows how many other rivers have been drained before they can benefit from the drainage of the Boyle catchment area.  These people found their cocks of hay floating about in the past two or three months: they went out and found the turf they had laboured to save and put into ricks buried under seven or eight feet of water.  They were told this evening that they were not going to get anything out of the moneys voted by the Oireachtas.  I said, and I repeat, that I do not grudge to the people of North Strand or the people of the Shannon basin anything they are getting.  We in the Opposition are co-operating with the Government in voting moneys for the relief of distress.  What I am saying is that all the people of my county who suffered almost as bad a calamity in the past three or four months will get nothing out of what we are doing to-night, and whatever hope they had of getting an exchange of lands before, they are now 50 square miles further away from it, and a Mayo man was Minister for Lands in the Cabinet which made that decision.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The small man never gets a chance.  I think I have made it clear that Mayo will suffer rather than gain by this.  I defy contradiction on that.  I suggest to the Government that inasmuch as the Taoiseach has asked voluntary subscribers to continue to send in money for the relief of distress throughout the country and inasmuch as we are now voting moneys for only two defined areas, all the money that comes from outside bodies should be devoted to areas other than the North Strand and the Shannon basin.  In that way we would be endeavouring to solve some very urgent problems outside these two areas.  I do not think the voluntary contributors would object if that course were adopted by the Government.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy who has spoken has said that in his constituency there is at least one case of severe hardship as a result of the recent flooding. Deputy Kenny, Deputy Giles, Deputy McQuillan, Deputy Lindsay and every other Deputy to whom I listened was able to give an example of grave hardship in his constituency.  I appreciate that small sums of money will not solve all these problems but in cases of illness or where there is a large number of children in a family I think these voluntary contributions should be devoted to alleviating that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once upon a time an Irishman was too proud to accept money by way of charity.  He insisted on making his own way in life.  All the world over as a result of social legislation that pride has gradually been broken down.  I appeal to the people for whom we are voting this money to-night to remember their proud heritage and co-operate with the Government in the alleviation of distress by refraining from making exaggerated claims after the fashion of the fellow who runs an old car into a <Col N="1970" /> ditch and who, when he goes to the insurance company, claims that it was worth about four times its actual value. I suppose there are people who will do that sort of thing.  I hope they will not be many because every bogus claim will take double the time to settle that a genuine claim will take.  When the Minister comes to reply I hope to hear him deal with the statements I have made.</P>
    <P>I overheard the Minister for Lands say that I want to get this speech into the local papers.  I am saying what I believe to be the truth and I would like the Minister for Lands to come down to County Mayo and explain to the people there that they are not worse off because of what we are doing to-night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of entering into this debate until I heard the statements made by the last speaker.  The only trouble that we have in my county is that the waters that fall run too quickly to the sea with the exception of an area in North Kerry and a river between North and South Kerry.  It is amazing to me that any Deputy should try to use this Vote in order to reap political capital out of such a situation as that caused by the recent flooding.  Thanks to Providence, we have not suffered but I can assure the House that we are behind the Government in anything they propose to do to alleviate the distress caused.  In fact we take pride in being associated with anything this Government does for the alleviation of distress in the flooded areas. It is ridiculous talking about Mayo and flooding here and there.  These things occur and there is no way of avoiding them.  All the Government can do, when a situation arises where people suffer from flooding or from any other calamity over which they have <Col N="1971" /> no control, is to come to their aid.  I think that we should be really proud of the steps taken by the Minister for Agriculture and the various organisations to alleviate the distress that occurred in this instance.  To my mind there is no limit to which we ought not to go, either by providing money or help in any other form, to ensure that the people who have suffered distress because of flooding will be fully compensated.  There has been no question in this matter of political associations or anything like that.  We as a nation, have on occasion come to the aid of people in foreign lands who were suffering similar distress.  Why not, therefore, give aid to our own people when necessary?  This Government has done that.  It has done everything possible.</P>
      <P>I should like to state that the people I represent in South Kerry are proud of what has been done.  Their approval will be given to anything that can be done no matter what sacrifices it may entail for the people generally, to ensure that the inhabitants of the affected areas will be fully compensated for their losses of live stock or damage to their homes.  I am proud of the action of the Minister for Agriculture and of the Minister for Defence in visiting the affected areas to see for themselves the effect of the damage. I am proud also of the help given by the voluntary organisations.  We are especially proud of what has been done by our Army.  In fact, I think that the whole world is proud of the action taken to assist the suffering people. There should be no question of opposition to the Estimates put forward by the Government.  This is a case really of an emergency and in all emergencies the Government of the country concerned&mdash;it does not matter what Party is in power&mdash;feel it their duty to come to the aid of the stricken people.  There should be no question of politics or party affiliations in matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as my area is concerned, we do not suffer from flooding at present but we did suffer on some occasions in the past.  The Government then came to our aid in connection with the <Col N="1972" /> drainage of the Maine and our difficulties were solved.  That, I think, should be the attitude always towards suffering communities, that whenever any section suffer in any way the whole country should come to their aid as we are coming to the aid of the people who have suffered from the recent floods in an effort to alleviate their sufferings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate but in view of the fact that so many other Deputies have spoken on this matter, I should like to say a few words in regard to it. I appreciate the action of the Government in coming to the assistance of people who are in a bad way at the moment in the Shannon area and in the North Dublin area.  Everyone in the Dáil will support wholeheartedly any action the Government may take in that direction.  At the same time, it is only natural that we should direct the attention of the Government to our own counties and constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Palmer's references to areas in South Kerry that were affected up to recently where the people suffered to an alarming degree for a few years.  The Maine Valley and the Castlemaine, Keelgallylander and Callinafercy districts were mentioned. People in these districts lost capital and almost everything some time ago, and they received no financial assistance.  I do not claim that these are matters which should be considered in the same category as the proposals before the House at the moment, but I should like to make a plea to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture that if the people to whom I refer cannot be assisted financially from moneys voted now, the Government should at least consider the question of an abatement of their valuations.  That is a point that I think could be justifiably put up to the Government, that they should arrange that the farmers who have suffered immense losses in recent years from flooding in County Kerry should be given a remission of rates for seven years.  The Government could make these arrangements with the Valuation Department or make an Order to that <Col N="1973" /> effect.  That would be one way of alleviating the hardships caused to the people concerned.  I make that suggestion in view of the fact that it may not be possible to give financial assistance to areas not scheduled in the proposals before the House at the moment. I hope that these points will be considered by the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Agriculture, that if they cannot see their way to assist our people under the present proposals at least the question of a revision of valuations might be considered as some compensation for the losses they sustained in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the last speaker, I had not intended intervening in this debate, but considering the amount of time given to it it strikes me as amazing in one sense that Deputies&mdash; perhaps they are right in regarding it from a parochial point of view&mdash;should stress the importance of doing something other than is covered by the Estimate.  Is it not right to say that this has been a tragedy for everyone concerned?  Is it not right to say that it is a tragedy that there should be Deputies who, instead of trying to get this through, are discussing problems which are not related to the terrible problem created by the disaster that has come upon so many of our people in recent days?  We do not know if the proposals of the Government will be the great success that we want them to be, but they cannot be a success as long as Deputies act in that way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn mentioned his own area.  It would be very easy, of course, if there was money available, for all of us to ask that the problems that affect us should be dealt with.  I can speak of areas in South Cork where there has been flooding consistently every year.  I know many traders and hundreds of unfortunate families in Cork City who, in all the years back, in the years when the Leader of the Opposition was in power, suffered from flooding owing to the terrible, high spring tides.  Nothing was ever said here about it.  They had to meet that problem annually.  Perhaps it was a small problem in relation to the present disaster but certainly it represented much more than inconvenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1974" /> There is no necessity to adopt the procedure of drawing red herrings across the trail.  We as a united Parliament should do our best to help those who have suffered so much as a result of the very bad weather we have experienced.  If the people concerned had been listening to much that has been said in the course of this debate they would consider that that was a bigger disaster than what they had to go through for the last week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who comes from an area that fortunately, thank God, escaped the tragedy of the floods, I want to express my sympathy with the people who have been affected and to say that we are wholeheartedly behind the Government in voting this money for their relief.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Taoiseach say to-night that the other areas would be looked after by the Red Cross Society and that the Government would stand behind the society in that.  On 1st December Deputy Kennedy, Deputy Carter and I put down a question to the Taoiseach asking that that be done. The question was answered by the Minister for Defence.  He gave the impression that money was not needed. I travel through the Shannon area every week and the floods in that area for the last six weeks have been tragic. Do not imagine that I am going to criticise the Government in any way. It would be in very bad taste to give the impression that it was only when the tragedy hit Dublin that an emergency was declared.  Therefore, I was delighted to hear the Taoiseach say that the other areas would be looked after and that the Government would back the Red Cross Society in looking after them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are tragedies in other parts of Ireland at present.  In Sligo town, a fortnight ago, owing to some work done by the corporation, a very big flood of water covered in a field with the result that the water swept through two stone walls and went into a terrace of houses and ruined every bit of furniture in those houses.  That might have happened owing to the neglect of the corporation.  The people applied to the corporation but I have been informed that they have been <Col N="1975" /> turned down by the corporation.  The loss of their furniture is as much a tragedy to these people as is the loss of the furniture of those people we heard so much about all evening.  They are just as entitled to compensation. I cannot see much difference between being drowned in the Shannon or the Tolka and being drowned in the Moy or the Feorish.  Therefore, I was glad to hear the Taoiseach say that the Government were behind the Red Cross Society and would see that these people were looked after.</P>
    <P>We in the West, who escaped the worst of the floods, are wholeheartedly behind this Vote and wholeheartedly join in the sympathy that has been extended to these unfortunate people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was unfortunate to suggest that the steps proposed by the Government to provide residents in the seriously flooded areas between Athlone and Banagher with an opportunity of migrating would result in the congests of the County Mayo being postponed in securing relief of their congestion.  Very well now.  I have a message for the congests of County Mayo and I think I know them a little better than their champion this evening and I warrant that they know me and mine a great deal better than they know their champion this evening.</P>
      <P>No congest in County Mayo will be delayed by one hour or by one acre in the relief of his circumstance by whatever measures this Government considers it appropriate to take for the relief of afflicted people in the Shannon valley.  Their new-found champion may bring that message back from me to County Mayo and repeat it at every cross-roads in County Mayo and then proceed to deny it and my neighbours in County Mayo will laugh him to ridicule when he makes his denial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that unfortunate intervention, I think our Government has every reason to be beholden to Dáil Éireann for the helpful attitude adopted by every member of this House, from the Leader of the Opposition down, in dealing with this problem. They have not been consistent <Col N="1976" /> in adulation and they have said frankly where they thought the measures we have taken heretofore have fallen short of what they thought was requisite.  I can only assure Deputies on all sides of the House that the suggestions that they have made are understood by the Government to be made in good faith and will be most closely examined on their merits.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to certain of those suggestions so that I may give specific indication of our readiness to examine them and our gratitude for their submission.  But, I think I should make this clear as crystal&mdash;if we are to be realistic in confronting the problem that lies ahead, we have got to face the fact that the obligation which this Government undertakes on behalf of the nation is to relieve distress. We are not in a position to undertake universal compensation for loss.  If that principle be accepted by the Oireachtas there is not a farm in Ireland in respect of which a claim might not legitimately be made during this year for compensation for loss.  It is true to say that in a certain sense every farm in Ireland has been in some degree flooded this year. I think it is also true to say that every farmer in Ireland has, as a result of weather conditions, suffered losses this year and I think that aspect of this situation shows the absurdity of any attempt being made by the Oireachtas to approach this problem on the basis of full compensation.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case made by Deputy Cunningham of Donegal who pointed out the case of a neighbour of his in the Lagan valley who lost 17 acres of wheat.  Now that is a substantial loss. Deputy Cunningham estimated total losses of that man to be approximately £700.  Then I asked him what was the size of that man's farm and he said quite frankly that it was 400 acres.  If a man has 400 Irish acres of land and is a competent farmer, I say that he has an income of £4,000 a year.  Is it seriously said that we should try to give him full monetary compensation&mdash; to a man who has £4,000 a year and who has suffered loss amounting to £700 in this particular year?  That illustrates the point that if you accept the <Col N="1977" /> principle of attempting to give full compensation all our efforts to pay compensation to the real sufferers would be at the bottom of the bog where we would inevitably sink long before we had reached the cases which are genuine cases of distress and in which we have a clear duty to give aid, comfort and assistance to the limit of our resources.</P>
    <P>We have not a deliberate choice to make in dealing with the losses which we see.  We cannot go on the lines of full compensation for all losses.  If we did we would sink into a morass of uselessness and would paralyse our capacity to relieve those who are real sufferers and who are really in distress as a result of flooding.  We all know there have been floods in other parts of the country as well as in Dublin and in the Tolka valley.  But we have no doubt whatever that the nature of the flooding in the City of Dublin, as described by Deputy Larkin, while it was not a long sustained trial like that involving the people in the Shannon basin, had the added tragedy that it came upon these people in a clamp in the middle of the night before the people could get any of their property together.  Many of them had to try as best they could to get away with their lives.  While it is true that their emergency was over in 48 hours, their little store of furniture and the decoration of their houses are there left after them in a state of ruin and desolation simply because they had not sufficient time when the rush of the waters came upon them.</P>
    <P>On the other hand you have, as Deputies from the country areas know, the peculiar difficulty in the Shannon valley where they have been wrestling with appalling conditions of flooding for months and we believe that they will go on suffering for another two months no matter how we try to tackle the problem.  Even if the weather settles now it will be another two months before the waters recede from their lands and, mark you, we have no guarantee at all that the situation will not be further aggravated if we take the average meteorological experience for the past 20 years and forecast the <Col N="1978" /> rainfall for December and January.  If we do that, we have reason to believe that the Shannon might rise another foot.  However, there is the consoling factor that as we get into December and January it would be a meteorological phenomenon if the river rose any further as the time passes.  But we must all the time hope that for the next six or eight weeks the average rainfall will be less than is usual.  If it is not, we have further grave problems ahead in the Shannon valley.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, I think our resources are adequate to meet whatever flooding problems arise in that area.  I do not want to introduce any spirit of acrimony into the debate, but did I not understand Deputy Gilbride to say that I fell short of my duty when I said that no grants were wanted, having visited the Shannon area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I am sorry I misunderstood him.  But the flooding was there and did I not understand the Deputy to suggest that I was not aware of that?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I made a mistake.  But the suggestion was made in a certain form that there was no concern here for the distress in the Shannon area until the flooding broke out in Dublin.  It will not do any good at all to make suggestions like these.  We all know that flooding in the Shannon valley from Athlone to Banagher is an annual event because the river has a winter and a summer bed.  In fact if this were not so a great deal of the callow land adjoining the Shannon would be seriously reduced in value.  If the limits of the river were restricted too much some of this callow land would become useless, but the moment those floods began to assume dangerous dimensions, I take no credit for the fact that I told this House on the 5th November that I was going down to inspect the area myself on the 12th. And I went down on two occasions and I travelled all through the floods and I fell into them&mdash;through no fault <Col N="1979" /> of my own.  Driving around in the roads, my car broke down and I fell into the floods, and I was doing the best I could.</P>
      <P>In any case, having seen the position I advised the Government that the situation could be met properly by interest-free loans to enable anybody who had suffered any losses of fuel, fodder or live stock to renew their stocks and to give them five years for repayment.  During an inspection of the Meelick lock gates, I had a discussion with the Minister for Lands and it was decided to provide a system of migration for the people from the flooded lands.  I feel that at that time that was the right attitude.  And I can say that I was strongly pressed at that time to recommend that there should be free grants.  But I did not agree. I told them in the Clonown schoolhouse that I would not recommend grants. I do not believe the situation calls for grants.  I believe interest-free loans can meet the problem with which we are confronted at the present time.  I am not saying that in Dáil Éireann and telling a different story in Clonown school.  I told them that story in Clonown school and we were then surrounded by water.  I told the people there: &ldquo;Is it not the mercy of goodness we did not give free grants to buy fuel and hay and stock it on land that is now flooded?&rdquo;  But a new situation obtains now since I was in Clonown on November 12th.  Houses where the water was not within 15 yards of the front door have now a foot of water in them.  Houses where the water was seeping under the door and where they could keep it out with a broom have now water in them up to the handle of the door, and the people have been evacuated out of these houses and are in the Kiltoom military barracks or in their neighbours' houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a new situation and that this House realises that that is a new situation.  I would be a fool if I were ashamed to come to Dáil Éireann on the 15th December and say: &ldquo;The recommendations I made on the 12th November are not adequate for the situation that obtains on <Col N="1980" /> the 15th December&rdquo;; and I would be a fool if I came to Dáil Éireann and did not admit that on the 12th November I hoped the floods would go down. I was hoping and praying they would go down.  They did not; they went up and it is the fault of nobody in this House or anywhere else that they went up, and we must face the possibility that they may go up further.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies who say nothing was done on the Shannon until there was a flood to remember this: if nothing had been done on the Shannon, could I have it to tell to-day that not a beast had been lost on the Shannon?  Could I have it to tell to-day that there is not a single individual who wanted accommodation, but has been found accommodation?  Could I have it to tell to-day that not a single beast that required fodder has not been brought fodder or else been brought to where the fodder was.  There was an organisation prepared, and I am not denying two or three times we provided what we thought was a margin of safety and on each occasion we discovered that the event exceeded the margin of safety we thought was adequate.  But largely I am obliged to confess owing to the resource, calm, courage and skill of Colonel Collins-Powell we extended our organisation to meet each new development as it arose.  It was no more than we were paid to do and I am not claiming any credit.  As Deputy Giles has said, there is no thanks to those who are paid for doing their work and they would have to come here in sackcloth and ashes if they failed to carry out their job.  I am entitled to say, however, we did our job and that we did not wait for the floods of the Tolka to do the job on the Shannon valley and to be ready to do any further job that a new emergency might thrust upon us.</P>
    <P>I quite agree&mdash;I forget what Deputy mentioned it&mdash;that we must be alive to the danger of exceptional outbreaks of fluke, particularly amongst sheep and cattle, in these heavily flooded areas.  I do not care to prick any man's bubble but I am bound to tell the Dáil that I sent a veterinary officer to the Shannon flood area the day before <Col N="1981" /> yesterday with a direction to make a survey of every four-footed beast in the area and I have arranged that there shall be inaugurated in the provincial Press of the country an intensive advertising campaign to direct the attention of farmers to the danger of the incidence of this disease and to the methods which they can employ now to cure the disease where it is present or to prevent it developing where it has not yet occurred.  If any Deputy can suggest to me any further precaution I could take on that front, I would be very grateful for their suggestions but everything I know that I am in a position to do is being or has been done.  I entirely agree the incidence of animal disease consequent on floods is a real danger against which precautions must and will be taken.</P>
    <P>I want to reassure Deputies on all sides of the House that we are fully conscious of the situation in relation to seed potatoes and seed oats in these areas in the coming season. Steps are already being taken to ensure that supplies of seed oats will be adequate and of first quality.  I do not doubt that we shall be able to put our hands on an ample sufficiency of good seed potatoes because, as Deputies are aware in that particular commodity we do a large export trade and it simply means that the Potato Marketing Board will be requisitioned to keep on hands an adequate supply of seed potatoes to provide all possible requirements in any area which we might immediately anticipate would experience a shortage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles was checked, I think, for appearing, perhaps, to go a step outside the strict bounds of relevancy when he dwelt on what appeared to him to be the excessive solicitude for road building when greater attention to drainage might avert much of the troubles with which we are now contending. I do not think we can properly or constructively talk about floods if we do not consider how best we may take steps to prevent their occurrence.  I will agree with Deputy Giles, as I very frequently find myself constrained to do, in this regard.  It makes me almost inarticulate with rage <Col N="1982" /> when I am driving down to an area in the centre of this country, 50 square miles of which is inundated, and passing along a fine main road as smooth as a billiards ball I find fellows rooting holes in the road four feet deep over a distance of a quarter of a mile because they do not like the little bump that is in it.  It costs about £280 an acre to tar-spray a road never mind rooting four feet out of it, and when I pass these road works proceeding and run down into 50 square miles of country under water and proceed to ferry people out of it in boats, to swim the cattle out and to ferry hay out, and when I hear Deputies all over the House saying: &ldquo;My neighbours are inundated and that if such and such a river were cleared my neighbour would not be under water;&rdquo; when I hear them say the Boyne residents are under water, the Barrow residents are under water, the Nore residents and the people living on the river bank in Donegal are under water, I ask myself: is there not a great deal in what Deputy Giles says when he says that we should clear the main channels of the river where the really serious flooding arises in this country?  If we got the Boyne and the Barrow cleared, the Nore and the Moy cleared, the main channels, you might never have serious flooding.  It is true the tributary rivers running into these might not serve as adequate outlets for the necessary drainage of the land appertraining thereto but you would never get this business of vast areas of country being inundated if the water could escape.</P>
    <P>Look at the estuary of the Moy.  As Deputy O'Hara says, he and I who live nearby are persecuted all our lives long with our own neighbours floundering around in a sea of water year after year, not because the tributaries are held up; the tributaries are running too well but the main channel of the outlet to the sea is choked.  If we could get these main channels cleared we would achieve two great purposes: (1) we would avoid a great deal of the persecution which our neighbours have to go through from this kind of flooding and (2) we would create a pool of employment in every catchment area to which we could put our hands in <Col N="1983" /> clearing the arterial rivers pouring into these main rivers whenever employment conditions in those particular areas called for special works in order to increase employment for men who would otherwise be unemployed.  I do not want to go too far into this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He is an old dog for the hard road.  There is nobody in this House who knows better the special problem of the Shannon than the selfsame Deputy Allen.  He has been out fluthering around the House all this day writing letters to his constituents and attending to his parliamentary business.  I have sat in this House and explained to the House the special problem of the Shannon stating quite freely and frankly what happened.  Now that Deputy Allen has got rid of his post, sent his constituents away, he traipses in here at ten minutes past ten to ask awkward questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been labouring on this problem of the Shannon floods since eight o'clock the night before last, all yesterday and all to-day.  Now, I love to chop logic with Deputy Allen, when I am fresh and well, but now the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak, and at ten minutes past ten to-night I am damned if I will chop logic with Deputy Allen.  We will do the best we can.  Let me reiterate.  I am authorised so say on behalf of the Government that we are grateful to Deputies on all sides of the House for the suggestions they have made.  We undertake to give them our best consideration and we undertake to do our best in the present situation and more than that we cannot undertake to do.  Whether we like it or not on the 9th February, the 9th March, the 9th April and the 9th May for the next four and a half years we will have to answer in this House for the performance of our duty <Col N="1984" /> in regard to this matter and every other matter that arises.</P>

      <P>But this we undertake to do&mdash;our best to deal with this situation as it develops.  We can undertake to do no more.  That we should please all is quite unthinkable: that we are handing over to the best of our ability into the hands of detached and objective judges of the circumstances of each case is certain.  In Dublin a committee drawn as best we can from sympathetic and objective judges of the situation will be set up and I have outlined to the House the committee that we design to advise us in the matter of the Shannon valley.  In the last analysis it is not those committees but we who must answer to this House for the performance of the tasks before us.</P>
      <P>We have told the House what we are trying to do, expressed gratitude for the generous co-operation of Dáil Éireann in this matter and we must leave the future in God's hands in the conviction that it could not be in any better hands.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the purpose of bringing in a token Vote of £10 is merely to use the device of the Supplementary Estimate to get the authority of Dáil Éireann to proceed. When the House reassembles, as the Deputy will recall, usually at the end of the financial year, Supplementary Estimates are brought in <Col N="1989" /> where extra moneys are required.  Such a Supplementary Estimate will be brought forward when a sum approximating to what has been spent, or will be spent, will be named in such Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>Very probably.  As the Leader of the Opposition knows blooming well, when he was in office and wanted £100,000 he went to the Secretary of the Department of Finance and said: &ldquo;Get that somewhere and we will bring in a Supplementary Estimate.&rdquo; How in heck do I know where it is, but it is somewhere.  The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to get the authority of Oireachtas Éireann to spend public money.  Now, when we want money to relieve our people of distress, let me assure the Irish nation that the Irish Exchequer is damn well able to bear the burden.  How it bears the burden or by what mysterious acrobatics the Department of Finance finds the money I do not know; but, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, when he was in Government he was told every morning that there was not sixpence in the kitty, but if he wanted a £1,000,000 in the afternoon he got it.</P>

      <P>This amendment was moved by Deputy Briscoe last night.  On that occasion, and I want this on the record because I consider it an absolutely appalling thing to have occurred, the Minister apparently offered to accept this amendment if we would let the Bill through, having refused the amendment of Deputy <Col N="1990" /> Briscoe on its merits.  The Minister, as Minister, does not think this amendment should be incorporated in the Bill and will not accept it but, in effect, he offered it to us as a bribe if we would let the Bill through.  I want to make an emphatic protest against this kind of thing in this House.  That amendment should either have been accepted on its merits or rejected on its merits.  In fairness to the Minister, as it might be mistaken as to the quarter from which I suggested the Minister had been prompted, I should say that it was from his left that he was prompted and not from his right in that regard.</P>

We have here in the White Paper some sample references to anticipated variation of boundaries.

      <P>We are dealing here with the Minister who is responsible for the welfare and prosperity of the agricultural community in this country. Early this harvest&mdash;and I think both the Minister and every Deputy in the House will have to admit that it was the most disastrous harvest we have seen in our time, at least it was the most disastrous I have seen in my time and that covers a fairly long period&mdash;several deputations of farmers called on the Minister in connection with the price obtainable for feeding barley.  The Minister's replies are on record.  The Minister, when appealed to on this matter, referred us to the small farmer who was feeding pigs.  He said: &ldquo;You want me to increase the price of barley on the small farmer to help on the gentleman with the 200 acres and the two motor cars&rdquo;.  He went further and told us about the small farmer in the West with ten acres and a wife and six children, and he wanted to know whether we wished to increase the price of feeding stuffs for him.  When one member of a deputation appealed to the Minister to fix a floor price even of 45/- per barrel for Irish barley, the Minister replied: &ldquo;45/- a barrel would mean an impost of £1 per pig because it would take seven cwt. of barley to fatten a pig.  Do you want me to put an impost of £1 a pig on the small farmer?&rdquo;  These were the Minister's words.  I stated here yesterday that the price of Irish feeding barley had been artificially depressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that very quickly.  Facing that position, the farmers of this country got from 36/- to 41/- per barrel for their barley.  That was the price of feeding barley in this country this year.  Having then cleared the Irish farmer's barley at a maximum of 41/-per barrel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>36/- to 41/-.  It is rather extraordinary that the Minister, who washes his hands like Pontius Pilate and says:&ldquo;I was not responsible for the price&rdquo;; it is rather extraordinary after the Minister's statement as to the seven cwt. of barley necessary to fatten a pig and the £1 per pig impost on the small farmer with the ten acres and the six children, if 45/- per barrel were paid for Irish barley, should agree to a price for foreign barley which works out somewhere at&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now discussing the subject matter of Question No. 64.  I have already informed him that the question to be debated is the subject matter of Question No. 65, that is, how the price of imported barley reacts on the production of bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Having cleared off Irish barley at the lower prices which I quoted, one would expect a reduction in the price of feeding stuffs, seeing that barley up to then was sold at 48/- per barrel.  Seeing that in the early harvest of this year barley was purchased from our farmers at 40/- to 41/- as the maximum, one would expect that there would be a reduction in the price of feeding stuffs.  What has happened?  Foreign barley is now being imported at from £27 to £30 per ton.  Evidently as far as I can see, the use that is being made of the Irish farmer's barley is to cheapen the price paid to the Turk or the Iraqian for his barley.  The Minister says Iraq is not 100 miles from Turkey, so we know where we are.  The Irish farmer is now to be used to subsidise the Iraqian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the new use that is to be found for him in the production of feeding stuffs.  If paying a price to the Irish farmer of 45/- per barrel for barley would mean an impost of £1 a pig on the small farmer, I ask the Minister what should the price of bacon be now, seeing that the pig for the rest of the year is to be fed on the sweepings of Iraqian barley, with a 3 per cent. dirt clause, Iraqian barley that is just muck as I proved in this House in 1948 when I brought in samples for the Minister to look at. <Col N="1994" /> That barley is now to be fed to the pigs of this country to fatten them. The Minister, evidently, is quite satisfied with that position for he has formally announced now, having abolished the wheat, that he will pay 40/- a barrel again next year for feeding barley.  As accurately as I can work it out, if it takes seven cwt. of barley to fatten a pig and if 45/- a barrel would put an impost of £1 a pig on the small farmer, the price now being paid for the Iraqian barley would mean that the farmer would have to get an increase of 66/- a cwt. on that pig in order to be in as good a position as he would be with Irish barley at 45/-.  That is the position.  What will be the position of that farmer who has to fatten the pig now with the £30 a ton barley?  When the Minister stated that is was coming in at £27, he was very careful of his statement.</P>
    <P>I have here, Sir, the statement issued by Grain Importers, Limited, dated 11th November, in which they said, first, that the Minister had agreed that licences for the importation of foreign barleys would be issued to Grain Importers, Limited.  They say here, Canadian barley, £30 a ton; North African, £27 10s.; Iraqian, £27 7s. 6d.; delivered in six-ton lots at the nearest railway station.  So that is the price at which the manufacturer of feeding stuffs will get it.</P>

Will the Minister go half way? If the Minister is prepared to pay from £27 to £30 a ton to the Iraqian for foreign barley surely he should be prepared to pay £25 a ton to the Irish farmer.  That is not asking too much. Give us £5 a ton less than you are giving to the foreigner.  Even that.

It is the intention of the Government that if the world price of feeding stuffs to which our competitors have access is higher than the price paid for Irish barley, green, steps will be taken to pay 40/- per barrel, green, to the producer in Ireland.  Deputy Corry would have us believe that the price of pigs is uneconomic.  He says that in the opening paragraph of his question.</P>
      <P>I say to Deputy Corry and to this House that as a result of the Pig and Bacon Agreement that I made on behalf of the inter-Party Government in June, 1951, the Irish farmer is getting for his pork to-day a higher price than any other exporting country in the known world.  Does anybody, does Deputy Corry, deny it or challenge it&mdash; a higher price for his pork than any other exporting nation in the known world?  Will Deputy Corry explain how I could do better for the farmer of this country than that, and will he explain what his Government did from June, 1951, down to to-day to improve the position of the pig producers of this country over and above what was done?  On the 17th April, 1954, Fianna Fáil had been three years in office in this country.  Is not that so? On that day the price of pork delivered to the factories in Ireland was 234/-a cwt.  On the 11th December, 1954, the price of the same product delivered to the same factory was 246/- per cwt. To-day the price of pork is on the average 6/- to 12/- per cwt. higher than it was two months before Fianna Fáil left office.</P>

      <P>But what is the difference in the price of barley?</P>

      <P>As I said on another occasion, the Deputy is as cute as a Christian.  He is trying to relate the price of green barley to the price of dried barley.  We know perfectly well that Iraqian barley has from 11 per cent. to 14 per cent. moisture content and that Irish barley has from 20 per cent. to 23 per cent.  If you want to <Col N="1999" /> work out the price of Irish and Iraqian barley you will find that 40/- on the farm to the Irish farmer is somewhat more than the price paid for Iraqian barley delivered to the railway station. Remember that when Deputy Corry says we are paying to the Iraqian farmer £5 a ton more for barley than our own farmer, the true fact is that the Iraqian farmer is getting about £5 a ton less for barley than the Irish farmer is getting and he is damned glad to get it.  I do not want to see any Deputy in this House accepting as a suitable standard of living for our people the standard of living obtaining for the farmer of the Iraqian desert. I do not want to make any comparison of that kind.  I would be ashamed of myself if we were doing for our farmer no more than the resources of Iraq made it possible to do for their farmers. I want to remind the House that what Deputy Corry says is for the purpose of deceiving the farmer and I must say I saw a rather sour expression mantle the countenance of Deputy Moher as he listened.  Deputy Corry began by saying barley fetched from 36/- to 40/-; then he said 40/-to 41/-; then from 40/- to 43/- a ton. The fact is that when the market for barley opened this year a notice appeared in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> from two barley dealers that they would not buy any Irish barley and&mdash;the Deputy knows this blooming well&mdash;it was for the purpose of beating down the price. Within 48 hours, every mill in the province of Minister got a notice from me: &ldquo;You will buy Irish barley or you will shut your mill and there will be no soft talk about it, no persuasion, no bribing.  You will buy Irish barley or you will shut your mill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened last year?  The Minister for Agriculture last year pleaded with the millers to buy the barley.  They told him to go to blazes. He told them that if they bought the barley for 48/- he would see them right in January.  They bought it at <Col N="2000" /> 48/- and sold it back at 61/-.  They then insisted that he would sell it back to them at £27 a ton and they insisted that, until they bought it, the Minister would pay these &ldquo;buckos&rdquo; 2d. a barrel per week for storing it for them and he paid it.  He lost £200,000 on the transaction.  The millers got it and the pig feeders paid it.</P>
    <P>I am only Minister for Agriculture since last June.  They tried that trick on me and in 48 hours I told them to go out and buy the barley and they paid from 40/- to 45/- for all the barley that was offered in this country.</P>

      <P>Play fair.  They paid from 40/- to 45/-.  They came to me for a licence to import barley and I told them they must demonstrate to me that they had advertised adequately in all the provincial papers offering to buy domestic barley before I licensed them to purchase barley.  They did that and it was not until I was satisfied that all the barley that the Irish farmers had available had been bought that I licensed the import of barley.</P>
      <P>Whose fault is it that we had no barley and no oats?  Go and make your speech about Iraqian barley to those who left me in the position that I had no where to get barley.  If I have no barley this time 12 months let the Iraqian barley come in and I will hang my head for shame.  In the meantime I would suggest to the Deputy that he would retire with his agricultural colleagues into some secret chamber and weep together by the waters of Jerusalem that their own ineptitude put them where they are.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 9th February, 1955.</P>
