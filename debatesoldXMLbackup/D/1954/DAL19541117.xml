    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether he has received a communication from a public representative of our six occupied northeastern counties, requesting the provision of a courtesy right of audience in Dáil Éireann to a representative from that area in order to put before the House the views of the people of the occupied area in regard to the recent debate on Partition which took place in the House, and, if so, whether he proposes to accede to the request.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative: the text of the letter to which the Deputy refers was released to the newspapers simultaneously with its dispatch to me.  In my reply, which I sent on the 9th instant, I informed the representative concerned that the Government took the view that the suggestion made in his letter had implicitly&mdash;if not, indeed, explicitly&mdash;been determined by the recent decision of this House in connection with the question of audience for Six-County representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>I will communicate with the Deputy in the course of the afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he is aware that the public representative referred to in the question <Col N="602" /> is the Chairman of the Anti-Partition League Parliamentary Party in the Six Counties; secondly, whether he is prepared, in view of the importance of this request, to make time available to enable the Dáil to consider whether the Dáil is prepared to grant the Chairman of the Anti-Partition Parliamentary Party an opportunity of addressing this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of Deputy MacBride's supplementary question, I would say that the public representative concerned wrote to me and did not say that he was writing in his capacity as Chairman of the Anti-Partition Parliamentary Party, to which the Deputy has referred. I am, of course, aware that he occupies that position.</P>
      <P>The second part of the supplementary question does not appear to me to arise and, in any event, I do not think the Government, having regard to the full discussion that has already taken place here, would be prepared to give time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will consider the desirability of having an index prepared, and published periodically, in respect of gross or net profits of undertakings engaged in the production of transportable goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Particulars of the profits, as defined for national income purposes, of concerns engaged in <Col N="603" /> the production of transportable goods are not available, and therefore the compilation of an index of the type suggested by the Deputy is not feasible.  The Central Statistics Office is, however, investigating, in the light of the information now available to it, what extra data on the remuneration of the various factors of production it will be possible to give in the next issue of the <i>Statistical Survey,</i> and I would ask the Deputy to await the result of that inquiry.</P>
      <P>It is not clear what the Deputy wishes to have included in the term &ldquo;gross profit&rdquo;, but there are regularly available for each industry particulars of the value of gross output, as well as of the cost of materials, fuel, packing cases, etc., materials for repairs, and of the amounts paid to other firms for work done as well as the expenditure on wages and salaries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the value of the existing old age pension of 21/6 in terms of 1938 prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to state the value of the existing old age pension of 21/6 in terms of 1938 prices since an index number appropriate to the class concerned is not available. From the official general index numbers it is estimated that £1 in mid-August, 1954, would have purchased at retail prices the same quantum of goods and services (including rent) as 8/7 at mid-August, 1938.</P>

      <P>The information <Col N="604" /> which the Deputy requires at (i) and (ii)  is not available.  As regards (iii), it is not possible to state the contribution to national income of the production of individual agricultural products, but I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the estimated value of the gross output of horses, eggs and poultry for each of the years 1947 to 1951 inclusive.  In the case of the two latter items, the output includes the value, at farm prices, of the produce consumed in farm households.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice to publish information regarding industrial proposals from private interests, as such proposals must be treated as confidential.

With regard to (b) if a grant is made by An Foras Tionscal particulars will appear in that body's annual report.  I think it would be undesirable to ask An Foras Tionscal to supply detailed particulars of its operations in advance of the submission of the annual report to the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if, in view of the financial hardship imposed on parents by the purchase of school books, he will consider prescribing suitable text books for the various grades in national and secondary schools, so that only one set of books will be necessary for members of the same family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be appreciated that it is desirable on educational grounds that the same text books should not be used indefinitely in national or secondary schools.  The unnecessary changing of books is, however, discouraged by my Department.</P>
      <P>Some years ago a notice in the following terms was issued to managers and teachers of national schools for their guidance:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In a separate class or standard in charge of one teacher, the readers and text books, when selected, are not to be changed, unless in exceptional circumstances, for a period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  In a division, consisting of two or more classes or standards combined, in charge of one teacher, a similar principle is to be adopted.  The readers and text books, when selected, should be changed in any year only to the extent which is absolutely necessary. In such cases, of course, pupils will require fresh reading matter, and possibly fresh text books, in their second year in the division, but the same readers and text books should be used in the division every third year at least.  The provision of fresh text books, as distinct from readers, by pupils in their second year in a <Col N="613" /> division should be reduced to a minimum.</P>
    <P>It was added in the notice that under this arrangement, it would be possible for books kept clean and in good order, to be transmitted to brothers and sisters of pupils who had used them or to be acquired by other children who needed them, and, as a consequence, the cost of book equipment to parents of pupils of national schools would be considerably reduced.</P>
    <P>In prescribing texts for secondary schools, also, the question of keeping the cost as low as possible is borne in mind.  For the most part a three year rotation of standard text books is prescribed for the different languages. In the case of Latin and Greek the rotation is a four year one and in the case of English poetry, French poetry and English prose the rotation is such as to permit of the same text books being used year after year.  As regards Irish, whilst there is not a prescribed rotation of prose texts, the same texts are, in fact, repeated frequently.</P>

A letter will reach us inside 24 hours so that if there is any serious complaint the matter will be <Col N="614" /> brought to the notice of the Department and it will certainly be looked into.  On the other end of the scale, you have the managers who are in charge of the schools.  I am sure the managers would take an interest in any complaint made to them.  There is no reason why any group of people should labour under a serious disability in this respect because if the complaint is made it can be very easily investigated.  The attitude of the Department is quite clear from the regulations which have been in existence for a long time.</P>

      <P>During the last six financial years the Land Commission divided 160,000 acres of untenanted land of which 121,000 acres were utilised for the relief of congestion, a total of 8,000 congests benefiting thereby.  In all, about 530 migrants were transferred to new buildings, the vast majority of them being small farmers.</P>
      <P>It is expected that for some few years the Land Commission will be able to do at least as much for the relief of congestion.</P>

      <P>Government policy cannot override an Act of this House. The Act the Deputy refers to, as well as previous Land Acts, gave to the commissioners certain powers and took them out of the hands of the Minister and the House.  The case referred to in Deputy Tully's question comes within the ambit of one of these particular matters.  For Deputy Tully's information, the Minister has power over the Land Commission in certain respects and if the Deputy refers to Section 12 of the Land Act, 1950, and Section 6 of the 1933 Land Act, he will find there certain matters taken from the Minister and given exclusively to the complete discretion of the commissioners.

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he is aware that when leaving England for abroad Irish citizens are required to take their place in the queue designated, &ldquo;Holders of British Passports&rdquo;, and that, when it is pointed out that an Irish passport is held, they are informed that they are considered by the embarkation authorities to be British subjects, and if he will state what steps he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Cosgrave) Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that at certain British channel ports Irish citizens are required to take their place in a queue under some such title as &ldquo;Holders of British passports&rdquo;; but, so far as I know, this does not imply that the British authorities consider Irish citizens to be British subjects.</P>
      <P>Under reciprocal arrangements agreed between the two countries, Irish citizens in Britain and British subjects in Ireland are exempt from the restrictions imposed on aliens generally.  One aspect of these reciprocal arrangements is that Irish citizens entering or leaving Britain are exempt from the immigration requirements, including the obligation of filling landing or embarkation cards, imposed on holders of other non-British passports.</P>
      <P>As, therefore, Irish citizens are entitled to exactly the same facilities as British subjects, the practice of grouping them together has, I suppose, been adopted as a matter of administrative convenience for the expeditious handling of immigration and currency control requirements at British ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For myself, I should have thought it desirable in the interests of good relations between our two countries that public recognition in Britain of Irish nationality should find expression on such occasions; and that some such designation as &ldquo;holders of British and Irish passports&rdquo; might be employed as being in accord with the factual situation.  The Deputy will, however, appreciate that this is a matter wholly for the British authorities and their present practice may have been influenced <Col N="635" /> by the fact that, of the vast numbers passing through the British channel ports, Irish citizens form only a small proportion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state whether it is proposed to introduce proposals for legislation to restore the provisions under the National Health Insurance Acts in respect of voluntary contributors, the termination of which by the Social Welfare Act, 1952, deprived such contributors of important benefits for which, in many instances, they had contributed over many years and for which they still have great need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the date of the coming into operation of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act in 1936, voluntary insurance was available in relation to health benefits only.  The number of persons who up to the end of 1935 had elected to become voluntary contributors was 108.  It was only after the introduction of pensions insurance that the number of voluntary contributors increased and it is clear that the great majority elected to become voluntary contributors because of pensions insurance.</P>
      <P>Under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, which came into operation on 5th January, 1953, voluntary insurance is confined to insurance for widows' and orphans' pensions only, at a special contribution rate of 1/6 a week.  The scope of the compulsory provisions of the Act is confined to persons working for employers and is further restricted in the case of non-manual workers to persons where remuneration does not exceed £600 a year.  The difficulty of making satisfactory provision for premature death of the breadwinner is recognised by permitting persons who cease to be compulsorily insurable to continue as voluntary contributors for this benefit only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards persons who were already insured as voluntary contributors under the repealed Health and Pensions <Col N="636" /> Acts, the rights of such persons to sickness benefits and treatment benefits were not terminated at once. They were preserved for a period of 18 months, that is up to 5th July, 1954, and this period can be further extended by any periods of sickness occurring after 5th January, 1953. This period corresponds to the period of free insurance under the repealed Acts during which a contributor remained insured and eligible for benefit after contributions ceased to be payable by or in respect of him.</P>
    <P>I should add that the full benefits of the Social Welfare Act, including treatment benefit, but excluding unemployment benefit, to which voluntary insurance cannot apply, are worth a weekly contribution of about 4/9.</P>
    <P>I will, however, have the matter further examined in connection with future legislation which I have in mind.</P>

      <P>My present view is that the introduction in this country of a pay-as-you-earn system of income-tax collection for wage and salary earners would not be warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain categories of employees are, of course, already subject to statutory <Col N="637" /> deduction of income-tax from current wages and salaries.  In addition, voluntary schemes for deduction of tax from wages and salaries have been arranged in many cases between employers and employees with the agreement of the revenue.  Such voluntary deduction schemes possess advantages over a State-sponsored system as they are more freely adaptable to the circumstances of the employees and the business concerned. Where arrangements of this kind do not already exist, employers would, I imagine, be willing to consider establishing them if a majority of their workers so desire.  The Deputy may take it that, in that event, the Revenue Commissioners would be glad to render all co-operation possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether he has yet considered the application for a grant, under the rural improvements scheme, for the repair of the Seemachudda Road, Ballysaggart, in the electoral division of Lismore, County Waterford; and, if so, whether, in view of the inability of the landowners in the area, who are very small holders, to make any contribution to the cost, he will make a grant to cover the full cost of the work.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the question refers to an application from a number of landholders, represented by Michael Landers, for a grant to repair a road in the townlands to Feagarrid, Knockaunarast, Knockadav and Seemochuda, County Waterford.  The cost of repairing the whole of the road would be excessive, but a grant of £849 has been offered towards the cost, estimated at £900, of repairing the most important section of the road, the beneficiaries being required to contribute the balance of £51.  A full-cost grant would not be justified.</P>

The qualifications in regard to supplementary housing grants are set out in the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1952, and the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1954.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference in qualification referred to by the Deputy probably relates to grants under Section 11 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1952, as amended by Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1954. Section 11 of the Housing Act of 1952, as amended, reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A housing authority may make, to or in respect of a person (other than a farmer or a person to whom a grant is made under Section 10 of this Act) in respect of a house (whether situate within or outside the functional area of the authority) for which a relevant grant is made, a grant of an amount not exceeding 50 per cent. of the relevant grant, if</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The petition of the Cork Corporation for a provisional Order extending the boundary of the County Borough of Cork was received in my Department on the 21st April, 1953.  Detailed documents explanatory of the proposal were received on the 9th May, 1953. The public inquiry into the petition was opened on the 12th January, 1954, and adjourned to the 26th idem when it was concluded.  My consideration of the matter has satisfied me as to the necessity for an extension of the city boundary, but the accurate topographical description of the boundary requires rather lengthy examination and careful definition.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difference in health and social welfare benefits in the city and county.  I hope that the arrangements now in train for the making of an Order and its confirmation by the Oireachtas will enable the provisions of the Order to be in operation by the 1st April next.</P>

I think all Deputies will agree that the Minister is right to introduce this Bill for a further 12 months pending consideration of the Bill which Deputy Boland has in mind, but the House will also be aware that very many people who are owners of property and have that property let, feel that they are not getting a fair crack of the whip in relation to the amount of increases which they are entitled to put on the rent when repairs and improvements are carried out.  The present fractions&mdash;I do not carry them in my mind&mdash;were fixed I think in 1946, and there is no doubt the cost of practically any type of work has increased considerably since. I just want to ascertain if the Minister has given consideration to this question and if so whether he intends doing anything about it in the next 12 months?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one word missing in one of the sections of the Rent Restrictions Act and it has caused a great deal of disturbance and havoc in Dublin City during the last couple of weeks.  I have a case here which was brought to my notice where the tenant, who was the father of an ordinary working-class family in a working-class area, died and the landlord proceeded to give the widow notice to quit and succeeded in getting an order to evict herself and the children.  If that continues, there is nothing to prevent a landlord, whenever the father of a family in similar circumstances dies, from giving the mother notice to quit and succeeding in putting them out in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court in 1953 which can be found in the <i>Irish Law Times</i> of the 27th February, 1954.  It is the case of Reynold v. McKane and Lyons.  That case was quoted in connection with the case of Mrs. Jane Milea of 26, Lower Rutland Street, Dublin.  I was trying to get the tenant kept on in the house where her family was born and which was her home.  Then she gets this letter: &ldquo;This is to confirm that a decree was granted against you by the Circuit Court .... that rent had been paid up to the date of the Notice to Quit, the proceedings being against you not for over-holding but on title, the actual tenant being your late husband.&rdquo;  A stay was put on until the 1st January and the sheriff's men will go in on that date to evict that woman from her home where she lived all her life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to get done is to provide that the contractual tenant would also be protected as well as the statutory tenant.  Without exaggeration, 90 per cent. of the tenants in decent working-class houses in Dublin <Col N="652" /> become contractual tenants when the father of the family dies and when that happens, it is open to the owner to seek possession of the house.  It does not matter what family the person has; the case is not covered by the Rent Restrictions Act.  The contractual tenant is the ordinary tenant, the father of a working-class family, whose name goes on the rent book and is it to be said that, because of the omission of this one word, his widow is to be evicted, if he dies?</P>
    <P>This case was before Judge MacCarthy recently in the Circuit Court and the Circuit Court made their decision on the basis of the Supreme Court decision.  I would ask the Minister to safeguard the citizens generally and the rights of contractual tenants who, as I said, comprise 90 per cent. of the citizens of Dublin in working-class areas.  I know it is not the intention that when a docker at the North Wall dies after 40 years in a house, anyone should have the right to say to his widow: &ldquo;Get out.&rdquo;  That is not and never was the intention of the Act and I would ask the Minister to look into it.</P>
    <P>Section 39, sub-section (3) of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In case the statutory tenant leaves him surviving his wife, who was residing with him at the time of his death, she shall be entitled to retain possession of the premises under the same terms and conditions as the deceased statutory tenant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I merely want the contractual tenant to get the same benefits as the statutory tenant; if not, it will lead to a lot of trouble in the City of Dublin. It has commenced in a working-class area in the Summerhill, Lower Rutland Street and Seán MacDermott Street area.  I earnestly appeal to the House&mdash;and I feel I am appealing to a sympathetic House&mdash;not to allow a woman and her family&mdash;it is bad enough for her to lose her husband&mdash; to be under the threat, within a week of his death, of losing her home.  I will leave the matter entirely in the hands of the Minister and the Government. As I say, sub-section (39) of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946, gives protection <Col N="653" /> to statutory tenants and why not to contractual tenants who, as I say, comprise 90 per cent. of the tenants of working-class houses in the City of Dublin?</P>

      <P>If the position is as indicated by Deputy Byrne, I certainly think the Minister should look into it, but I wonder is the position as has been represented to Deputy Byrne?  My understanding of the position is this: It is true that the 1946 Act specifically deals with the case of statutory tenants&mdash;I think it is in Section 40, as the Deputy mentioned&mdash; and it provides that on the death of a statutory tenant the widow or widower or other member of the family residing with the statutory tenant at the time of death becomes entitled to the tenancy, but remember that a statutory tenant is a contractual tenant who has lost his contractual tenancy by reason of the fact that notice to quit has been served.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contractual tenant, and the person who is there then is only a tenant by virtue of the Rent Restrictions Act, and that is how he becomes known as a statutory tenant which is now a definition incorporated in the Rent Restrictions Act.  I always assumed&mdash;I may be wrong in this&mdash;that it is a well-settled and well-known law that an ordinary contractual tenant, that is, a tenant whose tenancy has not been determined by notice to quit, has a tenancy interest developing in the ordinary way as any other personal property and that, in the case of a contractual tenant, the personal representatives of the deceased tenant became entitled in the ordinary way to the benefit of his tenancy interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It astounds me to learn that there was a decision in the Supreme Court which seems to run counter to the general law on the subject of devolution of property.  I am not saying that Deputy Byrne is mistaken.  It may be that the decision which he has quoted has that effect and, if it has, I do not think there is any doubt at all that he is right in raising it here and asking the Minister to look into it, and I think <Col N="654" /> the Minister should look into it in relation to the decision which has been given.  I do not think that when the 1946 Act was being drafted, there was any flaw or slackness in the wording of Section 40 because the only people it was necessary to protect were statutory tenants, people whose contractual tenancy had come to an end and who were merely holding their tenancy rights by virtue of the operation of that Act.  These were the only people whose rights appeared to need protection, because, as I say, the position as regards a contractual tenant was well-settled and well-known under the law. If there is a decision which runs counter to that it certainly should be looked into.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I be permitted to make one or two observations, in view of the fact that I was associated with the particular case, the decision in which has caused this trouble?  The decision arose, I think, in Cork and it was to the effect that if a landlord can get in a notice to quit in time, in the case of a deceased tenant dying intestate, before a grant of administration is taken out, the tenancy is gone and the widow and family get no rights under the Act.  You require to be a pretty slick landlord to do that, but some of them have done it.  The taking out of a grant of administration would solve the whole matter.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, in the case of a contractual tenant, the tenant had an actual tenancy or piece of property in the premises which he was occupying.  He had something he could deal with by will, even though it was not perhaps very valuable from a pecuniary point of view.  When he died intestate, that would pass to his widow and children under the ordinary law of intestacy, but if a landlord got in his notice to quit, before administration was taken out, there was nothing on which the grant could operate.  It is a very thin point and a very technical decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter is dealt with by Judge Conroy's commission in several parts of the report.  It is dealt with on page 75 of the report on rent control in paragraph 265 and the following paragraphs and there is a recommendation <Col N="655" /> made in reference to the matter in paragraph 271, on page 78, and an alternative recommendation made subsequently at paragraph 283 on page 83 of the report.  This last recommendation is that, if the recommendation referred to in the earlier paragraph is not adopted, any new legislation should ensure that the spouse and family of the deceased intestate contractual tenant of controlled premises shall be in the same position, so far as the right to remain in possession is concerned, as the spouse and family of a deceased statutory tenant.</P>
    <P>Obviously, if a general clause were put into this Bill, it might be said to interfere with the right of a tenant to make a will dealing with the property. I think the Deputy's troubles can be got over, if the tenant makes a short will leaving his rights in the property to his widow or children.  I think I can suggest without prejudice, and without incurring any liability for the gratuitous information I am giving, the Deputy might solve the whole matter and obviate the necessity for putting in this particular provision in the Bill. The matter is being considered in connection with all the other problems arising out of Judge Conroy's recommendations. If we were to adopt the Deputy's suggestion, we would be taking one particular proposal of the rent commission to put into this Bill. We would not be getting the whole matter into perspective, without giving each recommendation full consideration. If there is a way out, in the manner I suggest, then the matter will have to wait until the general Bill, which I hope will not be unduly delayed, is introduced and, in the meantime, the suggestion I have made might be considered.</P>

I remember when we went to the Seanad we had senior counsel, junior counsel and solicitors offering their assistance to make it a watertight <Col N="656" /> measure but, within a very short time, a loophole was found.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters I should like to raise on this section.  First of all, I should like to know is the Minister satisfied with the drafting of Section 29, as to whether or not it carries out the intention behind the Bill of giving the arbitrator full discretion in relation to costs.  There might be some doubt in view of the opening sentence of Section 29 as to whether or not that section could be negatived by importing into the reference to arbitration some words which might become standardised and might be recognised as importing a contrary intention within the meaning of the section.  I gather that the whole idea of this section is to see to it that an arbitrator will have the same discretion with regard to costs as a judge of the High Court or the Circuit Court would have in cases coming before him.</P>
      <P>There is one other smaller and more technical matter to which I should like to refer.  It is generally accepted in the legal profession that there are two sets of costs which might be awarded, either party and party costs or solicitor and client costs.  It has been judicially mentioned from the bench, however, that in relation to solicitor and client costs, a situation may arise where even though the judge intends giving a complete indemnity to one party for costs as against the other, and allows the most generous scale under either party and party or solicitor and client costs, there might still be an outstanding balance in respect of which no indemnity is given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to give complete indemnity to one party as against another, it has <Col N="659" /> been decided that the correct order to make is an award of solicitor and own-client costs.  Now, the only point I want to make in connection with that in relation to Section 29 is that, while the intention of the Bill certainly appears to be to give the arbitrator the greatest possible discretion in awarding costs, as at present worded and having regard to the decision to which I have referred, it would appear that there might be a loophole there and that a situation could arise wherein an arbitrator desirous of giving complete indemnity to one party is not, having regard to the terms of Section 29, permitted to do so because he cannot make an order for solicitor and own-client costs but merely an order for solicitor and client costs.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there may very well be arguments against the viewpoint that this absolute discretion should be given to the arbitrator, and I recognise the validity of such arguments. It is one thing when one is dealing with a judge of the High Court or Supreme Court, a man who is well versed in law and knows perfectly the full consequences of any order he may make, and it is another thing when one is dealing with an arbitrator, who need not necessarily be a professional man at all and who may not recognise to the same extent the consequences of an order made by him in relation to the costs of an arbitration.  I merely raise the point because the section seems to show a desire to allow the widest possible discretion and it may be that, on its present wording, absolute discretion with regard to costs is not in fact being given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's statement in relation to the first point raised by him, if he takes Section 30 in conjunction with Section 29 he will find that that will clear up any doubts in his mind.  In connection with the other point, this type of costs is very rarely given, as the Deputy is aware, even by judges.  Our provision is the same as that in the British Arbitration Act and the Northern Ireland Arbitration Act.</P>

      <P>The section provides that the Minister may bring the Act or portion of the Act into operation from time to time as he may deem it advisable. I do not know whether this is normal practice or not in such Bills, but it provides that he may bring it in for &ldquo;any particular purpose or provision.&rdquo; It seems to me that it would be more satisfactory if the section provided that he may bring in any particular part or section of the Bill rather than to use the general description &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;.  I do not know if I am making myself clear to the Minister but it does appear to me that, as the section is drafted, it would be open to the Minister to say: &ldquo;For a particular purpose I am bringing the Bill into operation, not merely a section of it but the whole Bill.&rdquo;  You would have the rather anomalous position that you might have the Bill or portion of it applying to one particular county and not applying to another county.  I think the usual phrasing in such sections is that he may bring in any section or part of the Bill.  There may be a good reason, but it just occurs to me that it is an unusual way of legislating for the bringing into operation of a Bill or part of a Bill.</P>

      <P>1.  To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and if a Resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the Order is laid before it the Order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> My amendment is moved to ensure that any regulations made will be published for examination by the members of the council who are members of An Dáil; that if they are held to be unsatisfactory in any respect the regulations can be opposed and further information sought in the matter and further information given to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the making of regulations, Sections 36, 38 and 51 refer to matters to be prescribed by the Minister.  Section 36 refers to the nature of the public notice to be given by a local authority.  Section 38 deals with the form of the sign to be exhibited.  Section 51 deals with the matter of a rate of 1d. in the £.  These are relatively unimportant matters and it would be inappropriate that the Minister should be required to make regulations in regard to them to go to each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>There are other more important matters such as the matters covered by Section 19 of the 1941 Act.  The Minister is not required to present such regulations.  There has never been any demand that important regulations made under very important sections of the 1941 Act should be published, whereas the regulations which would be made under this particular Act are relatively trivial.  Those are the only reasons why I say that the regulations should not be presented.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may make regulations prescribing any matter or thing referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel that we are completely in the dark.  If the Minister makes regulations, there is no means of arguing the merits of such regulations or the consequences that will flow from them on a particular local authority.  We feel that in the pursuance of democracy if the Minister makes a regulation on any matter or thing, the safeguard should be there and that the regulations should be exposed in the Oireachtas for a period of 21 days during which time the elected representatives can <Col N="666" /> see the regulation, find out what it means, what effect it will have and make representations to the Minister before such regulation comes into force. It does not only concern the three items referred to by the Minister but every single operation he is likely to prescribe under this Act.  I do not think the Minister himself or any other Minister would be agreeable to having that authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument is tending now to centre itself on the specific matters to be prescribed in this Act.  I would object to the bald terms rather than on principle in relation to this Act.  I object particularly because of a later provision which this Act contains.  I think the importance of this amendment does not lie so much in its reference to this Act as in the principle with regard to delegated legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To make my point clear, I better refer straight away to the provision <Col N="667" /> in Section 14 (n) which we will come to later on.  Here we have a provision which in effect provides for the implementing of regulations by direction given from time to time by the appropriate Minister, or, in effect, gives statutory force to ordinary regulations made, completely shortcircuiting the legislative machinery here.  At least, that would appear to be the case on a first reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The memorandum circulated covers that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, the fact that such a provision should have appeared in a Bill which was circulated and passed Second Stage is something that calls for serious comment and note in this Assembly.  We have a history in regard to delegated legislation which is a little bit confused. I think I will be completely within the bounds of argument in regard to this amendment if I go back to the circumstances that brought about the necessity for such qualifying clauses and draw attention to them.</P>
      <P>During the war, of course, under the stress of emergency conditions, and where you had completely abnormal conditions, legislation by Order was a necessity and had to be freely exploited in practically every domain in the life of the community.  The war was hardly over when the then Opposition, the Minister's own Party, and others also launched a very cogent, if you like, campaign against this question of legislation by Order.  There was a number of sympathisers with that point of view on the benches of the then Government. In other words, I think the opinion in the House as a whole was that a certain dangerous situation had developed where democracy could be made, in effect, a farce if it became too easy for Departments to legislate by means of Orders.  It would in the long run make the functions of this House almost unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the exigencies of the organisation in our day demand and necessitate that there must be some regulation by Order and legislation by Order.  I am addressing these <Col N="668" /> remarks particularly to the Minister because the Minister will recollect the particular stress laid on this point by their own Party and by the Taoiseach and members of his Government in particular.  This principle of safeguarding the power that is in this House has been a cardinal one in our approach some years ago in this House.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to hear that the Minister is going to introduce an amendment to cover that dangerous innovation in Section 14 but that such an amendment is necessary makes us, as I said before, feel that at every turn, where powers are given to a Minister to legislate by regulation, those powers should be hedged in as far as possible and only granted to the extent which necessity demands.  I can see no possible valid excuse for rejecting an amendment such as the one tendered on the mere ground that it is unnecessary in the particular type of Order contemplated.  The trouble is that that can easily be the thin end of the wedge. If it is unnecessary in the case of an Order, say, for blocking a road, it is an easy thing to extend it, say, to an Order only permitting a certain type of traffic on the road&mdash;and then it will be easy to extend it to an Order that might control the whole user of the public highway.  I realise that that may be a far-fetched statement but I intend it as such.  The fact is that such a thing can be the thin end of the wedge.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the dangerous provision under Section 14 and to the fact that no harm can be done by adopting the amendment, there can be nothing that will prejudice the operation of an Order; if an Order for blocking a road is urgent then it will be done.  The four Deputies who put their names to this amendment included the words &ldquo;... but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder&rdquo;.  What objection can there be to the inclusion of such a qualifying clause in respect of the making of a regulation unless it be that somebody does not want the thing to be discussed?  After all, it is the right of the Deputies here to discuss any action taken by the Minister of <Col N="669" /> the Department: not only is it their right but it is their duty to do so where they see that the case is one which should be investigated.</P>
    <P>In order to enable Deputies to perform these functions, it is very important that the information will be available.  One way in which the information can be made available is by putting the onus on the Deputy to inform himself and putting the document on the Table of the House, thus making it available here.  Then, any Deputy who is interested enough can find out what he wants to know.  However, it is a totally different thing to have Deputies in the position where they cannot find out, or easily find out, what has been done.  For these reasons, I think this amendment&mdash; particularly on the principle&mdash;should be accepted.</P>
    <P>I grant the Minister that, in the particular subject-matter to which it relates, there is much to be said for his point of view but, on the general principle of safeguarding the matter of delegated legislation, on the general principle of the responsibility, powers, authority and privileges of this House for the protection of the public, I think the Minister would be well-advised to accept this amendment and, frankly, I cannot see that there is any reason why he should not.  If the Minister can tell us some way in which the administration would be embarrassed by accepting this amendment, we will consider it.  However, unless he can say that it will hold things up in this way or that way, I can see no reason why the amendment should not be accepted and I strongly urge that it be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should consider accepting this amendment. I agree that on the facts of this particular case, it is not of very vital importance&mdash;but it is dangerous legislative precedent.  We have tended too much towards the making of laws by regulations and Orders that are not readily available to members of the public or even to members of the House.  I welcome the statements made by Deputy Major de Valera in <Col N="670" /> regard to that matter&mdash;particularly when I think of the number of times members of our Parties from time to time objected to exactly similar provisions in Bills introduced by the last Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here the Local Government Act of 1941 which, as far as I know, was not introduced by the present Minister but was probably introduced by the Minister before him. It contains exactly the same section enabling the Minister to make regulations prescribing any matter or thing referred to in the Act as prescribed or to be prescribed.  However, the fact that the last Government inserted provisions in their legislation which infringed on what, in my view, should be the proper constitutional position is no reason why this Government or this Dáil should do it.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister, if at all possible, to accept this amendment.  It cannot cause very much inconvenience.  It only means that a copy of the Order will have to be laid on the Table of the House.  There has been a tendency to mill out Orders&mdash;not by the Minister's Department but by other Departments &mdash;at a terrific rate.  Unless they are laid on the Table of the House there is no way in which Deputies can even become aware of the existence of such Orders.  This amendment has been put down by four responsible members of the House who are also members of the Dublin Corporation.  In deference to their views, I think the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the amendment is almost identical.  I agree with the previous speakers.  Whether or not what was done in the past was done for good or bad reasons, the fact is that we seem to be in agreement that <Col N="671" /> it would be better not to have the legislation delegated to the matter of Orders.  I cannot see why the Minister will not accept this amendment to Section 4&mdash;and it will cover Section 14 as well.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera talked about the three particular references the Minister has made and to which these Orders might be made.  These things to-day can be very vital.  A local authority might decide to widen a certain street and the Minister might, by Order, overrule the unanimous decision of the local authority.  It is not as simple as saying that it refers only to a road.  Deputy Major de Valera referred to other aspects of it. We are now vitally concerned with the whole reorganisation, if you like, and rebuilding of the City of Dublin and all of us on the corporation are concerned about certain problems in connection with town planning, and so forth.  We give much time in studying these things.  We do not want to be faced with a decision which we cannot overrule and say: &ldquo;This is the better way.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to say to the Minister that all the amendments which were put down in my name and the names of Deputies A. Byrne, J. Belton and D. Larkin are amendments which have no reference whatsoever to Party views.  One might say that they represent the unanimous opinion of the representatives of the Dublin Corporation. They have been studied with a view to improving, if we can, the whole method of city government. It is in that sense that we approach this matter&mdash;as colleagues on the Dublin Corporation.  We feel very strongly on the matter and we would ask the Minister not to force the issue but to agree to accept the amendment to Section 4&mdash;and then we shall have overcome that bit of a difficulty.</P>

      <P>I would press the Minister to accept the amendment put down in the names of us four Deputies. The Minister indicated that the section would only give him power to make regulations under three rather unimportant sections.  If these three sections of the Bill which he cites are <Col N="672" /> unimportant then, for that reason alone, I think the Minister should accept the viewpoint put forward here that regulations in respect of these sections should be placed on the Table of the House.</P>
      <P>I think it would be correct to say that, if a regulation is made in respect of a minor matter, no Deputy in this House would, for the purpose of obstructing, seek to have the regulation made by the Minister annulled. On the other hand, I think it is correct to say from the point of view of local authorities that it could be very embarrassing to members of local authorities&mdash;and there are many in this House &mdash;to find that even in small ways they would be getting indirect information on regulations made affecting them as members of local authorities.  I think the case is well made to the Minister and I would ask that the amendment in the names of the four Deputies who happen also to be members of the Dublin Corporation, be accepted.</P>

      <P>I can assure the House that there is no person more opposed to legislation by regulation or by ministerial Order than I am, and I appreciate what Deputy de Valera has said, that during the emergency it was necessary to legislate by ministerial Order.  In the year 1941, as Deputy MacBride has pointed out, a Local Government Bill was introduced and passed by this House giving the Minister power to make regulations governing very important matters.</P>

      <P>The Opposition opposed them at the time and it was argued in the House and accepted.  I am prepared in the case of major matters where regulations must be made to lay them before the House and that is the reason I have put in the <Col N="673" /> amendment; but here we are only dealing with minor matters.  For instance, supposing we want to close the roadway down at the Curragh for motor racing, we must take our decision fairly fast.  Would it not be absurd and ridiculous to ask to lay the regulation before the House governing the closing of the road?  These are minor matters. They may affect some organisation, such as those organising motor racing, very seriously.  However, as Deputy MacBride has pointed out, this amendment has been put in and signed by four responsible Deputies of this House and by four responsible members of the Dublin Corporation, and if the House presses me to accept it I am prepared to do so.</P>

That is what we are concerned about.  The heading of Section 19 is &ldquo;Provisions applicable to both major and other offices.&rdquo;  Under this the Minister could make regulations determining remuneration, regulating the payment and amount of travelling expenses, determining hours of duty, providing for records of attendance, and so on. It has nothing whatever to do with what the Minister called &ldquo;minor matters.&rdquo;  I would suggest that Section 19 of the Act of 1941 deals with minor matters and what we are discussing are the major matters.</P>

      <P>I still will join issue on this question of major and minor matters.  That is a very easy phrase to bandy about, but what are major and minor matters?  Where do you find a definition of what is major and what is minor?  A thing might be major from one point of view and minor from another.  They are two words very easy to bandy about here but they can be very easily an excuse for bringing about a situation which we all want to avoid.  I think the Minister as a lawyer will agree with me that there are dangers there.  He says he will accept this and I think he should.  It is a general principle here that we should be very careful, even though it may appear to be a matter of form, to see that our powers&mdash;after all the powers of legislation are vested in the Oireachtas&mdash;are safeguarded in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A minor matter about the closing of a road in the Curragh was mentioned. In the ordinary course of events that may be a minor matter for a motor race.  What embarrassment or trouble can be caused by laying that amending regulation on the Table of the House? The action has been taken.  That is provided for in the amendment, that there will be no prejudice to the validity of the Order.  What possible embarrassment, inconvenience or anything else can accrue from laying the Order there?  On the other hand the <Col N="675" /> closing of the road at the Curragh in another set of circumstances might be a matter of considerable public importance.  Therefore, I for one, purely on the question of the principle, say that I would be very glad to accept the Minister's offer that he will include the amendment.  I think he should on principle.</P>

      <P>I apologise to Deputy de Valera if I am wrong and I can only express regret he had not more influence with his Party.  It was only during the period of the last Government, I think, that the Undeveloped Areas Bill was introduced.  I recall, as a member of the other House of the Oireachtas, protesting against the fact that that Bill reeked and steeped in legislation by Order on matters which certainly appear to be of major importance.  Now Deputy de Valera tells us there is no difference; it does not matter whether they are major or minor matters.  It is the principle that counts and the principle is that there should not be legislation by Order if it can be avoided.  With that principle I agree and, as Deputy de Valera has pointed out, the Party I represent has, for many years, suggested that the principle of legislation by Order, at any rate when it was unnecessary, was bad and undesirable. Therefore, I am glad the Minister is adopting the attitude he is adopting because I believe that Deputy de Valera is right in his 1954 approach to this matter.  I am glad to learn from his interruption that it is not a new one and I wish him very much greater success in the future in converting his own Party to his point of view in this matter.</P>

However, after Deputy O'Higgins and myself have had these little sallies at one another, let us get back to the substance.</P>
      <P>The war situation was dangerous.  It necessitated regulation by Order. There was a great need to curb that tendency, and if Deputy O'Higgins wants it I will give him and his associates credit for that point in the past.  That need is as much as ever here to-day.  Since no one here has given us a concrete reason why the inclusion of such a safeguard would bring about embarrassment or would be objectionable, I think the principle should rule.  If there were no strong argument advanced that serious embarrassment to the Executive or serious inhibition in getting work done would result from such a provision, then we would be open to argument, at all events; but since no such points are forthcoming the principle should rule.  The Minister has offered us this amendment, and says that he will accept it.  I think he has done very wisely, and I congratulate him on accepting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points on this section that have been brought to my notice.  I advance them merely as matters for the Minister to consider and for amendment, possibly, on the Report Stage.  Having regard to a later section, I think Section 58 of the Bill, this section in effect provides that where&mdash;to safeguard myself, let me say &ldquo;amongst other things&rdquo;&mdash;a public authority undertakes duties or functions in regard to another local authority&mdash;and presumably that relates to the later section I referred to, where such provisions are covered&mdash;the officers of the local authority will have the duty of performing those duties.  In other words, I conceive this section to have arisen in this way, that the Minister is going to provide in this Bill&mdash;and this House when it passes it&mdash;that one local authority can undertake functions or duties for another local authority, presumably in the other local authority's area, or for and on behalf of it, and, having provided for that someone raises the question: &ldquo;Who i going to do it; will our officers and employees do it or could our officer and employees object to doing it?' Presumably, on going into that lega question, the Minister may have been advised that as the law stood th officers and employees of the particular local authority undertaking the functions of the other authority might be in a position to object and that, therefore, the inclusion of the section was necessity; but we are now up against something in the way of pretty broad principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of the public and the point of view of the community as a whole, I think it would be unreasonable in all cases for officers or employees simply to be able to say: &ldquo;This is not for our local authority and, therefore, we are not required to do it,&rdquo; and in that way completely nullify or stultify the later provisions of the Act.  On the other hand, there is the opposite extreme, where we can conceive of a local authority undertaking functions and duties to such an extent that it would be hardly fair to ask their officers and employees to take it in their stride, so to speak.  Now, there is a question there.  Quite frankly, that particular objection was <Col N="679" /> only brought to my notice very recently and I have not had time to consider it, but I think it is one that the Minister should consider&mdash;whether it is equitable to go the whole way and to say to the medical officer, the engineer or some other employee of the local authority: &ldquo;Look, we are carrying out some works for a neighbouring local authority or we are administering some scheme for a neighbouring local authority and you have to take on this additional work and it is just part of your ordinary work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should say it is a question of degree.  If it were only a trifling or relatively small, minor matter, I think it would be unreasonable for the employee or officer to object.  On the other hand, if it were anything substantial it may very well be that the officer or employee would be taxed beyond his capacity or would be asked &mdash;this is equally important&mdash;to undertake work and duties far in excess of those for which he contracted, and questions of additional remuneration, facilities, inconveniences &mdash; all these things can arise.  I do not want to delay the Minister by hypothetical cases, but I think he can see the problem I am dealing with.  I must content myself with that at the moment, but the question naturally has been raised and these officers and employees are apprehensive and they would press for deletion of such a section. If that section were to be deleted, however, I think the Minister would have to have, on the other hand, some safeguards so that any unreasonable use would not be made of the present position.  All I can say at this stage is that I think the Minister should consider that matter before the Report Stage&mdash;I take it representations will have been made to him&mdash;and see if there is not some way to reconcile the various conflicting principles which appear to be an issue in this section.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter in the section which I think is an accident, but it does appear in the wording of this section where it says: &ldquo;It shall be the duty of every officer of each such local authority to perform such duties, <Col N="680" /> or refrain from performing such duties, appropriate to the nature of the power, function or duty to which the agreement or arrangment relates, as the local authority under whom he holds office may decide.&rdquo;  The wording of that simply boils down to this&mdash;that the officer of the undertaking local authority will be bound to perform or refrain from performing such duties as his local authority may prescribe, subject only in this section to the qualification that it is appropriate to the nature of the power or function which is taken over by the undertaking authority.  That means that the local authority can tell its officers to perform any duties, or not to perform a duty, in relation to the authority for whom it is acting, subject only to one qualification, namely, that its directions will be appropriate to the arrangement made between the two of them.  That might have rather unforeseen consequences. The Minister has limited the application of the section so that it is &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; to the arrangement but surely there should be something there making it &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; to the functions of the officer also?  In other words I think there is an omission. Under the working of that section, it is, I think, conceivable, though undoubtedly very far-fetched, that you might detail a doctor to do an engineer's work.  I think it is purely an oversight and perhaps it could be met by the addition of the words &ldquo;appropriate to the nature of the office held by such officer and appropriate to the nature of...&rdquo;  I do not know if I have made the point clear.  Two qualifications are necessary: one is there already and the second would provide that the function or duty should be &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; to the office held by such officer.  I think that would be desirable, because quite clearly it would be undesirable to order a medical officer to build a bridge or do an engineering job or vice versa.  I recommend that as nothing more really than a drafting amendment which the Minister might include on the Report Stage.</P>

What I want to ask the Minister is&mdash;if our city manager and council <Col N="682" /> of elected representatives decide that the time has arrived to give an official an increase in salary and send it on to the Minister&mdash;as the city manager did quite recently in connection with our law agent's department and in which case the Minister held up or rejected the city manager's recommendation&mdash;what further power should the city manager or council have?

As this section deals with what is of vital importance to elected representatives&mdash;the day to day carrying on of the business of the local authorities, of which they are the managers or, if you like, the directors&mdash; they should have some cognisance and some control of the appointment of their staffs, promotion, abolition of offices and generally, to be responsible for the remuneration, because, in the final analysis, it is the elected representatives who on a particular day each year have to find out of the rates the money to pay them.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go through this section at length.  Sub-section (1) refers to the amalgamation of offices.  Obviously, local representatives should have some say and they should be consulted, if it is decided by the Minister that certain offices should be amalgamated. After all, it is the elected representatives who know intimately how a local authority operates and what each section of it does, and how, if necessary, an office might be suggested for amalgamation and how it might affect adversely the working of the particular local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> Section 2 deals with officials of local authorities who are affected by two Ministers, particularly so in our case, where the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Local Government dovetail quite a lot in our affairs.  Where Health may suggest one thing and Local Government another, and where they get together and find some compromise, we do not want to be faced with an Order incorporating that compromise without at least being drawn into the matter and having a final say.  Local government, as some people seem to think, particularly certain officers of the State, does not happen to be purely administration of office affairs.  It is well known to members of this House who are public representatives in some form or another, that local administration affects every day almost every citizen of the area represented by those representatives, and that where alterations are made in the administration, they have to have regard to the impact of those alterations or appointments on the people.  It is the ratepayers who elect those representatives and we must safeguard their interests as well as safeguarding efficient and economic administration.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) says that offices shall not be amalgamated under this section &ldquo;unless each of the offices is vacant or unless each of the offices is held by the same person or unless only one of the offices being not vacant ...&rdquo; Sub-section (4) deals with something similar, but in respect of appointments again.</P>
    <P>We feel&mdash;and it is in line with other amendments to other sections&mdash;that appointments of officials, amalgamation of offices, the creation of offices or the appointment of additional officials should only be done either by way of a reserved function of the local authority, or at least as the result of consultation and agreement between the city manager and the local representatives.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister will resist this amendment or not, but I want to say to him that we are very serious about it.  The Chair has requested that in debating this amendment to Section 10, we should also <Col N="685" /> debate amendments to Sections 12, 20, 26 and 28.  Reading all these sections, it is quite clear that the same principle runs through them.  Section 10 is the one I have referred to.  The same applies to Section 12, which again deals with officials, offices and so forth. Section 20 deals with remuneration and in this connection I would like to say to the Minister&mdash;and I am sure he will understand our position&mdash;that in present circumstances the manager has the power, with the consent of the Minister, to add a number of additional officials; he may appoint a number of engineers or other officials.  The local authority representatives know nothing about it, but when the estimates are presented to the representatives and when they see there is an increase arising from additional salaries, it is then for the first time that they are confronted with this situation, never having been consulted before.  They have either to accept the position and pass the necessary additional rating amount to pay for these salaries or create chaos by not passing the rate and affecting the running of the local authority.</P>
    <P>We want the manager, with all the control that is necessary over him by local government, to come along to the local representatives and to say: &ldquo;I propose promoting this man&rdquo; or &ldquo;I propose appointing additional officials; it will cost you so much, and this is the reason for it.&rdquo;  He should make his case for the necessity for these appointments to the local representatives, as he has to make it to the Minister, because I am satisfied that the Minister does not say: &ldquo;Go ahead; appoint 12 people&rdquo;.  He makes him make his case to him.  He could just as easily make the same case to us, and the Minister would be much more safeguarded if he found that not only did the manager think such appointments necessary, but that it was fortified by the views of the representatives after they had examined it on the spot, knowing the situation first hand from their day to day contact with the operations of the local authority.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether in this difficulty&mdash;the Minister himself is in a difficulty&mdash;we have been discussing the <Col N="686" /> principle of the County and City Management Bill to be introduced shortly to amend certain legislation and to transfer back to local representatives certain functions which would be reserved functions and which now are not.  The Minister has mentioned, I cannot say exactly when, that such a Bill would be introduced.  With that in mind, I think the Minister ought to accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

If the Bill is to be introduced this session, and if it contains what most of us hope it will contain, a proposal to give back to local representatives certain controls which they have not now&mdash;surely in the short interim period these amendments to the various sections can be accepted because they are in line with what I believe most representatives understand will be contained in the new Managerial Bill.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Davin, has already on a number of occasions outside this House indicated his expectancy that there will be further restoration of powers to local representatives.</P>

      <P>I could not gather for the moment whether he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government or to the Minister for Social Welfare.  The Parliamentary Secretary has also in this House on a number of occasions, in the very recent past, been a very strong advocate for what I now ask and I do not think he is hostile to the views I am expressing. I do not think the Minister is hostile <Col N="687" /> either, so therefore, subject to what other supporters of the amendment may say, I shall just reiterate that we want a right to have some say, some knowledge, some control over appointments, dismissals, promotions and salaries payable to the officials of our local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment applies to Section 10 and, it is suggested, also, to Sections 15 and 20. It in effect asks the Minister, even under this Bill, to take some functions away from the city manager and to give them to the local authority, to the elected representatives.  Deputy Briscoe referred in particular to the desirability of the elected representatives, the local authorities throughout the country and here in Dublin, having some say in the appointment, promotion and dismissal of employees and he raised the matter, to some extent, of the responsibility of the members of local authorities to the ratepayers. There is another responsibility which we, in Dublin, have come up against in recent years.  That is, that because of the fact that the elected representatives did not have the authority suggested in the amendment, services to the citizens were liable to be prejudiced very severely.  The elected representatives were aware of the fact that, in certain sections of the local authority, services were being prejudiced through lack of technical administrative staff.  All they could do under the present system was to ask questions in the council chamber or to make representations to the manager.  I think it is important here and now to get from the Minister an indication as to whether he will be prepared to consider that the term &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; for the purpose of this Bill should mean the elected representatives.  I think it well to make it clear that none of the Deputies who have put their names to this amendment was thinking in terms of the question of the appointment, or dismissal of any individual or of any alteration in the office of any individual; but we feel that the power should be vested in the local authority itself just as power, in a national way, <Col N="688" /> is vested in this House and in the person of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The control of the offices of this Government is vested in the Dáil through the appropriate Minister and it is a negation of democracy, in my opinion, that in the case of the other form of government we have in this country, local government, control is vested in a manager who is not responsible for the purposes of the Act to the local authority and in effect can, if he so desires, inform the elected representative of the people in a particular area, that the question of administration is a matter outside their province and one on which they not only can exert no decision but in effect can have no opinion.  This amendment simply asks that the people who go for election before the citizens whether in cities, towns or rural areas, on their being elected to a particular local authority shall be the governing authority and the local authority, and that they shall have the right to see that the local authority is run in a proper manner and that the officers and servants of the local authority are treated in a proper manner.  At the present moment the elected representatives have no jurisdiction whatsoever in this matter and I would therefore suggest to the Minister that he might favourably consider incorporating the amendment standing in the names of the four Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this amendment and the various other amendments referred to, all these deal with the relations of staff and county managers and local authorities.  Prior to the introduction of the original Cork City Management Act, 1929, and the County Management Acts the elected representatives had control over staff, over their dismissal and otherwise; but that control was abolished by the County Management and City Management Acts and I would respectfully suggest to the House that the arguments now being put forward would be more appropriate when we come to discuss the amending of the County Management Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ever since the introducing of these Acts it has been accepted down <Col N="689" /> through the years and right through legislation introduced and passed in this House that the executive officer or county manager shall have control of staff.  That was accepted in the original Cork City Management Act and in the County Management Act, 1940.  No later than last year the County Management Bill, 1953, was introduced here and the same principle was accepted with, of course, certain reservations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>And amendments.  I am not making any political point or argument out of this, but that has been the accepted practice.  I hope the amendment we are now discussing will be discussed when we introduce the amending Bill of 1954; I think it is inappropriate to discuss these amendments now.  All these sections are intended to generalise and consolidate the existing law; they do not, however, consolidate the whole of the law relating to officers.  There is no more justification for writing in these amendments into this Bill than there would be for trying to amend the Housing Bill which was introduced last March to rearrange reserved and executive functions in relation to housing.</P>
      <P>Let us discuss these amendments on the appropriate occasion, namely, when we are discussing the amendments to the County Management Act.  I cannot accept these amendments now.  I am not prepared to say what I shall do when we come to discuss amending the Act, or whether they will be written into it.</P>

I am sure the Minister will understand our position.</P>
      <P>Now, since the death of our housing director during a period when housing had become a priority service of the Dublin Corporation's activities and, as everybody will admit, we have advanced from year to year to what might be called a maximum housing programme, we have not been able to appoint a housing director because the Local Government Department will not permit us to pay a housing director under present circumstances a salary in excess of a certain figure.  I think the figure is £1,400.</P>

We are now dealing with a Bill under which it should be possible to correct a situation which is not fair to public representatives. If the Minister does that he will have an opportunity then of judging what happens in the interregnum between now and the time he introduces his other legislation.  The House will then be in a position to discuss the matter on the basis of experience.</P>
      <P>I think it is only fair to say that we are all in agreement, all 44 members of the Dublin Corporation&mdash;I cannot speak for one who rarely attends&mdash;in relation to this matter.  We have all seriously considered the position, not to-day or yesterday but over a very long period of time.  We know what the attitude of our members is, including our Lord Mayor.  The position is a most invidious one.  An unhappy situation is being created.  We want local government carried out by public representatives but if the Minister puts this Bill through without giving consideration to the requests and pleas of those of us who have some experience in this matter, when the next election comes the Minister will find himself faced with a possible insufficiency of candidates to fill the seats available on local authorities.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to discuss with the Deputy certain things in which he does not indulge, to my knowledge anyhow.  I am not approaching this in any Party fashion.  I do not know whether I am disclosing a Party secret when I say that I am in complete disagreement with my colleague, Deputy Smith, in relation to certain <Col N="693" /> matters in which he has a lot of sympathy with the Minister.  He is sympathetic in relation to some of the things the Minister is proposing, things to which I strenuously object.  I am approaching this purely on the basis of consultations with my colleagues in the Dublin Corporation and what we believe to be in the best interests of the running of the Dublin Corporation. It is in that spirit, as I mentioned before, that we sat down together as a committee selected by the corporation and decided to go through this Bill section by section and to make amendments in our joint names.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he cannot see the sense in accepting an amendment of this nature when we will have the County Management Bill to deal with this matter, but we are getting no promise; the Minister is not saying to us that these amendments will be embodied in the Bill he proposes to introduce.  If he stated that, I, for one, would be quite prepared to accept his undertaking without question, without reservation and to ask my colleagues to withdraw these amendments because we would be prepared to wait for six or nine months if the Minister gave us his undertaking that that will be the position.  I am sure the Minister will not give that undertaking.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with amendments to a number of these sections, each one of which is vital in itself and I am afraid if the Minister cannot give us something better than just the vague undertaking he has given that there will be a County Management Bill, without saying what will be in it, we will have to press these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would put the point to the Minister that a Local Government Bill should contain the fundamental basis of local government in all its aspects.  A Managerial Bill is really only an administrative Bill setting out what certain officials ought to do and their functions.  The functions that the elected public representatives should have should be enshrined in a Local Government Bill and a Managerial Bill should give the manager certain functions and should be confined to that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="694" /> I think amendments of this kind are vital to this Bill and should be considered and dealt with now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one particular matter on which I should like to hear from the Minister.  The Minister indicated that possibly the amendments would be more appropriate to and could be argued on a sounder basis on the City and County Management Bill.  On that particular point I would be inclined to go some part of the way with him.  What I would be concerned with is, not the question of the date when the Minister brings the Act into operation, but that the absence of an amendment such as proposed to Section 10 and other sections of the present Bill would not prejudice our discussion of the City and County Management Bill.  I should like to have an assurance from the Minister&mdash;he has indicated that he intends to bring in such a Bill&mdash;that, if this amendment is not accepted, we would not be told when the City and County Management Bill is under discussion: &ldquo;I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment now because there was an amendment of this nature to the Local Government Bill, 1954, which was withdrawn, and now it would not be right for me to accept it in this newer Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is another point that the Minister might bear in mind&mdash;the difference between the functions of a city or county manager and an executive officer.  Neither a city manager nor a county manager at present is an executive officer as such because an executive officer carries out functions laid down by somebody in authority, whether it is a local authority, a Minister, a board of directors or somebody else.  He is not in the particular area the last word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say, without any question of personalities, that in Dublin we have been facing the position that the effective power is not vested in the elected representatives; it is vested in an appointed official.  Practically 99 per cent. of the authority that is <Col N="695" /> supposed to be vested in the Dublin Corporation in one case is actually vested in the city manager.</P>
    <P>If I can have an assurance from the Minister that if I am prepared, as one Deputy concerned, to withdraw this amendment, he will not say, when the City and County Management Bill comes before the House: &ldquo;You accepted it in 1954 on another Bill; you should accept it on this occasion,&rdquo; and in view of the indication that the Bill referred to by the Minister will come before the House within a fairly reasonable period, I am prepared to withdraw my objection.</P>
    <P>In doing so I want to mention that in this particular section we were not holding the section objectionable.  Our view is purely and simply that there should be a definition of the term &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; and that the definition in this case and for the purpose of the section should be &ldquo;the elected representatives&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It may be well to mention that, while we are anxious that the situation should be rectified as soon as possible, the main Act has been the law of this land since 1941, and if we have been able to tolerate the position for 14 or 15 years, I think it reasonable that we might manage to struggle on for I hope not more than a few months under the present position, again on the clear understanding that what we do here will not be used against us at a later time.</P>

      <P>I would have some sympathy for the point of view expressed here by the Minister on these amendments if the general setting were different.  Before Parliament dissolved certain proposals were being discussed here dealing with the managerial system and the making of certain amendments in the law in regard to the segregation of functions as between the elected body and the manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot say myself from memory whether or not the present Minister gave the House and the country any <Col N="696" /> idea of what his attitude was on the Act itself and towards the amendments which were proposed then.  Again, from my recollection, I can say that the amendments proposed here provided, maybe not entirely, what is sought in these amendments and went a considerable distance to meet the point of view expressed here.</P>
    <P>For example, one of the amendments proposed sought to ensure that a county or city manager would not have the power or right to create a new office without the approval of his local body.  Again, speaking from memory, I think the amendments also proposed that the local authority, the elected body, would have the right of determining questions of remuneration but would not have the ordinary control that is exercised over staff.  They would have a right to say what the rate of remuneration should be</P>
    <P>I take it that it was because the Dáil was dissolved these proposals were dropped and a tour was made of the local bodies seeking information as to what exactly these local bodies were anxious to secure in the way of amendments to the law as it stands, and that amendments such as the ones we are now discussing were proposed by Deputies who felt that in the Bill, as it was before the House, they at least had something.</P>
    <P>When the Parliament reassembled, a new Government was elected and they proceeded to drop the proposals that were there for reasons unknown to me&mdash;I am not questioning them in any sense&mdash;and they proceeded along these lines.  Nothing aggravates me more than the line of argument which was advanced here since we proceeded to discuss this Bill.</P>
    <P>We have put up with this for ten or 12 years.  The provisions of the Act of 1941 which it is proposed to amend, have been there all these years.  Those of you who are now seeking amendments of them had all that time in which to amend them.  Surely that line of argument is childish?  It is childish inasmuch as Governments are elected, I take it, to make changes.  There is surely no obligation on a Government such as the one we have to-day.  It was not brought into existence for the <Col N="697" /> purpose of implementing the policy of its predecessor.  In this House, in the course of this short discussion, in the country, and, indeed, in correspondence that I notice from time to time passing to local bodies all over the country, you would think that the present Government and some of the present Ministers were really elected to implement Fianna Fáil policy.  I do not expect them to and, therefore, irrespective of what the Minister's predecessor did, the Government should have a view on these matters.</P>
    <P>If it were a matter that no proposals to amend the existing managerial laws were being discussed; if he had not gone to the country to meet local bodies and if the amendments had not been publicly discussed, I would agree entirely that the Minister would be entitled to say: &ldquo;I will undertake to introduce an amending Bill but it is not my intention at this stage to tell you what the proposals will contain.&rdquo; If the circumstances were different, that would be an understandable attitude but because of the present setting, the fact that proposals were here which went a considerable distance to meet the amendments we are now discussing, that members of the Opposition, now members of the Government, expressed their opinions as to the inadequacy of these&mdash;they have had the added advantage of public discussion as to what the elected representatives wanted&mdash;then if the Minister said he approved in general of the principle which it is sought to establish in these amendments, my general attitude would be to ask the House to give effect to them.</P>

      <P>I was going to mention that point.  Deputies opposite appear to forget the fact that this Government was formed on a 12-point programme.  Point No. 12 was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To restore democratic rights in respect of local government by amending the County Management Acts and give to local authorities greater autonomy and effective power <Col N="698" /> in local affairs.  To provide for employees of local authorities a scheme of conciliation and arbitration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one of the 12 points in the inter-Party programme and they intend to implement every one of the 12 points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a very interesting discussion and Deputy Briscoe brought up very many good points.  It is quite clear that the difficulty at the present time is that members of local authorities are faced with the problem of reading in the newspapers that so many more officials were appointed.  This leads to great dissatisfaction in various local authorities. Many have expressed that view over a long period.  Deputy Briscoe made his point very clear in that respect. Against that, I think we must of necessity get direct control.  Deputy MacCarthy mentioned that he considered it would be more appropriate to deal with the matter under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder would Deputy Briscoe admit that all these difficulties and problems in regard to reading in the newspapers about the appointment of new officials&mdash;information that members of local authorities in their wisdom believe they should get&mdash;have arisen not out of a Local Government Act as such but out of the County Management Act?  Deputy Briscoe considers it fantastic to adopt the attitude of saying that we have got to have this now.  I agree with Deputy Smith in regard to one point in respect of the attitude of those in Opposition with those in Government.  We will get nowhere by adopting the attitude of asking, &ldquo;Why did you not do it?&rdquo;  The Minister for Local Government tells us that a Bill is ready to deal with a problem directly related to all the problems that Deputy Briscoe spent all his time telling us about this evening.  Deputy Briscoe may not have these problems in Dublin.  If he speaks about the difficulties in regard to the appointment of an architect or some such matter, I do not know what happens in Dublin but we have been able to appoint outside architects in Cork.  No doubt, this problem exists in Dublin with the corporation.  It must be directly related to the overriding factor&mdash;and <Col N="699" /> that is the County Management Act. I consider that, in itself, this Bill is of tremendous importance.  It is true that we may have to make amendments to it.  However, we are more than anxious to get at the kernel of all this trouble in local authorities, that is, the County Management Act.  There, and there alone, in my opinion, lies the root of the trouble.  We come here and openly ask the Minister to realise the implications of the problems that beset us under the County Management Act.  If that fact is fully understood, then perhaps we may know where we are&mdash; rather than getting something now and then hearing talk afterwards to the effect that an amendment of the County Management Act is coming in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see that government by the people, for the people is just as fundamental in local government as it is in national affairs.  That should be the fundamental basis of legislation.  I should like to see that any departure from it would be only a kind of amending Act, setting up an executive, giving perhaps to somebody called the county manager certain functions either in cooperation with the elected representatives or acting in some affairs, perhaps, on his own responsibility as chief executive.  That is the way it appeals to me and that is the way the matter should be approached.  The fundamental basis of local government is the Local Government Act.  If we have any faith or confidence in democracy, that should be the fundamental basis of the laws we make here.  Then, let us amend them afterwards when we are considering the executive or administrative side which would be dealt with in the Managerial Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first Managerial Act was put into force in 1929 for the city that I have, for a time, represented.  We are not satisfied&mdash;that is the plain fact of the matter&mdash;with the way things have worked out in that regard.  Though the elected representatives of the people may, from time to time, be criticised for the manner of their administration or for their decisions, taking all in all. I think the work they have done in the past to various generations has <Col N="700" /> fewer defects than we have experienced under the managerial system.  That is my personal opinion on the matter.  I am very definite in the belief that we should get down to it and get a good Local Government Act, putting in it government by the people for the people&mdash;that this question of talking about a Managerial Act afterwards would be only a side issue and that it should not be made the main Act.  Somebody is talking about giving more power to the public representatives.  That is not the fundamental thing.  The fundamental thing is to give less power to the managers and more power to the people.  I think we are approaching the whole thing from the wrong basis, fundamentally.  I would suggest to the Minister that he ought to reconsider the whole matter and deal in this Bill with the fundamental things applying to local government.</P>

I am not satisfied, as one of the signatories to this amendment, with Deputy D. Larkin's assurance.  It is no assurance to the City of Dublin or to any local authority that the principle will be accepted.  Deputy D. Larkin asked the Minister for an assurance that, if these amendments are now withdrawn, it will not preclude us from reintroducing them on the County Management (Amendment) Bill, probably with the same fate as they appear to be going to get to-day.  I am very strong on this point.  I do not know what the rules of the House are and whether, if four Deputies sign an amendment jointly, any one of them can get up and withdraw without the consent of the other three.</P>

      <P>Deputy Smith referred to No. 12 of the points of the political programme of the inter-Party Government, that of restoring to local representatives control over their local affairs.  It says quite definitely that that will be implemented.

I do not intend to go as far as accepting permission to reintroduce an amendment. That is all Deputy Larking is asking for.</P>

Amendment No. 26 to Section 28 asks the Minister to accept a provision which will enable the local authorities to have the right of preparing the terms and conditions of a proposed appointment.  After that, it goes to the Local Appointments Commission, and so on.  The local authority representatives want to get a certain official to perform certain special duties and having reached agreement that such a person is necessary they want to have his appointment.  They are debarred from having any say <Col N="705" /> whatever at the present moment in the terms and conditions of such appointment.  Will the Minister agree that that is a very serious request and that the non-existence of that right for the local representatives is, in fact, a very serious situation.</P>

Is that the attitude of mind we are to take in this House? We learn by experience and we have learned from experience that the position is not as we would like it to be in the Dublin Corporation under the Managerial and Local Government Acts.  Deputy Desmond said this was a Local Government Act and had nothing to do with management.  The whole thing is interwoven.

      <P>I move amendment No. 6, standing in the names of Deputies James Tully, J. O'Connor, and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Section 10 (2) of the Act of 1941 is hereby amended by the insertion of the words &ldquo;or by a decision of any local authority under which he previously held office in relation to his remuneration in that office&rdquo; before &ldquo;may appeal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is intended to cover the position of an official who was formerly employed by one local authority and transferred to another local authority.  I think it is an amendment which the Minister might well accept.  Its purpose is to enable an officer to appeal even if transferred from the service of one local authority to another.  I do not know if the Minister appreciates the point it is intended to cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine it would come up only in very rare cases.  It is really an extension of the principle which the Acts make applicable to officers of a local authority to cover those cases where an officer is transferred from one local authority to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision is intended to cover a very narrow type of case and I am not aware that this matter has given any kind of trouble. If the Deputy would subsequently communicate with me and give me some evidence of the need for this <Col N="710" /> provision the matter could be further considered on the Report Stage.  I am not aware that there is any demand for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very rarely that a case would occur.  It is just intended to cover the odd case that may arise and it is an extension of principle the Minister is already embodying in the Bill to cover cases of officers transferred from one local authority to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say the number of officials affected would be negligible, maybe three or four in the year.  It is merely extending the principle which the Minister himself recognises, to those officials who are transferred from one local authority to another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Any regulations made by the Minister under Section 4 of the Act of 1941 prescribing the manner of appeal by an officer to the Minister shall, if they require the officer to give or send a copy of his appeal to the local authority, also provide that copies of any statements in relation to the said appeal submitted to the Minister by the local authority shall be given or sent to the officer.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to ensure that, where an appeal is made to a Minister by an official, the reply to the allegations, made by the county manager probably in most cases, will be communicated to the official so that he will know the case which is being made against him and which he has to meet. As a matter of course at the moment, I understand, the county manager is supplied with the full particulars which the official concerned may forward to the Minister and this amendment is intended to ensure that, likewise, the official will be made aware of the answer to his complaint. I think that, in ordinary fairness, this is an amendment which the Minister might accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy an undertaking that a provision will be inserted in the regulations which will be made when this Bill is an Act governing this point.  The undertaking which I now give in substitution for the amendment is that it will be written into the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's undertaking at once.  The only difficulty I see about that is that a subsequent Minister might alter that regulation and it would therefore be more satisfactory to have it embodied in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that it is the practice never to alter regulations, but possibly it might be.  I <Col N="712" /> understand that the purpose of the amendment is already covered by practice in the Department.  We are now going to embody it in the regulations. It is an unwritten practice which we will embody in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to challenge the Minister's statement in that regard, but it has been represented to me that the practice is just the opposite and that no official is ever told what the county manager says about him, while the county manager is told what the official says to the Minister about him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I have that undertaking from the Minister?  It will be embodied in the regulations and not taken out of the regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, in the past, it may not have been the practice of other Ministers to follow in the footsteps of local government, but they have given an undertaking to do it from now on.  The different Ministries will be in agreement on the regulations and on having this practice incorporated in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  I also see the difficulty in submitting to county managers the replying statements of some of the appellants, that it might prejudice them in the future, but when it comes to a clear-cut issue, I think there should be discovery, all cards being put on the table.  In the preliminary stages, however, it would not be sufficient, unless there was a <i>prima facie</i> case established against the particular officer, so that it would be much better to provide for it by regulations than by legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in the unique position, for once, of agreeing with Deputy MacBride, who, I am afraid, is right.  The position is that under Section 4 the regulations are limited to such regulations &ldquo;as are referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed&rdquo;. It is not very clear that these would be &ldquo;prescribed or to be prescribed&rdquo;&mdash;that it is a function of <Col N="714" /> that nature.  The amendment accepted by the Minister refers to regulations under that section and it may be &mdash; I do not know; it would depend on whether the regulations in the particular case have to be laid on the Table of the House &mdash; that there may be a drafting loophole to be covered there, as Deputy MacBride suggests.  On the other hand, the Minister has told us that it is his intention to cover it and I think we can leave it to him.  He has been very frank in saying that he intends to cover it and no doubt he will have regard to that possible drafting difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one small matter which arises on the section.  In sub-section (1) (6), there is a right of appeal within a period of six months. It sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An appeal under sub-section (2) of this section shall not be brought after the expiration of six months after the decision is made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We all know that the six months' period in regard to local authorities in another connection has been a bone of contention and was recently disposed of here.  I suggest to the Minister for Report Stage that a very simple amendment would give him elasticity here &mdash; the insertion of the words &ldquo;save with the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;  That would provide a safeguard against the law working harshly and mechanically against an appellant who might have missed a very short period.  I know that it is giving the Minister unwanted jurisdiction, if you like, and I can see his objections to taking it on, but nevertheless I ask him to consider it.</P>

On the previous section, we discussed an amendment by Deputy MacBride in which Deputy MacBride wanted to make sure that regulations made by a particular Minister might not be altered adversely to officials by a succeeding Minister.  We have got an assurance from the Minister that that will not happen but this section proposes to bring into the Bill a power which does not exist in it, but which exists in other Acts, namely, that notwithstanding any regulations you make you have power under the 1946 Act to revoke the whole of these regulations. Under the previous section we have talked in one way; now we are going to talk the other way.  I frankly do not understand it.  That is why we want an elucidation of the section and that is why the section is put down on the list of amendments as being opposed.  The Minister has already stated that when regulations are made they are not usually altered. If that is so, why do you want power to alter them?</P>

      <P>Section 13 of the 1941 Act gives the appropriate Minister power to revoke or amend any Order, regulation, direction or declaration made under the Act.  That is an essential power.  Regulations have been adopted from time to time in changing circumstances or needs.  The reference to Section 16 of the Act of 1941 is purely a drafting one. Obviously, all this law must apply to existing officers if it is to be of any use at all.  The section is purely a drafting one.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister does not like it and I sympathise with him.  We know from the Minister's own utterances in the past what his feelings are.  The Minister is a lawyer and he appreciates the dangerous implications of this as other lawyers do.  I have every sympathy with the Minister but I object to the section on the grounds of its drafting.  In the past I <Col N="717" /> know &mdash; and I can go back to 1946 &mdash; there were people on all sides who would agree that his type of legislation by reference was bad; it is dangerous. It is very difficult for Deputies to find the full content of its meaning.  There is absolutely no reason why trouble should not be taken to redraft the whole provision properly so that it would be intelligible, because every lawyer, anyway, knows that it is by the concatenation of a multiplicity of sections, that you can make it impossble to achieve things that were clearly the intention of the Legislature when the legislation was put through.  Anybody who has been in court knows how it can work.  I remember personally raising this in connection with regulations under the Defence Forces Bill, where the thing became an abuse.  I would strongly urge the Minister that the redrafting of the section should be considered.</P>
      <P>Let us read Section 13 of the Act of 1941.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every power conferred by any section of this Part of this Act to make any Order, regulation, direction or declaration shall be construed as including a power to revoke or amend any Order, regulation, direction or declaration made under such section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>First of all, there is a very serious extension of legislation by Order or delegated powers of legislation in this.  It is a big departure and a big step to enable the Minister to legislate at all by Order.  It is a further, a greater, and perhaps a more dangerous thing to give him the flexibility of repeal, and to mend his hand, by regulation. Naturally, when I say &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;, there is no reference to the present holder of the office.  The power given by that section is limited to Part II, because it refers to &ldquo;this Part&rdquo;.  If I am reading the Act correctly that Section 13 contains no Part II, but as this power is related to Part II, that extension of the power of legislation given to the Minister is restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, this section is extending this power to Part III of the Act of 1946 and all that is in the Act of 1946 &mdash;&ldquo;this Chapter of this Part of this <Col N="718" /> Act&rdquo;.  It may be necessary to do it. I am not arguing that point at the moment.  I leave it to people of experience to argue when it is necessary to do it, but let us be quite clear on what we are doing.  We are taking another step in giving power to the Minister, who is an executive, and through the Minister, in practice, to the officers of his Department, to county managers who are rapidly being integrated in accordance with the scheme, as the general government of the State.  There is a further tendency there to centralisation.  We are giving them further powers of legislation and flexibility in legislation by giving them power to repeal their own legislation and, therefore, to substitute therefor new legislation.  That may be argued; for my part, in raising this I merely want to stress that we are doing this, that we should not do it to any greater extent than is absolutely necessary and that we should understand what we are doing.</P>
    <P>I think we should ask the Minister to specify particularly what is involved in these sections.  This type of legislation by reference is really objectionable from our point of view, from his point of view, and from the point of view of the convenience of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on the Second Reading of the Bill no person deplores legislation by reference more than I do, but the Minister is in the hands of the parliamentary draftsman. This section is a legal safeguard to ensure that the provisions of this Part of the Bill will apply to existing officers.  It also gives the appropriate Minister power to revoke or amend any regulation made by him in the past.  As the Deputy is aware, we are endeavouring to consolidate local government law in the very near future and I am advised that this Bill is essential, particularly sections like this one, for the consolidation of that law, and that is one of the reasons why this has been put into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Essential in what way?  We can consider a thing as essential in two ways.  It may be essential from the legal point of view, but frankly I cannot understand that; <Col N="719" /> it may also be essential from an administrative point of view on the ground that if one does not get these things in now one will never get them in.  We are not prepared to agree that all the things that are thought essential from an executive angle are desirable and that is testified to by the fact that so many Deputies have spoken on behalf of the public and their representatives.  I hardly think the second unworldly construction I have put on the Minister's statement would be sufficient reason for the passing of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete lines 32 and 33.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must join in the protest that has already been made in relation to this type of legislation.  It is really appalling to have legislation by reference introduced in this manner.  It means that nobody, be he a lawyer or anything else, can ever find out the full effect of legislation.  If it is necessary to amend a section or sub-section of an earlier Act why not enact the whole section comprehensively.  This is an appalling way in which to legislate.  I know the Minister is not responsible for it, but it is a bad, slipshod habit into which the draftsman has fallen.  It is deplorable that we should be faced in this House with Bills amending earlier legislation by reference indirectly, <Col N="720" /> making it practically impossible for anybody to discover what the effect of the law is.</P>
    <P>Surely it should be our aim to simplify the law and not to make it more difficult for either legislators or the public.  Here at least members of the Oireachtas have the earlier statutes available to them.  Members of the public have not, and they cannot afford either the time or the money to buy perhaps ten different volumes of statutes in order to find out what the law is, but nevertheless, we expect them to keep the law.  I know this is not the Minister's fault and it is not fair to blame him, but I appeal to him and to the other members of the Government to set their faces firmly against their officials and the draftsman producing legislation of this type.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete paragraph (k) of this new sub-section which is to be introduced into Section 19 of the 1941 Act.  Paragraph (k) provides a number of restrictions on holders of offices engaging in any other gainful occupations. Possibly there is a very good case to be made against officials engaging in other occupations in addition to their official duties.  I am not sufficiently familiar with the type of case which occurs, but I know that in many areas officials have to pursue other occupations. It may be that such a practice is open to abuse and should be stopped.  I do not know.  I would like to hear the case made against it.  I am not sufficiently familiar with conditions to know whether it is an objectionable practice or whether there are certain merits in it.  I imagine a case can be made both for and against it.</P>
    <P>I put down this amendment because I found the Minister already had ample power to deal with the position under Section 39 of the 1946 Act.  That seems to me to give the Minister all the powers he requires.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment to delete paragraph (m) of Section 14.  Again it occurred to me that both the Minister, county manager or managers have already adequate powers of suspension and that this provision was really unnecessary, and in some cases might operate unfairly on the official concerned. Has the Minister not already got adequate powers of suspension?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opposite view to Deputy MacBride on that.  We studied this particular thing and, as far as the Dublin Corporation are concerned, we welcome sub-section (m) because what we read into it is this: under the present law, if a manager suspends an official he must send on the suspension to the Minister and it may take six months before the Minister's decision comes back.  During that time the person is suspended, possibly for what might be a comparatively trivial offence.  This part of the section, as I understand it, will enable a manager to say to a man in respect of some trivial offence: &ldquo;I am suspending you,&rdquo; and he may be able to recall him within a week because the circumstances of the offence might not warrant anything more serious than that.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but, as we read this, it is to enable a manager to deal with a case expeditiously and avoid undue hardship to a person whom the manager may, without proper consideration, suspend and cannot recall when he realises that the offence is not so serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Briscoe has made the strongest case possible for deleting the sub-section. Is Deputy Briscoe serious when he suggests that the manager may have made a mistake and that this is to enable the manager to mend his hand?  I am doing Deputy Briscoe an injustice when I make that suggestion.  I, for one, am convinced that there is very great <Col N="723" /> need for deleting this particular sub-section.</P>
      <P>Just consider the case.  Are we to put into the hands of a county manager &mdash; I ask all these people who are talking about the powers of the local authorities &mdash; the right summarily to suspend a man for seven days and deduct pay for seven days, to use Deputy Briscoe's words, for a trivial offence? There may be grounds for amending the law as it is in the case which Deputy Briscoe has pointed out where a suspension might go on for six months.  That is another matter.  That position may well want to be amended but, as I conceive it, not by this provision giving summary powers of this nature without any protection that I can see for the employee concerned.</P>
      <P>County managers, like their employees, are human.  In the case of the Army, why did we pass, and why have Parliaments found it necessary to pass in the case of defence forces and similar bodies, very stringent codes of discipline and why, when putting through the Defence Bill in the previous Parliament, did we devote so much time to the protection of the individual against constituted legal authority?</P>
      <P>Remember, the county manager is in a somewhat similar position.  He has all the authority of the State and the law behind him.  He is in such a strong position that certain safeguards are necessary.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go to the extent of saying that in appropriate circumstances there should not be power for short time suspension of an offending or a remiss employee or officer but what I do think is that to put it in a form that is capable of being an arbitrary and summary decision on the part of one human being in authority, giving him credit for the best will in the world, is to say the least of it, sloppy legislation on our part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister considers, for, say, the reason Deputy Briscoe first advanced, that something supplementary to the present law is necessary because of the length of time, then by all means let the Minister furnish his provision but let the Minister furnish some provision <Col N="724" /> that will ensure that there is some safeguard for the person who is the subject of the action that is here.</P>
    <P>At this point I might make a suggestion, perhaps, to the Minister.  Might not this be a case where the Minister could easily decentralise his own authority as presently existing to the elected body?  Might this not be a case for reference to the elected body or to a committee of the elected body which could be speedy and efficient and give the safeguard of another decision in the matter?  Would this not be an appropriate case for providing a power in the elected body?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that there is some case to be made for deleting this sub-section.  The strongest thing one might say about it is that it is difficult to understand why a trivial offence should take six months to investigate in the Department.  Why it should be necessary to have to wait six <Col N="725" /> months for a decision on a trivial matter is something that I cannot understand.  But I do think that there is a danger, as Deputy de Valera has pointed out &mdash; it is a complete break from precedent &mdash; in giving the manager powers to punish an officer without any redress whatever by that officer.  It is a section, one could easily conceive, in which the powers which the county manager might get might on occasions be abused.  I do not imagine that they would be generally abused but, nevertheless, there is a danger of occasional abuse and the temptation is there. County managers are human beings.  It is putting great power into their hands. I suggest that the remedy might lie in the suggestion that the Department set aside special officers for minor offences. That would help to expedite a decision. If the employee or the officer is suspended for a week, there is really no reason why the decision could not be given within a short period.  I think the section should not be necessary. I suggest that the Minister might consider these few remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has a practical knowledge of a local authority, I would advise the Minister to stand firm on this whole thing. Where an officer is suspended for a mis-demeanour it is ridiculous to suggest that you give authority to the local councillors to sit in judgment as to his restoration or the continuance of his suspension.  Is it not quite obvious to anybody who has sat in a local authority that it is pull &mdash; often political pull &mdash; which will make them give their decision irrespective of the merits of the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has to approach this matter in a very general fashion and not particularise on it.  Those of us who have knowledge of local authority administration know that it would end local government in the country if we left it to the decision of the local authority to suspend, restore or otherwise deal with the offender.  If a particular job has to be done in an emergency and the manager orders it to be done; if the people are in peril and a particular officer decides that he will not do it or let anyone under him do it or defies the manager, are we to quote <Col N="726" /> the power of the manager then?  Are we to hold up the whole services for him?  If we give him the authority suggested here, the officer can go to the councillors and get absolution for every offence he commits irrespective of the damage it does to the general control.  As one who has 25 years' service on a local authority and who has studied this matter inside out, I say to the Minister: &ldquo;Stand adamant on this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a colleague, Deputy Kennedy, firstly, he may be perfectly right about the local authority.  I do not intend to press that, but still there should be some safeguard.  It should not be beyond the wit of man or the Minister to hedge this with some particular safeguard of the nature I spoke about.  With regard to Deputy Kennedy's second point, the Deputy instanced a very serious case. If the situation was such as painted by Deputy Kennedy, then by all means the present existing system is adequate and there can be absolutely no objection to straight away suspending the man even if there would be a six months' delay.  Again, the present system is perfectly adequate to deal with the serious case mentioned by Deputy Kennedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are thinking about is this. The present section is designed, in the words of Deputy Briscoe, to meet the trivial case.  It is the trivial case that causes great injustice to an individual. Although it may be trivial from the point of view of the local authority or any other point of view, it can be anything but trivial to the individual concerned.  It is because of these considerations that I would ask the Minister to meet the trivial case and to hedge it with some safeguard even if there is only to be a provision for appealing against the suspension or, if the suspension is subsequently found to be unwarranted, a provision for paying the man the difference of what he lost or make it up to him.  Even if there is only a provision of that kind, it would do.  Something should be included rather than leave the thing naked as it is.  I do not think the remarks of Deputy Kennedy change the position. I freely concede that the suggestion I <Col N="727" /> made at random of going to the local authority may be a bad one.  Some safeguard is necessary.  On Deputy Kennedy's second point, he has cited major matters and they are adequately covered by the present law.  It is the trivial case we should consider.  I would strongly urge on the Minister to consider that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that it was my own and Deputy Briscoe's fault that led to the discussion on this particular matter and led the House completely astray.  The sub-section does not deal with suspension at all.  It is really the parliamentary draftsman's fault.  I think it is necessary to bring the House back to the actual amendment. Section 14 proposes to amend Section 19 of the Act of 1941 by substituting these five paragraphs for (j) of sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Act of 1941.  The House will probably be somewhat surprised to learn that paragraph (j) deals only with the provisions in the case of holders of office being ill, absent or incapacitated and provides for the performance by deputies of their duties.  Paragraph (m) in this new Bill deals only, apparently, with the question of depriving somebody of the pay to which they would otherwise be entitled. The description used by the draftsman is &ldquo;holders of suspensions from performance of duties.&rdquo;  In other words, that is the name of the person involved, &ldquo;holder of suspensions from performance of duties.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It provides that apparently the county manager may deprive them of their remuneration during the continuance of their suspension, the termination thereof and the forfeiture of any salary to which they might be entitled. I think that is what it means. It is one of the drawbacks of this legislation that practically nobody except the parliamentary draftsman really knows what it means.  I think that even he does not.  It merely empowers the Minister to make regulations which would debar the county manager from forfeiting any salary which an official might otherwise receive.  It does not alter the principle.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister to stand by this section.  I am only making an ordinary layman's approach to this matter in the light of practical experience.  A manager may want to punish an officer for an offence under existing regulations and the only way he can punish him is by suspending him.  Under existing regulations and law, the only way he can punish him is by suspending him and that suspension cannot be removed until the Minister says that it may be removed. It may take six months.  The result is that the manager will not suspend a person for what might be called an offence not justifying such a punishment.  If he does not do something about the matter, the official concerned can become very slovenly and he can get worse and worse and worse.  The purpose of this is to keep a certain amount of discipline so that the manager can say to an official: &ldquo;You are worthy of being laid off for a week and I am going to lay you off for a week.&rdquo;  He can do it himself and he can bring him back himself, without sanction from the Minister.  That is as I understand it.  It would improve discipline rather than disimprove it. For the serious offences, the present position still continues.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to Section 26 of the 1941 Act, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The appropriate Minister may empower the relevant local authority to remove from office with the consent of the Minister the holder of any office and may define the procedure to be adopted and the conditions to be fulfilled in relation to the exercise of the power so conferred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy wish me to read it?  Section 27 of the Local Government Act of 1941 relates to suspensions and sets out the procedure. Section 10 of the 1941 Act will still give any official whose salary has been forfeited the right of appeal to the Minister, even on a short-term suspension.  The Deputies appear to be perturbed about this forfeiture clause. However, the officer will have the right of appeal under Section 10 of the 1941 Act and, actually, what is embodied now in all these various sub-paragraphs (j), (k), (l), (m) and (n), could have been made by regulation under Section 26 of the 1941 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think some safeguard <Col N="730" /> is necessary in this section.  One can understand and I quite agree with giving the manager power to make short suspensions.  I think it would be good in every way&mdash;but it could be abused.  We have to take human nature into account in the case of managers as well as in the case of the ordinary official.  As I see it, there is nothing in this to prevent a manager from suspending an official on, say, a Friday, and, on the following Friday, when he resumes, to suspend him again and keep it going for as long as he likes. I cannot see anything in that section to stop him from doing that, without any reference to the Minister or any appeal.  In my view, it is vitally necessary that some safeguard should be put there against such an action&mdash; some provision whereby a manager could not suspend a man for a continuing period without giving him a right of appeal or without letting him resume duty and dealing with him in the ordinary way, as is the case at the moment.  Certainly, some safeguard is necessary to provide for such a case.</P>

      <P>As Deputy MacBride has said, it looks like being a fairly complicated bit of legislation now.  As I see it, there is to be a new provision in relation to suspension, even though it acts through remuneration. I do not think Deputy MacBride's distinction makes a lot of difference to the basic argument.  Under Section 27 of the Local Government Act of 1941, powers of suspension are given.  I would ask the Minister if any other powers of suspension are given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important in relation to this drafted section. Sub-section (1) of Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1941, reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever in respect of the holder of an office under a local authority there is, in the opinion of such local authority or of the appropriate Minister, reason to believe that such holder has failed to perform satisfactorily the duties of such office or has misconducted himself in relation to such office or is otherwise unfit to hold such office, <Col N="731" /> such local authority or the appropriate Minister (as the case may be) may suspend such holder from the performance of the duties of such office while such alleged failure, misconduct or unfitness is being inquired into and the disciplinary action (if any) to be taken in regard thereto is being determined.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There, that section gives a simple power of suspension, pending investigation, as I read it&mdash;a power of suspension pending investigation, for stated causes.  Only the Minister can, apparently, terminate the suspension, according to that section.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) of Section 27 of the 1941 Act says, in effect, that the question of the holder's remuneration is to be at the discretion of the Minister: whether or not he is to be paid during suspension is a matter at the discretion of the Minister.  There are other sub-sections also which I do not think are material to our argument here.  Am I right in that interpretation of the first half of that section?  It gives a general power of suspension in a certain case, pending investigation, removable by the Minister.  Is that the position?  I have to ask the Minister for the answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <P>Therefore, the duration of the suspension is from the moment of suspension to the time of the Minister's decision.  Would the Minister then please tell me the meaning of the phrase&mdash;where is it related to that or any other section&mdash;&ldquo;including short-term disciplinary suspension not exceeding seven days&rdquo;?  Where do we find &ldquo;short-term disciplinary suspension&rdquo;?</P>

Now, admittedly, coming back to Section 19 of the Act of 1941&mdash;the section referred to&mdash;that is simply a section that gives powers of making regulations and there are a whole string of things and powers given to the Minister making regulations. Then, in Section 14, there are additions to those powers.  What we are seeking to do is to give powers to the Minister to make regulations which can provide in any way the Minister likes for remuneration in respect of suspensions to introduce a new type of suspension, you might say, which is not in Section 27, a new animal altogether, so to speak, which is even slipped in in brackets &ldquo;...(including short-term disciplinary suspension not exceeding seven days.)&rdquo;</P>

This, therefore, is a most objectionable provision.  Here, you are giving blank powers to the Minister to make any regulation he likes touching suspension and payment in respect of suspension where, mark you, before, it seems to me on my reading of it to have been restricted to cases of suspension pending inquiry and where the Minister had, admittedly, discretion to determine these things.</P>
      <P>I would not be too worried if the Minister had this power.  I quite agree we must be realists but what I am afraid of is that the Minister will blandly, by regulation, pass on this power to a county manager without further ado.  I am particularly anxious about it in that sense having regard to the fact that the reason given here is that it will not have the Minister to deal with it.  I would be satisfied if the Minister would ensure that he would not pass on that power without safeguard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major De Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not sufficient safeguard under Section 10. It is too broad, too general.  Again, I do not like the particular amendment by which it is done.  Without meaning offence, I think it is almost slid into the Bill; it is an additional power.  I far prefer to see it out in a more straightforward manner.  This new animal called &ldquo;short term disciplinary suspension,&rdquo; what is it in plain language?  It is summary punishment where you had not summary punishment before.  Whether you have an appeal or not, where before suspension related only to suspension pending an inquiry, now you are bringing in short term disciplinary suspension <i>simpliciter</i> which, however you take it, is simply summary punishment, whatever about the right of appeal.</P>
      <P>However, I have delayed the House enough making the point.  I strongly urge the Minister as a legal practitioner who appreciates the difficulties to put in the necessary safeguard. I have no objection, with appropriate safeguards, to giving the county manager or the Minister the powers necessary to maintain discipline but I think we should put in the necessary safeguard, realising that it is not enough to give blanket, autocratic, authority in matters like this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied the necessary safeguards are contained in Section 10 of the Local Government Act, 1941.  One would imagine to hear Deputy De Valera speak that this was something new.  Deputies in this House who are members of mental hospital committees know it is something in practice for years.  Every one of you who are members of mental hospital committees know that and there has never been a word about it.  It is a practice which in my opinion was questionable but a practice which we are now going to legitimise.  All of you know how essential it is that our R.M.S.s should have this power of suspension.  Where it comes down to <Col N="735" /> the question raised by Deputy Colley that an employee may be suspended on Friday, taken on again the following Saturday and suspended, Section 10 even provides for that.  An officer of a local authority who is aggrieved by a decision of such local authority in relation to remuneration, duties, or conditions of service&mdash;conditions of service will cover such a case&mdash;he has the right of appeal to the Minister.  I can assure Deputy de Valera that Ministers do not treat appeals in the same manner in which he suspects they are treated.  This in my opinion is a very essential sub-section.  It will legitimise a practice which has been going on for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is almost a more shocking statement but, on the section, I am not satisfied that Section 10 of the 1941 Act gives the safeguard that the Minister thinks it does. It will not be a question in relation to his remuneration because it will be suspension and the remuneration will have been made incidental to this section. Will it be a matter in connection with his duties?  It is certainly not a condition of service.  I am not satisfied but the Minister will continue to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and there is no use in prolonging the debate.  Nevertheless I would seriously ask him to consider a safeguard.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete lines 49 to 51.</P>
      <P>A good deal of discussion has taken place on this clause, a very serious one, &ldquo;providing for the removal from office by local authorities of holders who hold in a permanent capacity and prescribing the procedure to be adopted and the conditions to be fulfilled in relation to such removals.&rdquo;  My committee have asked us to request the removal of the last three lines in the clause which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Providing for the supplementing of the regulations by directions given from time to time by the appropriate Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would object to these words myself. I do not think any Minister should have the right, if a case comes before him, of supplementing regulations even though I am satisfied that the present Minister&mdash;and I should say 99 per cent. of the Ministers of State&mdash;would favour the victim, the official who was being superseded, suspended or transferred. Supposing that official felt he had a grievance, that he went and got legal advice and found that he was right, is it proper that a county manager who still wanted to get rid of the man, could ask a Minister to supplement the regulations for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know of a case against the E.S.B. some ten or 15 years ago in which a man was suspended, lost his <Col N="737" /> money and was out for a long time. Eventually he went to law and got a verdict in the High Court, I think.  I cannot see anything like that happening, because of my belief in human nature, that Ministers in Government Departments would be 90 per cent. in favour of assisting that type of victim. But supposing a county manager wanted to get rid of an official and that the regulations then did not permit him to do so, is it right that the Minister should have this terribly drastic power of supplementing the regulations by directions given from time to time by the appropriate Minister?  I do not think the Minister ought to seek those powers, I do not think he would be a happy man to have them.  If some day a county manager can come to him and prove, according to his outlook, that the man should be removed and yet the regulations then did not give permission to remove him, would it be right for any Minister to have power to supplement the regulations?</P>
    <P>Deputies ask for the removal of those lines.  Some Deputies&mdash;I think there are ten or 12 names&mdash;have asked for the removal of three lines, and other Deputies ask for the removal of more lines.  My three ask for three lines. There are three separate resolutions asking for these lines to be removed&mdash; by men, nearly every one of whom served on local boards.  I would ask the Minister to consider the matter and make clear what the intention is in asking for the supplementing of regulations from time to time.</P>

He knows very well that from time to time the corporation and other local authorities seek advice from the Department. There is very great doubt indeed as to the legality of advice given by way of circular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the original statutory regulations were made in 1943&mdash;that book contained regulations made for one section of my Department alone and there is a number of sections in the Department&mdash;there has been very great doubt as to the legality of these regulations. <Col N="738" /> They govern many things&mdash; for instance, promotions to certain classes of office, which may be made from time to time; the appointment of rate collectors, the compilation of examination papers, the remuneration of branch librarians, the approval of deputies and substitutes, the payment of overtime, travelling and subsistence allowances.  All these are governed by regulations issued from time to time&mdash; and varied, of course, from time to time&mdash;apart altogether from the statutory regulations introduced in 1943. Once we question the validity of these regulations it is time that we legalise them, and that is what we are trying to do by this paragraph.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like very soberly and quietly to ask the Minister a question.  I would like the answer, as I am not aware of it.  Is there any other case where this House has given statutory sanction and power to a Minister to supplement statutory regulations by directions?  If not, have we not here the most extraordinary innovation and extension of the power of legislation by Order?  That is a question which I ask the Minister very soberly and I think that we and the public should take particular cognisance of the answer.  We must face the fact as it is.  There is need in local government, as in any other sphere of State activity, for enabling legislation, in the first instance, and thereafter for executive authority in order to get work done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the working out of the local government code, the enabling legislation was supplied in the first instance by Acts of Parliament.  That proving not flexible enough to meet all contingencies, we have had to meet the situation by enabling Ministers to prescribe regulations&mdash;but statutory regulations, which are in the nature of delegated legislation and have legislative authority.  We have seen in the course of this discussion even to-day that it was found necessary in certain cases to attach to the Minister the power of repeal.  Gradually that developed, and we have delegated our power and right to legislate, to the particular Minister for the time being, almost an <Col N="739" /> omnibus power.  In fact, the only safeguard we have been able to retain, and sometimes we had to fight for it, is that these regulations would be disclosed to us through the machinery of laying them on the Table of the House. That has been sufficient heretofore&mdash; there were the ordinary directives in the course of administration down the line, between the Minister, the county manager, the officer and so on&mdash;and I presume that is to go on, and that all that was necessary, and they acquired the character of regulation.  Now by this section we are bringing in something new.</P>
    <P>It is very naïve to say that the Minister may, by regulation, &ldquo;provide for the supplementing of the regulations by directions given from time to time by the appropriate Minister.&rdquo;  Now, whatever the intention is there, it means in fact that we are now to give the Minister power to take to himself power to make what will be in effect regulations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Which he has been doing down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they have been in a different category.  They had not the statutory character&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been acted upon, but nevertheless, from the point of view of legal right and status in legislation, there has been nothing carrying the force of law here as regulation, save and except such regulations as were duly made by the Minister in direct pursuance of statutory authority.  This naïve supplementation by direction means simply saying to the Minister: &ldquo;Do what you like.&rdquo; Let us face it.  I can see people arguing that this may be necessary, but this is the thin end of the wedge, if it is the first time it has been used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know; I have asked the Minister.  Even if it <Col N="740" /> were not the first time, it is still a highly objectionable practice; and it is the first time I can think of that it has come to my notice.  Here is a provision that simply says to the Minister &ldquo;Make your regulations and then make any directions you like after that and it is no concern of anyone else.&rdquo;  In fact, all he has to do is to get enabling legislation.  We might as well pass an Act here and now and save ourselves time and trouble by saying in it: &ldquo;The Minister for Local Government can do what he likes.&rdquo; This is the beginning of it.  You may think I am an alarmist but I want to put this on record and I hope that all thinking members of the community, all thinking bodies, public authorities, educational and all other authorities will take note of this fact that the Dáil has the authority to legislate and that we have already gone far in giving power to Ministers to legislate by Order even with power of appeal attached, but that now the Minister proposes in a Bill here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>And to which the Deputy put down no amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point.  The Deputy is perfectly entitled to make his case and that is a very weak answer.  The Deputy is making his case now, and tells the Minister that there is plenty of time on Report if the Minister wants to take it that way.  I want this in black and white and if I am wrong I can be contradicted: The Minister is now providing that he may make regulations, and providing for the supplementing of the regulations by directions given from time to time by the &ldquo;appropriate Minister&rdquo;.  In other words, he can legislate by direction without any hedge about him in this regard.  I know perfectly well that is not the Minister's intention.  I am being forceful about this because I see in it a danger, another safeguard gone.  I see in it the thin end of the wedge.  I see something that makes me apprehensive. I believe when the Minister talks about this Bill being a prerequisite to the codification of local government law that if you get this into it, your codification does not matter a damn.  It is <Col N="741" /> so much eye-wash because the hand can be mended at every turn.  To my mind this is the most serious and objectionable provision in the Bill.  The Minister has moved an amendment that every regulation made under the Bill must be tabled in each House, but let me point out that there is no provision that the supplemental regulation by direction must be laid before the House.  These could be hidden.  The supplementing of that regulation by direction could be such that although the regulation might have been&mdash;and would be prescribed to be &mdash; on the Table of this House, the supplement thereto would perhaps never come to our notice at all because there is nothing to compel it to be put on the Table of the House.</P>
      <P>The thing is so serious that I am not going to say: Provide for them to go on the Table of the House.  I think this type of provision should not be there at all.  I think it is highly dangerous and objectionable and a step which if expanded at all would make a complete farce out of legislation here.</P>
      <P>What is the interpretation of this supplemental direction?  A direction could go very far even so far as to contradict the regulation.  The thing is so wide that anything could happen. I find it necessary to say again, as the Minister would be careful to do as a Deputy of the Dáil, that I am not impugning the particular holder of ministerial office at the moment nor the particular officers who advised him but there is in this a real danger to the constitutional safeguards in our system of legislation, in the publicity, in the fact that it is legislation of this State in theory to be enacted by this House and that even in the last stage the Minister has the power to delegate.  All that is seriously attacked here.  I see in this the first step towards breaking up the authority of our system of legislation if this were spread.  That is why I said I would like to invite the attention not only of the Minister and of the House but of the public, local authorities and all other bodies of a thinking sort in this State to a provision of this nature, and I think an outcry against it is called for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to set the Deputy's mind at ease by informing him that this is not the first time that there has been legislation introduced in this House enabling a Minister to issue directions and giving these directions the full force of law. It has been done not infrequently, unfortunately, in a number of different measures, some extremely important ones and in other cases I think it was a favourite device of the Department of Industry and Commerce on a number of occasions.  That does not make it any less objectionable.  It is an objectionable practice.  But I do not think that this is the occasion to launch a constitutional battle on it.  I think if we could turn our back on this type of legislation it would be a step forward.  I think the discussion on this Bill has been useful from that point of view because it has made the members of this House appreciate that the time has come when Deputies should dig their heels in against the practice of delegated legislation and also against the type of draftsmanship used in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister this question on the use of the word &ldquo;direction.&rdquo;  What is a direction supplementing a regulation?  What is the status of a direction as against a regulation?  Is it a law?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

It seems to me that if this is to be something to supplement a regulation there should be an amendment of the regulation &mdash; is that what it is?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has any evil intention at all and it is more the idea of introducing some new form of animal into our already overloaded system for delegating powers, that is objectionable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very interested to get some examples of where it has been done before.  Quite frankly, I do not know of any.  It is a different thing to say the Minister may prescribe the rate of remuneration or something like that.  That is definitely hedged, but here is an omnibus provision and it is not from the point of view of scoring against the Minister that I am raising this but because the provision is so wide <Col N="744" /> in providing for supplementing of regulations by direction given by the &ldquo;appropriate Minister.&rdquo;  The fact that it is provided in this Bill puts a supplemental direction on all fours with regard to statutory effect with a regulation.  It does that.  You cannot escape it.  The effect of this provision would be to put such supplemental directions &mdash; whatever they are &mdash; on all fours with regard to cognisance in court and so on with statutory regulations.</P>
      <P>In the case of statutory regulations, in the main, there would be the safeguard that we would have them on the Table of the House.  Even the Minister's subsequent amendment will not cover these directions, and secondly, there is nothing to limit the nature of these directions.  It is one thing to say that remuneration shall be at the rate which the Minister directs &mdash; and there is usually the safeguard &ldquo;in conjunction with the Minister for Finance&rdquo;&mdash; and another to say generally that you can supplement the regulations without qualification.  There is a very wide field opened here, opened, I admit, with a very thin little breach, but a breach which can be widened.  One could not foresee the length to which this type of direction could go.  It is almost conceivable that, under this, the Minister could give a direction that something should be done secretly without the knowledge of Parliament or anybody else &mdash; it could almost get to that point &mdash; and that such a direction would be legal and binding until it came to the notice of somebody who brought it under review in this House.</P>

      <P>We have to make a distinction between the workings of the local government machine internally, and its relations outside.  It is quite obvious, as I said at the outset, that in working local government, you must have enabling legislation.  You must have legislation, broadly, and regulation as part of legislation, determining the relations of the Local Government Department to the citizen and so forth. <Col N="749" /> Then you give directives for the working of it, particularly within the machine.  That is administration.  That has been given but it does not need extension.  Here is one aspect of it which might be fundamental.  Nobody will deny the right of the Minister to make regulations touching his own machine, such as the remuneration or the travelling allowances of any employed officer or any matter of that nature.  These are quite obviously administrative details just as in the Civil Service these matters are determined&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The section states that &ldquo;the appropriate Minister may for all or any of the following purposes make regulations applying to all the offices in relation to which he is the appropriate Minister and their holders, or to such of those offices as belong to a specified class, description or grade.&rdquo; Offices as well as holders &mdash; mark that. There are certain things I was coming to in regard to holders themselves. There are certain rights just as there are in the case of the Army which I mentioned earlier, that need to be safeguarded with regard to the holders and in regard to the offices.  Regulations can be made under this section covering practically anything that is involved in regard to the offices as well as in regard to the holders.  That is quite wide enough to be objectionable but apart from that &mdash; I am back to the original point I made &mdash; it is the generality of the provision, the opening-up &mdash; and I think I said earlier a small opening could lead to a big breach &mdash; that I object to.  Even if Deputy MacBride and the Minister relate the proposal to the same type of <Col N="750" /> powers in previous legislation, I still think it is objectionable to extend it and that it is unnecessary in this case, that what the Minister wants to do can be done in another way that there can be no doubt of the legality of what he has done heretofore.  I still think this sub-section is in principle objectionable and I would ask the Minister to remove it.  Again I am back to the question of principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the view of Deputy MacBride that there might be a cluttering up in the Library <Col N="752" /> because if such a directive came along to supplement a regulation, it would come immediately to the notice of the local authorities and then, in a matter of days, if it were something to which there was objection or something in regard to which there should be further consideration, some member of the House would go into the Library and read it.  You might have other regulations once every week and nobody would bother about them because there would be no objection to them but the moment one of these supplemental directives came along, which nobody would like, it would be brought to the notice of the local authority and if a member of the local authority were not a member of this House he would present it to a member of the House. That is why I say that as far as I am concerned &mdash; I am not prepared to enter into these legal problems &mdash; if the Minister will agree that because of the suspicions expressed, he is prepared to place these directives on the Table of the House, he can say &ldquo;All right, there is nothing to hide about supplemental directives.  We will insert this amendment providing that they should be placed on the Table of the House&rdquo;.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Agricultural Grant &mdash; Motion.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That in view of the steep increase in rates on agricultural land, the high cost of labour and the reduction in live-stock prices, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that a substantial increase should be made by the Government in the present agricultural grant for the further relief of rates on agricultural land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this motion last week and to-night I am anxious to bring my information up to date as far as I can. I have taken steps for that purpose and I have found a most extraordinary position, a position which to my mind offers an unanswerable case for this motion.  The movers of the motion have, if anything, been too conservative in asking for a substantial increase from the Government in the present agricultural grant for the further relief of rates on agricultural land.</P>
      <P>Now I base my claim, having dealt last week with the conditions under which the farmers and the agricultural community generally have this year to find the wherewithal to pay rates, mainly on roads which are the property of the local authority.  In the utilisation of those roads the State has been enabled through the medium of taxation to collect certain revenue. I would like briefly to bring the House up to date by giving the House the benefit of the information that I received to-day.  Petrol taxation in 1944-45 brought a revenue to the State of £782,907; in 1953-54 petrol taxation brought a revenue to the State of £6,820,000, an increase of over £6,000,000 on that item alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day I put down a question asking for the revenue derived from the import duties on mechanically propelled vehicles and parts thereof.  I find that revenue was only £48,500 in 1944-45; this year it is £1,500,000, an increase of well over £1,000,000 of which a sum of £220,000 represents <Col N="754" /> duty charged on home-made tyres and tubes.  Motor taxation has gone up from £619,000 in 1944-45 to £4,402,000 in 1953-54.  The total increase in these three items alone as between 1944-45 and 1953-54 is £11,243,285.</P>
    <P>We will find now what is the effect of all that motor taxation, etc., on roads.  We find that the total rates on agricultural land in 1944-45 was £4,878,000; it is now £10,380,449 so that the ratepayers paying rates on agricultural land find that their demand has gone up by £5,500,000. Remember, every gallon of petrol used, every mechanically propelled vehicle brought into the country and every single hour in which these vehicles move or work means a further deterioration of the roads at the expense of the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I come now to another little table. I find that in 1932-33 the contribution, the rates paid on agricultural land was only 36 per cent. of the total; the Central Fund paid 64 per cent.  To-day the Central Fund only pays 47 per cent. In plain language, that increase of £11,000,000 in revenue has put a burden on the rates of over £5,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What year does the 36 per cent. represent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister answered the question.  It was 64 per cent. in 1932-33; it was 47 per cent. in 1953-54.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not worrying who is in office or who is not.  Times change like the wind.  The Deputy is over there to-night; he might be gone to-morrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Just like Deputy Corry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We happen to be two Deputies who have had a long time here.  I think Deputy Davin is a few years longer than I am in the House. Nevertheless, I have been here for 28 years and I expect to spend about 45 more, if that is any information to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case I am making is that of the £11,000,000 increased revenue that the State has got from the user of the <Col N="755" /> roads, it has given in the relief of rates out of that sum a total increase of £1,750,000.  The State has paid back £1,750,000 increased grant against £5,500,000 paid by local authorities.  The State in its present position has increased its net revenue, taking into consideration the grants given, by £9,500,000.  In plain language, the Government could completely derate agricultural land out of the increased revenue the State has got, and still have a few millions left.  That is the position.  There is no burking it.  The case I am arguing now is the case I argued when I was on the other side of the House.  Governments do not matter with me.  I am here as one representing those who have to pay the piper, representing the local authority who has to face this increased burden. Due to the &ldquo;mechanisation age,&rdquo; we will call it, they have to bring the roads up to a certain standard.  They do not get the increased money for that except out of the pockets of the ratepayers and the State is not contributing its share or anything like its share.</P>
    <P>I have here a table for my own County Cork, which should bring it fairly well home to the Minister.  I am sorry I have not got the figures for his county.  In 1948-49, the general rates were 19/1 in the £.  In 1954-55, they are 33/9.  They have increased from £1,025,000 to £1,835,000 and the agricultural grant, covering the same period, in 1948-49 was £396,906, and in 1954-55, was £591,000 &mdash; a total increase of £194,000 out of an increased rate of £810,000.  That is a fair comparison, and it is not anything like 46 per cent. of the increase in rates&mdash;it is not even 25 per cent.  That is why I say that the Government and the Minister would be well advised to take these matters into consideration now and to give a fair increase.  Who imagined that in nine years there would be an increased revenue of £6,000,000 a year from petrol alone?  That is the increased revenue which has been drawn from petrol.  Every gallon of petrol, from which the State draws revenue in the shape of taxes, goes to the deterioration of the roads and represents an increased <Col N="756" /> liability on the local ratepayer. That is the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Were you not looking for more lorries last week to do more harm to the roads?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was looking for what I need for my constituents, and I have no apology to make to anyone for looking for it and I pay for it.  That is the condition of affairs.  That does not excuse the Parliamentary Secretary from facing up to his responsibility in this matter, as the man on whom the local authorities are depending to make their case in the Cabinet for an increase in grant.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows &mdash; we all know &mdash; that there is not a day that local authorities have not a deputation in regard to the condition of the ordinary county roads, to the effect that they are impassable, that they are unable to bear the traffic that is put on them, that they are starved for want of money. The reason they are starved for want of money is that we cannot come to those who are not responsible, who have not drawn revenue out of them, for the money.  It is the State who is getting the increased revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State cannot increase its revenue by £11,000,000 odd on roads that are the property of the local authorities and say, &ldquo;This is all loot.  We will use it in some other way; the man who pays the rates must find the money to keep up the roads all the time.&rdquo;  That is why I am anxious that the Parliamentary Secretary, if he is intervening in this debate, will tell us definitely whether they will give this increase in the agricultural grant or not.  The unfortunate ratepayers &mdash; I dealt with this aspect of affairs last week &mdash; find themselves in the position that they cannot pay.  County surveyors and deputy surveyors are putting in their demands now to keep the roads even in ordinary condition.  The money is not there to meet the demands because the ratepayers cannot afford it.  What can you expect to get from a man whose harvest is gone down the Shannon?  Where will he find the rates this year unless he takes advantage of the loan that the Minister for Agriculture has promised him, while he is giving hard cash to the <Col N="757" /> civil servants?  It is a grant to them and a loan to the old farmers.  Let us face these things straightforwardly.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House. I had not intended to intervene this evening but I was anxious to put the House in full possession of the fresh information that I have got.  I know the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary is anxious to intervene in the debate.  It is their duty to tell us how much of the extra £11,000,000 that the State is drawing in revenue will be given.  I want them to justify, if they can, the withholding of that £11,000,000 from the agricultural community and the ratepayers.  Let them come out and do it.  At the last meeting of the local authority we had to appeal to the county rate collectors to give the agricultural community time to pay, time to find the money &mdash; money which, unfortunately, a large number of them cannot find in the circumstances.  That is the position, and I would like either the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to let us know definitely here how much of that £11,000,000 they will give to the relief of the ratepayer this year.  I would suggest that it is high time to raise the whole proposition of a new deal in so far as the roads are concerned.  It would be very much better for the ratepayer if we had the old toll-gate system on the roads rather than the present position where the State takes all and gives nothing.</P>

I will give my reasons briefly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> At the time when Deputy Childers was a member of the Government, with Deputy Corry supporting him, a motion similar to this came up and was met with the vilest abuse from the Fianna Fáil party.  I can go back to 1932 many years before I became a member of this House to quote Deputy Corry's attitude towards a motion to relieve rates.  It might not be similar to the present motion so far as the wording is concerned.  Deputy Childers had the brazen effrontery to admit that if they were the Government again they would oppose such a motion but for some sinister reason of his own and his Party they would support the present motion which was put down in good faith.  If Deputies Childers and Corry had no better contribution to make than that it would have been much more decent for them to have remained silent.  Not 12 months ago Deputy Corry, when he was sitting on this side of the House behind the then Government showed he was no cripple when he walked into the Lobby to vote every time against the farmers' interests.</P>

      <P>Without usurping the position of the Chair, I do not think that is a point of order.  If Deputy Corry wants the quotation he can go to the Library or to the Dáil Debates and there see it.  He will have another opportunity of proving that what I said just now is not true.  The rates in the rural districts have become a first-class problem and there is no gainsaying that.  We want to saddle the right horse with the blame and that I am going to do.  Long before I became a member of the Government in 1948; while I was a member of the inter-Party Government before and while in opposition during the past three years, I spoke against the policy of Fianna Fáil passing legislation imposing fresh burdens on the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>Can Deputy Corry &mdash; he can correct me if what I was saying is wrong &mdash; point to a single Act passed by those of us on this side of the House while in Government that imposed one penny extra on the rates?</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry seems to be concerned about the rates and the ratepayers.  Incidentally, I will not dwell on the fact that Deputy Corry appointed two county managers in his own county and I am sure that will not help to keep down the rates. Deputy Corry and his Party have passed Act after Act, including the famous Health Act which is now law and which, I prophesy, will mean a burden next year of at least 3/- in the £ on the rates in most counties.  If Deputy Corry and the Fianna Fáil Party were so concerned about the health of the people, why did they not pass a Health Act the cost of which would be borne out of the Central Fund?  That would have been the proof of their sincerity.  It is very easy to give away pounds at the other fellow's expense.</P>

      <P>I realise and appreciate the motives which inspired this motion. <Col N="760" /> I realise that the sponsors of this motion had the interests of the farmers of Ireland at heart when they put it down.  The other day, when speaking to the motion Deputy Beirne said it was put down some considerable time ago.  The motion states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, in view of the steep increase in rates on agricultural land, the high cost of labour and the reduction in live-stock prices, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that a substantial increase should be made by the Government in the present agricultural grant for the further relief of rates on agricultural land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers, opening for the Opposition, said he supported the motion and he gave reasons for it.  He said that in their very first year of office Fianna Fáil had increased the agricultural grant.  He did not tell the House that in the following year they decreased it or that a similar motion to that of the present one was put down by the then Deputy Belton and that he, Deputy Corry, opposed that motion and gave his reasons for it.  It was suggested to him by Deputy Belton that at one time he was in favour of derating.  Deputy Corry said that they were in favour of complete derating, but they had profited by experience.  He cries out to-day for complete derating. He cries out to-day for something to be done for the farmers of this country.  I think my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, gave him a very good answer.  We are prepared to do something for the farmers of this country and no later than to-day we told this House what we are prepared to do. Replying to a question put down by the Deputy from Westmeath, Deputy Dillon said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government has decided to make available interest-free loans, repayable over five years, to purchase stock, fodder or fuel, where losses in any such category have been experienced as a result of these floods.</P>
      <P>The Irish Land Commission will, forthwith, examine the possibility of migrating such landholders in these flooded areas as may seek alternative holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> The Commissioners of Public Works will examine the possibility of removing obstructions in the river bed, and, in consultation with the E.S.B., will review the administration of sluice-gates on the Shannon.</P>
    <P>Consultation with Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann is proceeding with a view to making available pressed beet pulp, for ensiling or direct feeding, at specially reduced rates.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Irish Red Cross Society, at the instance of local representations, is examining the need for emergency relief measures, if and where such exist.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are some of the things which the Government of to-day are doing for the distressed Irish farmer.  I think the sponsors of this motion may take pride in the fact that they are supporting a Government which is doing these things for the unfortunate Irish farmers.  Who will forget what the last inter-Party Government did for the farmers?  Who will forget the land reclamation scheme and the subsidised ground limestone scheme?  Who will forget the 1948 Trade Agreement whereby we guaranteed to the farmers of this country fixed prices for their cattle related to the prices across the water?  You gentlemen who sponsor this motion should take pride in the fact that you supported the then Government and the Government of to-day in procuring these reliefs for the Irish farmers.</P>

      <P>I wish to be brief.  I know that other Deputies wish to speak.  As the sponsors of this motion know the present Government are working on a budget, a Finance Act, which was introduced by our predecessors.  Our financial resources are limited.  We are endeavouring to meet the liabilities which the former Government imposed upon us.  We are not shirking the payment of the debts which they left us.  However, so far as the financial resources of the Government are concerned, we will endeavour to do all we possibly can for the farmers of this country.  I give the sponsors of this <Col N="762" /> motion the assurance that we will reexamine this position when we are in a financial position to do so and any relief we can give the farmers will be gladly given.</P>

      <P>I regret that that should be so in the case of such an important matter as this motion deals with.  The sponsors of this motion are very sincere in their efforts to help our farming community in the matter of relief in rates and in any other way they can.  We realise and appreciate that our farming community form the backbone of our country.  We are only too conscious of the fact that our farmers are very badly hit &mdash; and it is to say the least of it, disgusting to think that any group of Deputies would indulge in the sort of tactics that were indulged in by certain Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to this motion.  Some of these very Deputies represent farming constituencies.  If any of their constituents had been in the public gallery and had witnessed the display that went on here, and heard those Fianna Fáil Deputies speak in the hypocritical fashion in which they spoke, I am sure they would be disgusted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first speaker on behalf of Fianna Fáil was Deputy Childers.  He is one of the gentlemen who recently rushed down to Shannon Valley, where flooding has occurred.  He pretended to be sympathetic towards the plight of the farmers there.  It would be interesting to know what Deputy Childers did during his term of office in the interests of these people.  He pretended to display great sympathy on his recent visit to the Shannon area and, naturally, he got quite a lot of publicity from the newspaper which backs his particular Party. However, I am sure the farmers of his area &mdash; it is pretty obvious that they are intelligent people because at no time did they give Deputy Childers a very <Col N="763" /> good vote: he always got in by the skin of his teeth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, I want to challenge Deputy Childers &mdash; a former Cabinet Minister &mdash; on what he did to relieve the situation with regard to flooding in the Shannon area when he had the power to do it.  If he had done anything about it, I am sure the farmers of the Shannon area would not now find themselves in the plight they are in.  We have only to read the newspapers to realise how grave the situation is.  Certainly they have my sympathy &mdash; as has every farmer throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Childers came into this House and took advantage of this motion to try, as he thought, to create embarrassment and trouble among the Parties that form the inter-Party Government.  If that is what he is aiming at, I can assure him that he is mistaken.  I am proud to say that we in the Clann na Talmhan Party have the greatest confidence in the present Minister for Local Government &mdash; as we have confidence in the present Minister for Agriculture and in the other Ministers in the Cabinet.  We considered it was advisable to table this motion <Col N="764" /> to afford the House an opportunity of discussing the matter in a sensible and sincere way, to afford the Minister an opportunity of giving his views and to afford the farmers of Ireland in general an opportunity of reading in the daily papers what the various Ministers &mdash; and, on this occasion, it is the Minister for Local Government &mdash; have to say regarding their plight.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given this House an assurance to-night that this whole matter is very much to the forefront in his mind.  That, coming from a Minister of the standing of Deputy O'Donnell, the present Minister for Local Government, is something that the people will have confidence in&mdash; unlike some of his predecessors who were prepared to make every type of promise for the sake of holding power and office.  Personally, I have the greatest confidence in the sincerity of the Minister and in his statement here to-night that, at the earliest possible moment, he will review this whole question and see what can be done.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the Minister, too, when he states that he has taken over from another Minister and that he is operating his finances and trying to work things out as best he can.  We all know that it would be impossible for the present Minister to wave a wand and remove all the headaches of the farming community in the short space of five or six months.  However, when we get an assurance from a responsible Minister who, we know, is sincere and honest, that he will review the whole situation in the light of the conditions that prevail at the present time among the farming community, the Clann na Talmhan Party feels it has succeeded in focusing the attention of the present Minister and of the Government generally on a really important problem and we are satisfied that the Minister will, at the earliest possible date, as he has stated, review the whole situation and then give certain reliefs to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>There is another important matter that I should just like to refer to in passing.  Other speakers, including Deputy Beirne who opened this debate, referred to it as well.  They stated that <Col N="765" /> it was the practice in recent times to shift taxation from central to local authorities.  Unfortunately, that is all too true.  It is true of successive Governments but certainly no Government ever achieved what Fianna Fáil achieved in that regard.  I refer to the piling-up of taxation on the farming community, in particular, and to the shifting of certain taxes from the central authority to the local authority.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into all the figures that Deputy Childers quoted when he was speaking.  He quoted a lot of figures and, as the Minister for Local Government pointed out a while ago, he quoted certain figures that suited his own purpose; certain other figures he did not quote.  It is all too true that the shifting of taxation from the Central Fund to the local councils is a regrettable trend and I would like to impress on the Minister that anything he can do while he is a Minister of this Government &mdash; I hope he will be there for quite a long time and I believe he will &mdash; to lighten the load of local taxation will be appreciated by the farming community and by any other people who may benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself comes from a rural constituency very much like mine.  It is rugged and mountainous. The people who sent him here are mainly small farmers; many of them, I think, are fishermen, and the present Minister knows the conditions that exist in the country just as well as I do.  He did not come from the plains of Kildare, Meath or any other county; he came from a county that is to a great extent Gaelic speaking and he is a native speaker himself, I am glad to say.  He understands the problems of the ordinary small man, so I feel, having brought these matters to his notice, that when he is reviewing the whole situation at a later date he will take some steps to relieve the present plight of the people.</P>
    <P>In listening to the Minister for Agriculture to-day and to the Minister for Local Government now on the question of certain reliefs for the Shannon area, I personally was disappointed, not disappointed because the people of the Shannon area should benefit in any way from anything the Government or <Col N="766" /> the present Minister might do to relieve their situation.  I am not in any way parochial-minded.  Speaking in the National Parliament on a matter of this kind I realise it is our duty to cater as best we can for all sections of the community.  My disappointment arose from the fact that the Minister did not seem to be specific enough.  I am very much interested in a serious problem that exists in my constituency. I refer to the flooding of the River Moy which concerns a number of constituencies as well as mine.  It has wreaked havoc on the farmers around the banks of the Moy.  I have spoken about it before in this House, and I repeat that I was disappointed that neither the Minister for Agriculture nor the Minister for Local Government referred to the plight of the farmers in Mayo and parts of Sligo who are seriously hit by the flood damage caused by the River Moy.</P>
    <P>I have received scores and scores of letters from farmers who complain that they have lost all their potatoes; others complain that they have lost their oats and their wheat.  We are not a wheat-growing county, but the little we have we must use to the best possible advantage.  It is very serious for people in areas where you have a great many uneconomic holders when they lose their crops in the way they have lost them this year.  While the people I speak for are very sympathetic towards the people in the Shannon area, I feel that any benefits that may be afforded in respect of the Shannon Valley should also be afforded in areas, constituencies or counties such as I represent.</P>
    <P>I should be obliged if the Minister could tell us briefly when I have concluded if it is proposed to do something for the people along the River Moy and, for that matter, along other rivers.  I do not wish to be unfair; I do not grudge the people along the Shannon Valley anything they can get. They have been hard hit and they have my greatest sympathy.  Nevertheless, I feel obliged to speak in the strongest possible terms to focus the attention of the Government on the plight of the people in my own constituency.  They have suffered for years and years.  On <Col N="767" /> this occasion they have lost everything; many of them have lost their entire crops and they are faced with a situation where they must, in many cases, replace turf which they used as fuel. This is a county which, during the emergency produced quite a lot of turf for the national pool.  Now they have lost practically all their turf.  It has been carried away by the flood waters of the River Moy, and the same thing applies to their crops.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands pointed out when he was speaking of the expense of implementing the health services and that the added cost to the rate-payers would be very serious.  I have been addressing a number of meetings in my own constituency in recent times.  When you inquire from your constituents what is their main grievance, they will ask you to try to pull down rates.  They are very much alarmed at the present time because they appreciate that the introduction of certain sections of the Health Act will further increase the rates.  I would ask the Minister in the light of this knowledge&mdash;I know he takes a deep interest in it&mdash;to focus his attention on the effect that this will have on poor counties like Mayo.  Rates have reached such an alarming figure that in many instances you have people emigrating by the thousand.  It is a common sight in my part of the county to see bus load after bus load fleeing from the Barony of Erris and even from the town of Ballina.  Houses are closed up and people have gone over to England to seek employment.  People are alarmed on this question of the additional cost of running the health services and I would ask the Minister to take steps at the earliest possible moment to relieve the situation.</P>
    <P>Again I must refer to the gentlemen on the far side of the House, the Fianna Fáil Deputies who have spoken.  They showed their marked sympathy to-night for the farming community.  They shed tears, mar dheadh.  The same thing applied when this was being debated last week. They did not shed tears when the calves were being slaughtered.  I am not going into the merits of the economic war&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He said that he would fill the fields with inspectors, to compel the farmers to do certain things. I submit that has a certain bearing on this.  However, if I am out of order &mdash; I thought I was fairly relevant.  They also referred to election promises. Everyone knows that no group of individuals that ever went out in any country in the world was more lavish in promises about reducing rates and doing other things, than the Fianna Fáil Party in their time.  I remember as a young fellow listening to them outside church gates when they denounced Fine Gael &mdash; or Cumann na nGaedheal, as the Party then was &mdash; for high taxation; but when they got control themselves they piled it on as no other Party before or since has done.  Where promises are concerned, those opposite should be slow to refer to election promises.  They were lavish in my own constituency and at a by-election I remember they promised a biscuit factory.</P>

It seems that because they had the reins of Government they were prepared to put up with any sort of treatment the Minister might wish to administer.

I say to each and every Deputy who is sincere and honest, that these people are only playing politics.  It is disgusting that men elected to this Parliament should behave in such a way.  They seem to forget the sacrifice made down the years by good Irishmen in order that this Parliament might be established for the betterment of the country as a whole.  I suggest to them that they should take their duties and responsibilities more seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> The question of Government is a serious one and a good Opposition can be most helpful.  An honest and sincere Opposition can offer constructive criticism to a Government and is one of the most helpful things one can have.  Even the present Government does not want to tell the Irish people that all the brains are on its side.  I am prepared to concede that there is a lot of intelligent and brainy men on the Fianna Fáil side, men who made sacrifices in the past and that sort of thing, but it must be humiliating to the decent men in Fianna Fáil that a handful of the calibre we had here in recent times should make cheap jibes and take advantage of the plight of the farmer to exploit that situation here for their own personal gain and also, I suppose, for Party gain.  That is a disgusting state of affairs.  I am sure every Minister in the present Government will at any time appreciate constructive and honest criticism.  Even though the suggestions may come from a Fianna Fáil Deputy, if they are practicable and workable the present Ministers would be very glad to adopt them in the best interests of the nation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to thank the Minister for the kindly way he received the motion.  We appreciate that, as he is a man of his word, he will at the earliest possible date get down to work on this whole question of rates as it applies to the agricultural community. We feel confident, with the assurance that he has given to-night, that he will at a later date put it into effect and we have no fear whatsoever when the Minister gives his word here &mdash; unlike some other Ministers we have had experience of in the past.  We know he will do everything humanly possible to relieve these rates on the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with him to this extent. I fully appreciate that he has taken over office from the Fianna Fáil Party, with all the bungling and tomfoolery that went on during the period of Fianna Fáil administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time to-day I asked the Minister for Lands in Question 26:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;if he will state what proposals the Land Commission have under consideration for dealing with the congested areas and to what extent they propose meeting this problem by the migration of small farmers and others?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the following Question No. 27 I asked the Minister for Lands:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;if he will state (1) the number <Col N="772" /> of migrants whom the Land Commission propose transferring from each county in the West of Ireland during the next few years, and (2) the number of farmers from areas other than the congested areas proposed for transfer during the same period?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In reply to that the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As to the first part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to a written statement given in reply to a similar question put down by Deputy Bartley on 3rd November, 1954.</P>
    <P>As to the second part, almost every migrant comes from a congested area since it is essential that his surrendered holding should be of value in relieving congestion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In reply to the question asking the Minister what proposals the Land Commission had under consideration for dealing with congested areas and to what extent they proposed to meet this problem by the migration of small farmers and others, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the last six financial years the Land Commission divided 160,000 acres of untenanted land of which 121,000 acres was utilised for the relief of congestion, a total of 8,000 congests benefiting thereby. In all, about 530 migrants were transferred to new holdings, the vast majority of them being small farmers.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is expected that for some few years the Land Commission will be able to do at least as much for the relief of congestion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The question by Deputy Bartley to which the Minister referred me was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands if he will say how many holdings the Land Commission will provide in this financial year for people from each separate county of the congested area in exchange for their former holdings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister's answer to that was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The success of a scheme of migration depends very much on the goodwill <Col N="773" /> and co-operation of those affected by it; I think, therefore, that it would not be to the advantage of the people to disclose figures which would only provoke jealousy and dissension between the various congested districts.  The factor that bears most weight with the Land Commission in choosing migrants is the suitability of their original holdings for increasing and rearranging the holdings which will be left.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit that the Minister deliberately evaded a direct reply to a direct question.  The first of my questions was to ask the Minister for Lands what proposals the Land Commission have under consideration for dealing with the congested areas and I also asked him to state the number of migrants that the Land Commission propose to transfer from each county in the West of Ireland during the next few years and he refers me to a reply which he gave to Deputy Bartley who asked a similar question on November 3rd.  I do not like wearying the House by repeating the reply he gave then. He gave no direct answer.  He referred to-day to the evasive answer he gave on that occasion when he said it was not desirable to give figures, that it might lead to misunderstandings and jealousies between different parts of the congested areas.</P>
    <P>One thing to which I want to refer is that if his answer to Deputy Bartley be taken on its face value it discloses that it would not be advantageous to discuss figures which would only provoke &ldquo;jealousy and dissension between the various congested districts&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;The factor that bears most weight with the Land Commission in choosing migrants is the suitability of their original holdings for increasing and rearranging the holdings that will be left.&rdquo;  Surely the Minister as a man with responsibility for such an important part of our life should have more sense than to say that he only considers the one problem of how the farms that remain after the migrants have gone can be utilised.  Does he not know that migration is wrong? Does he not know that even with the utmost power and resources with direct migration he can only deal in a small <Col N="774" /> way with the problem of emigration? He must take into consideration other factors as well as that, such as what other means of living exists in these areas apart from the land, how much these farmers get from fishing or from industries perhaps in the vicinity.  They cannot make a living on their farms. If only the holdings of those who have migrated are available how can the Minister find land to be divided to create new holdings?  If that is the Minister's attitude he should not be in his position.</P>
    <P>The whole problem is: what is going to be done with the congested areas and how far is the Minister looking forward to providing ways and means through direct migration for a solution to that major problem?  That is one of the most stupid answers a Minister or anybody else could give.  It shows that he has no interest in dealing with the problem in its widest sense.  His refusal to give figures as to the number of migrants taken from each county suggests a sinister motive.</P>
    <P>The Minister is as well aware as I am that it has been stated time and again that, since he became Minister, a preference has been given to certain counties in the West of Ireland to the detriment of other counties the claims of which were equally good but which have been mercilessly neglected.  In his own interest and in the interests of decency in public administration, the Minister should go out of his way to assure the public that these rumours are, as I hope they are, unfounded, and to give me the figures in a direct way in reply to a direct question.  If the day comes when a Minister in this Parliament of ours refuses to answer direct questions on matters which are of vital importance, the day is also coming close when the public will no longer have any confidence or belief in representation in the Dáil, and when our people will be driven to adopt other methods of getting satisfaction for their grievances than by means of questions here, if these questions are to be treated cavalierly and evasive answers given.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter and to give me the full answer to the questions I put to <Col N="775" /> him to-day, to give me the numbers taken from each county.  I did not ask him for the figures for six years; I asked him only for the figures for last year.  Why make the position more involved by bringing me back five or six years?  I know very well that the number migrated from my part of the country during the past six years is infinitesimal, and I know that last year the number would not exceed five from County Leitrim, which is one of the most congested and needy areas, in the matter of migration, in the country. I do not want an answer from the Minister in relation to five years, but I want to know what is his plan for the next few years, as definitely set out in my question.  No reply was given to that.</P>
    <P>Why this evasion?  Why not tell us? Do I not know perfectly well that, in Leitrim and Sligo, many families are holding themselves together under difficult conditions and refusing even yet to emigrate to other countries, because of their hope that at least now, when war conditions have passed and a new Government is in office, conditions will improve to the extent of their being enabled to get a means of living on alternative farms in other parts of the country.  Do not continue to deceive them.  For God's sake, be honest and tell these people that the number of migrants from their area in the past five years is almost negligible &mdash; a maximum of ten out of all the hundreds the Minister has referred to &mdash; and tell them not to be wasting their time in hoping that you have any plans to do better for them.  Let them follow the example of the man who tries to make provision for himself and his family by going elsewhere, as is your plan.</P>
    <P>I can tell the Minister here and now that his present plan is to emigrate the people from North Leitrim and part of North Sligo and get rid of them.  The Minister sends out circulars each half-year when the annuity comes due to all these small farmers asking them will they sell their land to his Department for afforestation. He wants to replace the human beings down there with trees.  That is his plan.  I have clear evidence of that, <Col N="776" /> and, in the absence of straightforward answers to my questions, I charge him with being guilty of such an effort.  In the old days when Cromwell came here, according to tradition, he said: &ldquo;To Hell or to Connaught.&rdquo;  There was a choice, but the Minister now gives them no choice.  He forces them out of their holdings and leaves them without an alternative means of living.</P>
    <P>If that is his policy, I can tell him that, so far as lies within my power, I am going to bring all these facts before the people and tell them that questions by me in the Dáil and representations made here on their behalf are going to be of no avail, that they are to be left to fend for themselves and to use their own resources in defence of what they acquired under terrible conditions and continue to preserve under the same conditions.  Let the Minister take responsibility.  Let him answer these questions directly and let him tell us what is his plan for the next few years.  Let him give me the figures of the numbers he proposes to transfer.</P>

      <P>To refresh Deputy Maguire's mind, because I am sure the information is lying dormant in his head, let me tell him that, when I first became Minister for Lands in 1948, I found a Land Commission that was frozen stiff by Deputy Maguire's Party since 1941.  I found a Land Commission frozen stiff by the Fianna Fáil Party since the month of April, 1941, the excuse being that the Land Commission should not take up land for the relief of congestion during the emergency years.  Perhaps that was all right, but the Minister at the time distinctly conveyed to the House that the close-down Order would last only for the duration of the emergency.  The war was over for three years when I took office in February, 1948, and there was not the slightest indication that the Government was going to lift that Order and allow the Land Commission to go ahead with the relief of congestion.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in 1941, the Land Commission had an inspectorial staff, the principal part in the Land Commission, the outdoor staff, of approximately 138.  When I took office, there were only 53 inspectors because all the rest had been lent to the Department of Agriculture to enforce the compulsory tillage regulations.  Perhaps that was all right, too; but here is the point&mdash; when I sought to get them back, they were not available, because some had retired, some had resigned and some had stayed on permanently with the Department of Agriculture.  I recruited, inside nine months, new staff to bring the inspectorial staff to the figure of 153, the highest ever and not alone that, but I was not a fortnight in office when my predecessor, Deputy Derrig&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and does not want <Col N="778" /> to hear the answer, but he will hear it, no matter how he interrupts.  In March, 1948, when I had been about a month in office, I found that the Land Commission had not got one single perch of land in hands for the relief of congestion, with the exception of bits and scraps all over the country which had been offered to people who would not take it because of its quality.  That was the machine I got to work when I took office in 1948 &mdash; the work of Deputy Maguire's Party.  I will not accept responsibility for what they did or for what Deputy Maguire helped them to do.</P>

      <P>When I took over the Land Commission, I did not get one single perch of land from the outgoing Minister, Deputy Moylan, for the relief of congestion.  There was none there, because whatever had been there had been divided off and on during the war years.  When I went out of office in 1951, I handed over a total inspectorate of 153 to Deputy Derrig.  I handed over 28,000 acres of lands on which he could work for the last three years.  To go back over the last six years &mdash; Deputy Maguire does not want me to repeat the answer which I gave him to-day, but I shall repeat it &mdash; the Land Commission divided 160,000 acres of untenanted land.  For Deputy Maguire's information, I may say that untenanted land means vested land, and it does not take into account about 40,000 acres of unvested land which was resumed.  Of the 160,000 acres of untenanted land, 121,000 acres were utilised for the relief of congestion, a <Col N="779" /> total of 8,000 congests benefiting thereby.  In all, about 530 migrants were transferred to new holdings, the vast majority of them being small farmers. If there is evasion in that, I want to tell Deputy Maguire that I hope to do as well and a lot better for the next six years, and I shall tell him why.  The first two years of my period as Minister were practically barren for the reason that I had nothing to work on.</P>

      <P>Deputy Maguire wants me to project myself into the future and to give a guarantee of what is going to happen in the next year or two.  I think that Deputy Maguire or anybody who has any experience of Land Commission work knows that it would not be fair for the Minister for Lands to try to give details in respect to the work of the Land Commission for next spring for this reason: We have a certain number of holdings to get ready.  In these cases houses are being built, out-offices are being erected and fences are being made. From time to time the Land Commission has experienced grave and heartbreaking set-backs in this work through strikes and 101 other causes. Very often the Land Commission may set out to provide holdings for 100 or 80 migrants during the year, but in actual practice they might fall short of one-third or one-fourth of the target due to the causes I have stated.  I shall not mislead the House by giving them what at best would be only a guess.  I refuse positively to mislead the House.  I think a Minister should stick entirely to the truth and rather than mislead the House I shall not hazard a guess and it would be only a guess.  If the information that is being sought from the Land Commission is not available, then I think we should not have to venture into the realms of conjecture.  I think it would be wrong and if we were to do so, I think the very thing that Deputy Maguire said in regard to people losing respect for Parliament would become a reality.  If I were to state that we would have 150 migrants in the next year and if our accomplishment fell short of that number by ten or 20, questions could be raised here, and people who have no way of ascertaining the difficulties which confront the Land Commission would say: &ldquo;What kind of Parliament have we when you have a Minister for Lands stating that there would be 150 holdings available this year and now there are only 120.&rdquo;  I shall not mislead the House and I shall not be stampeded by the Deputy who seems to be rather touchy on this question <Col N="781" /> of the relief of congestion.  He talks about migrants.</P>

      <P>I want to make this clear.  The Land Commission while I am in charge of it will never go around making gifts of land to people.  The Land Commission has a very serious problem in regard to the relief of congestion and nobody will be migrated except people whose land is needed <Col N="782" /> for the relief of congestion.  Deputy Maguire mentioned trees.  I did not quite understand what he meant.  I am anxious to see forestry for two reasons, first, to supply our own timber needs, and, secondly, to give much-needed employment in rural areas, but I certainly will not allow a situation to arise where trees will crush out people because much as we want trees, we want people more.  The Deputy made a number of points arising out of his question.  He perhaps wants a bit of publicity.  I hope he has got it, but I want to tell him that the relief of congestion will go on while I have a say in the Land Commission and the planting of trees will go on but in the proper places.</P>
