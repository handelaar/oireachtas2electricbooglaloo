      <P>A new school to replace the present Glasheen Boys' National School is in course of erection and preliminary arrangements are being made for the replacement of St. Patrick's Girls' and Infants' National Schools.</P>
      <P>Apart from this the general question of the national school requirements in Cork County Borough and its immediate vicinity is under examination in my Department.  This examination includes both the question of the provision of school accommodation for the new housing areas at Ballyphehane, Spangle Hill, Churchfield and Bishops-town and the question of the replacement and/or reconstruction and extension of existing schools.  As regards the provision to be made for new areas, my Department has the advice of a local committee representative of the various interests concerned.  It has already been decided that new schools should be provided in the Ballyphehane and Churchfield areas, but pending the completion of the examination of the general question I regret that I am not in a position to give detailed information as to the arrangements to be made for the area as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no proposals before my Department for the building, reconstruction or extension of technical <Col N="930" /> schools in Cork County Borough, apart from the School of Music, the construction of which is at present in progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state in respect of the latest year for which statistics are available the number of acres of land let by the Land Commission for (1) tillage and (2) grazing; further, if he will state whether he proposes to discontinue the practice of letting land on the 11 months' system by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been invariably the practice of the Land Commission to let lands which have come into their possession, pending allotment or rearrangement. Thus, the position is in a constant state of flux because each winter and spring some of these lands are being allotted while fresh land is constantly coming in, either by way of acquisition, resumption or holdings surrendered by migrants.  The latest period for which statistics are available is the year ended 31st December, 1953, and the figure then was 25,182 acres let in grazing, and 3,140 acres let in tillage.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the meaning of the latter part of the Deputy's question, as if the Land Commission discontinue the letting of land it is obvious that a serious wastage and inconvenience will occur, as in most cases smallholders are most anxious to get the temporary use of these lands.</P>

      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I understand from the Civil Service Commissioners that as no appointment was made as a result of the competition held in January of this year it would be contrary to long standing practice for them to indicate who were or were not candidates at that competition.</P>

(b) The committee's submission was mainly informative being designed to bring those proposals to the notice of the Minister for Finance <Col N="934" /> and to afford him an opportunity of issuing an interim direction to the committee.

The Department of Agriculture was requested to supply additional information on both proposals, but it was not found possible to make that information available before the 31st May, 1954.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 15 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The duty of customs imposed by Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1952 (No. 20 of 1952), shall in respect of tobacco imported on or after the 1st day of October, 1954, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates specified in Part I of the Fifth Schedule to this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The duty of excise imposed by Section 19 of the Finance Act, 1934 <Col N="938" /> (No. 31 of 1934), shall, as on and from the 1st day of October, 1954, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates specified in Part II of the Fifth Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>(3)  Sub-sections (3) and (5) of Section 19 of the Finance Act, 1934, shall apply to tobacco which is chargeable with the duty of excise imposed by sub-section (1) of the section at a rate specified in Part II of the Fifth Schedule to this Act and for the purpose of such application references in the said sub-sections (3) to (5) of the said Section 19 to Part I of the Sixth Schedule to the said Finance Act, 1934, shall be construed and have effect as references to Part II of the Fifth Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>(4)  The rebate on hard pressed tobacco mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 17 of the Finance Act, 1940 (No. 14 of 1940), shall, in respect of any such tobacco sold and sent out for use within the State by any licensed manufacturer on or after the 1st day of October, 1954, be at the rate of two shillings and eight pence per pound.</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purpose of this section, importation shall be deemed to take place at the time when the entry of the relevant goods under the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, is delivered.</P>
    <P>This is another of the series of amendments which I have moved to this Bill, the purpose of which is to reduce taxes to the extent that members of the present Government, and Deputies behind them, had suggested was possible prior to the general election.  The most remarkable thing about the discussion upon these amendments is that no member of the Government has thought fit to explain to the Dáil why it is not possible to reduce these taxes now.  They had repeatedly asserted in the past that these taxes were unnecessary and had expressed confidence in their ability to reduce them, if the opportunity were given them.  Deputies will recollect that the present Taoiseach had said that he would repeal these taxes in ten minutes if he became head of the Government, and that he would resign in one minute if he found himself unable to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> Perhaps equally remarkable is the fact that during the course of the debate not a single Deputy sitting behind the Government thought fit to ask the Government as to why a reduction is not possible.  These Deputies seem to have forgotten completely the confidence they expressed before the election in their ability to force the Government to reduce taxes.  Should they not now ask for an explanation as to why it cannot be done?  Not a single one of them has sought that explanation.  Apparently they are content to vote to maintain these taxes without knowing why.  The definite pledges and undertakings given by them to the electorate are still fresh in our minds.  The speed at which they are discarding these pledges and repudiating their undertakings is rather nauseating.  They should at least make some pretence at seeking a reasonable explanation as to why it is necessary to maintain these taxes at their present level.</P>
    <P>If the Government will say that these taxes cannot be reduced, that the revenue that they will yield is required for the purpose of meeting the cost of necessary Government services, then the position will be clear to the public.  The issue between us during the course of the election campaign was whether these taxes were necessary or not.  We said that they were necessary, that the Budget could not be balanced without the revenue which they represented except at the cost of a serious curtailment in the scope of Government services. Deputies opposite said that these services could be maintained and taxes reduced at the same time.  If that was not so, will they say so?  If the explanation is that the Government has now found out, and Deputies behind them are beginning to suspect, that during the election campaign they were talking nonsense and, if they stand up now and say so, it will end this discussion. We know they were talking nonsense. They are beginning to suspect it.  Some members of the Government know that in that respect we were right and they were wrong but will they say that?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for Finance stand <Col N="940" /> up and say that he is resisting the reduction of these taxes because he cannot forgo the revenue which they will bring in?  That is the explanation which the Dáil is entitled to get, an explanation which the public will understand.  It is treating the Dáil with contempt for Ministers to ask the House to resist these amendments without giving a reason for that resistance. It is treating the public with contempt, in view of the declarations that were made to them and the promises that were given to them, to refuse now to cut down these taxes without giving a single reason for maintaining them.</P>
    <P>Do Deputies not think their constituents are entitled to an explanation of the votes they gave yesterday? Is there one Deputy opposite who will attempt to give that explanation?  If that explanation is not given it merely demonstrates the contempt that Deputies have for those who voted for them.</P>

      <P>For Deputy Lemass to get up in this House and talk in terms of the word &ldquo;nauseating&rdquo; is, to say the least of it, the most impertinent suggestion that could be made to this House by that Deputy.  Deputy Lemass knows very well&mdash;no one knows better, as I have already said&mdash;that these amendments are nothing but a piece of showacting, play-acting and disgraceful play-acting at that.  Deputy Lemass knows that he has no case to make in respect of them and, because he had no case to make, he adopted the normal course adopted by a person who has no case&mdash;he put up here a case attempting to put into our mouths a case that was never made.</P>
      <P>The other night, during the course of the discussion on the Second Reading of this Bill, I went to some pains to show, and gave quotation after quotation from the general election campaign, that the complaint of the Fianna Fáil Party at that time was not that we were promising too much but that we were making no promises. Now they come to us to-day and try to make a different case altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> Deputy Lemass knows full well that the quotations he read yesterday from Mr. Costello and others dealing with the £10,000,000 taxation were quotations&mdash;though he did not give the dates of them&mdash;of what was said in 1952 and the Deputy and the House know that there is a very different situation to-day from the situation that obtained in 1952.  At the time of the Budget in 1952 current expenditure was estimated in my predecessor's Budget speech in April 1952 as being £94,826,000.  This year it was estimated by my predecessor as being £109,935,000.  If we are to discuss 1954, let us discuss it in terms of 1954 and let us not try to make the dishonest case, as Deputy Lemass made yesterday and wishes to repeat to-day, of treating 1954 on a 1952 basis.</P>

      <P>I want to draw attention to one matter.  Deputy Lemass spent a lot of time last night giving us quotations and reading for the benefit of the House advertisements appearing over the names of candidates in, I presume, the election campaign.  In one of the morning newspapers the words of Deputy Lemass in which I am interested are reported exactly, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In another advertisement it stated: &lsquo;The Labour Party seeks the support of the people in the forthcoming election so that they can bring about a reduction in the price of tobacco, cigarettes, beer and spirits&mdash;Vote No. 1&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and the candidate's name happens to be my own.  I am asking Deputy Lemass, through you, Sir, to give the date on which that advertisement appeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>There is only one leaflet and it is here.  It is in my possession.  I have no complaint against the reporter whose report appears on the morning paper.  He is just doing his work and he reported what was said in the House.  The Official Report of yesterday's debate will prove that Deputy Lemass said &ldquo;another advertisement&rdquo;.  Being my <Col N="942" /> own director of elections I can say that there was but one leaflet issued and I defy anyone to show that such was stated.</P>
      <P>My sole reason for intervening now is to let the House know that Deputy Lemass has been politically so dishonest that he is prepared to say advertisements appeared.  Unfortunately he barked up the wrong tree when he referred to a Deputy who had but one advertisement throughout the whole campaign.  I believe I am entitled at this stage to ask Deputy Lemass either to prove in substance the correctness of his statement or openly withdraw it here&mdash;one or the other.</P>

      <P>It is most unusual for a Party the size of the Fine Gael Party, that is supposed to be a responsible Party, to run away from its election pledges and to give no excuse. The Minister for Finance described as play-acting and disgraceful play-acting the moving of amendments in the House to give effect to the promises upon which Fine Gael got sufficient votes to form a Government.  The 15 lawyers in Fine Gael may parse and make fine points as to what they promised and what they did not promise and what they were pretending to promise but the average voter in the country was asked clearly by the leaders of Fine Gael and by their supporters and canvassers to vote for the Fine Gael candidates in order to &ldquo;throw high taxation and high prices overboard.&rdquo;  Every voter in the country who looked at the hoardings during the general election campaign could see 20 feet square advertisements appealing to the voters to &ldquo;throw high taxation and high prices overboard.&rdquo;  The only thing that has been thrown overboard by Fine Gael since they came into office were their promises.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to give Deputies an opportunity of fulfilling their election promises to reduce the taxes on tobacco and cigarettes.  That is why it <Col N="954" /> is here.  When Deputies vote on this amendment they will be voting to fulfil those pledges or voting to repudiate them.  There can be no question whatever but that a specific undertaking was given by every one of them that those taxes would be reduced and reduced immediately. That is what the public understood when they voted for them.  Were the public so completely wrong as Deputies now suggest?  I do not believe that it is possible to get 75 or 76 Deputies in this House of different Parties all of whom are prepared cynically to repudiate their election pledges at the first opportunity they have of giving effect to them in the way suggested here yesterday.  Surely there is one honest man amongst them who will take this opportunity of voting to do the things he undertook to his electors he would do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Finance if it is not a fact that when the Budget was introduced&mdash; from which Budget this Finance Bill is a natural consequence&mdash;they did not then vote against that Budget because of the very objections they had to it as stated by them during the election campaign?  Will the Minister for Finance now tell us the reasons which prompted Fine Gael and the Labour Party to vote against the Budget?  If my recollection is correct, during the discussion on the Budget all the arguments were put forward which were subsequently used in the election campaign. If it is not fair for us to say that the public were misled by the statements made by the candidates who now form the coalition groups and that the public were not entitled to imply from all the leaflets and speeches that Fine Gael, Labour, and so forth were against our Budget because of these particular taxes, would they now say what reasons prompted them&mdash;all of them&mdash;to vote <Col N="955" /> against the Budget and now to change round and vote for the Finance Bill that enforces all the items of the Budget?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance says that you cannot have it both ways.  If anybody wants to have it both ways, I think it is the Minister for Finance. He wants to suggest that he was correct when he opposed the Budget and voted against it, and he wants to suggest that he is correct now in voting for the Budget proposals by opposing these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question: I did not make a statement.  My recollection is that Fine Gael in particular and also the Labour Party were opposed to the Budget and they were opposed to the Budget on the grounds that it contains taxation levels which they said were too high.  It contains excise duties on beer, spirits and tobacco which they said were too high. Either they were correct when they had that view then or they are correct now in their view that the levels of taxation are not too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout this discussion, Deputy Lemass has sought to make it clear that when Fianna Fáil introduced the Budget they introduced it with all these items which they considered necessary to meet the expenditure. The opposition to it was that they were not necessary.  Now, we have those who opposed the view of Fianna <Col N="956" /> Fáil, when Fianna Fáil were in Government, arguing in favour of the maintenance of the Budget as introduced and of its consequential taxes and excise levies.  By taking the same steps to-day as they took yesterday and voting against these amendments, they will only be confirming to the public that there was no other course open to Fianna Fáil than the course which they took in the Budget which they introduced immediately before the election.</P>
    <P>The purpose of having Fine Gael and Labour vote on these amendments is to have on record the fact that what they said before the election and throughout the course of the election campaign was nothing but nonsense, if it was not a deliberate attempt to mislead the public into believing that what they advocated could be accomplished. I cannot speak with any certain knowledge of the position outside Dublin City or outside the confines of my constituency but I believe that very many of the people who voted for Fine Gael and Labour in my constituency did so in the belief that they would get these reliefs&mdash;reliefs to the extent that these amendments try to bring about.</P>
    <P>The leaflet that Fine Gael published with the pictures of the pint of stout, the lb. of tea, and so forth, and the two prices&mdash;the pre-1952 price and the price ruling at present&mdash;was for no purpose other than to make people believe that, by taking off these taxes and excise duties, these commodities would be brought back again to the 1951 price level.</P>

Then the people would have the benefit of the promise being met no matter what the result.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass read out a number of leaflets.  The unfortunate aspect of the situation is that we should have collected and kept all those leaflets. We might be able to make use of them on another occasion.  We might have a search made in all the constituencies to procure some of those leaflets which may still be available.  We will then be able to read them out and probably get legal opinion as to the exact meaning of the words used in them.  The Minister for Finance might then be able to tell us whether the people were quite wrong in assuming anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance made one very extraordinarily satisfactory admission in this House as far as we are concerned.  He was talking about their leaving us £22,500,000 in the Exchequer when they left office in 1951.  I pointed out that there were commitments attached to it.  That was admitted and the Minister stated on this occasion that there was no money left in the Exchequer but that there were commitments.  I asked him to give us a list of the commitments but we have not got them yet.  We can get that list by way of parliamentary question and answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asked me a question which was really to put me off the line I was on.  The question the Minister now asks me is whether it was wrong for the groups which make up the Government to have issued a 12-point programme before they took office as a Government and, if so, why was it not equally wrong for Fianna Fáil to have issued 17 points before they took office also after an election.  I am not talking about that but I will answer <Col N="962" /> it.  I think it is a good thing for Parties to try and indicate what their programme will be.  Particularly is that the case where the groups that make up a coalition have to indulge in a certain amount of bargaining.  We had the Labour Party saying that they would not join the Fine Gael Coalition Government unless certain things were done.</P>
    <P>I do not know what were the things discussed at the bargaining table. They are known only to those who participated in the discussion.  These 12 points were not issued during the election campaign.  We are a democratically elected Parliament and the people who elect a Government elect them on the basis of either performance or promises.  On this occasion the issue in the election was a cost-of-living issue.  It was described as a bread and butter election campaign. It concerned all matters appertaining to the well-being of the household. The cost of living was to be reduced.  Taxation was to be reduced. That was how it was summed up.  This is what we allude to.</P>
    <P>Thousands and thousands of voters who had not what might be called strict Party affiliations, those who were not, if you like to call it, strict Fianna Fáil supporters or strict Fine Gael supporters, the floating vote, looked at the performance of Fianna Fáil and the promises of the other candidates. They said they would vote for the other groups and candidates because they offered them something better than the Fianna Fáil people were apparently able to give.  Those people, having voted that way, and having expected the results promised, now find that none of these promises was made at all.</P>
    <P>They will not get cheaper cigarettes. They will not get cheaper tobacco. They will jolly well go on smoking cigarettes and pay the same price for them.  I say to the Minister that you cannot by legislation impose a direction that everybody must smoke so many cigarettes every day.  When you advise people that they can get goods cheaper than they are being sold, then they expect to get them.  The only alternative open to them, if the position of <Col N="963" /> their affairs is such, is that they will have to cut down on certain items. What will they cut down on?  They may cut down on cigarettes and tobacco. They may eat a little bit more butter. If they do it will cost the Exchequer more.  I hope they will eat a lot more.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that because the price was so high they were denied this very essential item of nourishment. Now that it is somewhat cheaper, I hope they will get a little extra nourishment.  The Minister and his colleagues and supporters in the back benches can take the line of scoring political debating points in here, but the man who has a limited income to live on, who has to budget what he and his family will spend their money on, will now have to re-examine how his expenditure is going to take place. He is not going to get anything cheaper except, of course, butter.  He will have to either drink less pints or drink more&mdash;or he might drink the same.  If he does that, it will reflect itself on some other commodity.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to say that I genuinely believed and still believe that the public, the floating vote people, who voted for Fine Gael and for Labour on these matters, gave the extra votes because of the fact that they believed that they were going to get some concessions, and apparently they are going to get none.</P>

      <P>The air of unreality in this debate has, I think, only been equalled by that which Alice found long ago when she arrived in Wonderland. I could carry the parallel further and say that Deputy Lemass could be cast as one of the characters of that bit of literature.  He struck me throughout the whole discussion as being a very self-confident, assertive person who had found that the basis of his self-confidence was his uneasiness, and who was bolstering up that self-confidence by whistling past the graveyard a very silly tune.  The fact is, of course, that Deputy Lemass has been arranging things for many years, and he does not realise that now his power to arrange has gone.  He will not arrange the business of this Government or the <Col N="964" /> order in which that business will be taken.  He will not decide when we will do anything.  We will decide that.  When we come to do those things, those promises we made we will keep, and when we come to initate the processes which will lighten the load on the people's back, take off the load that has been put there by Mr. Lemass and his colleagues, I hope we will have the support of Mr. Lemass&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night the Minister for Finance referred to a pamphlet that was issued on my behalf in the 1951 General Election, and he did not read the pamphlet.  I asked him to do so, and he did not, but he went on to say that the effect of that pamphlet was that it promised to reduce the cost of living.  I have no recollection that there was any definite promise, or any promise, made in the 1951 General Election in County Kildare by Fianna Fáil to reduce the cost of living or to reduce the price of any specific commodity during that election campaign. I have heard Ministers state here that they made no promises in this election, but there was an advertisement put into the newspapers in Kildare in this election, and a large pamphlet issued setting out the prices for a large number of commodities&mdash; the 1951. prices, when the inter-Party Government were put out of office, and the 1954 prices.  We had tea at so much a lb., although it was not true; tea could only be bought on ration at that price, but it was put in the pamphlet. There was also sugar and butter at so much, and the prices that prevailed this year when the Fianna Fáil Government went out of office.  What was the purpose of posting up that poster or putting in that advertisement with &ldquo;vote Deputy Sweetman&rdquo; at the bottom of it?  On it also was that Fianna Fáil was a cruel Government, that they delighted, one would think&mdash;that they took a fiendish <Col N="965" /> delight&mdash;in causing hardship to the people.  What was the purpose, or what were the ordinary people in the constituency of Kildare to think but that when Deputy Sweetman referred to the prices that existed when the inter-Party was last in and the prices that existed when they went out of office, it was their intention to reduce the prices of these commodities. Cigarettes and tobacco were mentioned in it at the prices that prevailed in 1951 to which they were reduced by the previous inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>I remember, in 1948, when the Minister for Finance was on the platform asking for the votes of the people of Kildare and saying that Fianna Fáil put a cruel tax on cigarettes, brandishing a packet of cigarettes from the platform outside every chapel gate in the county and saying that Fianna Fáil put on that cruel tax.  If there was a cruel tax put on, the inter-Party Government decided that they would take them off immediately they got into office in 1948.</P>
      <P>As well as I can recollect, the tax that was put on in 1952 was a much more severe tax, and there was a very much greater hardship put on the people by that increase, and that is all the more reason why it should be reduced now.  We had that &ldquo;facts for housewives,&rdquo; listing all those prices and those increases, and I believe that the people in the county who supported Fine Gael gave them support more than they would have got in the ordinary course of events in the belief that Fine Gael was going to make life easier for them in that election. Deputy Sweetman, for the first time, headed the poll.</P>

      <P>Beside the Minister for Finance we had in that campaign the Tánaiste, and the Tánaiste promised everything. He promised that he would reduce taxation to reduce the cost of living. He referred to the very severe charges put on cigarettes.  Even when he was returning thanks for his election at the head of the poll, he said that we were going to move now from&mdash;he referred to a word which I just cannot catch&mdash; that we were moving into greater expectations from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That was the trend of the Tánaiste's speech there, that subsidies were to be restored, the price of cigarettes and tobacco to be reduced, and all that.  If the Minister for Finance says that he was making no promises, he suggested in his propaganda that he would reduce taxation, reduce the rates of taxation.  He blamed Fianna Fáil for the high rates in the country to which he himself had contributed largely and to hold down which he had done nothing.  Fianna Fáil were blamed for everything. Deputy Norton had no hesitation in promising everything and he was so lavish in his promises that I was afraid the people would doubt him, but they did not&mdash;they took him at his word.  I noticed, however, that at the end of all the speeches at the Fine Gael meetings at which Fianna Fáil were attacked for their policy of austerity, the speakers asked for No 2 votes for Deputy Norton, which I take to be an <Col N="967" /> indication that Fine Gael must have some responsibility for the promises made by their colleague who is now Tánaiste in this Government.</P>

      <P>There are very many people at present who are sadly disappointed and who very much regret the way they allowed themselves to be deceived by the Parties who now form the Government.  We heard a lot of moaning here for a couple of years by the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture about the poor old age pensioner's smoke and we were told that the old age pensioner could not have his smoke, due to the cruelty of Fianna Fáil.  That was echoed by many other Deputies on the opposite side.  We are now told that that situation cannot be put right immediately, but I can assure the Government that the people of the country thought it would be done as quickly as it was done in 1948, when the inter-Party Government reduced the price of drink, tobacco and other commodities even before the victory celebrations were over.</P>
      <P>They were down in West Cork&mdash; Deputy Costello, Deputy Flanagan and others&mdash;saying that we now have the &ldquo;Johnny Costello pint.&rdquo;  Naturally, the people thought all the reductions that were promised in the last election would be brought into force just as quickly this time, but Deputy A. Barry now stands up and tells the House that all these things will be done when the Government think it right to do them and not when Deputy Lemass thinks it right to do them.  We do not know whether that will be within the next five years, but it is not going to happen during the present financial year, we are told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody doubts that we were heading back to that position in this Budget we are discussing, in which we started off by increasing income-tax allowances and reducing the price of bread, a reduction which costs practically the same as this reduction in the price of butter about which they talked so much.  One halfpenny off the price of the loaf amounts to practically the same thing as 5d. <Col N="968" /> per lb. off the price of butter, and the people who will benefit most by that reduction in the price of butter are the hotel and restaurant people.  The inter-Party Government know very well what happened when they tried to redeem their promises in 1948 and when they reduced all these things immediately.  They know that they put themselves in debt and they know well that the Fianna Fáil Government which followed them had to pay that debt.  They know very well all the things for which they did not make provision.  They did not make provision for paying the civil servants the increase under the arbitration award and made no provision for the subsidy to C.I.E. and they were using American dollars at the time.</P>

      <P>We will try to keep as near to it as we can and I think I am entitled to reply when a new Deputy stands up here and tells us: &ldquo;We will reduce the price of these things in our own good time.&rdquo;  We have no doubt in the world that we would have been able to do it in our own good time, but these people went before the people and deceived them by leading them to believe that it would be done as quickly as it was done in 1948.  I am merely stating what happened after these reductions in 1948 in order to point out why Fianna Fáil had to bring in that severe Budget.  It was due simply to the debt left by the inter-Party Government, and of course the inter-Party Government learned a lesson which they do not want to repeat in 1954.  They know very well that they could not do all this without sinking the country deeper into debt, with the result that we get 5d. off the price of butter, that being all we are to get this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> I do not hear anybody weeping about the old age pensioner's smoke on that side now.  The Deputies there seem to have forgotten all about him and his smoke, and to have forgotten all the crying Deputy Flanagan, who is now Parliamentary Secretary, carried on for a couple of hours one day.  They have completely forgotten about these poor people for whom they had all the pity&mdash;the poor old age pensioners who could not get a smoke because the price was too high.  I say that this Government has deceived the country at large by their promises to reduce taxation.  As I say, there is no doubt that the people expected these reductions to come into force just as quickly as they came into force in 1948. That is what the people expected, but they are now sadly disappointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things noticeable about the attitude of the Government Parties in this debate on the tobacco duty and in fact in the entire debate.  One is that they are particularly anxious to deny that they committed themselves in any way to the public during the election campaign to a reduction in prices and a reduction in the taxation on any commodity. The other is their perturbation about our using our right in the House to expose their attitude when they got their first opportunity to make good some of the many promises they made.  Every Deputy from the Government side who spoke was at great pains to explain how they made no promises of any kind.  That may sound all right here, but there are thousands of people throughout the country waiting and watching to see what the attitude of the Government is going to be on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to some of the election speeches in reference to the tax on tobacco and cigarettes, and not merely did they promise to reduce these things but they gave the very striking illustration to their hearers of a village or town with a row of shops on one side selling commodities at a cheap price and a row of shops on the other side selling these commodities at a higher price.  They asked them which shops they would turn to to buy their goods and said that that was exactly what <Col N="970" /> they were being asked to decide on 18th May.  You have been asked to go out and vote on the one hand for cheap prices, for a lower cost of living and for lower taxation or on the other hand to come out and support high prices.  The same people come along and tell you now that they made no promises whatever.</P>
    <P>As regards what the Deputy said, that these reductions would be made at some time or other, we all remember the slogan at the bottom of the advertisements: &ldquo;We did it in 1948; we will do it again.&rdquo;  Now is the time to do it but the Government have no mind to do it.  They fooled the people and they are annoyed because we have exposed their tactics in this instance.</P>
    <P>Supposing the Deputies opposite made the speeches in the election campaign which they are making here in these last two days, they would be sitting over here now.  Supposing Deputy Dunne went up to Navan and made the speech he made last night in this House instead of the speech he actually made in Navan, what would be the result?  They are speaking with two voices and they are annoyed simply because we are exposing the fact.  They have already failed to indicate to the people why they are not carrying out their promises.</P>
    <P>If anyone has any doubt as to what the public thought, just ask a tobacco traveller or a representative of the tobacco or cigarette companies who will tell you that when they went around to the shopkeepers prior to the Dáil being assembled, they could hardly pick up a single order from Cork to Donegal because, before people would lay in stocks, they were waiting to see what the adjustment in prices would be.  Yet you have the Government coming in and saying that the people did not expect it and that there were no promises.  But people voted because of those promises.  That small margin of a floating vote went to them because those voters believed an effort would be made to carry out some of the blitz of promises that were made.  It is not merely our right but our duty to expose on every occasion in this House the failure of the Government Party to give effect to the <Col N="971" /> many promises they made.  The people now know the position in regard to the tax on tobacco and cigarettes, but they have been waiting; they actually refused to lay in stocks.  I refused myself to buy in stocks of tobacco.  No shopkeeper who was listening to the promises that were propagated up and down the country would do so.  However, they know now how they stand, and, what is more, they will know how they stand on the next occasion when it presents itself, and they will give their decision in no unmistakable manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance likened our attitude last night to the story of the sour grapes.  I think that it was particularly inapt as applied to this side of the House, but one is tempted to use it in relation to the speeches which have been made for the past week on these amendments. Not many on the Fine Gael Benches have spoken.  Labour has been the chief defender of the Minister.  However, all of the speeches lead one to the belief that the Minister for Finance has succeeded in convincing those Labour spokesmen, and the few Fine Gael people who have spoken, that the grapes which were represented during the election campaign as being particularly sweet&mdash;reduced prices for cigarettes, for tobacco, for the essential food items, etc&mdash;are, in fact&mdash;now that these Deputies are on the Government side of the House&mdash;very sour, indeed, and not worth hankering after, and that the Fianna Fáil people are trying to force something upon the people which they would not relish if they were given it.  Therefore, the Minister for Finance has decided that the people are not to have this year the things which he told them a month ago would be very good for them and that he would regulate the doses if they would only give him the right to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Brennan said, whether one goes to newspaper advertisements, to pamphlets or to the chalking on the dead walls and on the roadways, there cannot be any doubt in the mind of anybody who has observed in the most casual way what the promises were.  We have been held up on this <Col N="972" /> side for having on one famous occasion referred to the Oxford Dictionary.  Now the Labour Party members, Deputy Desmond particularly, were very punctilious this afternoon, in wanting Deputy Lemass to quote not alone the document but to produce Deputy Desmond's own signature on it and, in fact, to quote the paragraph chapter and verse.  We know, and everybody who took part in the election knows, that not alone were these promises made on a public platform but they were made with greater vehemence on the floors of the households which were visited by the canvassers of the various speakers.  If the Minister for Finance would have the grace to do what the Fianna Fáil Party did when they came along in 1951&mdash;and he has chided us with not having fulfilled our undertaking with regard to the subsidies&mdash;perhaps this cynical action of all the Coalition groups might be less objectionable&mdash;I will not say it would be acceptable&mdash; that is, to say that the financial position does not warrant what Fianna Fáil suggests they should do.</P>
    <P>One of the Fine Gael speakers in a commendably short speech, without referring specifically to the subject matter of this motion, cigarettes or tobacco, said that this Government is making a genuine effort to reduce the burden of the people.  We have not withheld the due amount of credit which that action has earned but I would like to say to Deputy Barry that the lightening of the burden amounts to £1,250,000.  When one considers all the &ldquo;gáisc&rdquo;, all the boasting and the ballyhoo that took place for about two months before the election and all the people who were deceived to oring about that concession of £1,250,000, it is awfully like using a sledge-hammer to kill the proverbial fly.  The Fianna Fáil Party went out without any &ldquo;gáisc&rdquo; boasting or ballyhoo and lightened the burden by £900,000 in the matter of bread and lightened it a further £900,000 in relation to other taxes.</P>
    <P>We did not shout from the housetops about that, and I think our attitude on this side of the House is readily understandable by those who have been deceived.  We know that <Col N="973" /> the convinced Fine Gael supporter was not deceived.  We know equally well that no wool was pulled over the eyes of the convinced Fianna Fáil supporter. That section of the electorate, however, to which Deputy Briscoe referred was deceived.  We think it is a perfectly justifiable attitude to point out to those people the scurvy trick&mdash; I do not think any other description can be applied to it&mdash;that has been played upon them.  Even the civil servants, and I have met many of them since the change of Government, who had calculated what they would receive from the £1,000,000 back money will be disappointed.  I admit this is not strictly relevant, but I do not think I am straying much further than the average speaker.  The civil servants had calculated to the last penny what they would get so that they could have a holiday this year.  But they have been deceived.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance would admit frankly and freely, as Fianna Fáil did in 1951, that the position is such that he cannot concede these tax reliefs, that attitude would be much less objectionable.  Putting the bold, cynical face on it in relation to the statements that were made, statements about which there is no doubt in the public mind, leaves Fianna Fáil no choice but to put these matters to a test so that the public will know exactly who has honoured his word.</P>

      <P>The demonstration by the Labour Party member who stormed out of the House because his name was associated with a promise to reduce taxation will have its effect on the country.  The attitude of the Minister for Finance and his fellow-travellers now is that the reason they published this document showing the price of cigarettes in 1954 and the price of cigarettes in 1951 was to give warning to the people that that would be the price of cigarettes under a new Coalition.  To-day and yesterday they claimed here by their attitude that the reason they published the pint as costing 10d. in 1951 and 1/2 in 1954 was to tell the people that they would continue to pay 1/2 for it.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Briscoe was speaking to-day and when he accused the Minister for Finance of having voted against the tax on tobacco, the Minister for Finance indignantly denied that he voted against the tax on tobacco in the Budget of this year.  The fact is that the increase in the tax on tobacco was put on in the 1952 Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the narrow legalistic argument.  The Minister did not vote against the tax on tobacco in this year's Budget and he wants the people to believe that he was actually in favour this year of the existing level of taxation on tobacco.  But the fact is that there was no increase in the tax on tobacco and nothing in the Budget this year about tobacco.  It was in 1952 the tax was increased and it was in that year that the present Minister and his colleagues, then in opposition, voted against it.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance should also remember that the reason that Deputy Costello, now Taoiseach, gave for not voting against the income-tax proposals was because they would be null and void after the election and would have to be reintroduced.  It is interesting in view of the fact that there was no promise about a reduction in income-tax to look at column 601 of the Official Report of 21st April last, the day the Budget was introduced. Deputy Costello said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I gather that by reason of the special provision in the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, this Resolution will go by the board on the dissolution and accordingly it will be necessary to give statutory effect to it by the Dáil in the future and by whatever Government may introduce it.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke too quickly.  He is too fond of interrupting instead of talking.  He has got plenty of opportunities of speaking since he came into the House but his policy is to interrupt every sentence uttered by anybody on this side of the House.

      <P>The reason Deputy Costello gave for not voting against the Income-Tax Resolution was that it would have to be reintroduced; he wanted to be assured that it would die or, otherwise, he would vote against it.  The statement of the Minister for Finance on that now is in keeping with the whole attitude of the Coalition groups: they were always in favour of <Col N="976" /> these taxes.  When they were ranting around the country about the price of beer and cigarettes and so forth, they were really warning the people that they stood for them.</P>
      <P>The people will have an opportunity of judging the Coalition groups by the action of the Deputies who speak here and the Deputy who stormed out of the House in indignation because his name was associated with leaflets promising a reduction in beer, cigarettes and tobacco.  It was interesting to have Deputy Desmond repudiating the leaflet of the Labour Party because his name was not signed to it.  Nevertheless he stood as a Labour Party representative. He was elected as a Labour Party Deputy and he, in turn, supported the election of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance on the basis that they would carry out the promises made by the various Coalition speakers throughout the country. The people are getting a lesson and I feel sure that they will keep it in mind. It will help towards the development of a healthy political sense.  There is no doubt that, if you get 15 or 20 Smart Alec lawyers, they can put a case, a deceptive case, to the people, but this business will enable the people the better to judge such tactics in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, what is done here is this: there are seven duties concerned dealing with boots and shoes; six of them have been completely suspended, and because it was <Col N="980" /> dealt with under the 1932 Act the seventh has been partially suspended. But for the purpose of drafting, the seventh is taken out and an amendment is brought in for the purpose of dealing with that portion which is still being retained.  It could equally well have been done by deleting the part of the seventh that has been suspended, but it is easier to draft it on the basis of talking the whole of seven out and bringing back, as we do, a small part dealing with component parts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I should like some information.  The need to revoke all these duties which have been suspended for some time, and which were previously brought into force under particular sections of various Finance Acts, arises from the anticipated final disappearance of the Supplies and Services Acts on the 31st March next.  Is it the intention of the Government that that Act should finally lapse on the 31st March?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to do is to bring to the Minister's attention the peculiar jungle that exists with regard to customs duties.  I set out to try and find out what was the purpose of the various items appearing in the Second Schedule.  It is not at all an easy matter.  Perhaps I might first of all refer to No. 10, which deals with the duty on certain roofing tiles.  The duty which is here being terminated is a duty referred to in the Finance Act of 1935.  On looking up the Act of 1935, the first thing one discovers is that by taking off this duty, apparently immediately certain other duties become leviable.  In the Act of 1935 there is a special provision with regard to roofing tiles.  It says that the duty imposed by Section 4 of the Finance Act, 1933, shall not be charged while this duty&mdash;that is the one under the 1935 Act&mdash;is chargeable, so that by taking off the duty under the 1935 Act we are reimposing the duty of the 1933 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To make it a little more complicated there is a reference in it to the Finance Act of 1947, which has a <Col N="982" /> special provision by way of amendment to the 1935 Act.  Oddly enough, the special provision which is now to be inserted in the 1935 Act by the 1947 Act concerns an Act of 1937 and it has to do with the discovery that some roofing tiles are made of asbestos.</P>
    <P>Having reached that point in my researches, and not being able to find out anything more on the subject, I addressed a question to the Minister on the 23rd June, and I asked him if he would state what, if any, customs duty or duties will be chargeable on the roofing tiles referred to in the Finance Bill, 1954, at reference No. 10 of the Second Schedule, page 17, when the Bill becomes law.  The answer was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No duty will be chargeable on the roofing tiles referred to when the Finance Bill becomes law.  The operation of the duties mentioned in the Second Schedule to the Finance Bill is at present suspended and the articles to which they apply are, therefore, entitled to importation free of duty.  To preserve this position on the passing of the Bill, the Minister for Industry and Commerce intends to ask the Government to make an Order under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, providing that articles within the scope of any of the duties revoked would not become otherwise liable to duty as a result of such revocation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that you find the extraordinary position that before the Finance Bill received its Second Reading, it has to be amended by Order.  The purpose of the Schedule was to give statutory effect to Orders already in existence.  I only discovered that afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Orders which would come within the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To give permanent effect to Orders already there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not clear on the face of it.  Then having given statutory effect to them, and made everything look nice, we discover that the Act does not really come into operation without another Order.  I am not personally interested in roofing tiles, but I am interested from the <Col N="983" /> point of view of the ordinary person or businessman who wishes to know what is the position in regard to any article imported.  I want to suggest to the Minister that he should examine the whole position and see if some codification or some legislation could be enacted which would make the matter relatively simple so that the business community and the consumer can know what is happening.  It could easily happen where those things are done by Order&mdash;as, for instance, in the boot and shoe business where there is a quota&mdash;that a member of the public would not know what the position was when he was purchasing something.  I doubt if the Minister could rattle off now the types of things that are dutiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make the Deputy a present of this fat book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>But that fat book will by this evening be out of date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And it is always subject to the Revenue Commissioners' interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask that the Minister should consider the whole position to see if something could not be devised to deal with the matter.  It happens occasionally on the Border where some individual is bringing across some item that the fat book is produced and worried customs officials look through it for the appropriate heading.  It is quite easy to find a loophole, as was already found by the Revenue Commissioners, that for instance a roofing tile could be made, not only of clay and so on but of asbestos.  It very frequently happens, I understand, that a particular article can be found under various headings and the customs officer has to find out which is the appropriate heading and very often it happens that he says in the end: &ldquo;I do not care so long as it is taken away out of my sight.&rdquo;  I do not think that is good.  I suggest that the Minister, when he finds time, might review the whole position and see if some simpler form could not be found in order that the public will at least <Col N="984" /> know what duties they are supposed to pay and when things can come in without a quota and when, in effect, though the duty may be gone, the individual cannot bring these things in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with the Deputy's point.  The references in the enactments which cover all these things are undoubtedly complicated.  The position appears to be fairly clear in this respect, however, that while a duty may be altered under an Order made under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act, 1932, a duty cannot be abolished except in a Finance Act and it is because the duty to which the Deputy referred here in No. 10 is being completely abolished that it has to come into this Act.  The duty concerned is that under tariff reference 51, if the Deputy is interested. As soon as you abolish tariff reference 51 altogether you then have to consider the provisions of the tariff reference immediately above it because it covers tiles, clay, etc., not otherwise liable.  As long as tariff reference 51 is there they are otherwise liable but when tariff reference 51 goes they are not otherwise liable and on that account an Order has to be made changing the higher reference but not abolishing it.  Tariff reference 51 is abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Deputy is aware that there is at the present moment a European Customs Union study group considering the classification of goods coming into various countries.  It is not a question of changing the duties or the methods of entry but for the purpose of getting a common classification amongest all the countries who are members of that study group.  We are members of it.  When that study group has concluded its researches that would be, apparently, a rather suitable time, I would suggest, for trying to get a classification that would be easier.  To try to do anything about it now and then possibly have to do it again when the study group concludes its research, would lead to some duplication.  I want to stress that that research is purely on the question of classification and not on the question of either altering the duty or the quota Order.  It would be desirable that so far as <Col N="985" /> possible businessmen in every country would be able easily to underst and the easiest way to understand would be to get a common classification all round.</P>

      <P>I should perhaps explain to the House that Section 27 is new in that it was not previously indicated.  It is for the purpose of extending to the various types of payment that are mentioned here an exemption that was previously given in earlier Acts.  It would be fair to say that when the exemptions were given in the earlier Acts these payments under the Health Act and the other subsidiary payments mentioned here were overlooked at that time.</P>

      <P>Before I moved to report progress last night I had been complaining of the ambiguity of the report of the Dairying Commission where they used the expression: &ldquo;a reasonably high milk inheritance&rdquo;.  I had given a table which I asserted was much more specific.  The Minister asked for the reference.  I have tried in the meantime to find the reference but have failed.  I promise to supply the reference.</P>
      <P>I have particulars in this table of the yield of butter fat per cow; food unit consumed per lb. butter fat produced, and butter fat per acre produced, for the following breeds:&mdash; Dutch Friesian, New Zealand Jersey, Danish Jersey, and Irish shorthorn. Dutch Friesian: yield of butter fat per cow, 310 lb.; food units consumed per lb. of butter fat produced, 21.1; butter fat per acre produced, 105 lb.  New Zealand Jersey: yield of butter fat per cow, 250 lb.; food units consumed, 18.7; butter fat per acre produced, 119 lb.  Danish Jersey: yield of butter fat per cow, 270 lb.; food units consumed per lb. of butter fat produced 19.8; butter fat per acre produced, 112 lb.  Irish shorthorn: yield of butter fat per cow, 180 lb.; food units consumed per lb. of butter fat produced, 30.6.; butter fat per acre produced, 73 lb.  It is obvious, while I have not been able to dig up the reference, that this was something computed, because here underneath I have: A fodder yield of 1,600 lb. S.E. is assumed in each case, while the average yield of cows in creamery districts is taken at the inflated figure of 500 gallons and 3.6 per cent. butter fat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated that the British shorthorn is barren of any blood that would provide us with a competitive dairy cow.  I will give the following table of a survey made by the British Milk Marketing Board, taken from the registers of the British milk marketing boards of England and Wales.  This <Col N="987" /> survey covered three breeds: Friesian, dairy shorthorn and Jersey.  The number of pedigree bulls surveyed in the case of the Friesian breed was 3,281; bulls whose daughters averaged over 350 lb. of butter fat, 621, or 19 per cent.; bulls whose daughters averaged over 400 lb. butter fat, 141, or 4.9 per cent.  Dairy shorthorns: number of bulls surveyed, 2,140; number of bulls whose daughters averaged over 350 lb. butter fat, 23, or 1 per cent.; number of daughters with average of 400 lb. butter fat, 2, or .01 per cent.  Jersey: 962 bulls producing 159 daughters with an average of over 350 lb. butter fat, or 16.5 per cent.; and with daughters over 400 lb. butter fat, 65, or 6.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>These figures would seem to prove that even in England, the fount of our supply of dairy shorthorn bulls, they have not a blood which would produce a competitive dairy cow of shorthorn breed.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister referred me to the herd at the Albert College.  I want to say first of all that I was speaking of the consequences of the Livestock Breeding Act.  The Minister I am sure will agree that the herd at the Albert Collge is not a consequence of the Livestock Breeding Act.  He will, I am sure, agree that, while the heifers may have been bought in the Dublin market, in the selection of the bulls which raised the standard we had concentrated all the talent in his Department and that the Albert College, like many other institutions of its kind, some of them in private hands, is not a fair comparison.  To me that indicates nothing.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I should like to give some idea of my mind on the matter by saying what Goldsmith said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The robes which wrapped their limbs in silken sloth</P>
    <P>Have robbed the neighbouring fields of half their growth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is typical of many of these so-called show pieces we find all over the country.  What we are concerned very much about is the herd, the small <Col N="988" /> herd of the small dairyman, the herd of honest John Murphy and of the small holders who in this country in the aggregate constitute the basis of our dairying industry.  These are the people in whom I am deeply interested.  These are the people who have sent me from the dairying constituency of East Cork to say in this House what I have been saying outside for a long time.</P>
    <P>I started off by bringing to the notice of the Minister the properties of the Dutch Friesian.  He made particular reference in his statement yesterday to the properties of the Aberdeen Angus.  I should like to hear if he has any reasonable objection to put forward in his reply why we should not cross good cows produced from Dutch bulls with the Aberdeen Angus. You are always safe with a breed that will colour mark.  I am one of the people who never favoured the Whitehead cross because in some areas, particularly in the adjoining constituency of South Tipperary, I remember a time not long ago when the dominant crossbreed there was the Aberdeen Angus. But then the days of scarcity came and it was a case of bulk rather than quality, and in a matter of a few years the Aberdeen Angus cross completely disappeared from these areas and was replaced by the Whitehead.  Now there is an obvious return to the Aberdeen Angus.  Any butcher or person dealing in quality meat will tell you that from the point of view of the selective consumer the Aberdeen Angus is the better beef cross.  The Whitehead cross produces an excess of yellow fat, fat of all kinds.  Now, excess fat and yellow fat in beef is objectionable to most people and I think it is wise to encourage the production and promotion of the Aberdeen Angus cross.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with something here in connection with the Dutch Friesian. We all know that in the production of the Friesian in England, as regards contour, they went the very opposite to what we did here with the shorthorn. Contour was completely thrown overboard.  They concentrated on milk production and they produced a loose, awkward, ramshackle cow, the old <Col N="989" /> British Friesian.  They got the milk average but they did not get contour in their Friesian cow.  The cow had bad conformity, was hard to keep up, and was a high consumer of food.  In more recent times they have set about removing this malconformation in their Friesian herds there.  They have done that, or they have set about doing it, by importing into the country a number of Dutch Friesian bulls.</P>
    <P>I have looked on these importations more from the angle that the British when they went to Friesland to purchase those bulls could have got better bulls, but they did a wise thing: they got the bulls genetically suited to repair the malconformation, the maldevelopment, in that loose, ramshackle cow.  In other words, they concentrated on bringing in Dutch bulls that would reduce the hind legs of this animal.  I think it is absolutely ridiculous for us here to go to England to buy the progeny of those bulls, when we could go to Holland and get a better bull, a better Dutch Friesian bull, than the British have introduced over there. There is one Dutch Friesian bull sited in the insemination station at Mitchelstown, and I hope the Minister will have an opportunity some time in the future of going to Mitchelstown and going to the Friesian station there and making a comparison side by side with some outstanding Herefords and seeing his conformation and seeing the layers of beef which he put on.</P>
    <P>I have here some interesting figures of what the British brought in and what the dams of those bulls on the average are recorded for.  First of all, the average yield of all cows in Holland is about 380 lb. of butter fat. The dams of the bulls used in Dutch Friesian A.I. centres are the progeny of 400 lb. butter fat cows.  Dams imported by the British in 1951 averaged over 481 lb. butter fat for all lactations. In addition to this, the Dutch Friesian will, I submit, produce as good a store as the Irish shorthorn.</P>
    <P>I would now say something about breeds.  While I have spoken at some length on the Friesian, I am not unmindful of the characteristics of other breeds.  I think it is ridiculous to act as we do at present regarding the breeds <Col N="990" /> on the hillsides&mdash;and we have a number of dairy farms on the hillsides up to 2,000 feet above sea level.  If the Minister or officers of his Department were to go into those areas, as I have done, they could study the type of shorthorn seen there.  Look at it.  The thing is stunted on the hillsides.  Look at the udder, the bag; it has a bag like a mountain ewe.  Is there not something wrong, if you go into Limerick from the month of October until March and see the weighty shorthorn cows, whose average weight is about 11 cwt., knee deep in mud in the paddocks in the heavy soil there?  The soil is wholly unsuitable for such a weighty animal. Would not the sensible thing be to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>In that particular area the sensible thing would be to get a light article, to introduce in that particular county the Jersey, whose average weight is around 7 cwt.  She would not bog down in the Limerick soil.  Then we know that from the creamery angle the Jersey is 40 per cent. a butter producer, a better converter of food into butter fat than any other breed.</P>
      <P>Getting back to the hillsides, we have quite a number of our dairy farms on the hills up to 1,500 and 2,000 feet up. I have made a particular study of the type of cow on the hillside. They are stunted.  Would not the sensible thing be to introduce a breed whose environmental background would make it suitable for the dairy farm on the hills?  Why should not our Department concentrate on the development of the Kerry, and even of the Ayrshire, in those areas?  The man on the hillside wants something like that.  Regarding their progeny, I have seen calves that came from the hills as yearlings and I would be sorry for the beef man who took them over.  There was evidence again of underdevelopment. There was obvious evidence that those animals suffered from the mineral deficiencies which are known to exist on our hillsides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated yesterday evening that we had engaged in a very slow and tortuous process in developing these shorthorns.  Although it is not the announced policy of the Minister's Department, are we not retracing our footsteps?  Are we not now trying to muddle along and de-beef this shorthorn? Then I pose the question: What will happen if, at the end, we fail to bring home the beef? I have maintained that we inherited in our Department of Agriculture a bad tradition: we inherited a commonwealth outlook. One of the things that has amused me, as a new Deputy of this House and as one who has observed successive Ministers for Agriculture in action, was that, no matter how much they disagreed or scalped one another, the one thing on which they always agreed was on the particular breed of cow, <Col N="992" /> this phenomenon known as the dual-purpose cow.  I am extremely suspicious, and I have accused heads of our Departments of indoctrinating their subordinates and passing down this wretched virus which has afflicted our Department of Agriculture.  I will go further.  I have even, in another place, said that Ministers entering Merrion Street are subjected to conditioning.</P>
      <P>It is very obvious that one of the things that the Minister will find in his room at Merrion Street when he goes there is a record&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture has already found it. There is a record there, and every now and then he is given a new rôle&mdash;what the Americans call &ldquo;disc jockey&rdquo;. Each successive Minister for Agriculture&mdash;one after another&mdash;had his turn at the turntable and each one put on the record and it played this: &ldquo;The dual-purpose cow is the best in the world.&rdquo;  On the other side, some time when he inadvertently turned up the wrong side, there was a recording of the Minister's own voice&mdash;the voice of successive Ministers for Agriculture&mdash; saying: &ldquo;We can never again compete in the competitive markets of the world for dairy produce&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Very early on, our Department of Agriculture fell out of the race.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>That, again, is part of the record.  We missed the race away back when we had an opportunity of holding that proud place which we once held as the first exporters in Europe of dairy produce.  We turned in another direction.</P>
      <P>The Minister is now in a very unenviable position.  One of the things which I think any Minister presiding in Merrion Street would live in fear and terror of is a surplus of any dairy product. It would, I would say, become radioactive in his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You are telling me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>You know, as well as I do, that down through the years, dairying has been carried on.  It is a tradition. If you look at the records you will find that our dairy cow population has moved up and down only slightly, that it has remained static at between 1,250,000 and 1,500,000.  If there is evidence that there are forces abroad which will contribute to an increase in our milk yields, I say the bigger proportion of that increase will come not from bulls but from an improved grass technique which I hope to deal with later on.  The Minister may find himself from that improved technique with a surplus of dairy produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, we know that there was a time when we could have come in on a starving market during the war when our opponents' dairy economy was geared to supply the needs of one belligerent and when the other was looking for all the butter they could <Col N="994" /> buy, we were in the unfortunate position that we were not able to supply our own population.  Then&mdash;I do not intend to go into all the circumstances dealing with it&mdash;the most peculiar thing happened.  Our gallon-age began to go up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the exact date, but if the Minister will study the records he will see that we have and I believe we have a persistent and systematic increase in our milk gallon-age. I can observe that even in my own herd.  Any creamery manager will tell you that the average is going up. Manures are available and there is an improvement in grass technique.  We can expect in the future that we shall have a substantial increase from our dairy cows.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that another day may come when the Minister will not say, &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;  However, are we now in a peculiar position?  The Minister knows as well as any Deputy who has studied the matter that the Irish creameries in the British market are there to fill a <i>pro tem</i> need.  He knows as well as I do that if you fail to compete in one dairy produce you are out for the whole lot.  That is very much our position.  We are not there as competitors; we have not been there as competitors.  We have been there to supply the <i>pro tem</i> needs of the British.  When they were able to purchase Canadian cheese, we were there until then.  Then we were asked to gather up our impedimenta and clear out&mdash;and we are almost out for cheese.</P>
      <P>The same thing goes for condensed milk.  We are on the way out for that. Again, in the powdered milk business, I believe there is a substantial reduction in the amount wanted from us. Now we seem to have put all our eggs in the one basket&mdash;into the chocolate crumb.  Last year I think there was something in the region of £18,000,000 worth of chocolate crumb exported from this country.  We got, I believe, at peak, a figure like 40,000 tons but as far as I am aware that figure is now substantially reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> They are in the peculiar position in England at the moment that they have a surplus of liquid milk over their liquid milk requirements of almost twice our total output in milk.  What will happen in the coming year nobody can foretell. I would not press the Minister to say what will happen in the coming year.  He could not reliably say in this House that we would be afforded in the British market the same quota that was given to us this year for chocolate crumb.  Let us study the figures.  I saw a figure recently where in the first three months of last year they converted something like 2.3 million gallons into chocolate crumb but in the first three months of this year they converted 8.9 million gallons into chocolate crumb.  That in itself should be a pointer to the direction in which we are going.</P>

I think that the time is too short to have that happen to a sufficient degree to save us here.  I fear&mdash;I regret very much to say so&mdash;that we will be again on the scurry.  We will again be scurrying next year for this particular milk product.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The best land in the country is growing physically as little as it is possible for it to grow under an Irish sky.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Every day of the week we see advertisements in the various newspapers exhorting the farmers to use more phosphates and use more ground limestone.  The most peculiar thing is that we never see an advertisement saying you will not get an economic return from the use of phosphate or the use of ground limestone when you spread it over couch, bent, Yorkshire fog, gabhal luachair and aiteann Gaedhealach and any of the other wretched grasses you see all over the country.  Side by side with that propaganda of spreading more phosphate and more ground limestone and having the land tested, why do we not have some propaganda advertisement pointing out to our farmers how futile it is for them to expect a profitable return from the use of either ground limestone or phosphates on those wretched grasses?</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware, as a man who travels from the West to Dublin, from looking at our fields, that one could not see a profit accruing from the spreading of manures or ground limestone on some of the land. I know myself&mdash;it is a common practice in answer to these propaganda advertisements&mdash;that we have farmers, smallholders of 50 acres and under, who say they will lime half their farms this year and lime the other half next year.  That is all the result of being misguided by the propaganda advertisements of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware, and the House is aware, that if you adopt that peculiar system and if you till a quota proportionate to the size of your farm, well, on a small farm you pass from one field to another quickly, and if you do any reasonable amount of tillage you turn the lime down altogether. Would it not be logical and sensible for the Department of Agriculture to advise the farmers to till in order to replace worn-out pastures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Oftentimes, when a speaker attempts a comparison between Ireland and New Zealand, people will throw up their hands and say: &ldquo;Oh, they have a better climate.&rdquo;  It is admitted that they have a more uniform climate but I have asserted over and over again that potentially we have one of the finest climates in the world for the production of grass&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as part of a sensible rotation in which you would have a rotation of roots and cereals.  In his book Holmes said of the soil of New Zealand:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The soils for the most part are poor, light sands or gravels or stiff clay, deficient in lime and phosphate. Their fertile seeming surface is due to hard soil and scientific treatment by which the farmers have sought to improve them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That gives a fair comparison of the soil on which the New Zealander has made such remarkable progress.</P>
      <P>We have done very little here on this question of grass, and anything that has been done has been done by an outside body, the Grasslands Society. We have not made a study of this very important factor, the production of cheap and plentiful grass which is a very big factor in reducing our production costs.  We have lagged behind, and until we address ourselves to this basic problem we will feel the weather in competition as regards any product produced from grass.  I have said over and over again that except for the introduction of the machine we have made very little progress.  There has been no revolution in Irish agricultural technique in the last 50 years, and we have made no progress comparable to our opposite numbers elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is always concentration on where the dairyman fails, but why not concentrate on where the beef producer has failed?  He seems to have escaped the whole time.  He seems to have been very much riding at ease <Col N="999" /> down through the years on the back of the unfortunate dairyman, who has been his pack mule.  Our whole dairying economy has been geared in favour of the beef producer.  It is all very well to quote a figure for the price of store cattle but take it over a previous period, over a number of years, and find exactly what the position of the dairyman as a producer of cheap stores for the beef trade has been.  Somebody has computed a figure&mdash;there might be a more recent one&mdash;in relation to the return for a unit of food that is fed to a dairy cow to a unit of food fed to a beef animal. It has been: beef, 1.2d.; milk, 2d.  That is a factor, and there is one thing that I want to say now before I forget it&mdash;we have been accused in the dairying area of incompetence, but surely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say the Minister. There is no need for the Minister to challenge me.  I have not accused the Minister of it; but various vested interests have accused the dairying industry of being incompetent&mdash;vested interests in beef.  There is far more incompetence in this country in the production of beef.  The Minister is aware that on the average it takes us in this country 12 months longer to produce mature beef than it does those people who produce beef as it should be produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a statement which I am prepared to stand over, and if the Minister would get officers of his Department to examine what the average age of the mature animal exported is here I am afraid he would alter his opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say, again, that there is no logical reason why our function should be to produce a by-product in our dairying industry in the supply of a store to the beef animal.  Why should not something be done?  Why does not the beef man try to produce?  We are all aware that the grass lands and the grazing <Col N="1000" /> lands have for the past few years been completely understocked.  Do we not know that the beef barons of two or three years ago are now slowly but surely becoming the wheat and beet barons of last year and this year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They are becoming the wheat barons now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I was thoroughly amazed at some of the grazing lands that I saw ploughed up under wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>That is sensible and logical.  Any sane person&mdash;and the Minister did not always hold that view &mdash;would know that a logical rotation in a grazing area should be grain and grass.  Those people should try to fill the gap.  I have said earlier that our cow population has remained static, and we can only increase the number of our store cattle by reducing the mortality rate in calves, but there is still a big gap to be filled to supply the grazing counties with an adequate number of stores if we are to develop a sound and solid beef export trade.  I say that it is very much their job to get both, and to produce the pure beef calf suckling the beef cow, and then the whole dispute of beef versus milk resolves itself into this, that this dispute will not come to be settled in the dairying counties of the South but the ultimate solution will be found as a result of that in the beef counties of the flat lands and midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be logical for me, having spoken so long about cows, not to say something about the scheme which is to be introduced for the tuberculin testing of cows.  I hope that it will make rapid success.  It is imperative for us to proceed as fast in this matter as we possibly can.  Again I say that the lash has been held over us.  Possibly we would not have moved even now were it not for the fact that in Great Britain, where around 40 per cent. of their cattle are now T.B. tested, there has been erected against us a <i>cordon sanitaire,</i> an area into which no Irish store may enter.  As they increase this <i>cordon</i> the area, for the Irish store will be reduced <i>pro rata</i>; and it is imperative that the <Col N="1001" /> Minister and the section of his Department dealing with it in co-operation with every section of the community should proceed with all speed in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in the area scheduled by the Department.</P>
    <P>I want to say this much.  There is something missing.  There is a prerequisite, preparatory work that should be done which has been missing because I think very much&mdash;no, I am accusing nobody; the Minister's accusing finger is in the wrong direction&mdash; I think that a prerequisite to the bovine tuberculin testing of cattle is first of all a decent cowshed on every farm.  It is no use removing one set of infected animals and replacing them with tuberculin tested cattle, if they are to be sent back again into the miserable shacks from which the reactors were removed to be reinfected. There is one point in that connection which I want to stress.  It is that there is something illogical about the whole thing.  Again, we have started at the wrong end, because I maintain that we have in our dairy herds all over the country thousands of cows which, on the law of economics, should long ago have been eliminated.  Now we are starting to eliminate these animals, not because they are pensioners, but because they might react in a tuberculin test.</P>
    <P>Another point which I want to bring to the notice of the Minister is the grant system operated in respect of farm buildings.  The Minister is aware that a condition attaching to qualification for a grant for any house, cowbyre included, is that a considerable capital outlay on the erection of the house must be undertaken by the person about to qualify for the grant.  The Minister must also remember that most of our dairy men are small holders and the people who have mainly availed of the grants are people with strong bank accounts.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will make a tour of the dairy areas of the South, he will discover that all these small people still have the same shacks, and I suggest that that scheme be revised, particularly the scheme in relation to cow-byres and that the Minister should make sure that, on a valuation basis, the small man will get preferential <Col N="1002" /> treatment over the man with the higher valuation.  That is only logical and a reasonable prequisite, if we want to get rid of the wretched shacks in which many of our cows all over the country are housed.  I have put a view to the House in relation to cattle.  It may not be the Fianna Fáil view, but it is my view, the view possibly of a minority, but expressed by a good many people, a number which I believe is growing year by year.</P>
    <P>We come now to pigs and again we are very much in the position of the Pied Piper of Hamelin in this regard. If the Minister will go into any pig fair and walk from one crib to another, all he need to do to give a description of what he sees is to change the word rat in the Pied Piper of Hamelin.  They are all there&mdash;the small ones and the tawny ones.  There was no uniformity, in spite of what the Minister may say about the Large York.  Very little has been done by the Department of Agriculture in relation to the pigs in comparison with what has been done by our competitors elsewhere.  I know one thing that has been done&mdash;there has been race segregation in relation to pigs.  A colour bar was enforced when it came to dealing with pigs, but the Minister and the House are aware that, in respect of a particular commodity which might have been acceptable yesterday, there is a complete change to-day.  We live in a world of change and that applies to taste in food, and to-day one thing we do know is that no one now wants excessive fat. We seem to suffer from acidosis, dyspepsia and all the other peculiar stomach ailments attaching to excessive fat.  I cannot look at the thing myself and generally nobody wants excessive fat, so that the farmer must gear his unit of production just the same as the manufacturer to satisfy the needs of his customers.</P>
    <P>I say that we have not done that in our pig production.  When the British housewife years ago said that she did not want our fat bacon, our attitude here was very much the attitude: &ldquo;If you do not take it, you can keep on slimming.&rdquo;  We did nothing about it, but we know that as far back as 1906 the Danes started to improve their <Col N="1003" /> production in an effort to satisfy their main customer, the British housewife, and we know what happened.  It is a slow process, involving scientific application and study of genetics, to alter the conformation of any animal, and so the Danes started their pig-testing stations.  We are only starting now, while the Danes started theirs away back in 1906, and it is on record that, between the years 1926 and 1936, they were able to increase the average length of sides of bacon to the bacon factories by approximately two inches. If I were to put down a question asking the Minister what was the average length of an Irish side of bacon, he would have considerable difficulty in providing me with the answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>We could, I suggest to the Minister, as a person interested in pigs, reduce our fat by a simple method.  It would be what one might call an emergency provision.  Age is a big factor in the production of fat and pigs.  Like politicians, they seem to put on a disproportionate amount of fat as they grow older, but we could effect a considerable improvement, it is my belief, if we were to encourage the marketing of our pigs at a younger age, when the animals have far less proportion of fat than the older animals.  We know that the average age of a Danish pig going into the factory is something like 180 days.  I have no figures but, from observation, I think the average age of Irish pigs going to the market would be much higher than that.  Perhaps I am wrong in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You are wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could be shown to be wrong if the figure is available, but if we concentrated on <Col N="1004" /> trying to get our pigs marketed at a younger age, we would considerably reduce the fat content, but then something would happen, because to get the same gross tonnage of bacon produced, we would have to increase breeding&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and increased breeding would mean that we would considerably increase the production cost.  It is logical that, if you have to produce a greater number of finished pigs to get that same gross weight, there will be an increase in cost.  I will pass on from pigs, and I am not going to say much about the old hen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I will talk about it in a minute.  I am one of those people who have always believed that there were very few old hens that did not die in debt.  The average farmer's wife always talked about the profit from poultry when she could get the bucket and go to the oats loft, but when it came to feeding the fowl out of the miller's bag it was different.  The Minister may still say he has a problem, but he stalked the country with that old hen which he used to say was worth more than a Fianna Fáil calf.  I heard him at every fair in the country, but I am afraid now that for future election campaigns the political hen has died of political cocksadosis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody in this country must live on a profit and as the main sources of national wealth of which we are possessed are those that come from the production of beef and livestock and from the production of cereals, it is a matter of prime importance that we decrease as far as we can the production costs in these industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to cereals, I am not satisfied that for some years past the costs of production have been lowered to the level to which it should be possible to lower them.  In particular, I refer to <Col N="1005" /> the production of wheat.  The all important factor in the production of wheat is the supply of fertilisers at a cheap price.  It is interesting to see that in 1947 before the advent of the inter-Party Government, the average yield of wheat per statute acre was 10.8 cwts.  and that after three years in which Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, advocated the use of fertilisers to a great degree by advertisement and by his utterances, the average amount of wheat produced per statute acre in 1953 was 23.2 cwts.</P>
    <P>The relevant figures with regard to the importation of fertilisers are that in 1947 £1,000,000 worth of fertilisers was imported, and that in 1951 £3,700,000 worth was imported.  In 1952, the figure was reduced to £2,900,000 and no figures are available for 1953.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the price of fertilisers, there are in the world to-day two main sources of fertilisers; one is the European and North African source and the other is the American source.  The European and North African source is completely controlled by an international cartel. If we make the price of wheat in this country £10 a barrel, that international cartel can decide that the Irish farmer is capable of paying maybe twice or three times his present price for the fertilisers they supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They can thus dole out to our fertiliser factories the raw materials of this <Col N="1006" /> industry at a price which will enable them to provide fertilisers at this rate and not a penny lower.  It is most important that the Minister should investigate all sources of supply for the fertiliser industry.  It is to his credit that when in power shortly before the inter-Party Government left office, he imported a very large amount of American fertilisers although heavily criticised for so doing.  He placed this lot of fertilisers at the disposal of the Irish farmer in any part of the country that required it at £9 10s. per ton.  I can personally say that five weeks later North African phosphate bought from the other source at £9 10s. was bought by him at £5 15s.  Therefore, in my view the Minister saved the Irish farmer a colossal sum in fertilisers by breaking the ring that then existed.</P>
    <P>It is, I fear, to the discredit of the following Minister that when he was left to dispose of these fertilisers he did not dispose of them as they could have been disposed of at £9 10s., but&mdash; and I quote the figure given to me by the Department of Agriculture this morning&mdash;at £17 a ton.  The reason given was that the price charged was the one prevailing in the country at the time.  The price should not have been the one prevailing in the country at the time because the following Minister should have made the effort the present Minister made then to decrease the price of fertilisers to the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>I pass now to the position in relation to the production of beef, bacon and poultry products.  The principal materials of these industries are obviously compound feeding stuffs and feeding stuffs of themselves.  A price of £4 was given to the Irish farmer last year for wheat and he profited by it but it is a matter of very great question whether, in fact, the farmer received the whole £4.</P>
    <P>My reason for so saying is that for nine months of the year the Irish millers were instructed by Government Order to provide brans and pollards, the offals of this wheat, at from £6 to £10 more than was being paid by our competitors for the British market. The position, therefore, was that the Irish housewife who went for the bag <Col N="1007" /> of bran, the bag of pollard, the bag of mash or the bag of meal, paid 6/- to 10/- per cwt. more for it.  Is it not a fact that the subsidy paid by the Government to the millers to compensate them for the loss on Irish wheat is assessed from their losses on this wheat and that if the Government instruct the miller to charge more for the offals the loss is less?  It is quite clear that if the farmer received £4 a barrel for his wheat, his wife paid back 5/- to 6/- on every bag of feeding for her fowl and pigs. I would ask the Minister to see that production from the raw materials for the feeding industry is not hampered and remind him that no Government has a moral right to take from one class of the community or from one productive group a right which is theirs and give it to another for political purposes.  With regard to that I would like to quote what Deputy Corry said yesterday evening from the Fianna Fáil Benches.  I took a note of it at the time.  He stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The farmers have already contributed to the reduction of the poor man's pint by some £2,000,000.  The breweries had authority to increase the price of the pint and when barley went up to 84/- a barrel the price of the pint was increased by a penny.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Chair then indicated to Deputy Corry that he could not discuss the price of barley on the particular amendment before the House and Deputy Corry, in reply, stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am showing how this price will not be the burden on the community that people think.  Due to the reduction of the price of barley from 84/- to 63/6, there is a big gap which should definitely cancel the ld. on the pint.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The main customer here for malting barley is known to everyone.  The fact of the matter is that that customer is not a free agent in relation to the price they can pay the Irish farmer. Last year, 170,000 standard barrels were produced; of that, 100,000 barrels were sold on the export market and 70,000 barrels on the home market. <Col N="1008" /> That firm is not the boss in the export market, but it has succeeded in capturing for the Irish farmer exactly 8 per cent.  of the export market.  When that firm exports a barrel of beer to Bristol, Manchester or anywhere else in the world, it is obviously in competition with its competitors, competitors mainly from Britain, but also from Denmark.  The raw materials for this industry must, therefore, be provided if the industry is to flourish and continue giving the Irish farmer the wonderful opportunity it has given him in the past of disposing of his malting barley at a price well above that of feeding barley.  That firm must be placed in a position, therefore, in which it can successfully compete.</P>
    <P>If the price of barley is increased beyond that which is paid by that firm's competitors, then the firm cannot compete and two things will occur. Firstly, the quality of the brew will deteriorate and, as a result of that, we will lose some of that important 8 per cent., which represents 65 per cent. of the trade in malting barley in so far as the Irish farmer is concerned; secondly, the firm will not be able to put back the moneys necessary to enable it to remain in the front line and compete with its competitors.</P>
    <P>It is an easy matter to give an example to illustrate the position. During the last five years, on the Vote for Agriculture, a figure of £5,000,000 has been quoted as representing the profits of that firm.  Now, those are trading profits.  When allowance has been made for putting the necessary capital back into the industry, the net profit is approximately £1,000,000.  It is easy to understand how this £5,000,000 decreases to £1,000,000 when one remembers that in one particular instance the construction of a plant to supply electricity and steam to clean certain parts of the brewery cost £1,000,000, and that £1,000,000 has to be repaid over 20 years.  That is one small item, and we are left with only £4,000,000 to use per year.</P>
    <P>The Irish farmer must place that firm in a position in which it can compete in order to enable it to give the Irish farmer the maximum amount of support.  It does not follow that that firm is looking for something for nothing. <Col N="1009" /> As proof of that, let me quote the year to which Deputy Corry referred when barley was 84/3 per barrel.  When Messrs. Guinness, having learned from their auditors that they had paid in Britain over 80/- per barrel for barley, implemented their promise to pay 2/6 more per barrel to the Irish farmer I, as their agent, paid out many thousands of pounds one morning to Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>Their attitude, aided by the Minister, is one of fair play and it is an attitude with which there should be no interference. Deputy Corry should remember that the firm is willing to pay the highest price it is able to pay.  Messrs. Guinness have always paid at least 15/- more per barrel for malting barley than the Irish farmer receives for feeding barley.  Deputy Corry can safely leave these matters in the hands of the Minister and the principals in that industry.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that the raw materials in so far as the production of cereals is concerned are provided at a price which is not one penny more than the price being paid by any other firm in any other country with which we find ourselves in competition.  If that position is maintained the British market will remain open to us.</P>
    <P>In relation to wheat, provided we get our fertilisers at the lowest possible rate we will produce our wheat at the lowest possible cost of production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most important Estimate that comes up for consideration here because it deals with our basic industry.  First of all, I would like to compliment the Minister on the very exhaustive and comprehensive survey of the Department's activities with which he provided Deputies yesterday and on the amazing statistical information it contains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's statement that live-stock prices would be stabilised for the coming two years is welcome news for every producer up and down the country.  We are all aware that live stock is the foundation of our whole economy; it is the section that has always maintained our people in some degree of affluence.  We are glad to <Col N="1010" /> know that live-stock prices are still buoyant.  Deputy Walsh stated yesterday that our live-stock trade brought in £20,000,000 more in 1953.  Of course, the stage for that increase was set through the medium of the trade agreement of 1948.  That provided the Irish farmer with the incentive to rear every call he could.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a statement on the introduction of measures to eradicate parasitic diseases.  He stated there was a guaranteed future for the pig industry.  We are all aware that the position of the pig industry is fluid at the moment, and it is reassuring and comforting to be told that the future of the industry is hopeful.  We trust that when the emergency of the last few weeks passes the industry will regain its former proportions.  Our pig producers will find consolation in the Minister's statement yesterday.</P>
    <P>Rabbit pest is a matter of grave concern in many districts and I would appeal to the Minister to use every means at his disposal in an effort to eradicate that pest.  I am not advocating the introduction of the new virus. I think it is too soon yet because we are not in a position to gauge its consequences. We are told in to-day's newspapers that 16 counties in Great Britain have got rid of the rabbit pest, but that should not entice us to introduce the virus here.  I would appeal to the Minister to use other alternative means for the present and to examine the possibility of having the export market opened for rabbits during the summer months as well as the possibility that has been put to me by certain firms of having the rabbits exported in carcase form hygienically sealed.</P>
    <P>The scheme for the eradication of bovine T.B. is inevitable.  I am afraid it is going to be a costly and difficult scheme, but I believe that, with the co-operation which the Minister has asked for, it will be effective.  It is very important for us since we must compete with the farmers in Great Britain, and if certain elements of our live-stock industry are going to be excluded from Great Britain it is imperative that we should act immediately. <Col N="1011" /> I believe it is going to be a costly scheme, and hence I would appeal to the Minister to try and keep the cost within bounds, because national expenditure has soared to such an enormous degree that our production cannot stand any further burdens, and neither will our potential production bear any further burdens.</P>
    <P>The matter of credits was raised here yesterday, in good faith, by Deputy Walsh.  The fact that he made certain credits available reflects all the greater credit on himself, but one cannot talk of credit so long as one has to pay from 5 per cent. to 6 per cent. on the money loaned.  Our agriculture is our sole economy and the land is our sole source of wealth.  I believe that if we could have made available in the Department of Agriculture £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 to be loaned out, free of interest, to our farmers, or, if there was an interest charge to be made, that it would be just sufficient to cover the cost of administration, these moneys loaned in that way would give our farmers a new incentive.  They would result, I believe, in an increase in production and would obviate the need for the present grants and loans which are being operated by the Department at the present time.</P>
    <P>We know ourselves that what was wrong for generations with the Irish farmers was that they had not the capital necessary to develop their resources in the way as they would think fit.  They had not the capital to improve their live stock, to apply fertilisers to their lands or to erect premises to house the cattle and other animals which they produced on their farms.  If they had the comforting consolation of knowing that they would now be able to get, through the Department of Agriculture, loans at a very low rate of interest they would redouble their efforts, always realising that if they met with one bad year they would have the Department to fall back on to tide them over the period until conditions improved for them.</P>
    <P>I humbly submit that as a practical <Col N="1012" /> scheme.  I do not see any reason why it could not be operated in this agricultural country where we pay such great lip service to agriculture.  I believe that if put into operation it would be the means of bringing great comfort to thousands of our farmers and would certainly be effective as a method of increasing employment.  It would also give our farmers an opportunity of getting maximum output from the land at their disposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the last speaker in appealing to the Minister to take active steps in the matter of dealing with the rabbit pest. I had a question down to the Minister on this matter last week.  I asked him if he was aware of the serious depredations which were being carried out by rabbits on our crops and grass, and if he would take steps to remedy the situation.  I must say that I was very disappointed with the reply which I received from him because he has always struck me, at any rate, as being a man who could make a constructive approach to any problem, and, if not a constructive one, a destructive one.  In this particular matter his destructive qualities could be very useful indeed. He mentioned that, by exhortation and so on, possibly the rabbits might disappear.  I pointed out to him that, as far as the farmers are concerned, it was not practical for the Minister himself to suggest that they should combine together for the purpose of exterminating the pest in a locality. We all know that one of the hardest things in this country is to get co-operation between any group.  Many of us have had the experience, in connection with roads, drainage and other things of trying for perhaps two or three years to get agreement amongst a group of farmers&mdash;to sign perhaps for a rural improvements scheme under which they would have to help by making a contribution.</P>

    <P>I suggest that the same thing applies when you are dealing with the rabbit pest.  There is no good in the Minister saying that there is advice available in his Department.  If he has advice to offer in this regard, I think that use should be made of the daily newspapers and of the local weekly newspapers <Col N="1013" /> in the different counties.  The suggestions which he has to make for meeting this rabbit pest problem should be made in the local papers in the form of advertisements.  From time to time we see very excellent information given by his Department in these local papers.  Therefore, I suggest that he should utilise them as a means of outlining his views for getting rid of the rabbits.</P>
    <P>The only other point that I want to mention is one that was dealt with very capably indeed by the last speaker, that is, the question of credit to farmers.  I have heard the Minister himself in this House, both as a former Minister for Agriculture and also in his capacity as a prominent member of the Opposition, speak on numerous occasions about the need for a reduction in the cost of money.  Now, if ever there was a Department where money is needed at a lower rate of interest it is the Department of Agriculture. The Agricultural Credit Corporation, I know, lend money to farmers at the present time at about 6 per cent.  In giving that figure, I may be ½ per cent. out one way or the other.  Even at that rate of interest, it is very difficult for farmers, in the West of Ireland at any rate, to get a loan.</P>
    <P>It would be very interesting, I think, if we had some information as to the number of applications made to the Agricultural Credit Corporation in a year for loans as well as the number of refusals.  I do not know what system the corporation adopts for the purpose of investigating the stability or otherwise of the applicants, but they seem to have their own secret agents for checking up on the reliability of many of these applicant farmers.  I can tell the Minister that the information which the corporation obtains in that way is very often incorrect. Of course, I understand that the Minister has no statutory power to interfere with the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  They have the last word themselves as to who should get a loan, and that even if the Minister were to make a recommendation it is quite possible the corporation may deem it unwise to agree with his <Col N="1014" /> recommendation.  The Minister is now in a position&mdash;I hope that the Ceann Comhairle will not pull me up on this &mdash;to change the law, and all that I ask of him is that he should put into effect, at some date in the near future, the very good suggestions which he has put forward from time to time in this House in connection with the issue of credit and the loan of money to trustworthy farmers at a reasonable rate of interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputies Manley and McQuillan and other Deputies who referred to it that the provision of credit for farmers is an eminently desirable thing and we are all at one in desiring that it be readily available at rates of interest that will make the loan economic for the man who borrows.  Is there any Deputy in this House who can propose to me a reasonable method of securing such loans?  If there is, he will be many thousand times welcome in my office and I promise to use all the influence I have with the Government to get such a proposal put into operation.</P>
      <P>In countries outside Ireland a mortgage on land is deemed to be the best of all securities.  It is no security in Ireland, and God forbid it ever should be.  We fought the land war in this country to banish the sheriff's bailiff and we determined&mdash;or our fathers and grandfathers did&mdash;that we did not think it was a good thing that people's homesteads should be taken from them by those who lent money on the security thereof.  I think we were right, and I do not want to revive in our system the proposition that neighbours should stand idly by while men and their wives and families are put out upon the roadside because they are unable to meet the interest charged on a loan that someone has made to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may shock orthodox economists. If it does, then so far as I am concerned they must get over the shock. That is what I believe.  The next line of defence is to invite a couple of neighbours to join with the farmer in guaranteeing the prompt repayment of the loan.  We all know by our own experience among our neighbours that <Col N="1015" /> that is a request that a decent man in the country is slow to make on his neighbours and we all know by our own experience that if he does muster up courage enough to make that request there are many men who are slow to accede to such a request.  And I am amongst them.</P>
    <P>If a man asks me to back a bill for him my answer is that if I have the money I will give it to the man, but I will not back his bill.  If a man wants me to back a bill for £100 I will give it to him, if I have the money, but if I have not got the money, I will not back the bill because for all I know, if and when that bill becomes due and I am called on to meet it, I may not have £100 then.  But if I have the money then and if I am honest in my intention of backing the bill the proper thing for me to do is to lend the money myself.  When I have the money I am entitled to lend it.  No sensible man backs his neighbour's bill lest the day might dawn when the bill would become due and he would not have the means of honouring his signature.</P>
    <P>Does that exhaust the possibilities? I think it does not.  I have thrown out the suggestion before and I will throw it out now.  There are two means whereby this problem might be overcome. One is the operation of loan societies among large groups of farmers in the country.  There are ample facilities in the Department of Agriculture to help the farmers of a parish&mdash;or of three parishes&mdash;to form a co-operative loan society.  Where it is a question of a small temporary advance to a neighbour the application can be considered by a committee of the society who know all the local circumstances and who can tell whether the loan is a reasonable risk or not; and if it is a reasonable risk, and the sum modest, the resources of the loan society will not be unduly strained by making the advance, and there is a reasonably strong local feeling that if the neighbours put up the money that it should be duly paid if the man who gets the loan is in a position to pay it.</P>
    <P>But that is not all.  If that will not work can we not arrange that where a <Col N="1016" /> farmer needs a loan of money his co-operative society will help him to get credit?  I threw out those two suggestions. Maybe they will not serve the purpose.  Will anyone come to me with any proposition that will provide reasonable security for small farmers other than the mortgaging of land which I do not think is good security because I do not think the neighbours would ever allow anyone to enforce it?</P>

      <P>I have dealt with that before the Deputy came into the House and the difficulty is that no decent man will ask his neighbours to go surety, and if he does ask, a great many men will not go sureties for the reason I have explained&mdash;that if a man comes to me to back a bill I always refuse, but if I have the money and can spare it I will lend it to him.  I will not sign a bill which I may not have the money to meet when it becomes due if I am called on.  And I doubt if Deputy Walsh would back a bill for anybody&mdash;rightly apprehensive that if the bill became due at a later date he would not have the wherewithal to meet the bill, whereas if he had it, he might lend or even give the money if he thought it was a very deserving case.

      <P>Reference has been made by more Deputies than one to the rabbit pest.  I can assure them that the problem is constantly present in my mind and I do not want to minimise it in the least degree but I think I am right in saying that this is a cyclical problem and that there is a tendency for the rabbit population to rise steeply and then to go down rapidly and rise steeply again at a later date, due to a process of natural selection.  In fact, I understand what happens is that when the rabbit population rises to a certain level, disease thins them out and the population sinks.  When it sinks to a minimum level the high incidence of disease dwindles and the population rapidly rises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not as pessimistic as the Deputy.  I believe rabbits have been gambolling in this country for the last 20 centuries and we are all here still.  That does not mean that rabbits cannot be an extremely exasperating pest to a farmer whose crops, sown and growing, are being devastated by a local plague of rabbits.  It does not mean that we should be indifferent, in my opinion, to the quantity of valuable herbage that is consumed or the indeterminable area that is perennially contaminated by rabbits.  All that is present to my mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What then must we do?  The first thing no doubt that occurs to the minds of some Deputies is: &ldquo;Why not introduce myxomatosis, and suffer a plague of myxomatosis, to destroy the rabbit population?&rdquo;  My answer to that is that every veterinary authority in the world will tell you that fortuitously and gratuitously to introduce a new animal disease into an island country, which is free from it, is to take a risk out of all proportion to the benefits that one can reasonably hope to derive from such a procedure.  We have no <Col N="1018" /> reason to think that myxomatosis would eliminate rabbits.</P>
    <P>We do know it would reduce the number but we have a virtual certainty, from experience gained in Australia and on the Continent of Europe, that there would emerge a small immune surviving population of rabbits which might then multiply again and, while we might be no worse off at the end of the cycle, we would be no better off and in the course of the cycle there might appear a disease in some other variety of animals which veterinary science might not promptly associate with the myxomatosis in rabbits because it might have an entirely different symptomatology in another genus of animal.</P>
    <P>Let us remember the case of the fowl pest commonly known as Newcastle Disease.  In turkeys, Newcastle Disease or fowl pest is practically symptomless.  Its presence can only be detected by a skilled veterinarian who observes the slow tremor in the turkey's head, its failure to put on weight and by applying the blood test which is the only diagnostic procedure for detecting the disease.  But introduce turkeys suffering from that practically symptomless condition into domestic fowl and they will die in thousands.  It will wipe them out as quickly as you bring them into contact with the diseased turkey.  Here you have a disease which is practically symptomless in turkeys but which is absolutely devastating amongst domestic fowl.  When the disease of myxomatosis first became popularly known, it was stated authoritatively that hares were immune to myxomatosis. It was alleged that exhaustive experience had shown that they were immune to the disease but it has become abundantly clear in the last 12 months that they are not immune, because hares suffering from the disease have been found&mdash;a position which up to 12 months would not have been regarded as possible.</P>
    <P>I am not going to be responsible for bringing the disease into this country for the purpose of eliminating rabbits and run the risk of coming to this House in three or fours years' time to have to inform Deputies that I found <Col N="1019" /> in dogs, cattles, sheep or pigs a devastating disease, of the existence of which I did not know and of the existence of which nobody else knew. Therefore I, as Minister for Agriculture, dissociate myself from any proposal to introduce a disease of which we are at present free because I do not know what the result of its introduction may be.</P>
    <P>That leaves us with the rabbits. What, then, must we do?  I invite any group of Deputies in this House who have influence with their own county committees of agriculture to get the county committees of agriculture to come to me and propose to me that we delimit an experimental pilot area and attempt the extermination of rabbits in that area by a method of intensive gassing of rabbits in their warrens. We may say certainly, if we have only one restricted area, all we can prove is that we can materially reduce the rabbit population in that area and that unless we go all out from there, the rabbits will come into it again, but we could determine, if we had an experimental project in a limited area, whether the concerted effort of all could not make a real impression on the rabbit population at these periods of the year when they reach their maximum numbers.</P>
    <P>Some people will say that the method of election is to seek new markets for rabbits and to export them in as large a number as possible to these markets. If I had to choose between exporting no rabbits and having no rabbits, on the one hand, and having to have rabbits and increasing our exports, on the other hand, I would be in favour of having no rabbits and no exports. There is always the danger of our getting an increase in the population of rabbits through this traffic in the export of rabbits which would counterbalance any possible profit we might derive from them.  Deputy Moher has referred to the hen as being the bankrupt live stock of the farm.  Well, there is no doubt that the rabbit is the bankrupt live stock of the Ireland. Whatever price we get for them is never going to produce a profitable economy here at home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> However, I do not believe in sitting down and saying that we can do nothing.  Some Deputies will come to me and say: &ldquo;Well, in any case it would help in some way, though it might not help very much, if the exports of rabbits were prohibited for only a very brief period and if we were allowed to export rabbits a little earlier than we have been heretofore.&rdquo; Very well; I have given that close consideration.  Ordinarily, the export of rabbits is prohibited to the end of September.  I am prepared to take a risk on that and to permit the export of rabbits from 1st september.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may think that that may not help very much but every little helps, as the old lady said when she spat into the sea.  It is some contribution but we are not going to make any really effective constribution unless we get a concerted effort and collaboration from every county committee of agriculture or anybody else who can help to make concentrated attacks on exceptional numbers of rabbits in particular areas with the purpose in view of exterminating them, not only when they emerge but in their burrows and from every other angle whence we can launch the attack upon them.</P>
    <P>If anybody else has any better plan to propose to me I will be delighted to hear him.  That is all I know about rabbits except that they are a scourge and a persecution and are at this moment eating me out of house and home in the parish of Kilcolman in the County of Roscommon and devil a much I can do with them because the rabbits that are eating me out of house and home live in the local graveyard and I cannot go in there to gas them out.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy Manley for his gracious reference to the White Paper which the Department of Agriculture takes pleasure in circulating for the better information of Deputies every year.  I think I can claim the credit for initiating that departure.  I think I can compliment my predecessor, Deputy Walsh, in so effectively carrying it on and passing back the tradition to me.  In fact, the White Paper which it was my privilege to circulate on this occasion was prepared very largely under the direction of Deputy <Col N="1021" /> Walsh and in presenting it to the House I invited the House to accept it subject to whatever correction he thought it necessary or proper to make in it.  I gather he has perused it and found it contained no heterodox view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan says that the cost of fertilisers is too high.  The more he says that the better pleased I am.  I invite the help of his strong elbow to bring the cost of fertilisers down and the more Deputies from every side of the House, whencever they may come, will raise their voices with mine and as I have no doubt, with that of Deputy Walsh, in seeking to bring down the cost of fertilisers, I think we should find certainly amongst all those Deputies here who represent the agricultural industry, a common cause over and above the political allegiance of us all.</P>

      <P>I thought that came from the Labour Benches and my heart rose high.  Now I want to turn to Deputy Moher's speech.  First, I want to compliment him.  It was a very valuable contribution to an agricultural debate. Secondly, I want to say to him that in so far as he dealt with genetic questions, I find myself in almost entire agreement with the genetic theories that he proposed to the House for acceptance.  He will have to forgive me if I allow the degree to which I was impressed by the speech he made to persuade me to deal with that speech as though it were made by an old hand in this House.  It is the custom, as the Deputy probably knows, when a new Deputy intervenes for the first time, that the Minister concluding the debate confines himself to courteous banalities in referring to what he has said, lest he seem discourteous or unduly ready to scout the propositions put forward by an inexperienced Deputy.  I cannot look on Deputy Moher as an inexperienced Deputy. His contribution was that of a seasoned performer equal to all the emergencies of debate.  Therefore, I dare to say to Deputy Moher, when he spoke so trenchantly of the failure and shortcomings of agricultural policy in this country over the last quarter of <Col N="1022" /> a century, did he ever stop to ask himself who guided agricultural policy in this country over the last quarter of a century.</P>

      <P>I direct the Department of Agriculture.  I make policy and the policy operated by the Department of Agriculture is my policy under the direction of the Taoiseach and the Government to which I belong.  I can certify that.  Now for the rest of the 25 years, I invite Deputy Moher to imparl with Deputy Walsh, Deputy Smith and Deputy Dr. Ryan and, if they have fallen short of his ideal of what a Minister for Agriculture should be, there is plenty of room in these benches, Deputy Moher, whenever you want to sit behind a real Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moher dwelt on our failure adequately to pursue the progenytesting of cattle.  I am in entire agreement with the Deputy, and I have said again and again and again that the whole business of trying to choose good dairy bulls by breeding from a pedigree is as irrelevant as listening to <i>The Waring of the Green</i> and taking whatever bull turns up at the fifth bar of the refrain.  All I can tell the Deputy is that we have men out now looking, not at the pedigrees of the bulls, but at their progeny to try and see if we can locate amongst the leased bulls in the country or any other bulls in the country evidence that there is a uniform tendency to improve amongst their offspring over their dams, with a view to capturing these bulls which, remember, will be in their seventh, eighth or ninth year, and draw them into the artificial insemination centres so that in the remaining years of their <Col N="1023" /> lives the maximum use may be made of them to propagate their stock.</P>
    <P>Haggedoorn, the famous Dutch geneticist, says in his book that if he went to an agricultural show to pick out a good dairy shorthorn bull, the first thing he would ask for is a good thick sheet wherewith to cover the whole bull except its tail, that the one thing that did not interest him was what the bull looked like.  He liked to put the bull in a tent and then say: &ldquo;Bring out its progeny and let me judge on its performance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The trouble is that most bulls at an agricultural show are ten months old and bulls do not have any progeny at ten months old.  You have to wait until the bull is five, six, seven, eight to nine years old before you can get a comprehensive sample of its female progeny to determine whether it has the quality of increasing the milk yield of its progeny over that of the dams.  I quite agree with the Deputy that if we had busied ourselves about that task years and years ago&mdash;it is a slow, difficult, tedious task&mdash;we would have got bulls by now which were proven bulls but, <i>ad interim</i>, I and my successor did the best we could.  While we were short of proven bulls, we went into the market and bought the bulls that we thought had the greatest likelihood of developing into proven bulls.  What else could we do?  Remember, you bought Tulyar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Let you buy a bovine Tulyar now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could but who here knows what Tulyar may be going to be worth?  He may breed nothing but a cab horse.  Is not that so?  It is a risk inherent in the breeding of blood stock because, by the time it is demonstrated that he will breed champions, all the money in the world would not buy him; no money would buy him because the person who had him would not part with him. Fortunately, that is not so in regard to cattle.  If we can find, locate and determine the identity of the proven bull he will have a price and where we are operating artificial insemination centres, where we can use them on a <Col N="1024" /> scale on which the private owner could not attempt to use them, I think we can afford to pay the price and, instead of saying to the farmer who has had him for four or five years and finds him no longer amenable or getting too heavy that he ought to take him to the butcher and have him slaughtered for meat, we can go in and say to him that that bull's record, judged by its progeny, makes him worth money and, instead of taking the butcher's price, we can tell him that we are prepared to pay a breeder's price.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Moher that all the resources which the Department of Agriculture disposes will be devoted to that end and that it intends to locate these bulls and bring them into the artificial insemination centres for the user of the greater number of our farmers.</P>
      <P>I ask Deputy Moher, who manifestly has an informed and public-spirited interest in this problem, to get it out of his head that the Department of Agriculture has the slightest desire to interfere if a man wants to have Friesian or Jersey or Ayrshire or any other kind of cattle.  But Deputy Moher surely will not ask Deputy Walsh and me, when I am Minister for Agriculture, to foreswear our right to form a judgment on the same matters as Deputy Moher has formed his judgment. He is entitled to his view that the Friesian is the best breed of cattle or the Ayrshire.  Suppose Deputy Walsh is made Minister for Agriculture or I am made Minister for Agriculture, have not we the right and the duty to apply our minds to the problem just as Deputy Moher applied his and testify to the truth as we see it?</P>
      <P>Deputy Moher would appear to imagine that the Department of Agriculture is indifferent to the progeny test of bulls.  He went on to tell the story of how the Department's officials went to Reading and bought a bull called Napoleon and that his progeny proved disappointing and the bull was withdrawn.</P>

Is not that evidence to Deputy Moher that the Department applied to that bull, expensive as it was, the very test that Deputy Moher charged them with not applying?  They were not afraid, because they were backed both by Deputy Walsh and myself who said they were perfectly right, having used the best judgment they could, to pay two thousand guineas, I think it was, for the bull.  They discovered that he was not producing the kind of progeny it was hoped he would produce and, instead of showing moral cowardice and persisting in using him, he was withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moher must develop the tendency of looking for the virtue in his neighbour and not seeking for the mote in his eye.  He will remember what happened the man who always saw the mote in his neighbour's eye and overlooked the beam in his own.  The Deputy should rather see the flickering flames of virtue which fitfully gleam through the windows of the Department of Agriculture now and again.  Deputy Moher will agree with us that the Department was right about that bull in any case.  If I did not think Deputy Moher was serious in what he was saying and had given a good deal of thought to what he said, I would not bother answering him.  It is because I think what he said was worthy of discussion that I stressed this by referring to it at such length.</P>
      <P>I notice that Deputy Moher referred to my old and valued friend, David Gray, the former American Ambassador here.  It is very interesting that Deputy Moher said that everything that man said was wrong except the one thing, and that was when he said: &ldquo;Your cattle in this country are robber cows&rdquo;.  At that moment he was a Daniel called to judgment, but in everything else there was neither sense nor meaning in what he said.  Why does Deputy Moher think that everything that man said was inimical to the interests of this country?</P>

If the man was wrong about everything Deputy Moher knew about and he heard that man say one thing which suggested that everybody in Ireland except himself was wrong, why does Deputy Moher plead to that declaration and say: &ldquo;In this Mr. Gray was an enlightened sage?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I was very fond of Mr. Gray.  He was one of my best friends, but he was talking through his hat when talking about Irish live stock.  He knew as much about them as my foot.  He did not know one end of a bull from another.  He was none the worse for that.  Like many another decent man, he was asked to give an opinion about something he knew &ldquo;Sweet Fanny Adams&rdquo; about and gave it and it had neither sense nor meaning.  I do not believe the man ever saw a shorthorn cow before he came here.  The first ones he saw, I do not think he knew whether they were cows or what.  There are not any shorthorns to speak of in the United States of America.  It is the Friesian and the Hereford they have there.  I bet you that all the American advisers who came here would tell us we should have Friesians or Herefords.  If Deputy Moher goes to the Dublin Cattle Market next Wednesday and inquires what is selling best, the Aberdeen Angus-shorthorn cross or the Hereford, he will find that we know as much about Irish agriculture in the Department of Agriculture as even the American ambassador did when talking in New York.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Corry rose, I duly wrote down &ldquo;Deputy Corry&rdquo; and I am damned if I wrote down another <Col N="1027" /> word because I did not know what he was talking about.  But Deputy Walsh was good enough to intervene in the debate and he said that he deplored the fact that we were not starting in Limerick with the eradication of bovine T.B.  He had only come into the House and I had just been getting my tea in a mug from his colleague, Deputy Cunningham, for even thinking of starting in Limerick.  &ldquo;You pays your money and you takes your choice.&rdquo;  Deputy Cunningham said he was greatly distressed that I did not go further west to inaugurate the scheme.  I ask, how much further west could I go than County Sligo unless I took to the sea?  I am doing the best I can.  Clare, Sligo and part of Limerick&mdash;East Limerick to begin with and, as fast as we can get it cleared, spread on out over the county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told not.  My advice is that it is best to start in Clare and a county like Sligo and that we should tackle Limerick &ldquo;with and with&rdquo;, as we say in the West of Ireland and if unexpected success attends our initial effort we can push out into Limerick as fast as our effort prospers; but if we try to bite off Limerick, Clare and Sligo at one bite we might bite off more than we can chew.  If we find that our resources are more than equal to our initial assignment, I can assure the Deputy that there is no one more anxious than he and I are to press on in Limerick and in every other county in Ireland.  Do not let us forget that, in addition to the intensive areas of eradication which we are about to schedule for the 1st September, we are eager to get any farmer in any individual farm in any part of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, we are anxious to help in any way we can.  Now, we do not pretend before we start at all that we know all the answers.  We are going to start out with a concerted plan but we are not going to be one bit abashed or ashamed or apologetic if we find that we have to mend our hand as we go.  Our purpose is to give the best possible service to the farmers who will collaborate with us, to help them to the maximum of our capacity and to make whatever burden the revelation of disease on their particular farm threatens them with, as light as we can make it.  I have no doubt that we have the cordial goodwill of Deputies on every side of the House in doing that task.  That we may make mistakes is certain: that we should seek to correct them as quickly as possible I can guarantee to the House. More than that at this stage I cannot say.</P>
      <P>I desire to record again my intense sense of obligation and gratitude to the veterinary profession for the utterly admirable spirit of co-operation they have shown and for their anxiety to help in every way they can. The same might be said of the voluntary organisations like Muintir na Tíre and Macra na Feirme and, as I have no doubt, will be said by the Irish Countrywomen's Association, when I have an opportunity of laying the problem before them.  The more help we get the more grateful we will be. I can say quite honestly to every Deputy in the House, to whatever Party he belongs, that he can give us in his public capacity invaluable help by reassuring his constituents and anyone else with whom he has influence that it is in their own interest and in the country's interest that they should collaborate with their Department of Agriculture, and with the servants and friends of the people who will come out from that Department, in expediting the eradication of this disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Walsh, I am happy to say, has declared himself as agreeing with me in the eminent desirability of the parish plan, and he says that if it were possible to put it into operation he would have done so.  Well, I am delighted to hear that, because I hope <Col N="1029" /> to give him a very early opportunity of rejoicing with me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you.  As we go, we will make the provision that our resources will allow.  If I can only do it in one county or two counties, I will do it in one or two counties, but I want to do it in one diocese or two dioceses and I want to get it on the basis of the parish.  What I propose to do is to provide one instructor, to be the servant and friend of the farmer, in every three parishes.  If we do that in the diocese of Killaloe, in the diocese of Elphin and in part of the diocese of Cashel, I know I will have the Deputy's sympathy and understanding if we do not cover a wider area in our initial departure and his encouragement to press forward into the wider area as the personnel becomes available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This much I can say, in any case, that there is no better profession for a young man to embark on in Ireland at the present time than the service of the land.  The faculty of agriculture is yawning for under-graduates and if there are any bewildered parents in this country scratching their heads to ask themselves what profession they can find for their son, that holds out the prospect of useful public service in his own country at a remuneration which will be acceptable to a man who does not aspire to riches but rather to security and dignity of occupation, he has it on the record that Deputy Walsh was only deterred from launching the plan I am about to launch by scarcity of personnel, that both sides of the House are firmly resolved to press forward with this project but there is an acute scarcity of personnel at the present time.  Here is a chance for <Col N="1030" /> calling the emigrants home or ensuring they will never have to go.</P>

I am not blaming Deputy Walsh or the Ministers who were Ministers for Agriculture before me for the simple reason that the drugs we had used and popularised were not available.  I am not claiming that there is any special <Col N="1032" /> credit to me.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that when these drugs became known to the much-despised Department of Agriculture we got them more widely used in Ireland than was the case in any country in the world and we made a greater inroad on calf mortality in Ireland than, I think, was made in any country in the world.  Instead of taking feathers out of one another's tail, let us all stand up and give three ringing cheers for the Department of Agriculture. We are losing cattle from aphospherosis, we are told.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the correct approach.  The first thing to do is to find out what is aphospherosis. Aphospherosis is a disease which occurs in cattle who are grazing on land which has become bereft of phosphates. How long does it take ordinary land to become bereft of phosphates?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the thirties and forties of this century. Of course, we have made much progress in many fields in this century.  Perhaps it is forgotten that it was the Irish farmer who first discovered the value of the slag heaps of Britain.</P>
      <P>The British threw basic slag away because they did not know its value. We bought it&mdash;our fathers and our grandfathers&mdash;and spread it on the land of Ireland.  Then, when the Economic War made live stock uneconomic, and when you had to sell a four-year-old bull for £4 15s., our people gave up putting phosphates on the land of Ireland.  For 13 years, practically no phosphates were put on the grass land of Ireland.  Then we started putting them out again.  As the cost of fuel went up, we stopped burning lime and there was no ground limestone on the land.  Then we put on the ground limestone and released the phosphate that was in the soil.</P>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Walsh that the more phosphate we put out the better for the land of Ireland but it did not help us to get the phosphate out by agreeing to put a tariff of 20 per cent. on superphosphate.</P>

But the man who wanted to buy super to put on his own land would not be let bring it in. I returned to office to find that an ordinary farmer of this country cannot bring it in to put on his own land but that selected gentlemen in the fertiliser business can bring it in and mix it and sell it as a compound and make a fat profit.  They can make a fat profit out of mixing fertilisers in this country and they can bring it in free under licence.

I do not think that is fair.  If the mixer is not prepared to pay it, then you should not ask the ten-acre farmer in the West of Ireland to pay it.  I do not deny that that makes me angry.  I live in too close contact with the small farmers of the West of Ireland not to resent most bitterly the fact that I must levy on <Col N="1035" /> them 20 per cent. in respect of the super they buy while I know that the mixer who is charging a fancy price for compound fertilisers can bring it in free.  So long as that is true, it makes me angry and I cannot help it.  I was born and reared amongst small farmers.

      <P>Whist now, for fear we should all get vexed.  Deputy Walsh spoke of the desirability of the expansion of veterinary services and made reference to research into oedema disease in pigs.  I do not think the Deputy has any reason to apologise for our research into oedema disease in pigs.  I think we were one of the first countries in the world in that field of research and I may say that the research is going forward.  I was at a research station in Washington and I visited all the research centres of the United States.  I must say that I could not find in their research stations any more advanced work on oedema disease in pigs than we have here.  Let me tell the House a story.  When I went into the Director of the Research Laboratory in Washington I was introduced to him as the Irish Minister for Agriculture.  I told him we had come to seek his aid and assistance in the matter of research into oedema disease in pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was gracious enough to say: &ldquo;Mr. Minister, it surprises me that you should come to us for advice.  You must not forget that it was from Dublin we learned the history of the warble fly.&rdquo;  It transpired that it was in Dublin the life cycle of the warble fly was first discovered and described, and a method for its prevention determined which is being followed by every nation in the world.  We have not discoverted all that needs to be known about oedema but we have learned as much in Dublin laboratories as they have learned in any other laboratory in the world.  Let us not make extravagant claims as to what we have <Col N="1036" /> done.  When we have done good work, let us claim with all modesty that we have done as well as everybody else. In the meantime, let us go on doing our job.  If others resolve that problem before anybody else we will be glad to learn from them but if we resolve the problem before anybody else all we know will be placed freely at our neighbour's disposal for their information.  More than that we cannot say.</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Walsh really began to go to town and said he would like to see an extension of the demonstration plots and advisory schemes.  I hope to establish the parish plan which will provide demonstrations and advice not only in the use of lime and fertilisers but in every other branch of agriculture and bring to every farmer not only all the information we have on those two problems but on every other topic in regard to which the Department of Agriculture is informed.</P>

I would like to ask any rational farmer in Dáil Éireann or outside it if he bought a farm for £39,000 and had £10,000 after doing it would he spend it on building roads?  Upon my word, if I were fortunate enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If I am to be rebuked for not tearing down all the buildings in Ireland, I think discrimination ought to be used.  May be the Deputy was right.  Cross his heart and hope to die&mdash;if it was his farm and it cost £39,000, would he spend £10,000 repairing the roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That draws an answer but I do not wish to give it now.  I think the Minister spent a lot of money on other people's farms before. However, we will leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can think that one out.  The Deputy said he wanted to make £1,000,000 available for credit to farmers to buy lime and fertilisers.  My recollection is that that proposal was submitted by the Deputy, and reference was made to the announcement that had been jointly issued by himself and the ex-Taoiseach relating to the credit funds. Is not that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I turn anxiously to the relevant page and discover a cutting from the <i>Irish Press</i> which reported &ldquo;that the Minister for Agriculture and the then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, had met a standing committee of the joint stock banks yesterday and after a protracted discussion were now happy to announce that the joint stock bank would be prepared to advance money to credit-worthy farmers for the purchase of fertiliser and lime.&rdquo;  That epoch-making declaration does not <Col N="1039" /> seem to me to have got the farmers much further than they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>They were all credit-worthy at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How does that provide £1,000,000 extended credit for the farmers of Ireland?  What is a bank there for but to lend money to credit-worthy people?  Anyone who is declared by a bank to be credit-worthy manifestly does not want credit.  They would not think him credit-worthy if he did.  That, so far as I know, is the only credit scheme the Deputy contemplated&mdash; that they should apply to the bank and if credit-worthy they would get the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind Deputies that, under the land rehabilitation project, any farmer who wants to get his holding fertilised in its entirety can apply to the land project and enclose 1/- per acre and for every acre tested he will have advice from the land project as to what fertilisers are required on every acre of his land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind telling the Minister that that has been there for three years and there was a very poor response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if that is the cause?  Let us tell them now that they can have, without limit, 60 years' credit if they want it to pay for lime and fertilisers, potash, super and whatever else the land requires, not on one acre or on one quarter but on the entire area.  What better credit provisions can we make for the farmers than that they can get all the fertiliser their land requires to bring it to optimum production without the deposit of a penny piece and they can have 60 years to pay it?  Can I do better than that?  If I can, I will be very grateful for any suggestions that any Deputy cares to make to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reclamation of hill grazing. Deputy Walsh said that more work of this kind should be provided.  I think that comes unkindly from Deputy <Col N="1040" /> Walsh.  I initiated a pilot hill grazing scheme under the direction of Mr. Moses Griffiths, director of the Otto Kahn Research Station in Wales.  We took two areas west of Ardara which were reclaimed by the officers of my Department under his direction.  I think that the Deputy will agree with me, if he ever inspected them, that they were converted from heathery hillside to relatively luscious grass.  Is not that so?  The Deputy agrees with me that that is so.  Will Deputies of this House believe that I visited those two areas of converted hill grazing two months ago and discovered that it had been suffered to revert back to a rushy swamp simply because the necessary work for its maintenance had been abandoned?</P>
    <P>I do not think that that was a farsighted thing for a Minister for Agriculture to do if he intended to get up in Dáil Éireann and say that he wants more work done in the reclamation of hill grazing.  There was a further area reclaimed just over Gweebarra Bridge in Donegal, but the astonishing thing is that, while the two areas which were reclaimed west of Ardara were abandoned, a new area has been started out in Glencolumbkille.  I do not know why the two areas west of Ardara were jettisoned.  I think it was a mistake to let them go.  It may have been that if the work had been carried out to its conclusion in those areas we might have been proved to be mistaken in our hopes, but at least we ought to have tried it out to the end.  I wonder were those areas conceivably associated with the Deputy's predecessor in office and he thought it better to have them remembered as &ldquo;Dillon's rushes&rdquo; rather than as &ldquo;Dillon's fields&rdquo;?  Certainly it ill becomes the Deputy to exhort me to undertake more hill grazing experiments when I have to tell you how those that were undertaken between 1948 and 1951 fared while he was Minister for Agriculture between 1951 and 1954.  I invite any Deputy of this House driving west from Ardara to see these areas.  One adjoins the road and one is on the hillside visible from the road. Let them judge as to whether Deputy Walsh exerted himself to the limit of his capacity to maintain and develop <Col N="1041" /> ground that had been gained in those two hill grazing experiments.</P>
    <P>Certain it is that, whatever work is put in hand in Glencolumbkille, I will follow it up with all the resources of which I dispose in the Department of Agriculture, and if at any time Deputy Walsh wants to go and inspect them and advise me of any failing on our part I will deem it a very great kindness on his part if he will direct his attention to any failure on my part rigorously to follow up what he started. I shall regard it as my duty to continue and persevere in whatever scheme he initiated until we are both satisfied that the optimum result has been achieved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh says that the amount now available under the farm buildings scheme is not nearly enough. Does he forget that it is his Estimate I am producing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider it, and the more the Deputy presses for it, the better pleased I will be.</P>
      <P>Deputy Walsh suggested that the water supply scheme should be extended to cattle houses and through the farm.  With that suggestion I am in the greatest sympathy, but the Deputy will remember that, when we were engaged in the plan of bringing water to the farmers' houses, we sought to get some kind of uniformity between one farmer and another.  If you give a general promise to bring water anywhere on the farm for any farm you will be up against the dilemma that for the man with a very large farm you have to bring the water beyond his kitchen all over the farm, whereas with the fellow with a very small farm you only require to bring it out to one field.  It therefore seems more equitable to say to every farmer: &ldquo;We will bring it to your kitchen. From that point on let every man take care of himself.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider making it available in the farmyards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that at least in those areas of intensive bovine eradication we should consider whether we could not extend the supply to the farmer who is seeking to promote improvements and taking measures to improve the facilities for an attested herd, and see if we could not devise a plan that, as an added inducement, such farmers could be facilitated in bringing the water beyond the point where it is brought to their kitchen, into their byres and wherever else it might be required for the better treatment of the cattle and their future protection from disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> The Deputy and I are both of the same spirit in facilitating farmers to bring it to any point on the farm where they would wish to bring it; but you must try, in the distribution of public money, to maintain something approximating to equity between one beneficiary and another.  I would feel a certain scruple about presenting a scheme to Dáil Éireann which would allow a man of 500 acres to be paid 50 per cent. of the expense of bringing water to 40 fields while on the other hand the man with 15 acres would get 50 per cent. of the cost of bringing it to two fields.  I do feel that where we are grappling with the question of T.B. in the intensive eradication areas that is an inducement which is well worthy of consideration and I shall certainly have it closely examined.</P>
    <P>Yes, I quite agree and have already communicated with the areas engaged in onion growing in the County of Kerry, in Castlegregory and the Maharees, that if they will form a co-operative society for the handling and marketing of their onions the Department of Agriculture is not only willing but eager to help them with advice and financially, provided that the scheme that they put up on a co-operative basis has in it the prospect of producing good onions that can be sold under the label of Castlegregory onions.  I want to say this, and I am sure that Deputy Walsh will confirm it, that the quality of the onions produced in Castlegregory and the Maharees is as good as any onion in the world.  Their method of saving and marketing them is deplorable, and unless they are saved and marketed in proper condition there is no future for the onion growing industry in this country.  It would be a tragedy if that valuable crop were thrown away when all that is necessary are certain technical measures in the saving and marketing of the crop about which there is no difficulty whatever.  So far as I know, and on this I believe Deputy Walsh agrees with me, the only real prospect of getting them effectively taken is through some form of co-operative society representing the growers; and if the growers will <Col N="1044" /> constitute such a society forthwith they can look to the Department and the I.A.O.S. for generous and effective help in getting their products on the market in proper condition and the confident prospect of commanding on that market as good prices as are obtainable for any other variety of onion being sold in this country.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Walsh was talking, he said he was puzzled by the fact that there was a reference made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department and by myself to the fact that the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in Seanad Eireann had advocated a cattle tax.</P>

I am sick of Deputy Lemass trying to run that unfortunate man.  He will not run me. I heard what Deputy Walsh said here to-day and I propose to comment on it now, and, if Deputy Lemass does not like it, he can lump it.  If Deputy Walsh had said that to Deputy Lemass more often in the past three years, I would have fewer headaches than I have at present in the Department. Deputy Walsh said he was shocked that the Parliamentary Secretary or I should have alleged that the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad had advocated a tax on cattle.</P>

      <P>One of the great advantages Fianna Fáil have is that the <i>Irish Press</i> says something and everybody waits to see if it will ring a bell. If it does, they all clamber on the bandwagon.  If it does not, everybody says in the Dáil: &ldquo;Who says the <i>Irish Press</i> speaks for the Fianna Fáil Party?&rdquo;  Then, the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in Seanad Éireann is put up as a bell-wether.  He says something and everybody sits down and waits to see if it is popular.  If it is, everybody gets on the bandwagon and, if it is not, everybody says here: &ldquo;Who the hell is he in the Seanad? What does he know about Fianna Fáil policy?&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass will get up here and say: &ldquo;I think such and such ought to be done by the Department of Agriculture,&rdquo; and sit back to see if that is going to be popular.  If it is popular, everybody gets up on the bandwagon, but, if it is not, in comes Deputy Walsh to ask: &ldquo;Why does he talk for the Department of Agriculture?&rdquo; I used to hear great lectures being given about the unity of the Fianna Fáil Party and about the of the Fianna Fáil Party and about the weakness of an inter-Party Government, with its conflicting views, dissension and disagreement.  I thought Fianna Fáil were like the Rock of Gibraltar and that when one pebble spoke all the other pebbles joined in.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The present enormous price of cattle is a major factor in the high cost of living in the towns.  That is a problem which the Government is constantly faced with and has not been able to do very much about.  If the Government had put a tax of £5 or even £10 a head on every animal exported on the hoof, it would have encouraged the development of the very desirable dead meat trade that is now taking place, and at the same time, reduced the price to the native consumer...by something like £10 per head.</P>
      <P>At column 1594, Senator Quirke, who, I understand is leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the question of raising the taxes, a suggestion has been made that a tax should be put on the export of cattle.  That suggestion was made, I believe, by Senator Johnston, and I am entirely in agreement with him.  I believe that cattle being exported from this country would stand at least some tax, and that a certain amount of money could be collected in that way.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have dealt with every point raised by Deputy Walsh and I am referring now to Deputy Cunningham's contribution.  Deputy McGrath has a word to tell about the milk supply in Cork, but before I deal with that, let me turn back for a moment to Deputy Moher, who said that he deplored that the 20 years' <Col N="1049" /> policy of the Department of Agriculture had made us uncompetitive in the markets of the world for butter.  I pointed out to him that his colleagues were responsible for a long part of that period and I do not think that, in normal conditions, we are necessarily uncompetitive for butter.  He then elaborated the theme that we would be much better off if we had, instead of dual purpose shorthorn cows, Friesians, Ayrshires, Jerseys and Kerrys, and that, if we had, we would be ready to take advantage of the world market for dairy produce on a competitive basis.</P>
      <P>Did he advert to the fact that at present the United States of America have 220,000,000 lbs. of butter which they cannot sell anywhere?  He knows that butter does not keep indefinitely. You can put butter in cold store and keep it for a certain time, but, after the lapse of a certain time, butter will deteriorate in any kind of store.  The United States of America hold 220,000,000 lbs. of butter in excess of their entire domestic requirements and of any foreign market they can contact. Denmark is selling butter in Moscow. New Zealand is selling butter in Moscow or anywhere else she can get a market.  Great Britain can buy butter anywhere she likes.</P>
      <P>Would we not be a nice case to-day if we had in this country nothing but Jersey cows?  What would we do?  The fact is that while New Zealand and the United States and Denmark cannot sleep at nights trying to sell their butter, we are selling beef and live stock to a market of 50,000,000 hungry people whose buyers arrived in Dublin on yesterday morning in greater numbers than at any time since 1939. There is no one in the world who can compete with us on quality in that market and a large part of the agricultural community of Great Britain depends on us for its survival for the raw material of its own agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had taken the advice of the people who told us 20 years ago to reject the dual-purpose shorthorn cow in favour of the Jersey cow, where would we be now?  We would have butter in abundance for sale; we <Col N="1050" /> would have dried milk, cheese and chocolate crumb in abundance for sale, but we would be faced with the fact that New Zealand and Denmark were combing the world for markets in which to sell these commodities, and that the United States was sitting in its citadel of Washington with 220,000,000 lbs. of butter over and above what was required for its domestic consumption and what it would sell in any market it could find, plus approximately the same quantity of dried milk and cheese.  And when that flood was let loose would we not be sitting pretty if we had Jersey cows, the calves of which you hit upon the head and bury when they are dropped? Or are we better in having a dual-purpose shorthorn cow that is producing enough butter to feed our own people and every calf of which when it is dropped is worth anything from £7 to £15, and instead of plummeting downwards is turning upwards.  Go and ask the Danes, the Dutch, the New Zealanders which they would prefer. Go and ask the American Minister for Agriculture which would he sooner have, his 200,000,000 lbs. of butter, his 200,000,000 lbs. of cheese, his 200,000,000 lbs. of dried milk in cold storage or Ireland's dual-purpose cow?</P>
    <P>Thanks be to God for the live-stock breeding policy of the Irish Department of Agriculture.  But for it the farmers in this country to-day would be confronted with disaster of a character that no Government from whatever Party drawn could save them. The cow that put blue suits, boots and fedora hats on the farmers of this country in the course of the last 50 years is standing to us well.  I will tell the House a story.  I spoke at a meeting in Ennis in 1951 at the foot of the O'Connell Monument.  I met a venerable cleric in the town of Ennis when I went there.  He said to me: &ldquo;What are you going to say to the people to-day?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;I am going to tell them to keep a firm grip on their holdings because their holdings are worth keeping now.&rdquo;  In a flash he understood what I was referring to, and he said to me: &ldquo;I was in the square when he said it.&rdquo;  He referred, of course, to the fact that it was at the foot of the O'Connell Monument in 1881 that <Col N="1051" /> Charles Stewart Parnell told the people to keep a firm grip on their holdings.  I was speaking to this man who was standing in the square when Parnell spoke those words, and he said to me: &ldquo;Do you know what struck me that day when I saw him walking at the head of the people?  Parnell in those days was a dandified kind of man.  He dressed very well and he had beautiful side whiskers and his hair was carefully brushed.  What struck me was that the people had such love and confidence in someone whose appearance was so different from their own because,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in those days the people were terribly poor.  Half of them were in their bare feet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I went down that afternoon to speak at the meeting and I looked down on the sons and grandsons of the men whom that venerable cleric had seen 70 years ago in their bare feet in the square of Ennis, I saw that they were all dressed as well as I am; they were dressed as well as any body of young countrymen in any country in the world.  As I sat there I asked myself: How?  What changed them from barefoot, hungry peasants into the prosperous independent farmers that stand around me now, and I was proud to remember that the answer was&mdash; there were two parts to it&mdash;the Land League and the shorthorn cow.  Think on that.</P>
    <P>I apologise to the House if I have trespassed too long.  I have tried to answer every Deputy who spoke and if I have been too detailed the fault was mine.  I will conclude by referring only to what Deputy McGrath had to say.  I cannot make out what Deputy McGrath wants.  Does he want pasteurisation of the Cork milk supply or does he not want it?  I want it and I have written in that sense to the milk suppliers of the Cork urban area.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the House what the position is in Cork.  First, Deputy McGrath made some inquiry about the appointment of a veterinary surgeon and said he could not understand why that veterinary surgeon was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The answer is that the Cork County Council agreed in 1952, after being <Col N="1052" /> urged by our Department for a considerable time previously, to appoint a wholetime veterinary inspector. Specially necessary in this respect was the adequate performance of public health duties in the environs of Cork City.  The post created in 1952 was a temporary one and was filled through the Local Appointments Commissioners. The appointee was one of the wholetime veterinary inspectors employed by the Cork Corporation, and he got leave of absence from the corporation to take up the post.  When that veterinary surgeon's term of office was expiring the Department induced the county council to make the post a permanent one and the council agreed. The corporation also agreed to extend their veterinary surgeon's leave of absence for a further six months until May, 1954, to give the council a further opportunity of making a permanent appointment. At the end of February, 1954, the county council made the appropriate statutory request to the Local Appointments Commission to fill the post on a permanent basis, and this Department has cleared with the commissioners the qualifications for, and particulars of, the office in connection with the advertisement of the permanent post.  Meanwhile, the veterinary surgeon whom the Cork Corporation had loaned to the Cork County Council has had to return to his normal duties and the county council has asked for a wholetime veterinary surgeon for a short period until the permanent appointment is made.  But the county council recently told the Department that they had not got a single answer to their advertisement.  However, when the advertisement for the permanent post appears in the daily Press the applications will probably turn up and the <i>status quo ante</i>, to which Deputy McGrath referred, will be restored.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that the Cork milk supply is dirty.  Deputy McGrath may take the soothing unction to his soul that some improvement was made when veterinary surgeon was appointed, but the bulk of that improvement was the removal of visible dirt only from the Cork milk supply. Usually, and here I venture on a paradox, visible dirt is clean dirt.  It is the invisible dirt that kills.  What one can <Col N="1053" /> see in milk one can usually take out of it; it is what one cannot see that poisons those who consume it.  Surely we do not want any better proof of the quality of the Cork milk supply than the fact that we have the perennial lamentation in this House that the people cannot drink the milk because it goes sour.</P>
    <P>I have got the particulars to which I referred in the Department.  I have got there the report of the city medical officer for the year 1952.  Let any Deputy who wants to know the true facts read that report from page 74 to page 78.  There he will find material to make parents' blood run cold at the thought of their children being asked to imbibe freely of that milk.  Now all I want is for the producers of milk for liquid consumption in Cork urban area to form a co-operative society to pasteurise the milk which they intend to distribute in Cork City.  I am prepared to help them, if needs be, by erecting the plant.  They have the money to go ahead with the work. They will get every facility the Department or the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society can give them.  I am not without hope that we have at last arrived at the end of a long and tortuous road in our endeavours to get the Cork milk supply pasteurised.  I must make it clear that I cannot go ahead at my end as expeditiously as I would like unless I have the help of the Lord Mayor of Cork, Deputy McGrath, and of the chairman of the Cork County Council.  I can say, however&mdash;and it is my duty to say so&mdash; that if the Cork milk supply is not as good as the milk supply of the City of Dublin within two years from to-day the fault will lie at the door of the Corporation of Cork City and of the County Council of Cork County.</P>
    <P>I am not without hope that both these bodies will now give their co-operation in achieving the end we all want, namely, a clean and healthy milk supply for Cork City.  If they do that, we will have the supply within 12 months; and we will have nothing but pure, pasteurised milk going to the people of Cork City within two years.</P>
    <P>I suppose I ought to apologise to the House for detaining Deputies for so <Col N="1054" /> long in replying to this most useful debate on the Department of Agriculture. I do not apologise.  I think the Department of Agriculture is of supreme importance.  I think certain Deputies, notably Deputy Moher, have made contributions to the debate of material value to any Minister for Agriculture who had the pleasure of listening to them.  I heard contributions from my own side of the House full of valuable suggestions and providing me with the opportunity of asking the Department to increase its activities in certain spheres.  Deputy Donegan, Deputy Manley, and others intervened most effectively in this debate and they have helped me materially by their contributions. When these Deputies were kind enough to help me, I thought I owed them the courtesy of answering them to the best of my ability.  I have done so at some considerable length.  I think the time has been well spent.  I hope my colleagues think as much.</P>

      <P>Arising out of certain remarks made by the Minister here last week concerning the National Development Fund, and remarks made elsewhere by the Attorney-General and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, I think it would be well if the intentions of the Government in relation to this fund were clarified.  Is it proposed to operate the fund and, if so, for what purpose? There were suggestions made by Deputies sitting opposite that the fund might be wound up.  There was certainly a suggestion that it was not intended that the fund should be used for the purposes indicated in the Act under which it was established.  The fact that these suggestions were made indicates that the Government has intentions in relation to the fund contrary to those of the previous Government when the fund was established. I want, primarily, to deal with the remark that was made by the Minister on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill.  He said then&mdash;I am quoting from column 688 of the Dáil Debates of the 24th June last:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I took the precaution, however, at a very early date of ascertaining what some of the proposals were that were pending at the time that we came into Government for the purposes of allocation from this National Development Fund.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And then, as Deputies will remember, he proceeded to read out a list of various construction projects which, apparently, had been submitted, or brought forward by the Department of Justice and the Department of Education. To clarify that position, and <Col N="1056" /> to get on the record the facts, I asked the Minister a number of questions.  I think it is well and proper that I should state now what precisely the position was at the date on which the Government changed.</P>
    <P>Up to the 31st May last, projects, the total cost of which would amount to £6,500,000, had been approved of by the previous Government for financing from the National Development Fund. None of the proposals read out here by the Minister on the 24th June was included amongst those which had been approved.  I doubt if any Deputy will find fault with the list of approved projects on the ground that they involved undesirable expenditure or were in any way unconstructive.</P>
    <P>These projects included a first allocation of £1,000,000 to the Road Fund, followed by a further allocation of £1,900,000 for the present financial year to the Road Fund, including £400,000 for Gaeltacht roads.  There was also, in respect of the previous financial year, an allocation of £100,000 for the Works Act programme.  The total money allocated for expenditure through the Department of Local Government from the National Development Fund was £3,000,000.</P>
    <P>There were two allocations, one of £500,000 and one of £400,000 in respect of the financial year 1953-54 and the year 1954-55, to the Special Employment Schemes Office for the extension of the activities of that office, and for works which are classified as special employment schemes.  A sum of £250,000 was made available for schemes in the Gaeltacht.  It was generally understood that the allocation and administration of the money would be undertaken by Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng.</P>
    <P>There were allocations, amounting to £1,298,900, for schemes put forward by the Department of Industry and Commerce. These included a grant of £550,000 for improvements to Cork Harbour, a grant of £527,400 for the improvement of Dublin Harbour, £200,000 for the construction of the roads which will be necessary in connection with the four hand-turf power stations to be erected by the E.S.B., and £20,000 for <Col N="1057" /> the erection of a bridge over the road at Castlemungret, outside Limerick. There was a dispute between the county council and C.I.E. as to whether there should be a bridge over the road or a level crossing, and the dispute was settled by a grant from the National Development Fund.</P>
    <P>There were a number of projects put forward by the Department of Agriculture and approved of by the previous Government.  The principal of these was a scheme for the eradication of bovine T.B. in the County Limerick for which £600,000 was allocated. There were a number of other schemes which I need not detail, but I want to make it clear that these were the only schemes approved of by the previous Government for financing out of the National Development Fund at the time the change of Government took place.</P>
    <P>There were two other proposals which had been put forward by the Department of Agriculture which had been approved of by the inter-departmental Committee that considers these proposals in the first instance and which were awaiting the approval of the Minister for Finance.  The Department had put forward a scheme for poultry development in Connemara estimated to cost £30,000, and a scheme for buildings and equipment of schools and farms, for the Department of Agriculture, estimated to cost £280,000.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the proposals read out by the Minister was not such that they could be fairly described as pending at the time the change of Government took place.  It was explained to this House when the National Development Fund Bill was under discussion here on Second Reading, that the procedure adopted was to ask every Department to bring forward for consideration every proposal which was on the stocks, either proposals which had been turned down as being inappropriate in the past because of the expenditure involved or proposals which were not likely to be brought forward in the immediate future in the normal course of departmental administration. There was, of course, no assurance given to any Department <Col N="1058" /> that any proposal it submitted would be approved of for financing out of the Fund, but the aim was to secure a tabulation of all proposals which the Department thought useful on any ground, and these proposals were due to be vetted, in the first instance, by the Inter-departmental Committee which had been established, and secondly by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to every one of the proposals which the Minister read out here on the 24th June is that they had not been submitted for detailed examination even by the National Fund Development Inter-departmental Committee.  No recommendation had been made by the Inter-departmental Committee to the Minister for Finance and certainly no decision to approve of them had been taken on behalf of the previous Government by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There was a question of policy as to whether building operations of the kind listed by the Department of Educ Justice and the Department of Education should be financed from the National Development Fund at all.  I think the Minister had to admit, when he was reading through the list that not all the projects on it were undesirable for financing at the present time.  Some of them might in fact be fairly describable as urgent.  I personally although a member of the previous Government had not heard of any of these proposals nor would I have heard of them unless they had been approved of after detailed examination by the National Development Fund Inter-departmental Committee.  What the merits of the proposals for certain reconstruction works at the Military Barracks at the Curragh were I cannot say.  There was, however, one proposal listed by the Minister, namely, to spend a sum of money on an extension of the facilities here at Leinster House.  The Minister may not be aware of the fact that only to-day the Committee on Procedure and Privileges were discussing the inadequacy of the facilities available to the Government and to Government Deputies here at Leinster House.  May I make this quite clear, straight away, that they are not going to solve their problem by taking any <Col N="1059" /> of the very meagre facilities at present available to the Opposition Party.  If that was their idea it is an idea that will not work, and if additional facilities have to be provided, then this proposal, in whole or in part, will have to be considered by the Government in due course.</P>
    <P>With regard to the construction of a new headquarters for the Garda Síochána, I think Deputies ought to know that the Garda headquarters at Kilmainham had to be vacated because the buildings were declared to be unsound, and something has to be done about them.  You could not ask the Garda headquarters to operate in a building which the architect says is unsafe and whether the work is done now or in the future it cannot be postponed indefinitely.  I presume that the reconstruction of Garda barracks in the country is not going to be stopped.  The implication of the Minister's apparent condemnation of the proposed expenditure on new Garda barracks would suggest that curtailment of activities in that regard is intended.  I think it is desirable that there should not be that curtailment because there are many cases where Gardai are operating from very unsuitable barracks, and places where new barracks are required.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem with which the previous Government was concerned and that was the difficulty of finding residences for Gardaí in certain areas.  We came to the conclusion that there is no way of solving that problem except by building&mdash;in certain districts&mdash;houses to be occupied by Gardaí and their families.  The transfer of Gardaí from one district to another in accordance with the normal administration of that force is often rendered impossible by reason of the inability of the Gardaí to find housing accommodation in the districts to which they were transferred.  It has been frequently referred to by the Garda representative body&mdash;the real difficulty of members of the force in getting housing accommodation.  In the long run, I think it will be found that in a number of districts houses will have to <Col N="1060" /> be built for occupation by the Gardaí and in which Gardaí on transfer to new districts can be accommodated.</P>
    <P>I hope that the decision to establish an historical museum in Kilmainham jail will not be scotched.  That building is there.  It is falling into disrepair and becoming an eyesore for want of upkeep.  It has considerable historical associations, and it is an appropriate place for such a museum. That there should be such a museum will, I think, be accepted by most Deputies.  At the present time there is completely inadequate accommodation for the many historical objects and souvenirs which should be on display. If the Minister has any doubts about that I am sure he can on inquiry find out how completely overcrowded the existing National Museum is.  There are priceless treasures stored in crates and vaults there that cannot be put on display anywhere.  The pressure on the National Muaseum could be greatly relieved if this project for an historical museum in Kilmainham jail is allowed to proceed.  The advantage of having additional attractions of that kind in Dublin from the point of view of the tourist trade is also worth bearing in mind.</P>
    <P>There has been very substantial pressure on the Government for the provision of additional accommodation for the National Gallery in Dublin and for many of the other works listed on that list.  I would agree fully that these are works which cannot be classified as urgent, and if there is better use to be made of the national resources now&mdash;that is very good&mdash;but I want, however, to urge strongly on the Government that on many occasions in the past it was proposed that there should always be available a pool of public works ready planned which could be drawn upon if depression in the building trade or other economic circumstances made it desirable to do so.  One of the aims of the previous Government was to ensure that such a pool of works would be there.</P>
    <P>The mere fact that steps were taken to prepare plans for different projects did not mean that these plans were to be implemented this year or next <Col N="1061" /> year.  The difficulty in the past in taking steps to relieve depression in the building and other trades was always the time involved in preparing plans to that end.  If there is any possibility of deterioration in conditions in the building trade in the future and if that is to be relieved by measures taken by the Government, these measures have to be planned now, and if the steps which were initiated to ensure that they would be planned now are stopped, then the Government may find itself in very real difficulty some time from which there will be no escape.</P>
    <P>We are all conscious of the fact that the drive to rehouse our people is coming to an end in many districts with the completion of building programmes. That is not so in Dublin, in Limerick, or in Cork, but in many of the counties and county towns of Ireland the original 1947 housing programme has already been completed and in many other counties and areas the completion of that programme is in sight.  It may be that we could raise our standards of accommodation and thereby create more work in the building field but we have got to recognise the fact that the resources of men, equipment and organisation-ability which were in the past absorbed by the building programmes will not be required for that programme in many parts of the country and must be turned to other useful activities of the kind listed in that programme if there is not to be a serious problem of employment dislocation in many districts.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages of setting up the National Development Fund was that it ensured that money would be available for works and schemes that were worth going ahead with now and at the same time that other works and schemes would be prepared and brought to the point at which they could be considered for approval at a later stage if economic circumstances warranted it.  The particular point I want to make is that, so far as the record of the previous Government was concerned, the measures of which we approved were those on the list that I gave to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There was a large list of proposals brought forward by various Departments which had not yet been considered.  Some were from the Department of Industry and Commerce, of which I am aware; some were from other Departments which had not come to the attention of Ministers other than those directly concerned. Every Department was given that precise instruction to bring forward every scheme that it considered would be worth while doing at any time, even though it might not be regarded as urgent in present circumstances.</P>
      <P>I would like to know if it is the intention of the present Government to allow the National Development Fund to proceed on that basis, to allow these various proposals of the different Departments to come before the National Development Committee and if approved, in accordance with whatever general directions are given to the committee, to be sent forward to the Minister for Finance.  May I say to the Minister for Finance that we will not hold him responsible for any scheme that he has not approved.  He can consider any proposal that comes to him and we will not try to attribute responsibility for that to him until he has given his approval.  We ask the same for ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two points which I want to bring to the attention of the Minister.  The first has reference to the facilities available for visitors to this House.  We have a structure at the main gate which I think is a disgrace to this House. Surely at this stage, when we have appeals from all sides of the House for improved buildings, it is not too much to ask that a better type of structure be provided there and a few extra amenities made available for those people who want to see how the business of the State is being conducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> The second matter that I desire to bring to the notice of the Minister is the lack of facilities in this House for Independent Deputies.  There seems to be an idea in the minds of members of political Parties here that they can shove the Independent members around any way they like.  As far as I can judge, when a room is given to the Independent Deputies in this House they are liable to be evicted within 24 hours.  I do not know whether the members of political Parties realise it or not, but each Independent is a Party unto himself.  To my mind an Independent Deputy has more work to do than any three Deputies of the various Parties put together.  His correspondence, if any of the Parties like to check upon it, is much greater than that received by any individual member of a political Party. Consequently a great deal of time when the House is not actually sitting from 9 or 9.30 in the morning is taken up dealing with correspondence from his constituents.  Very often he has to do the work of the political Parties.  So far as I am personally concerned I handle correspondence from both of the major Parties in this House.  I get little thanks for it of course.</P>
    <P>When the present Dáil came together and the rooms were allocated to the political Parties and others in this House, the Independents were given a room, but it has now been decided that we are to be deprived of that room and that it is to be handed over to the Labour Party.  I understand that the Labour Party have a room at the head of the stairs already and they want another one at the far end of the House.  I am not disputing the fact that they may require extra accommodation.  My point is that there are five Independents and we have one common policy at least on this&mdash;that we are entitled to facilities in order to deal with matters that affect the people who sent us here.  If I find that there are no facilities available to me, as regards accommodation to deal with the very heavy correspondence I receive or to interview those of my constituents who come to Dublin, then I am in the position that I shall have to explain to my <Col N="1065" /> constituents that there is an attempt in this House by the political Parties to deprive Independent Deputies of their rights.  It is a serious thing to make such an allegation and I do not want to do so yet, because I feel that when the matter is brought to the attention of the Minister he will see that fair play is given.</P>
    <P>So far as facilities for other Parties are concerned, they have their representatives on the various committees. Due to the fact, I presume, that there are only five Independents, we are deprived of representation on most committees of the House with the result that we have nobody to fight our case, and this is the only opportunity given to me to make a case on our behalf.  I want to make it clear to the House that my remarks are being made on behalf of all the Independents, not on my own behalf alone.</P>
    <P>In regard to the proper way to meet our demands, I am not concerned with the question of the erection of new buildings for the accommodation of the Independent Deputies.  I do not want the suggestion to be made by other members of the House that extra rooms have to be built to accommodate Independent Deputies, because I can see a very nice political lever being handed over to the political Parties in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parties are looking for extra rooms, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as our group is concerned, we have a membership of five.  We have a membership as big as two of the political Parties and on that basis we are entitled to the same facilities as the members of these Parties.  I do not want to prolong this matter, but I would ask the Minister to ensure that the present accommodation, which we intend to hold, is not taken from us by a Party which happens to have a greater number of Deputies than are in the Independent ranks.  I want to say personally that, unless we are offered suitable alternative accommodation, the room we have is the room we hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong the debate in this matter because, <Col N="1066" /> as Deputy McQuillan says, he speaks on behalf of all the Independent Deputies.  I should like to say that one of the difficulties under which the Independent Deputies have laboured in the past seems now to be aggravated. In the past we have had to allow the Committee of Public Accounts the temporary use of the room allocated to us as Independent Deputies.  Now the proposal apparently is that we should be moved to a room where possibly the Committee of Public Accounts will want to meet and where every other Committee of the Dáil and the Seanad is likely to be put in.  It must be remembered that when a Deputy is using a room he is possibly consulting statutes, dealing with correspondence and has papers lying about.  He has quite enough to do without being obliged to tidy these papers up on every day and at every hour that a Committee requires the use of the room.  I think it is not fair that he should be put in this position.</P>
      <P>We are not in any way attempting to be a stumbling block to some sensible arrangement regarding the accommodation in the House as it at present exists, but we do not think it fair that we should be asked, not alone to share a room with the Committee of Public Accounts but that we should be moved to one where every Committee of this House and of the Seanad as well will meet.  I appreciate as all the Independent Deputies appreciate the difficulties.  We are really raising the matter now because, as Deputy McQuillan has stated, we have no other opportunity of raising it.  I must say that I understood that we were to be allowed to voice our opinion at the meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this morning, but it apparently decided to evict us without hearing us.  We were not given an opportunity of making our case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any application was made by the Independent Deputies before the Committee of Procedure and Privileges. The notice was on the Order Paper that the Committee of Procedure and Privileges was to sit this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1067" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that there may have been a little misunderstanding on our part but we certainly understood that the purpose of the meeting was to  some suitable means of accommodation. We certainly never dreamt that the only purpose of the meeting was to evict us from our room.  However, I want to make this point while I am on the subject.  It might be suggested that there are facilities in the Library where Independent members can go and do their correspondence.  Unfortunately the rules that I understand there are in regard to the Library probably cannot be and certainly are not strictly adhered to.  The notice on the door says that is for the use of Senators and Deputies.  Quite a number of other people get in and it depends on what you make of the word &ldquo;use&rdquo;.  I do appreciate that with the accommodation available in the House to all Deputies and Senators it is impossible to find any solution but to allow them to interview constituents in the Library but it means that it is very difficult to read in the Library and almost impossible to write, so that it cannot be suggested that we have that available to us.</P>
      <P>May I just make this one point in conclusion?  On Monday last Deputy Alfred Byrne was honoured by the Capital City by being made its first citizen.  On Thursday Deputy Alfred Byrne, Lord Mayor of Dublin, is evicted from the Independents' room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we discuss the problems of Deputies we should consider the problem of visitors to this House, particularly those who come from the country.  The little poke of a place that is a so-called waiting room inside the gate is a disgrace. Something should be done there. There is sufficient room in the yard to extend that little building.  During the emergency concrete pill-boxes were erected in various places.  They were never used but at least they were intended for a good purpose in case of necessity.  In many cases the pill boxes that were erected throughout the country were twice as large as the so-called waiting-room where people are left while waiting for a Deputy whom they may wish to interview. Before we consider the problems of <Col N="1068" /> Deputies it is only fair that we should see that the waiting-room is modernised so that visitors will not get the impression, from the outside of Leinster House, that we are living in the 18th century.</P>
      <P>I remember coming into the House with my late colleague, Deputy Hurley, a member for South-East Cork.  The first time I came I got the impression of going into an exhibition of caged birds.  The wire netting in front of the public gallery gave me that impression. Apparently we are such important individuals that we must be protected against anyone who has the misfortune, at times, to sit in the public gallery.  We should devise means of providing comfort for those who must endure listening to some of us in this House because everyone in the public gallery is a guest of some member of the House and is entitled to some consideration.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Sheldon have a problem of accomodation, but so have we all.  I think Deputy McQuillan knows that we in the Labour Party are not anxious to throw him out of his room.  If he is put out on the side of the road we will take him in.  If the members of the Independent group have their problem, we have one also.  Even though some people may consider that we are a small Party, it is outrageous that it was only by fierce fighting as a Party that our claim to a second room was listened to.  We have at present the room that was occupied by a number of Independents in the 13th Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a deputation being received in that room, other members of our Party have nowhere to work. It has been put to us by some of the officials who are trying to bludgeon us when we express our views in this matter that in years gone by a certain wing of the building was allocated to the Opposition.  As I said then, and as I say in the House now, that time has gone.  We have reached a new phase in public life and instead of having two or, at most three Parties, we have a number of Parties.  I am convinced that the accommodation in the House is not divided equitably between the <Col N="1069" /> various Parties.  Like Deputy McQuillan, I am not advocating that we should look for extra accommodation by way of putting up large buildings, but even at present there is accommodation to which we are entitled.  I will relieve Deputy McQuillan's mind by saying that we did not ask for one room at the top of the building and another room at the back.  We wanted two rooms together.  There is a very convenient room, as Deputy McQuillan knows, which I believe we should have got.  It is a room leading off No. 114 and there is a dividing door between the two.  There is accommodation there that would have been very convenient for us.  I would like the Minister to look into the matter.</P>
    <P>There is a point as regards the restaurant.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance should be interested in this matter.  In the middle of the day or in the evening time, when we are all there and there is so much hot air about the place, it is the worst place in the City of Dublin that one could enter.  It is a veritable death-trap.  Are we to admit that we cannot devise means whereby members and their friends can have a meal in comfort in that so-called restaurant?  At present, any Deputy who goes in for his or her meals has the same complaint to make, that it is a disgrace owing to the lack of ventilation.  I would suggest that this matter be taken up most seriously. There is no reason why there should not be a proper system of ventilation in the restaurant.</P>
    <P>A word of praise is due to the staff who work in the restaurant under very difficult conditions.  We have adopted a new system for the restaurant for the last few months.  I should like to pay a tribute to a former Deputy, John McCann, for the wonderful work he did on the Restaurant Committee.  I should like the members of the House to know that the Restaurant Committee will not succeed unless we get the fullest co-operation from the members of the House.  It is only fair that members should know the difficulties under which the staff of the restaurant had to work for so many years back.  Should the occasion arise for members of the Restaurant Committee to ask for financial <Col N="1070" /> assistance for the improvement of the conditions in the restaurant and for the improvement of the conditions of the staff, I sincerely hope that the Minister will give the matter sympathetic consideration and that he will open the strings of the national purse so that the staff will get what they are entitled to&mdash;fair consideration.</P>
    <P>I should also like to direct attention to the wages paid to some employees. With regard to some of the staff here, whether we call them attendants or messengers, the wage paid to them, I believe, is disgraceful.  We hear a lot and talk a lot about the cost of living whether in Dublin or in Cork knowing that as employers we are setting a very bad headline.  It is about time that consideration should be given to the position of these attendants or messengers and also the women cleaners.  Deputy McQuillan may advocate the necessity for proper accommodation here.  It seems to have been the practice all the years back that, no matter what extra work was imposed on the staff there never seemed to have been a question of employing an extra hand.  While I fully appreciate the Minister's difficulties as a new and a young Minister coming into this important office, I hope that the remarks which Deputy McQuillan, Deputy Sheldon and myself have made will be given the consideration which is due to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Ceann Comhairle has left the Chair. As I understand, so far as the allocation of such rooms as there are in this building is concerned, it is the function of the Ceann Comhairle to allot them and not the function of the Government, nor even the function of the Committee of Procedure and Privileges. I can clearly remember, when I was on the other side of the House, putting forward an argument to which Deputy Lemass referred in regard to the rooms for the Fine Gael Party when we were in opposition, that I was told most specifically it was the sole responsibility of the Ceann Comhairle to allot such accommodation as is in this building in a way which in his opinion, was equitable amongst the various Parties and including for that <Col N="1071" /> purpose and for that purpose alone the Independents as a Party.  I am glad, and I am sure other Deputies will be touched to see the complete unity and co-operation there is amongst the Independents.  However, that of course is with reference to allocation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the problem of accommodation here itself, of course that has been under consideration for some time.  The &ldquo;doghouse&rdquo; as I have heard the waiting-room at the gate called at times, is not a very pleasant waiting-room, I agree.  At the same time, it would be a tragedy, as I think everyone would agree, if the very fine architectural features in the front of this building were spoiled by anything that would detract from them.</P>

      <P>It would be particularly difficult to erect anything there that would not detract in any way.  I understand it is particularly fresh in everybody's mind because of the meeting of the Committee of Procedure and Privileges this morning. I think that committee has sent the task to a sub-committee to consider what they think could be done to meet the convenience of all concerned in the circumstances, and, of course, I include in the convenience of all concerned not merely the convenience of Deputies and Parties, but also the taxpayer. No doubt the sub-committee when it meets will particularly remember the last-mentioned class to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the speech that I made last week on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill.  I thought I had made it perfectly clear, I certainly intended to make it clear, that I referred to proposals that were pending.  The proposals that were approved were, as I interjected across the House, given by Deputy Aiken when Acting-Minister for Finance either on the Vote on Account or in relation to some question at the time. They were given some time in March. Deputy Lemass does not think that a <Col N="1072" /> proposal which is sent forward by a Minister is a pending proposal.  It seems to me that that is exactly what a pending proposal is.  When a Minister sends forward a proposal to the Inter-departmental Committee, until such time as it is confirmed or rejected I think that &ldquo;pending&rdquo; is the exact description for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the exact significance of what the Minister for Lands said when he stated: &ldquo;This is what they are going to do?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister concerned who sent these proposals forward wish them to be done. I cannot see them being sent forward by the respective Ministers unless the Ministers concerned wish that.  I think if the Deputy considers what I said last week he will see that what I was objecting to was the scale on which these projects were planned.  I think I made it clear last week that I could see great merit in some of these proposals, but it was the scale I was objecting to.  I have not got the copy of the Official Report here, but I think I referred to it as a millionaire scale. Take, for example, the erection of the new Garda headquarters.  I do not think Deputy Lemass could possibly quarrel with me when I say that the plan for that on a £200,000 basis was out of accord with our national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it should be dealt with on that basis.  To go down the scale, take another proposal. I agree that houses for Guards are necessary, but I do not think that the Deputy would get agreement that it is desirable to build these houses at a cost of £3,000 per house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that that size of house is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That was my point. All these projects were planned on a scale that was entirely out of keeping with our economy.  I am glad to know that I will have the co-operation of <Col N="1073" /> the Deputy, because they must be dealt with on a scale which will be more in keeping with national finance. I gather also that the Deputy suggested that these projects and these plans were being put forward for a long-term view.  The National Development Fund was brought in for a specifically short-term view, for a period of four years only, and when we are considering them we must remember that Section 3 of the Act which was passed earlier this year specifically limited this fund to a period of four years.  Therefore, I think it is not unfair to say that this type of planning should be assessed on the basis of the Act and not on the basis that Deputy Lemass was suggesting, pushing it back for 20 years or some time in the distant never, never future.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy has raised this matter, I think I referred to it to-day in the answers I gave to the question that he put down.  I take the view, and I do not think the Deputy will disagree with the view I take, that these projects coming from any Department should not be even considered by the Interdepartmental Committee set up until the Minister in charge of the particular Department in question has signified his approval or disapproval.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that the previous Minister in charge of the Department approved that a project should go from the Department to the committee before it was allowed to go.  I have given an instruction accordingly to the Interdepartmental Committee that they are to refer back all those projects to the individual Ministers, so that the new Ministers can judge what part of the projects&mdash;all or any or some&mdash;should be sent forward again for examination, so that they would go to the committee for consideration with the approval of the new Minister just as they went, those of them that did go&mdash;and went, I must still use the word, pending the approval of the former Minister who sent them forward. When that has been done, it will be possible to examine the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I added another comment to the Deputy to-day in reply to a question he asked me, that when these proposals were received, my predecessor was <Col N="1074" /> asked for an interim direction.  I do not propose to make any comment on that, for reasons which the Deputy and I appreciate.  I only mention it to make it clear that I am not making any point on it, that I am dealing purely with the fact of the being pending because the individual Minister in charge of the Department sent them forward.  I have given directions that they be sent forward to the Department concerned, so that the individual Ministers might consider these proposals and such suitable proposals as they might in their wisdom deem more desirable in the national interest.  Without entering into it at this stage, I could conceive other proposals that it would be more in the national interest to have as a type of pool to which the Deputy referred.</P>

      <P>The net Estimate for Vote 8 is £54,530 more than the Estimate for 1953-54.  The provision for salaries, wages and allowances is increased by £72,000, but this increase is offset by the sum of £26,670 provided in 1953-54 from the Vote for increases in remuneration following the arbitration award of 1952.  The provisions for travelling, telegram and telephone charges, and incidental expenses account for an increase of £6,700. Appropriations-in-Aid are expected to realise £2,500 less than last year's Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head A refers to salaries, wages and allowances.  Specific provision has been made for 31 additional heads of staff of which 22 are for the engineering branch, and mainly for the marine and general division, to meet the requirements of the programme of harbour improvement works.  A contingency provision of the same amount as last year in respect of this branch is for additional engineering staff for drainage works and clerical assistance <Col N="1082" /> for the central engineering workshop establishment.</P>
    <P>Additional provision is required for consulting engineers' fees for services in connection with the Corrib-Clare Catchment Drainage Scheme and with dredging plant.  The other increases in the Subhead cover proposals for architectural staff to cope with additional work devolving on the new Works Division and to meet the requirements of the expanding Schools building and improvement programme, and staff for the Secretary's Branch required by the general expansion of the activities of the Office.  Five new heads of staff are being provided for the National Monuments Service.</P>
    <P>The salaries, amounting to £21,000 and the travelling expenses, £4,000, of engineering staff, numbering 41, engaged on surveys and works being carried out by the Commissioners as agents for the Minister for Agriculture, are recoverable from the Vote for Agriculture together with £2,100 for Secretariat and Accountant's Branch staff.  Expenditure amounting to £5,800 and £4,800 is recoverable from Vote 20&mdash;Employment and Emergency Schemes and Vote 51&mdash;Transport and Marine Services respectively&mdash;see items (5) and (7) of Subhead E&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The proposed additions to the technical staff are reflected in the increase of £5,500 in Subhead B.&mdash;Travelling Expenses&mdash;which is principally attributable to activities in connection with the Marine Works programme and also to increased mileage and subsistence rates.  The increase under Subhead C. &mdash;Incidental Expenses, £700, is likewise related to the requirements of the additional staff.  Provision is made for an increase of £500 in respect of Sub-head D.&mdash;Telegrams and Telephones arising out of the revision of the system of charges for the telephone service.</P>
    <P>A net increase of £2,000 is anticipated in receipts under Subhead E.&mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;the principal reduction being that of £5,000 in agency fees recoverable for services in connection with works chargeable to Telephone Capital Account and to the British Ministry of Works.  Recoveries <Col N="1083" /> from Vote 9 of salaries and travelling expenses of staff engaged on Drainage works also show a decrease, £1,900, in anticipation of the conclusion of work on the River Fergus and the Brosna Catchment Drainage Scheme.</P>
    <P>The amount expected to be recovered as administrative expenses for the management of the Local Loans Fund will also be less than last year to the extent of £1,000.  These decreases are offset to the extent shown in the Estimate by an increase of £3,100 recoverable from the Vote for employment and emergency schemes and by increases of £1,500 and £800 in the amounts expected to be recovered from the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Industry and Commerce in respect of the salaries and travelling expenses of staff engaged on the land rehabilitation and harbour improvement works.</P>
    <P>I come now to Vote 9.  The Estimate of £4,647,000 for Public Works and Buildings for this year compared with the Vote for 1953/54 shows a net increase of £1,639,850.</P>
    <P>The increase in gross expenditure is attributable mainly to the programme of building works and the acquisition of new premises.  Increases of lesser order in the provisions for the construction and maintenance of arterial drainage schemes are balanced by a roughly equivalent decrease in the provision for the purchase and maintenance of engineering plant and machinery and stores.  The provision for building maintenance is virtually unchanged but some increases have been made in the provisions for furniture and fuel.</P>
    <P>The provisions for the individual sub-heads show the following variations on those of last year:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sub-head A&mdash;Purchase of Sites and Buildings&mdash;has been increased by £440,000.</P>
    <P>Sub-head B&mdash;New Works, Alterations and Additions&mdash;shows an increase of £1,140,000 on last year's provision of £1,330,000.  The increase in the schools building and improvements <Col N="1084" /> provision accounts for £620,000 of the increase in this sub-head.  Due to progress with a number of school building projects the expenditure under this head last year amounted to £1,071,920, as against a provision of £730,000.  The provision for 1954/55 is £1,350,000.  Works at military establishments, including hard surface runways at Baldonnel, require an increased provision of £220,000 approximately. These comprise the more substantial increase under this sub-head which includes 162 items in all.</P>
    <P>The principal items included by my predecessor in the sub-head are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Áras an Uachtaráin&mdash;Improvements; Dublin Castle&mdash;new offices for stamping branch and Revenue Department; Office of Public Works&mdash;central engineering workshop and stores (adaptations); Botanic Gardens&mdash;improvement of water supply; Abbotstown Farm&mdash;adaptations; agricultural schools at Athenry, Ballyhaise and Clonakilty&mdash;sundry building and improvement works; Grange Stud and Dairy Farm&mdash;adaptations; Johnstown Castle&mdash;adaptations; Munster Institute &mdash;improved accommodation; Veterinary College&mdash;improvements; Fishery, etc. Harbours &mdash; dredging and improvement works and preliminary preparations for the construction of major fishery harbours; a number of new Garda barracks; Coláiste Móibhí Preparatory College&mdash;adaptations; Central Model Schools&mdash;central heating and electric lighting; Rosslare&mdash;new meteorological station; Valentia Observatory&mdash; adaptations and additions; a new tweed mart at Glencolumbkille; new post offices and telephone exchanges at Athenry, Cootehill, Drogheda, Galway, Kilrush, Naas and Rathluirc; extensions and improvements to existing post offices at Ballina, Dundalk, Kilkenny and Tralee; new broadcasting studies at Cork; Cathal Brugha barracks&mdash;dining hall and cookhouse; McKee Barracks&mdash;covered accommodation for vehicles; Baldonnel Camp&mdash; hard surface runways; Curragh Camp &mdash;new Catholic church, additional magazines, storage accommodation and renewal of electrical installation; Arbour Hill Detention Prison&mdash; memorial to 1916 leaders; Paris <Col N="1085" /> Embassy adaptations and furnishing; new employment exchanges at Ballina and Westport.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C&mdash;Maintenance and Supplies, has virtually the same provision as last year.  There is a small transfer of liability to the Vote for Transport and Marine Services in respect of some supplies for the Coast Life Saving Service but the expenditure as a whole is expected to show little change.</P>
    <P>For subhead D (1)&mdash;Furniture Fittings and Utensils, an additional £10,000 is being provided to meet large movements of headquarters staffs and increased demands generally.  There are no changes in sub-head D (2)&mdash; Central Furniture Stores or sub-head E&mdash;Rents, Rates, etc., but sub-head F&mdash;Fuel, Light, Water, Cleaning, etc., shows an increase of £1,000 attributable mainly to the proposed use of turf in central heating installations and the increased cost of fuel oil.  It is necessary also, chiefly as a matter of accounting procedure, to make separate provision for the cost of fuel stocks, purchased but unissued before the close of the financial year.  This provision, estimated at £5,000 is made under sub-head F (2)&mdash;Reserve Fuel Stocks, which has been opened for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Of the minor provisions, sub-head G &mdash;Phoenix Park National School, shows an increase of £360, the estimated cost of internal and external painting and sub-head I&mdash;Telegrams and Telephones&mdash;is increased by £100 consequent on revision of the system of charges for the telephone service. There is no charge in sub-head H&mdash; River Shannon Works.</P>
    <P>For Arterial Drainage Surveys (sub-head J (1)), the provision required is the same as last year, the survey programme contemplated being of similar extent to that proposed for 1953-54. Deputies will no doubt have observed that the drainage and machinery sub-heads are presented in a somewhat modified form this year.  The change has been made for the purpose of simplifying accounting procedure.</P>
    <P>The provision of £377,000 for Arterial Drainage Construction Works (sub-head J (2) is £41,500 higher than the <Col N="1086" /> corresponding figure for last year. Works on the Brosna are drawing to a close and those on the Corrib-Clare catchment drainage scheme have just begun.  Operations on the Glyde and Dee and on the Feale schemes are continuing; the Nenagh scheme has been exhibited in accordance with the Act and will shortly be submitted for confirmation. Further schemes in the design and survey stages are the Moy, the Maine, the Inny and the Suck.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head J (3) &mdash;Barrow Drainage, Repayment of Advances&mdash;is statutory and remains unchanged.  The provision under sub-head J (4)&mdash;River Fergus Drainage&mdash; shows a decrease of £5,500 as the works at Clarecastle are almost complete.</P>
    <P>A new sub-head&mdash;J (5)&mdash;has been opened to provide for the maintenance of completed arterial drainage schemes, one of which, the Brosna, is expected to come into that category during the year.  Expenditure under this sub-head will be recoverable in due course from the county councils concerned.</P>
    <P>For accounting purposes it has been found desirable to amalgamate the three K sub-heads which formerly provided separately for the purchase and maintenance of engineering plant and machinery and for workshop equipment and stores.  The new sub-head K &mdash;Purchase and Maintenance of Engineering Plant, Machinery and Stores&mdash;combines these provisions. Compared with the equivalent provisions of the 1953-54 Estimate the sub-head shows a decrease of £40,500. This decrease is mainly in respect of the provision required for workshop plant and equipment, a considerable quantity of which has now been installed.</P>
    <P>The estimate of receipts under sub-head L&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;shows a decrease of £23,190.  The main decrease is in the hireage of plant.  This figure varies from year to year according to the extent to which dredgers and other items of plant are engaged on works for local authorities and other outside parties.  The remaining variations are casual.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> Under the Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes, funds are provided for the annual programme of employment schemes to give work to men in receipt of unemployment assistance in urban and rural areas of the country, and for other services such as bog development schemes, rural improvements schemes, minor marine works and other miscellaneous schemes, which, while not specifically authorised for the purpose of giving employment, represent a useful contribution to that problem.  The Vote also makes provision for the salaries, travelling expenses, etc., of the staff of the Special Employment Schemes Office responsible for the administration of the Vote.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see from page 54 of the printed Estimates, the net provision <Col N="1088" /> in this year's Estimate is substantially the same as last year, viz., £695,900, compared with the provision of £689,450 in 1953-54.  It will be recalled, however, that the Vote last year was supplemented in December last by a grant of £500,000 from the National Development Fund.  It is proposed this year to supplement the Vote by a grant of £400,000 from the fund.  This was decided by the previous Minister before leaving office and it is proposed to accept that decision. The manner in which this extra money will be distributed among the various sub-heads of the Vote is at present under active consideration.</P>
    <P>The provision, including National Development Fund grant, and expenditure last year on the various services are shown in the following statement:&mdash;</P>

    <P>In addition to the Voted amounts mentioned above, contributions were provided by local authorities amounting to £79,200 for urban areas and £17,400 for Rural Employment Schemes.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F (Urban Employment Schemes) is intended to finance employment schemes in the four county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, the borough of Dún Laoghaire and such of the 55 other urban districts in which there are sufficient numbers of unemployment assistance recipients to form gangs of economic size.  These schemes are administered by the respective local authorities through the Department of Local Government and grants are subject to the local authority submitting suitable work schemes for approval by the Special Employment Schemes Office and the making of a contribution towards their costs.</P>
    <P>Employment schemes in rural areas under Sub-heads G and H form a joint programme of works.  They are carried out only in areas where the number of unemployment assistance recipients are sufficient to form gangs of economic size.  Sub-head G finances schemes of work on county roads administered by county councils.  The schemes are confined to non-urbanised towns and to rural areas where there are very large numbers of unemployment assistance recipients.  The county councils are required to contribute about 25 per <Col N="1089" /> cent, of the cost.  Subhead H (Minor Employment Schemes) consists of the construction and repair of accommodation roads to farmers' houses, lands and bogs.  No local contribution is required in respect of minor employment schemes.  These schemes are carried out only in the Counties of Cavan, Clare, Cork West, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo, and are confined to the congested or poorer areas in those counties.</P>
    <P>The provision under Subhead I for development works in bogs used by landholders and other private producers is for the repair or construction of roads and drains serving bogs used by landholders and other persons who produce handwon turf for their domestic requirements or for sale in neighbouring towns.</P>
    <P>The Rural Improvements Scheme (Subhead J) makes provision for grants towards the cost of carrying out works to benefit the lands of two or more farmers, such as small drainage schemes, bridges and the reconstruction and repair of accommodation roads to houses, lands and bogs.  State grants varying from 75 per cent. in the case of farms with an average valuation of £18 and over to 95 per cent. in the case of farms with an average valuation of below £6 of the cost of approved works are available, subject to the balance of the cost being met by the benefiting landholders.  In cases where the work is of substantial benefit to the general &ldquo;outside&rdquo; public in addition to the immediate farms benefiting, the percentage of State grant can be increased. These rural improvements schemes grants are available in any part of the Twenty-Six Counties, irrespective of the number of unemployment assistance recipients in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>The Rural Improvements Scheme is now the most popular scheme administered by the Special Employment Schemes Office and this, of course, is due to the change made in June, 1950 in the terms of the scheme.  Prior to that date farmers, irrespective of whether they were wealthy men with large valuations or small farmers with a valuation of only a few pounds per head, were required to pay one-quarter <Col N="1090" /> of the cost of the proposed works, the State contributing the remaining three-quarters. To meet the cases in the poorer districts where the farmers were not able to contribute one-quarter of the cost, the terms of the scheme were revised to allow an increased proportion of State grant, where necessary.  The 25 per cent. contribution was retained only in the case of farmers whose average valuation was £18 or more.  In the case of farmers with a valuation of £12 but below £18, the contribution was reduced to 20 per cent.: farmers with valuations of £9 or below £12 were only asked to pay 15 per cent.: £7 valuation and below £9 were asked to pay 11 per cent.: £6 average valuation or below £7 had to pay only 8 per cent., and in the case of the very small farmers with valuations of less than £6 they were asked to pay only a 5 per cent. contribution. The number of applications received under the scheme, in consequence, increased considerably, the figures being 695 in 1949-50 (the last year of the old arrangement), 1,412 in 1950-51, 1,285 in 1951-52, 1,226 in 1952-53 and 1,458 in 1953-54.  The money provision for the scheme in the Estimates had, in consequence, also to be increased from £100,000, which was the figure up to 1949-50 to £125,000 in 1950-51, £150,000 in 1951-52 and £175,000 in 1952-53.  The expenditure in 1952-53 was £190,000, and it has gone up again to £235,000 last year, which was met partly from the Vote provision of £197,000 and partly from the additional grant of £75,000 from the National Development Fund in 1953-54.  There are, in fact, already in the Special Employment Schemes Office sufficient applications to exhaust the money that can be made available for this scheme in 1954-55.  Deputies on all sides of the House must, therefore, realise that there will necessarily be some delay in dealing with any new applications. The provision for miscellaneous schemes (Subhead K) is mainly to meet expenditure on minor marine works, such as the extension and reconstruction of small piers or slips for the landing of seaweed and sand, and to facilitate the fishing industry. The county councils concerned are required to contribute one-quarter of <Col N="1091" /> the cost of such schemes and to maintain the works on completion.  The sub-head will also finance schemes of archaeological excavation at Tara, Lough Gara and other centres.</P>
    <P>The Appropriations-in-Aid realised last year were £38,750 approximately, of which £25,500 had been taken into account in the Estimates submitted to the Dáil and was used to meet part of the expenditure.  This subhead includes receipts in respect of rural improvements schemes, bog development schemes, minor marine works and the sales of surplus materials, etc.</P>

Tá súil agam go mbeidh ar chumas an <Col N="1093" /> Rúnaí Parlaiminte an t-airgead sin ar fad a chaitheamh i rith na bliana agus go mbeidh ar chumas foireann Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí agus na hoifigigh eile atá fé chúram an Rúnaí Parlaiminte obair ar fheabhas a dhéanamh leis an airgead sin ar mhaithe le na daoine i gcoitinne agus go mór-mhór daoine na gceanntracha bochta atá luaite agam.</P>
    <P>I perhaps should explain to the Parliamentary Secretary that his immediate predecessor is unavoidably prevented from being present and I want to assure him that it is not through any lack of courtesy on his part that he is not here.  We are particularly pleased that the programme of works prepared by Deputy <Col N="1094" /> Beegan when he was Parliamentary Secretary has been adopted by the present occupant of the office.  As I said in Irish, many of these schemes confer considerable benefit on the poorest districts in the country.  They confer two direct benefits: they provide very useful amenities which need to be provided, but which would have a very poor chance of being undertaken out of money provided from the rates and they provide employment in places where it is very difficult to find employment of the kind which is readily available in towns.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 2nd July.</P>
