      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will request the Central Statistics Office to prepare and make available an estimate of the number of visitors who came into the State in each of the last five years, showing, if possible, the number of such visitors who were tourists as distinct from persons visiting their relatives, the countries from which such tourists came, and the mode of transport utilised by them to come into the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office has been able to prepare and has published in the September, 1953, issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin</i> estimates of the number of visitors to this country in respect of the years 1951 and 1952 giving some of the information requested by the Deputy. Corresponding estimates for the year 1953 are being compiled and I anticipate that they will be available in about one month's time.  These estimates are largely based on the Sample Passenger Card Inquiry and, while it has hitherto not been possible to provide estimates of the numbers of visitors by country of permanent residence, it is hoped to make such estimates for 1953, though this will be possible only for countries from which substantial numbers of visitors came.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to make any estimates for 1950 or earlier years and I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the available relevant information for the years 1951 and 1952 relating to visitors who travelled via Britain or the Six Counties.  In addition it has been estimated that in 1952 the number of persons who visited this country from overseas and who did not travel via Britain or the Six Counties was about 20,000.</P>

      <P>The grants which are made to An Bord Fáilte and to Fógra Fáilte are for the discharge of the functions assigned to them under the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939 and 1952. The expenditure of the grants is within the discretion of the boards.  The Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, requires that the accounts of both boards shall be audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and that a copy of every balance sheet and income and expenditure account as passed by the Comptroller and Auditor-General together with his report thereon shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The financial accounts of the boards&mdash;copies of which I am sending to the Deputy&mdash;contain a considerable amount of information concerning expenditure under various heads and perhaps the information contained therein will meet the Deputy's requirements.</P>

The following particulars may, however, be sufficient for the Deputies' purpose:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Expenditure by An Bord Fáilte in connection with An Tóstal, 1953, amounted to £30,000; final figures for 1954 are not yet available but it is understood that the expenditure will be of the order of £55,000.  Expenditure by Fógra Fáilte in 1953 and 1954 amounted to £47,000 and £24,000 respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting-Minister for Justice (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been called to the criticisms referred to.</P>
      <P>The Government consider that the public interest requires that the power, which is vested in the Executive, to commute or remit punishment imposed by the courts is one that should be used most sparingly and only for cogent reasons and in exceptional circumstances.  The administration of justice is a matter for the courts, and it should be left to the courts to measure punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> As matters stand, it appears to be the practice that, when a person who has been convicted of an offence, or somebody on his behalf, presents a petition for clemency, the police are, as a matter of course unless the case is plainly a frivolous one, asked for a report.  The petition and report are then transmitted to the judge or justice who tried the case, with a request for his observations.  As the Government are satisfied that the present procedure entails a good deal of unnecessary work and waste of time, explicit instructions have been given that, in future, petitions which do not disclose any merits on their face are to be disallowed without reference to the trial judge or justice concerned and without obtaining a police report.  Directions have also been given to disallow petitions from or on behalf of persons who have neglected or omitted to pursue their ordinary right of appeal, unless it is established that the person concerned is, through lack of means or for any other reason, incapable of exercising his right or that an appeal was not taken for some other valid or reasonable cause.</P>
    <P>Petitions received are frequently based on the suggestion that a fine imposed is beyond the petitioner's means to pay.  In that connection, it is important to direct attention to the fact that the District Court (which handles most of the criminal business in the country) is specifically required by its rules to take into consideration the offender's means and to give him time to pay, where this is required, and is empowered, moreover, even after it has fixed the time for payment, to extend that time on subsequent application and to allow such further time as it may think fit.</P>
    <P>On the question of the removal of disqualifications, particularly those that are incurred by persons who have been convicted of motoring offences as a statutory consequence of their conviction, the Government take the view that, whatever opinion may be held about the necessity for or the value of uniform, severe and automatic penalties as a method of preventing such offences, the law should be allowed to take its course save in exceptional circumstances. <Col N="79" /> The Government, however, intend to have the matter examined with a view to a possible amendment of the law which would enable a person subjected to such a disqualification to apply to a court for reconsideration of the penalty and would empower the court to remove or modify the disqualification if, in the opinion of the court, the circumstances warrant that course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach does he think it proper for a district justice during two general elections, one in 1951 and the other, the last election, to question the right of a Minister to defer execution of a warrant pending his consideration of a petition, especially in view of the fact that this particular district justice had got the opinion from two Attorneys-General that the Minister could not properly exercise his functions if he had not the right to defer the execution of such a warrant?  I am glad to hear that the Taoiseach does intend to amend Section 23 of the 1951 Act.  I intended to ask him that as a supplementary but he has already answered it.  I am glad that he intends to do what I suggested when the Act was going through, to have some person other than a Minister to deal with the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">

I will have the matter examined also with a view to seeing what would be the most appropriate method of dealing with it.  The indication which I have given in my reply indicates my preference, that it should be a court that would look into the question of removing a disqualification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.  A report on the trend of employment and unemployment for the years 1950 and 1951 was submitted to the previous Government in June, 1953.  The Taoiseach's Department questioned the advisability of publishing the report at that stage on the grounds that the more important information in it had already been published elsewhere, that the employment position had changed so much that it would not be suitable to issue such out-of-date figures in an official publication, and that it was undesirable to include in the report passenger movement and travel document statistics which had been discarded as reliable measures of emigration. The Government decided that the report should not be published and that an inter-departmental committee comprising representatives of the Departments of Social Welfare and Industry and Commerce and of the Central Statistics Office should be established to prepare an annual report on employment and unemployment and that it should at once undertake the preparation of a report in respect of the years 1950, 1951 and 1952.</P>
      <P>A committee was set up accordingly and prepared a report covering the years 1950, 1951, 1952 and most of 1953. This report was submitted to the Government by the Minister for Social Welfare on 12th April, 1954.  On the 7th May last the Department was informed that it had been arranged at a meeting of the Government that the Minister would refer, for examination, to the inter-departmental committee a number of points which were raised in regard to the text of the report.  These points were not specified and the Minister did not refer them to the committee before he left office.</P>
      <P>I now propose to submit the report to the Government immediately for permission to present it to the Oireachtas and to publish it.  I will see what I can do to ensure that these reports are published in future as soon as possible after the end of the calendar year to which they refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention that, as the present report covers most of the year 1953, it <Col N="84" /> is not proposed to publish a separate report for that year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That it is expedient that legislation be enacted to give statutory effect to certain Financial Resolutions passed on the 21st day of April, 1954, by Dáil Eireann in Committee <Col N="90" /> on Finance, to make provision for other matters relating to or connected with the said Financial Resolutions and to provide for the cesser of the Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 326) (Beer) Order, 1954, and the Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 327) (Matches) Order, 1954.</P>
    <P>The House will recollect that there were four Financial Resolutions which were dealt with on the last day of the last Dáil.  These Resolutions, under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, have certain statutory effect when passed by the Dáil but that statutory effect is lost as soon as dissolution takes place.  The effect of the Resolution I have now moved and which is now before the House is to again revive them and to form the basis on foot of which the Bill, which is No. 1 on the Order Paper, will later be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The precedent being followed is exactly the same precedent as was followed after the general elections of 1938, 1945 and 1951.  The effect of this Resolution, therefore, is to form the basis of the Bill which will follow and revive the <i>status quo</i> as it was on the 21st April.</P>

      <P>It seems strange that the first act of the Coalition Government should be to confirm the taxation which was proposed by the former Government.  It is very strange, indeed, in view of everything they said about the Budget all round the country for the nine weeks prior to the date of the election.  Let us take the Leader of Fine Gael who is now Minister for Education.  He asserted at Carrick-on-Suir on the 27th of April that the first task of the new Administration would be to lighten the burden of taxation now crushing the people. Instead, the very first task of the new Administration was to confirm the taxation proposed by Fianna Fáil. Deputy Mulcahy, the Minister for Education, may smile at that, but there was quite a number of people who believed him.</P>

      <P>I just want to recall the basis upon which the Coalition group got votes.  I think it is a salutary thing that the people who believed them all round the country should now see that the first act of the new Administration was not to lighten the burden of taxation now crushing the people but to confirm the Resolutions which had become null and void, owing to the dissolution of the Government, and reimpose the taxation that Fianna Fáil proposed.</P>
      <P>I must say that I sympathise with the Minister for Finance.  I think he was very wise in saying nothing when introducing this Resolution.  He did not say about the tax Bill he is now proposing what Deputy Norton, the present Tánaiste, said about it&mdash;that it was a bucket-shop Budget, a faked Budget, but the Minister for Finance now calmly proposes in the fewest possible words to ask the Dáil to accept what was called a bucket-shop Budget and a faked Budget and all the other expressions which they used about it.</P>

      <Col N="92" /> Bill entitled an Act to give statutory effect to certain Financial Resolutions passed on the 21st day of April, 1954, by Dáil Éireann in Committee on Finance, to make provision for other matters relating to or connected with the said Financial Resolutions and to provide for the cesser of the Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 326) (Beer) Order, 1954, and the Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 327) (Matches) Order, 1954.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill is intended to meet a particular situation in connection with four of the Budget Resolutions, those dealing with income-tax, surtax, customs duty on beer, excise duty on beer, and excise duty on matches.  They were given statutory effect to under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927. When the dissolution took place on the 24th of April, these four Resolutions lost their statutory effect under the provisions of the same Act as I have already remarked in the case of the Resolution.  The purpose of the Bill is to remove the difficulties arising from this position by enacting that the Resolutions in question shall be deemed always to have continuous statutory effect from the outset and shall continue to have statutory effect for a limited period.  Also, the Bill makes other incidental and consequential provisions.  It is a short Bill and it is essential for it to be passed as a matter of urgency.  There were similar precedents for this provision.  The previous Government in respect of the last three of these Resolutions made two Orders on the 22nd April last under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act that were to have the effect of doing under that Act what could not be done under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927.  The effect of this Bill is that those Orders cease to have effect under the Imposition of Duties Act and are transferred to the Finance legislation under which, of course, they would have been dealt with if the dissolution of the Dáil had not taken place.</P>

    <P>According to the Standing Orders of the House, as Deputies are no doubt aware, it is necessary to introduce Financial Resolutions as the foundation of the Finance Bill.  The first Resolution that is being circulated at the moment to the members of the House is in respect of income-tax and surtax.  The effect of that Resolution is exactly the same as the Resolution that was dealt with in the former Dáil <Col N="94" /> on the 21st April.  As the Deputies will see on the paper there is a second, General Resolution, and perhaps I might ease the mind of Deputy Aiken if I tell him I will make a short statement on the General Resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provision in connection with finance.</P>
      <P>Those Deputies who were members of the last Dáil will remember that the leaders of the Parties which now form the Government put forward then in this House last March the reasons why we felt that an immediate general election was desirable.  A general election inevitably means disturbance of the economic life of a country.  Businessmen, if they are able to do so, naturally defer decisions.  There is uncertainty and instability until the people have made their choice.  Those were some of the reasons why we wished, in the interest of the community, to have an immediate election to cut the period of uncertainty to the minimum.</P>
      <P>The previous Government were not prepared, however, to accept the course we then advised and, accordingly, that dislocation and instability continued for almost three months up to the time when the new Government was formed on the 2nd June.  I am afraid that the unnecessary suspense has left its mark both on the country and on the revenue of the Government.  Tax revenue, for example, when compared with last year, was down in the first two months of this financial year, that is, for April and May, by £1,750,000.  Even allowing for the reduced balances carried in on 1st April, there was a drop of £1,250,000 in the current collection of taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has, however, now been elected with a clear mandate from the people and with a substantial majority in this House.  The decisiveness of the people's verdict and the assurance of that majority in the Dáil <Col N="95" /> will, I hope, make it clear to everyone that we can look ahead to a period of political stability&mdash;political stability which, as everyone realises, is one of the requisites for economic stability and progress.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach made it clear also in March that there was another reason why an immediate election was then desirable.  We were approaching the commencement of a new financial year&mdash;the period when the Government of the day must introduce its budgetary proposals.  In modern times, the Budget expresses not merely the manner in which revenue will be collected and services paid for but also the economic policy of the Government of the day.  We pointed out then that by deferring the election, the new Administration would be deprived of the opportunities which the framing of a Budget presents.  That was the position in which the Government found itself when it came into office two weeks ago.  We inherited a situation which it was too late to change.  Two months of the financial year had gone and obviously the year would be far advanced before Ministers had an opportunity of making a thorough study of the problems facing them in their respective spheres of administration. By then it would be too late for different financial proposals to have real operative effect in this financial year and the inevitable delay would merely add to the uncertainty and dislocation of business and retard that recovery which the very stability of this Government will bring.</P>
    <P>The Government has, therefore, decided that it has no option but to adopt for this year the proposals of my predecessor and, accordingly, the Resolutions which have been circulated and the Finance Bill which follows merely carry those proposals into effect.</P>
    <P>At the same time I should inform the Dáil that a rigorous examination of the Estimates for the Public Services prepared by our predecessors has already commenced with a view to the elimination of extravagance and waste and to the securing of a better return for the expenditure of public moneys.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> We hope and believe that, in that way, and under our policy of economic expansion we will be able in time to achieve our objects as a Government.</P>
    <P>I stress the phrase &ldquo;in time&rdquo; because it will clearly take time for our policies to operate and for their success to become apparent.  The Government, however, does feel that it is essential that something be done soon to ease the burden of the cost of living, particularly where it falls most heavily.</P>
    <P>While it is right that the best possible provision should be made for those members of the community who are unfortunately suffering from sickness or disease, it is wholly illogical at the same time to allow the health of others to be endangered by undernutrition. Few will deny that one of the articles of food of highest nutritional value&mdash;particularly for children&mdash; is butter.  It is the common experience of each member of the Government that the high retail price of butter is one of the principal causes of anxiety to people everywhere, not merely in the cities and towns but also in the rural areas.  The poorer people and those with large families find it particularly onerous.  The provision of enough butter for her children is almost invariably the greatest single source of worry to the mother of a family when she is considering the purchase of her weekly food supply.  In recognition of the importance of butter in the people's diet and to bring about a reduction in the cost of living as part of its social policy, the Government proposes to lower the price of butter by 5d. per lb. as from the 23rd August next.</P>
    <P>I need hardly stress how substantial is this contribution now being made by the Government.  It represents a reduction of 10 per cent. in the present price and it will enable the housewife to provide more butter for her family or of course if she prefers, she will have more money available from the saving to make other purchases. It represents a reduction in the cost of living that will be felt in almost every home and it is one that will lighten the load of the household <Col N="97" /> budget where it weighs most heavily. This concession will cost £1,250,000 in the current year and the Government is taking firm steps to meet that cost in the manner I have already indicated. The appropriate Supplementary Estimate will be introduced by the Minister for Agriculture in due course. I should add that this will reduce the price of butter to its approximate external economic level and the butter subsidy, therefore, operates to cover the gap between the price at which butter is produced and the price at which it could be bought from abroad.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the magnitude of that concession, it is the maximum that can be made at present.  In one newspaper there was a report that there would be a Supplementary Budget in the autumn.  If believed, that would cause some dislocation in certain trades.  I must make it clear therefore that such a suggestion is entirely without foundation.  So that traders and others may plan what purchases they should make and what stocks they should carry, I should state there will be no Supplementary Budget and no further concessions, remissions or impositions during this financial year.</P>
    <P>The Government is also committed to the payment of the portion of the arbitration award for civil servants which was not implemented by the previous Government.  That commitment, which covers the Army, the Gardaí and teachers as well as the Civil Service, will be honoured, but until the full examination of the commitments left to us by our predecessors has been completed, I cannot indicate the probable date of payment, but it may be taken that it will be prior to the expiration of the current financial year. I must, however, indicate that we have taken over no legacy such as that acquired by our predecessors on the 13th June, 1951.  When they acceded to office, they had no less than £22,500,000 ready and available in cash in the Marshall Aid Loan Counterpart Fund to carry on the capital programme.</P>
    <P>We are not in the same easy position. There are no similar funds available for us in the Marshall Aid Loan <Col N="98" /> Fund, or elsewhere.  On the contrary, in order to meet immediate capital commitments, we will have to obtain accommodation.  The difficulties of that situation by comparison with 1951 are at once apparent.  It is essential, therefore, that a real drive to expand savings should be commenced and that it should have the active co-operation of every citizen and particularly of those bodies in close contact with the community. In that way our people can help to complete the capital development programme.  At the same time, we shall take due care to ensure that private enterprise has adequate access to the capital market for the funds so vitally necessary for the fullest commercial and industrial development.  As that development progresses, and with wise and prudent handling by the Government of national affairs, we are confident that the resources of the country will be adequate to provide a reasonable living for town and country alike.</P>

      <P>Everything that is produced has to be paid for at some time or another by somebody.  Although the Minister for Finance has indicated that he has found that the yield of taxation is down by £1,250,000 for the first few months of this financial year, he is now proposing to spend another £2,250,000.  That money will have to be raised somewhere.  If it is not raised in this particular year, it will have to be raised next year and in the following years.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not paid by the taxpayers this year it will have to be paid on the double next year and in the following years.  It is very, very easy for a Government to shed its responsibility for the future and to spend and borrow in order to avoid political unpopularity or get the support of certain elements such as Fine Gael had to get in order to become the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy for a Government to do that.  If this game is continued by a succession of Governments and if this kind of action by Fine Gael is to become the standard for all Governments, our people will very quickly become beggars on foreign doorsteps looking for the money with which to pay for their imports. As a result of a similar policy in the three previous years of Coalition our taxation this year is £4,000,000 more than it should be or than it would have been had the Coalition Government paid its way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious now that this Government is embarking on another series of expenditure which will have a similar result.  The Government will avoid raising the proper amount of taxation to meet expenditure; it will avoid taxing within the financial year by borrowing and leaving the debt to be paid next year and in the following years.  Those who have the long-term interests of the country at heart, either in this Dáil or outside it, must be disappointed with a Government, irrespective of its composition, that deliberately sets out on such a policy. The net result of the few words that the Minister for Finance has said here to-day is that he feels that the Exchequer will be at least £1,250,000 worse off than the Fianna Fáil Minister <Col N="100" /> for Finance estimated.  Tax revenue was down by that amount in the first few months of this year.  In addition, he has taken on expenditure of at least £2,250,000 in respect of butter and the civil servants.  Does that mean that the Government deliberately intends to add £3,750,000 to the national debt? There is no doubt that that is what it does mean as a minimum.  It may be more.  We shall have to pay for the installation of this Government next year and in the following years as we had to pay for the Coalition Government after they left office.</P>

Instead of reducing tea, as they had promised by implication from 5/- and 6/- a lb. down to 2/8, of coffee from 5/- and 6/- a lb. down to 4/- and of sugar from 7d. down to 4d., bread from 9½d. to 6½d. and butter from 4/2 per lb. down to 2/10, the one thing that has happened is that butter alone is to come down not by 1/4 per lb. but by 5d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This is from the <i>Southern Star,</i> this particular one.  In that newspaper, at the last general election, it was indicated that butter was not to come down by 5d. per lb. but was to come down by 1/4 per lb.  Not only was butter to come down by 1/4 per lb. but sugar was to come down by 3d., tea was to come down by a few shillings per lb., flour was to come down from 4/6 to 2/8, and bread was to come down from 9½d. to 6½d.  That is what the people thought they were voting for; but the vast majority of the people, that is those who directed themselves to the question as to whether to believe Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, believed that what Fine Gael were promising was impossible.  The result was that they voted for the Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
      <P>There were other promises made in this particular advertisement which I have here in my hand.  There were to be &ldquo;old age pensions for all, with the abolition of the means test.&rdquo;  That was put out by Deputy S. Collins and Deputy O'Sullivan, both of whom got is on the promise of old age pensions for all.  We did not hear the Minister for Finance talk about that or about the abolition of the means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another of the things promised was top prices for farmers for all their products. There is one question which I want to ask the Minister for Finance. It is this, that I take it that this 5d. per lb. subsidy is on creamery butter only?  I take it that the amount of money which he mentioned of £1,250,000 would only cover that.  That means that the ordinary farmers' butter is to be left without any subsidy.  The subsidy is to go only to the creamery farmers so that the ordinary farmer, making butter in his own house which he sells at the present time at 2/6 a lb., will have to compete against the creamery butter carrying the subsidy. He can only get 2/6 a lb. for his butter now, and will have to compete against cheaper creamery butter in the future. In other words, he will have to sell his butter against the creamery butter, which is to be 5d. per lb. cheaper. The Minister for Finance has made no <Col N="102" /> provision for a subsidy for farmers' butter.  I think that is quite an invidious position to create.</P>

      <P>I am asking Fine Gael, which is the responsible Party in this Coalition Government, to behave on the basis of having responsibilities to the people, and not only to the voters of this year, but to the people who will have to meet tax bills and have to endeavour to build up the country next year and the years thereafter.  If Fine Gael are going to play ducks and drakes with national finance, as they did during the last Coalition, it is going to be almost impossible to get the country back on its feet again. After the last spree we had to come in here to take the responsibility of putting on very crushing taxation in order to get the finances of the country restored to a sound basis.  We had to impose the measures which had the result of cutting down our adverse trade balance from something like the £61,000,000 which it was running then to under £9,000,000.  But if Fine Gael are just going to throw money around and spend the money they should meet by taxation&mdash;borrow it and spend it&mdash; then the time is coming when it will be very difficult to get Parties to come in here and face the unpopularity of putting the matter to rights.  I warn the people who are behind Fine Gael throughout the country that they should have their eyes open as to what Fine Gael are doing and those of them who could think a little bit beyond to-day should make their views known so that to-day's bit of dishonesty in public finance should be the end of blatant dishonesty in financial matters. It is bad enough that we are&mdash;by the Minister's statement to-day&mdash;compelled to add £3,750,000 to the national debt next year, but it would be much worse <Col N="104" /> if that matter progressed until, instead of £3,750,000, it might be&mdash;I am talking now of the deadweight national debt&mdash;it might become £9,000,000 £10,000,000, £15,000,000 or £20,000,000. If a modern Government is so minded it can carry out that process.</P>
      <P>I trust that we will not have to debate this thing again and that for the future the Fine Gael Party will live up to its responsibility, which is the responsibility of any Irish Government, to safeguard the finances of the Irish people instead of putting them to ruin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to say a few words on this.  I heard Deputy Aiken talking when the first matter on the Order Paper was introduced by the Minister for Finance and the tenor of Deputy Aiken's complaint at that stage was that the Fine Gael Party and other groups supporting this Government and in particular the leader of the Fine Gael Party, the Minister for Education, had advised the people during the general election that one of the first tasks of a new Government would be to lighten the load, to lighten the burden, and that the Minister for Finance was breaking that undertaking by moving Item No. 3&mdash;I think it was&mdash;or No. 4 on the Order Paper.  The next time I heard Deputy Aiken speaking, he was complaining because the Minister for Finance and the Government had in no uncertain way set about implementing their undertaking to lighten the load.  I think that any Deputy on these benches and indeed most Deputies opposite will feel as I do that the present Government has been elected with a mandate from the people to do their utmost to lighten the load which was imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government, and so far as I am concerned I believe that the Minister for Finance and the Government as a whole deserves to be complimented and congratulated on the initial step they have taken in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was amusing to hear Deputy Aiken talking, using such phrases as &ldquo;throwing money around,&rdquo;&ldquo;going on a spending spree,&rdquo; within half-an-hour of hearing the Minister for External Affairs giving the total of <Col N="105" /> the money spent by none other than Deputy Aiken on the buying of a mansion in Paris for £153,000 odd. Deputy Aiken was the man responsible for that, and Deputy Aiken then talks of &ldquo;spending sprees&rdquo; and &ldquo;throwing money around.&rdquo;  I wonder did he let his mind wander back down the corridors of time even a few years and think of the animal he was galloping around this House some years ago&mdash;Tulyar&mdash;for £250,000, or did he think of any of the other items of expenditure incurred by himself and his colleagues in the last Government. Deputy Aiken refers also and appeals in a very moving voice to the people on this side of the House not to allow the Minister for Finance to impose intolerable burdens on the people.  Did it ever occur to him that, sitting within a few yards of him, was his leader who, two or three years ago, had, in all solemnity, told the people of this country that they were staggering under the weight of taxation, and giving an undertaking&mdash;implied, if not stated in so many words&mdash;that his Government, the Government to which Deputy Aiken belonged, was not going to add to that staggering burden of taxation?  Yet the ex-Minister, who now talks about &ldquo;intolerable burdens,&rdquo; was a member of the Government who immediately after his leader had referred to the people &ldquo;staggering under the burden of taxation,&rdquo; permitted&mdash;not only permitted but by deliberate Government action&mdash;imposed further taxation on the people, taxation both direct and indirect, and taxation which, in any event, the people were not able to avoid paying.</P>
    <P>I think it was the ex-Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who in the last Dáil complained that it was not fair to refer to such things as the increase in wireless licences, the increase in postage rates and so on as taxation, that it was not taxation because the people need not use these facilities if they did not want to.  The fact of the matter is that nowadays these facilities are used as a matter of necessity by practically every section of the people. These were some of the intolerable burdens to which Deputy Aiken should have been directing his attention over <Col N="106" /> the past three years.  It certainly at least calls for comment that in the second day of the new Dáil when Deputy Aiken finds himself in the Opposition Benches that he should so trippingly talk of &ldquo;spending sprees&rdquo; and of &ldquo;throwing money around&rdquo; and of &ldquo;intolerable burdens&rdquo;.  I want to say, as I indicated at the beginning, I have no doubt whatever that the people of this country will look to the present Government to use their best endeavours to lighten the load as the Minister for Education undertook to do when he said it would be one of the first tasks of the Government.  The Government is to be complimented on the steps they have taken already.  I believe that they will continue to have, as they have at the moment, the support of the overwhelming majority of the people, so long as they continue on the road that has been mapped out by them and has been indicated by the Minister for Finance here to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agreed with many people when this Government was formed that one of the best means of vindicating the policy which was pursued by the last Government was to let them have the alternative for a period in order to convince the people of what a good many of them were already aware&mdash;the insincerity of the Parties which now compose this Coalition Government.  Those of us who fought the election and went around the country know what the people expected, and do expect, from the Parties which now form the Coalition Government.  They expect what was implied in their advertisements during the election campaign, that was a complete reversal of the Fianna Fáil policy both with regard to prices and taxation; and they will be the most disappointed people that ever were in this country when they read their papers to-morrow to find that they have been merely given a sop equal to about 1/3 per week per household for all the promises made by the different Parties who came together to form a Coalition&mdash;5d. per lb. off butter without telling the people where the money is to be found.  They have no doubt whatever that it will come out of the pockets of the people themselves. <Col N="107" /> That is the sum and substance of all the promises made and all the bribery that was used to succeed in getting sufficient members to form this Government.  It is the greatest betrayal of the confidence of the people that ever was witnessed and, mark you, an assurance is given that nothing further is going to be done.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has gone out of his way to point out that there will be no Supplementary Budget.  In other words the people can expect no further reductions as a result of Government policy.  That is the reason why I am glad, and every member on these benches is glad, that that Government has come into power, because one of the best means of convincing the people that Fianna Fáil were on the right line and on the straight road is to give them the alternative for whatever length that alternative was capable of remaining in this House.  I have no doubt that there is one thing certain and sure&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Interruptions</i>).  I heard Deputy O'Leary once in my life making a speech in this House and it was a very poor effort.</P>

      <P>I have not in this Chair the authority of the Ceann Comhairle who has been elected to conduct the affairs of this House in an orderly manner, but while I am here I have the responsibility of seeing that order is preserved.  I prefer to do that by co-operation than by regulation, and I appeal to all sides of the House to listen to the debates calmly and to allow the speakers to develop their points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the reason why we are perfectly pleased and absolutely satisfied that the people have got a chance and got the alternative, because we are convinced that when the next opportunity arises to <Col N="108" /> return Fianna Fáil to this House as a Government it will be a simple matter indeed.  We were told about the high price of bread, flour, tea, sugar and the various things&mdash;beer and tobacco. There is not a word about them to-day. They will remain at the same figure. There is an assurance that there will be no further reductions.  There will be no Supplementary Budget to make any further effort to implement all the promises made about these foodstuffs, and the people will to-morrow, when they get their daily papers, be disillusioned and once again realise that they have been fooled on another occasion by all the groups who comprise the members of this Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>As far as we are concerned, we welcome reductions in any foodstuffs, but we would like to be told explicitly from what source the money is to be derived, because if the people are to be saved 1/8 a week it might be a terrible thing if the poorer sections had to contribute maybe 5/- later on towards that reduction.  I wonder if the better-off section of the community has to-day been given a gift of almost £2,000,000?  What is that going to do for the hunger-marching unemployed of Dublin we heard so much about during the past few years?  What benefit is it going to be to the small farmers and the rural community of this country?  That was a very shrewd political move in order to purchase votes of the people in the cities and towns, but it is very poor consolation to the small farmers and the rural community. I think that the people are now being taught a lesson, and it should not now be necessary to teach them a second one.  So far as we are concerned, we will lose no opportunity to expose in this House everything that is a betrayal of what those Parties promised during the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Aiken has already instanced the implied promise in the advertisement which was widely distributed throughout every constituency during the election campaign.  Every single increase in prices was instanced, with the implied suggestion, which the people definitely expected, that on the first opportunity there would be a Supplementary <Col N="109" /> Budget or a complete reversal of the one already brought in, for which an opportunity was presented here to-day; yet the Minister for Finance availed of that opportunity to confirm the proposal already made by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance prior to the dissolution of the Dáil. Now the people will have to wait until they are at some future date once again delivered from a financial mess by a Fianna Fáil Government.  That is exactly what the position amounts to.  On this occasion we hope that when the Coalition have gone as far as they can go, as they did on the last occasion, they will publicly admit that they have brought the country to the brink of financial ruin, and not use any other excuses for the dissolution of the Dáil, so that the people will be clear in their minds as to what the position actually is.  We had three years of the Coalition before, and the Dáil was dissolved without the slightest warning and for no possible reason. We afterwards discovered what the reason was.  The Coalition Government knew that if they had gone on for another year they could never come back into existence in this country again.  We must ensure that when they dissolve the Dáil on this occasion it will be made quite clear to the people that they have gone on as far as they have been able to go and that the real reason for a dissolution is that they have brought the country to the brink of financial collapse.  That is our duty here, and we have an important duty to the people whom we represent.</P>
    <P>The sop of 5d. per lb. off butter, the total thing that Fine Gael and the various Parties who comprise the Coalition have to offer the people, will disillusion them, I hope, once and for all.  As I say, they will now have a chance of considering the Fianna Fáil Government policy by comparison, which perhaps is the most convincing means.  It is not much use pointing the way to the straight road.  I hope that some future Party will have the courage of their convictions to do unpopular things if they lead to the proper development of the country and to the development of a sounder economy. <Col N="110" /> That approach will eventually get over the system whereby immediate appeals are made to the voters to get their support at election time by attracting them without considering what the future is going to bring or what those sops may lead to in the future.  Fianna Fáil will have courage to put before them a long-term policy for the development of the country even though it requires unpopular things to be done at the time.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that the public sometimes lose confidence in politicians generally when they are prepared to play up to the public at election time to the extent of offering them anything and everything for the sake of purchasing votes and, immediately the election is over, pursue any sort of policy they may desire.  I know that the people who supported Fine Gael were definitely expecting a complete reversal of the Fianna Fáil policy. They expected reduced taxes and a general reduction in prices and that they would find to-day a sort of heaven on earth in this country.  They will find out to-morrow that it all boils down to 5d. a lb. off butter, without any indication of the source from which the money is to be derived. They know perfectly well that they must pay for anything they get in the way of subsidies.  They certainly will be a disillusioned people.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the best means by which the people will eventually discover the soundness and the honesty of Fianna Fáil policy is a chance to compare it with what they find in operation as the alternative. That is the reason why we welcome the change of Government.  We know it will make our opportunity to come back, solid, increased in strength and numbers and to take over, as we did before, whatever mess may be left behind.</P>

      <P>The people gave them their answer.  I am very glad to come back as a second Labour Deputy from Wexford, in spite of State cars, in spite of letters sent from the Department of Health to every poor woman in my constituency, asking her about her children and saying how well off they would be under Dr. Ryan.  I came back, and Deputy Corish came back, in spite of slander, in spite of everything that could be used by Fianna Fáil speakers in my constituency.  I, as representing the working-class people of my constituency, am glad to have the announcement made here to-day of a reduction of 5d. a lb. in the price of butter.  That will be welcomed by every housewife in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
      <P>For three years, under Deputy de Valera's Government, we had a high cost of living.  Unemployed marchers in the City of Dublin were lying down on O'Connell Bridge to bring home to the then Taoiseach that there was unemployment. Of course, Fianna Fáil said that the figures were not alarming. The ex-Taoiseach said he did not know how many people emigrated.  They knew the numbers of horses that were exported and the countries to which they went, but they did not know where the human beings went.  They were not interested.  The people gave them their answer in the ballot boxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcomed the election, because, in my constituency, the working-class people, the aged and the poor were the sufferers.  &ldquo;Where would the money come from?&rdquo;  we heard.  Did the present Taoiseach ask this House where would the money come from to pay the Aga Khan for Tulyar?  Fianna Fáil came in here a few weeks ago and told us that C.I.E. were going to balance the Budget.  Where was the £4,250,000 to come from to buy diesel engines from an English contractor? We heard nothing from the Fianna Fáil back benchers on those occasions. We had a ½d.  Budget.  We had the ex-Taoiseach telling the people to keep the straight road.  Yes&mdash;the straight road to emigration of our people and starvation of our old age <Col N="112" /> pensioners, under a Government who, for 20 years, had tricked the people every time an election took place that they were the Republican Party.  Yet, only for the inter-Party Government, in 1948, the Republicans would still be in jail in the glasshouse in the Curragh.  I was glad to be in that Government to release those young Irishmen&mdash;the married men to go home to their wives and families and the sons to their mothers and fathers&mdash;who were held by Deputy de Valera as head of a Republican Government.</P>

We told the people that, if elected, we would support an inter-Party Government. We made no bones about that. What did Fianna Fáil say?  They would not co-operate with anybody. They wanted a dictatorship.  They are now a minority.  It is all very fine for Deputies to attack the Labour Party for being with Fine Gael, to attack Clann na Poblachta or the small farmers' Party for being with Fine Gael.

      <P>We do not know at present what the position is because Fianna Fáil told the people, in their Budget, that C.I.E. would balance it, a company for which this House voted £2,000,000 over a number of years and in respect of which Fianna Fáil allowed taxes to go up and bus fares and train fares to be increased.  Yet we were told by the ex-Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, that C.I.E. would balance the Budget.  That came as a surprise. Everybody wanted to know how it could be done in view of the fact that the House had to subsidise that company for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking as an ordinary member of the rank and file, living in a community of poor people.  I have been in public life since 1934.  The most difficult task of a public man is to try to help his constituents who are living on home assistance and similar low incomes.  That is the hardest job a T.D. has to perform.  Our Dáil work is comparatively easy.  The local duties with which every T.D. is confronted, and the effort to get something for the poor people, are the most difficult part of our work.  Now that we have a Government comprising representatives of Labour, businessmen and farmers, why should Fianna Fáil try to put across every cross-wipe they can to discredit the Labour Party?  They should remember that it was the Labour Party away back in 1932 who helped to elect Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach.  Let us look back over the <Col N="114" /> years.  When the Labour Party was pressing Deputy de Valera at the time to do certain things for the people, what did the then Taoiseach say?  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I cannot get on with these Labour fellows.  I will dissolve the Dáil; I will go to the country and get an over-all majority.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so, but other Deputies were allowed to refer even to the local elections and to the last general election.  Deputy Aiken referred to the last election, and Deputy Brennan also referred to it and to what the people of the country would say.  I think I am quite in order by reminding people on the opposite side of what they said in the past.  However, it is the future I want to look to.  That is what the country is looking to.  There is no doubt that any Government which remains too long in office becomes stale.  Surely when Fianna Fáil spent 20 years in office, they should have done all the things they promised to do, but they did not do these things.  They were, as I say, 20 years in office with a majority.  I think that, in fairness to the new Government, they should receive the co-operation of everybody in this House.  We want to see conditions improved in the country.  We want to see the unemployed taken away from the labour exchanges and provided with work.  We want to see houses provided for the people and the cost of living brought down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the time that Fianna Fáil was in office for the last three years, they brought in over £1,000,000 worth of New Zealand butter.  Did any of that money go to the Irish farmer?  No, it went to the New Zealand farmer. When we came in here before in 1948, what did we find?  We found that the previous Minister for Industry and <Col N="115" /> Commerce, Deputy Lemass, had brought in wheat at the highest price in the world, and the inter-Party Government had to fulfil the obligation of paying for it.</P>

It will be the job of the new Government to put into operation some of the other things that all the Parties on this side of the House promised, such as pensions at 60 for women and at 65 for men.  We welcome that in the Labour Party and I believe it is long overdue. I think that all men should have pensions at 65 and women at 60. Similarly, we welcome any reduction in the cost of living.  We believe that it can be brought about.  We believe that the spending of money on Constellations and on schemes such as the building of the Bray Road, Kilmainham Jail and on new Government buildings should cease.  We believe that all these schemes were nonsense and should not have been introduced by Fianna Fáil.  I often wonder how Deputy de Valera allowed his Party to introduce them.  Please God, with the co-operation we asked for from the people&mdash;the people have given us a good working majority&mdash;we shall be able to carry through our programme. We are here representing all sections of the people, except Fianna Fáil, who can see nobody else's point of view but their own.  We believe that this <Col N="116" /> country can be run more economically. We believe that the unnecessary expenditure incurred for the last three years with the help of certain Deputies who had no authority from the people &mdash;the four Independents&mdash;was not carrying out the wishes of the Irish people and the general election has shown that.</P>
      <P>It is no new thing for me to have to fight a general election.  I have fought five general elections, not to count local elections, and the people I represent sent me back here every time.  I must be satisfying the people of County Wexford, and if I were not I would not be here now.  I know some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies who were here before the last election and their faces are missing from this House to-day. They are gone.  I think that if for the next five years this Government make the progress which they hope to make, Fianna Fáil will be dead for all time.  I say to the Minister that I am delighted, as a working man, that it will be possible for us to broadcast to the country to-night that during the short time we have been in office we have been able to do something for the people we represent by bringing down the price of butter by 5d. per lb.  Please God, the people will be able to buy butter now whereas under Fianna Fáil many of them were able to buy only Stork Margarine for themselves and their children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the statements made by Deputy O'Leary was that now the Labour Party were looking to the future.  The future, at least for the term of this financial year, involves the fulfilment of one of the promises made by the Parties composing the Government.  I refer to the reduction of 5d. per lb. in the price of butter but it is pertinent, for some of the Labour representatives especially, to ask or to get their Ministers in the present Government to ask, what is going to be done about the promises in regard to the price of the loaf?  The price of bread and the price of flour were frequently referred to on platforms during the election compaign, and a guarantee was given by canvassers that the price of these commodities would be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am just wondering what effort was <Col N="117" /> made by the Labour Party to see to it that an immediate reduction will take place in the price of those commodities. There were other promises in respect to the price of drink and the price of cigarettes.  Over the last three years we have had various speakers, especially from the Labour Party, who said, and I thought at the time honestly believed, that unemployment was caused in the brewing and distilling industries by the present high price of drink.  Yet we have a guarantee from the Minister for Finance that in the remainder of this financial year which has just started there will be no reductions on those lines.  We had promises of reduced taxation, but again we cannot see any evidence that in the next eight or nine months taxation will be reduced. As a matter of fact, the announcement made to-day will increase taxation after this financial year&mdash;the payment of the £3,000,000 will mean taxation unless the money is found out of some of the money to be borrowed or to be got otherwise.</P>
    <P>When the people read to-morrow's papers I think they will get a shock&mdash; especially those who gave their votes on the clear understanding that all or at least a major part of the three or four different programmes expounded by the combined Parties who now form the Government would be fulfilled, and when they find that all of those promises amount to what might be regarded as 1/- or ? of a benefit per week to the ordinary householder.  The people will welcome a reduction in food prices, but they will also examine the reduction to find what it means. The change of Government has meant to them, at least for the remainder of the financial year, a benefit of not more than ? per household per week.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is right that the affairs of the country should be bartered in that way.  There may be temptation at election time to do certain things in order to win votes.  Certainly the programme, and the publicity given to the programme by way of advertisements and handbills, has amounted to very little here.  If a poster were got out before the election pointing out to the people that for the <Col N="118" /> coming year they would get the one and only benefit Deputy O'Leary refers to, the benefit of 5d. per lb. reduction in the price of butter, I fear that the Coalition Government would not hold the seats they occupy now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I, in common with pretty well most of the Deputies in this House, irrespective of how they show it, welcome this reduction in the price of butter.  From every election platform throughout the country assurances were given by my Party that one of the points of our programme would be, if we associated with the Government or caused any Government to be put in power, to require a promise that the prices of essential foodstuffs would be reduced to within the means of the ordinary person.  We made that promise here following the 1952 Budget and now that the election is over, there is no reason why we should vary from the promise and assurance we gave the people then.  During our association with other groups we found they were equally in agreement with us that the cost of living was too high.  It was a pleasure to be able to announce, as we did announce in the public papers prior to our being elected, that there was common agreement amongst the Parties that that policy would be implemented.  Here to-day is the first instalment of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure that when I go back to my constituents I will not be treated with the scorn Deputy Cunningham seems to think there will be because butter has been reduced by 5d. a lb.  I will not be able to say that all whiskey and stout and various other things are tumbling down, to-day or to-morrow.  Things will have to be done gradually, but the Labour Party is quite determined, now <Col N="119" /> as it ever has been, that this is but an instalment of the good things that are to come.  No ordinary, sane, commonsense Deputy could expect the Minister for Finance or his Cabinet to plunge in and say suddenly that everything in the other Government is now being changed automatically.  No one with any common sense expects that.  The people know that this is a good instalment, that it is a promise and an assurance to the people that this Government is going to keep the promises made from the several platforms during the election.  The fact that it costs £1,250,000 is significant.  It is a considerable sum to find.  The Labour Party always said they were not too worried as to where the money came from&mdash;we knew there was no section of the community so hard hit as the workers, and if it had to go on to some other section then we were satisfied. We believe, however&mdash;and whether we are right or wrong will be shown in the finances of the next Budget&mdash;that savings can be made that will compensate not only for this but for the other reductions that we hope will follow in times to come.</P>
    <P>It is not butter alone, Deputy Cunningham says, that weighs heavily: the price of bread, we know, is weighing heavily.  Surely no sane Deputy is foolish enough to think that any Government or Minister could examine anything in connection with a reduction in the price of flour or bread until such time as the harvest is taken, until we know what we will get in and what we have to pay out.  That is quite obvious.  I have no hesitation in saying, as a Labour man, that I hope and expect&mdash;and will in time demand, if necessary&mdash;that bread come down to within the means of the ordinary worker, that sugar will come down; but these things have to be done gradually.  We in the Labour Party are in this Government not because Fine Gael and ourselves want to grab office, not because Clann na Talmhan and ourselves want to grab office, but to help the other Parties to run this country in such a way that the ordinary people will be able to live.</P>
    <P>We expect a lot more things than a <Col N="120" /> reduction in the price of bread, butter and sugar.  We want to see employment given, we want to see extravagance stopped and we want to see sane living.  We will be asking and hoping for co-operation from Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and every other group in this country.  I do not want to make any political capital out of it.  I only want to say, in the name of our Party, that as an instalment&mdash;and only as an instalment&mdash;of Labour Party policy and inter-Party policy we welcome the reduction in the price of butter.</P>

      <P>There are a few matters which were referred to by some of the speakers in this Debate that I should like to follow up.  I should like, in particular, to refer to two matters which were mentioned by Deputy M. J. O'Higgins in his speech here to-day.  First, he referred to the recent purchase by the Department of External Affairs of a premises to house our Embassy in Paris.  That arrangement was initiated by the previous Government: I do not know whether or not it was concluded before they left office.  If the purchase was such an outrage and such a gross extravagance from the point of view of expenditure, why have the new Government, instead of approving the matter, not broken up the whole thing and stopped the purchase?</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the present Minister for Finance this question.  If he had been the Minister for Finance, would he have stopped that arrangement to purchase a better premises for our Ambassador and Embassy in Paris? Will it be denied that when the Coalition Government were previously in office a premises was purchased in London for the housing of our Ambassador and Embassy there?  Is it or is it not a fact that a premises was purchased in London for a sum of £200,000&mdash;a premises with a lease of only 40 years&mdash;when Deputy MacBride was Minister for External Affairs?  If so, why was that arrangement permitted by the then Minister for Finance and by several Fine Gael Ministers who were associated with that Government?  It was let through because it was considered, as it was considered in connection with Paris, that the premises that were then in occupation by the Embassy were unsuitable. I understand that some of the rooms in which the staff had to work in Paris were reconstructed stables and that the premises which were offered as suitable premises were purchased on the advice of people who were best qualified to advise in the matter.  That is the position as I understand it.  It is very easy to make political capital out of it.  However, will the Deputy who was Minister for Finance in the Coalition Government explain how it was that a sum of £200,000 was paid for a premises in London, a premises which had a lease of 40 years?  I understand that that sum of money was paid over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins also referred to the purchase of Tulyar by the Board of Governors of the National Stud as an extravagance of the previous Government. I should like to pose this question to the Minister for Finance.  Is it or is it not a fact that not one penny of Government money was spent on the purchase of Tulyar?  Is it or is it not a fact that what the then Government did was to guarantee an overdraft in respect of the National Stud to enable them to purchase Tulyar?  In any event, that is what happened, according as I understand the position: I may be wrong.  Further, since the purchase of <Col N="122" /> Tulyar was referred to, is it not a fact that the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, rose when he was in these Opposition Benches and said that if he had to take the decision he would take a decision similar to that which was taken by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Walsh, when he decided to support the National Stud in the matter of the purchase of that horse?  Is it not also a fact that the Fine Gael Party were divided in their opinion in regard to the purchase of that animal?  I suppose that Deputy O'Higgins is with the opposition in the Fine Gael Party and that his colleague, Deputy Dillon, supports the purchase of that animal.  The propaganda which was made out of that whole incident was unfair, unjust and untrue, and it is time that it stopped.  I should like to ask the Minister for Finance, who represents Kildare&mdash;which is a great racing county, and where the National Stud is situated&mdash;whether or not it is the intention of the Government to tell the National Stud to sell Tulyar.</P>

      <P>I come now to the matter of postage rates, the cost of wireless licences, and so forth.  Is it the intention of the Government to reduce these?  I thought that the present Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he was speaking from the Labour Benches, laid down the principle that the Post Office should pay for itself.  I thought he laid down the principle that the services rendered by the Post Office should pay for themselves and that he supported the increased postage rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that is in keeping with the type of dishonest and mean propaganda made use of by the Fine Gael Party, in particular, in the leaflet they issued about lower taxes, lower prices and better times.  We have an experience of it here to-day in the matter of this reduction of 5d. per lb. in the price of butter.  I understood from all the literature I saw emanating from Fine Gael, and the other Parties, that the price of butter was to be reduced to 2/10; per lb. <Col N="123" />&mdash;the price it was in 1951 before the subsidies were taken off.  I realised that that would cost millions to do and I realised that it would be impossible.</P>

      <P>We realised, as a Government, what it would cost and we realised as a Party what it would cost.  We have been told that there will be a reduction of 5d. per lb. in the price of creamery butter and that news will be welcomed by consumers all over the country: indeed, it will be welcomed by those who produce it and by those who purchase it.  However, the methods by which this position is being brought about are rather dubious.  I understood the Minister to say that, from August next, it will cost £1,250,000.  As I understand it, that sum of £1,250,000 is to be obtained without the imposition of additional taxation: it will be obtained within the framework of the Budget which was prepared by Deputy MacEntee, when he was Minister for Finance, by what the Minister called &ldquo;economies&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's statement also provides for an additional £1,000,000 in respect of the payment of certain moneys to civil servants and other officials who are remunerated out of State funds.  That extra £1,000,000 is also to be found without the imposition of any additional taxation.  Of course, that is welcome news but I hope I will be pardoned if I express the doubt that such money can be found within the framework of the current Budget which, apparently, the Minister intends to work on.  I hope that the Minister's prognostications in regard to the out-turn of the Budget for the present financial year will be realised.  The extra expenditure that is being announced&mdash;£2,250,000&mdash;is a huge sum of money which it is hoped to find by way of &ldquo;economies.&rdquo; Well, somebody will be hit somehow.  Somebody will be hit by the &ldquo;economies&rdquo; or else the financial structure and the financial mechanism will be hit.  Either the people who will suffer from the &ldquo;economies&rdquo; will be hit&mdash;whatever the &ldquo;economies&rdquo; are likely to be&mdash;or else the financial structure and the <Col N="124" /> financial mechanism will be hit if we are to be presented at the end of the year with deficit financing and an unbalanced Budget.</P>
    <P>I should like particularly if the Minister would tell me, in view of the pronouncements of a responsible Deputy like Deputy Michael O'Higgins, who must be regarded as a very responsible member of the Fine Gael Party, whether the Government have decided that Tulyar is to be sold and whether the Government have further decided that the postage rates and the wireless fees are to be decreased to the figure at which they were before they were increased a few years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>As a new Deputy to this House, I must admit straightway that I did find the attitude adopted by the Opposition here to-day on the proposals of the Minister for Finance both bewildering and somewhat amusing, because in my constituency in the City of Cork we experienced during the election campaign an attempt by the then outgoing Government Party to provoke both the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party into a position where they might make rash and wild statements regarding their policy on prices, might make promises that they would find afterwards they might not be able to fulfil.  Serious efforts were made in that connection and then, when the Fianna Fáil Party did not succeed in wresting from the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party in Cork City wild or rash statements on price policy, they dashed into print in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and the <i>Evening Echo</i> and warned the electors of Cork against voting for the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party because, they stated, these people were not promising anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had Deputy Aiken coming into the House to-day and saying that they promised this, that and the other thing&mdash;two most conflicting statements, and I must admit that I find them both amusing and bewildering.  A word used very often by Deputy Aiken in his contribution here to-day was the word &ldquo;honesty&rdquo;.  As a new member, I think I can call myself an honest man, at any rate, and I do believe that this Government and the Parties who <Col N="125" /> joined together to form this Government are honest people and are prepared to carry out an honest policy for the sake of this country.  It illbehoves a spokesman from the Opposition to dwell on honesty or dishonesty when it is a well-known fact that it is on record that the last Fianna Fáil Government deprived civil servants of the full amount of the very just award that was given to them.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the new Minister for Finance making the statement that that debt would be paid in full, because we in the Labour Party accepted that as a State debt and we stated that we would be glad to participate in any Government that would clear that debt.</P>
    <P>When we campaigned during the general election we told the electors that we in the Labour Party were not connected with any other Party, that there were no strings or attachments, but that we were prepared, if the opportunity arose, to join with other Parties to form a Government in an endeavour to bring back sanity to the administration of this country.  We got that opportunity and, as far as the Labour Party are concerned, we took it.  We took the 12-point programme which had been agreed upon by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party and the Leader of the Labour Party back to our ordinary members, as represented by their delegates from the various parts of the country.  That programme was agreed to unanimously by the members of the Labour Party and here to-day, as far as we are concerned, No. 1 point of that programme has been tackled.  I know that as far as the people whom I represent, or try to represent, are concerned they will receive the news of the 5d. reduction in the price of butter with approbation and as an indication of the fact that the policy which the Labour Party pursued and on which they got 19 Deputies returned to this House is a good policy and a policy which they intend to carry out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was interesting to observe the chagrin with which the Opposition Party listened to the announcement of the reduction in the <Col N="126" /> price of butter.  As Deputy Casey has told the House, we of the Labour Party went to the people with a clear-cut policy about which there was no doubt in the minds of the electorate.  We stated that we had a certain programme, and the fundamental plank in that programme, the main objective of our policy, was to improve the standard of living of the ordinary people and to reduce the cost of living.</P>
      <P>It will be remembered by those of us who had an opportunity of listening to the previous Minister for Finance introducing his Budget in 1952 that that Budget was received by the people with astonishment and with horror.  It will be recalled that from that Budget there flowed for the ordinary people of the country hardship, economic want and distress on a scale unknown during the previous 20 years.  Incidentally, I think it will be agreed by the thinking members of the Fianna Fáil Party that from that Budget there flowed the ruin of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The people gave their opinion as to the activities of the previous Administration in no uncertain way.  They indicated that they wanted a reduction in the cost of living and they indicated, too, that they wanted a stable Government, that they wanted a Government which would improve the lot of the ordinary people progressively and over a period and it cannot have gone unnoticed by the present Opposition that the change of Government which came as a result of the election was hailed throughout the country with joy and with celebrations. The first fruits of that change are apparent here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When other speakers were contributing to this debate I noticed the forced laughter of some of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I should like to put this now to the Opposition.  The Opposition during the three years in which they imposed themselves as a Government on this country sought to establish that the economic policy which they were promulgating and the financial policy for which they were responsible were the only ones for this country.  It flows from that that the step which is now being taken by this Government in reducing the price of butter is entirely wrong and unwise <Col N="127" /> and unsound from the viewpoint of Fianna Fáil.  Are the Opposition now going to vote against the reduction in the price of butter?  It will be interesting to see how these people, who like to pose as monuments of consistency in politics, will act on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will play a very vital rôle in this Government and, as has been instanced, they propose to bring about, with the co-operation of the other Parties which form the present Administration, not alone a reduction in the price of butter but, as was specifically stated within the memory of every member here, when the harvest is in and when it is possible to examine the wheat position in this country, in the cost of the loaf.  There will be further approaches made towards a reduction in the cost of living and the cost of the loaf about which Deputy Cunningham showed such belated anxiety will then come before this Dáil for consideration and attention.</P>
    <P>We of the Labour Party told the people that we wanted the essential things brought down in price, that we intended to see them brought down and members of other Parties did likewise. I do not think there will be found in the history of native government so clear an example of prompt action following upon election promises as is evidenced here to-day by the announcement of the Minister for Finance that butter is to be reduced in price by 5d. per lb., and, while members of the Opposition may have looked on that as a subject for levity and perhaps laughter, the people of the country will take a different view. Workers throughout the country, many of whom were misled into voting for members of the Opposition and putting them into this House, will take a different view and will welcome this reduction. I know that in regard to my constituency, and particularly in the very densely populated areas of it such as Ballyfermot, since 1952 it is not incorrect to say that the majority of the people living in these working-class areas have seen very little butter.  They have been forced to exist upon margarine and other substitutes <Col N="128" /> because they could not afford to buy butter at 4/2 per lb.  Any member of Fianna Fáil who is not over-injected with political virus must surely admit that a price of 4/2 per lb. for butter put butter completely out of the reach of working-class people.</P>
    <P>It is proposed now to reduce the price by 5d. per lb., and my hope is that in time, with the progressive development of the economic life of the country, with the increase in employment which will undoubtedly ensue from the change of Government, particularly when we get down to tackle the question of restriction of credit which the previous Government condoned as a result of their acceptance of the report of the Central Bank of some years ago, we will see, I am certain, an infusion of new life into industry.  We will see fewer small industrialists and small employers throughout the country being driven to desperation and in many cases to bankruptcy, as has happened over the past three years as a direct result of the policy of Fianna Fáil.  We will see then a blossoming of the economic life of Ireland and we will see, I hope, a return to the days of the first inter-Party Government when we had more workers in the employment of local authorities than ever before or since, and when we had more workers employed upon the building of houses for the people than ever before or since. There is still an urgent need, particularly in the City and County of Dublin, for the building of houses and the present Government will bend its energies to the solution of that problem.</P>
    <P>It was noted by everybody that when, in 1951, there came a change of administration and when the building drive was at its peak, when people were being provided with houses in every county in Ireland the dead hand of Fianna Fáil, which had grown palsied from being too long resting in office, stopped that drive, brought it almost to a sagging finish, with the result that we were forced back again to the situation which existed in 1947 and early in 1948 when we were exporting our skilled building trade operatives by the hundred to find work in <Col N="129" /> Britain, where, I may say, it was very difficult for them to find work, and when we had many thousands of skilled building labourers with nothing better to do than to sign on at the labour exchanges, particularly in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other big cities.</P>
    <P>We look forward to a change in that situation and the people will judge upon the actions of this Government just as they did the previous Administration upon their actions.  The people have already had ample proof that what we said on the hustings we meant, that we were going to bring down the cost of living.  We have taken the first step along that road to-day and the greatest proof of the disappointment of the Opposition with that step has been the blustering approach of the former Minister for External Affairs. He tried very feebly to make the case, where no ground for a case existed, that this was the end of the effort of this Administration so far as a reduction in the cost of living is concerned. The people, I think, will react to the announcement which will be known all over the country to-night of a reduction of 5d. per lb. in the price of butter in an entirely different way from that envisaged by Fianna Fáil.  There will be wonder that so much could be effected in so short a time by a Government in office for just a couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that Deputy MacEntee, when Minister for Finance, came into the House in 1952 and undid the work of years in a few short sentences by his announcement of the austerity policy of Fianna Fáil.  I do not think the greatest financial wizard the world produced could undo the damage Fianna Fáil did to the economic fabric of this country in an extraordinarily short time.  A very constructive step has been taken in regard to the price of this essential foodstuff and we of the Labour Party welcome it as the first point in our programme which has been put into effect.  Finally, I want again to say that we will be watching with interest&mdash;those of us sitting here who sat on the opposite side for so long and saw the damage being done&mdash; to see if Fianna Fáil will now follow their so-called policy of consistency <Col N="130" /> and vote against this reduction in the price of butter for the worker.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa cupla focal a rá ar an tairiscint atá ós comhair na Dála.  Ba mhaith an rud é dá mb'féidir an toghchán a chur ar siúl arís tar éis an ráitis atá déanta ag an Aire Airgeadais annso inniu.  Tá sé ceart go leor ag Lucht Oibre agus cainnteoirí eile a bheith ag cur a mbarúla i gcionn orainn, anois gurb é an bhrí a bhí leis an gcaint a rinneadar leis na daoine a mhealladh chun a vóta a thabhairt dóibh le linn a toghcháin nach raibh sé in aigne acu na rudaí a ghealladar a déanamh taobh istigh bliain amháin, ach níor dhuradar leis na daoine go mbeadh siad fágtha ar an méir is faide atá acu.  Tá sé soléir ón Aire Airgeadais féin agus ó na cainteoirí eile, fiú amháin an Lucht Oibre, an dream is mó a bhfuil cumhacht acu a tháinig as an gcaint a rinneadar annso gur mar sin atá an scéal anois.  Tá chuile chúis ag an Lucht Oibre a bheith sásta anois mar is iad a chuir an Rialtas isteach. Chaith breis agus 1,300,000 vótóirí a gcuid vótaí sa toghchán, ach níorbh iad siúd a chur an Rialtas seo in oifig ach 700 de lucht an Dream Oibre a tháinig le chéile i mBaile Átha Cliath ar an Domhnach roimh an toghchán chun a shocrú cad é an saghas Rialtas a cuirfí i gcumhacht.</P>
      <P>D'féadfadh an seacht gcéad daoine sin an Páirtí atá ar an taobh seo do chur isteach mar Rialtas dá mba mhaith leo é, ach bhí Fine Gael ag braith ar an seacht gcéad toscairí sin a tháinig le chéile i mBaile Átha Cliath ó gach áit in Éirinn ar an Domhnach roibh an toghchán.  Sin é an saghas &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; a taispeánadh suas sa toghchán seo.  Thug an Teachta Seán Ó Duinn ár ndúlán vótáil i gcoinne laghdú praghas an ime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá Fianna Fáil a rá gur féidir leo an rud seo a dhéanamh agus é a dhéanamh níos fearr ná an Comh-Rialtas.  Ní bheidis sásta fiacha a chur ar an nglúin seo agus ar na nglúin atá le theacht maidir le costas ime agus costas beatha.  Is é leirgas Fhianna Fáil go bhfuil dualgas ar mhuintir na hEireann íoc as rudaí reatha as teacht isteach na bliana.  Tá sé ceart go leor fiacha a chur ar an tír maidir le hoibreacha <Col N="131" /> forbairte ar nós Bord na Móna, Coras Iompair Éireann agus mar sin de.  Bhí Fianna Fáil níos toilteanaí ná dream ar bith eile sa Teach seo airgead a chur ar fáil agus airgead d'fháil ar iasacht le haghaidh na rudaí seo ach ní raibh Fianna Fáil sásta riamh fiacha a chur ar mhuintir na hÉireann maidir le tobac, beoir, im agus a leithéidí.</P>
    <P>Táimid sásta, mar adúirt Taoiseach an Phairtí seo, dul ar ais san bhfreasúra agus seasamh ar an bprionsabal sin agus sin é an fáth go bhfuilimid ar an taobh seo den Teach inniu.  Táimid sasta fanúint anseo agus éireoidh linn arís nuair is soiléir do na daoine nach féidir na rudaí a chur i bhfeidhm atá in aghaidh a chéile lenar mheall Páirtithe an Chomh-Rialtais iad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, I think a great many references were made at least which were not relevant to the issue although they might be related to this question of finance.  I would like again to stress what Deputy Donnchadh <Col N="132" /> Ó Briain said in reply to Deputy O'Higgins with regard to the purchase of an embassy in Paris.</P>
      <P>The figure given by the Minister was £153,000.  It is a strange thing that what was apparently a virtue in the Coalition Government should have been a vice in the previous Government and that they could find and make a good case for the spending of a much larger sum of money, also for an embassy. This is what I cavil at.  During the last few days of the election campaign the present Minister for Finance brought this red herring across the track before it was possible for this Party to reply to it and point out that they themselves had sinned in the same direction and sinned more grievously.</P>
      <P>New Zealand butter is another matter about which we were challenged. As a matter of fact, we did not introduce it.  It was introduced for the first time since native government was established by the Coalition Government.  Again, what was a virtue in the Coalition Government apparently is a sin when approved of by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party are entitled to the utmost attention in all their pronouncements in this present Parliament for the reason that although 1,300,000 cast their votes in the election to elect all the Deputies it required a conference of 700 Labour delegates to decide what sort of Government we were going to have.  They could have decided that Fianna Fáil was to be the Government just as well as Fine Gael.  For that reason, I take it that the Labour influence in the course of events for the duration of this present Parliament will be a vital one.  In that respect it is as well, perhaps, to point out that a Labour Deputy has been made Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We remember that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce expressed the opinion, when he was a Minister on a former occasion, that the business people and the manufacturers of this country robbed and rooked the people and that they had made enormous profits.  He is now Minister for Industry and Commerce and has, therefore, been given the responsibility <Col N="133" /> of reducing prices and seeing that no unfair profits are made.  One of the main hopes of the Coalition for the reduction of prices is the question of tackling the profits of business people and industrialists&mdash;that, taken with a statement made by the Minister for Finance that they hope by the elimination of waste and extravagance to find the moneys necessary to finance reductions in prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister could not very well say so early as this whether it was intended to apply any extra taxation seeing that one of the great appeals to the electorate was that not only would they increase all sorts of social welfare benefits and restore subsidies but also bring down the cost of government. When it comes to an examination of waste and extravagance in government, I do not think any Minister, not even the Minister for Finance himself, will be able to disemploy any very large proportion of his staffs.  If he does not do that either by immediate dismissal or the termination of the employment of temporaries or the stopping of recruitment, I do not see how he can make any savings in this connection. My own experience was that some of these offices are, in fact, understaffed.</P>
    <P>This reference to extravagance and waste brings one's mind back straightway to services such as Defence.  I am sure Deputies from the Government side know as well as we do that the economies indicated in this reference to waste and extravagance really mean that the economies are to be effected very largely in the Army and that the strength of the Army is to be reduced; the Guards have also been mentioned in that connection.  One naturally asks what will happen to the men who are at present in the Army.  Will they be put on the unemployment register, and, therefore, have to be provided for from another Government source?</P>
    <P>We feel that the Coalition have not, either in the 1948 or 1951 election, been honest with the electorate.  Prior to the 1948 election they announced that they accepted the award made by the Arbitration Tribunal in respect of the pay of public servants.  That acceptance <Col N="134" /> involved a commitment of over £3,000,000 but there was no provision made in the Budget to find that money. A somewhat similar deception was practised on this occasion, when the back money of £1,000,000 was promised two days before polling took place at a time when the rural part of the country had no time to examine it.</P>
    <P>This reference to the rural part of the country tempts me to follow some other Deputies in alluding to the election results.  One would imagine from what has been said that Fianna Fáil had been completely wiped out in this last election.  My own constituency has the largest urban area west of the Shannon and in its agricultural parts there is little or no tillage land.  That is a constituency of a type in which one would expect the appeals made by the Coalition to have a very great effect, but when the results were known it was found that the Coalition poll dropped considerably there.  An examination of the results will show that, outside Dublin and Cork, Fianna Fáil lost one seat only.  The appeal made, particularly by the Labour Party and, indeed, by the Fine Gael Party in their pamphlet on prices is one that was bound to get the housewives' vote in Dublin and Cork City.</P>
    <P>I have heard many Fianna Fáil people saying that if the Coalition could carry out the programme which they outlined to the public and upon which they got their votes, they would deserve to remain in office for all time and Fianna Fáil would deserve, in the words of one of the Deputies this evening, to fade out completely.  But the people did not vote for a reduction of 5d. a lb. in butter and for the payment of £1,000,000 of back money on the Kathleen Mavourneen system.  The civil servants, I believe, have all made out to the last shilling what each of them is to get out of this £1,000,000 back money and now they are told to-day by the Minister for Finance that it may be paid before the end of the financial year.  Does not everybody who took part in the election, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour, know that the public were led to believe in no uncertain terms that a Supplementary Budget would be introduced as soon <Col N="135" /> as Fianna Fáil were put out, that the subsidies would be restored in full and that the promises contained in the pamphlet issued by Fine Gael giving the scale of 1951 and 1954 prices would be fulfilled in this financial year?  Let them go back now to the people whom they canvassed and whose statements were repeated to us by those same people whom we canvassed after them, and let them say: &ldquo;We did not really intend cigarettes to come down to 1/8 this year.  It may happen before our five years are up.  We did not really expect the pint to come down to 1/- this year.  All we meant was that instead of bringing the butter down to 2/8 a lb. we would bring it down by 5d&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I said in Irish I would like this election to be fought again now and fought on the basis of the statement made this afternoon by the Minister for Finance.  I am quite satisfied that if we had an election now on that basis, Fianna Fáil would get a majority greater than any Party ever had in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to intervene in this debate as I am one of the new boys but a reference was made by the previous speaker to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and that is what brought me to my feet.  For many years I was chairman of a branch of the Federated Union of Employers and it is my belief that Deputy Norton will make a very good Minister for Industry and Commerce. I regret on this my second day in the House having had to listen for the second time to the suggestion being made by the Opposition that there is something undesirable about Deputy Norton as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am confident that Deputy Norton will bring to that Department a new conception of what that Department should mean.  It is a Department that should represent three distinct and important sections of our people: first, the employer, manufacturer or industrialist; second, and very important, the worker; and third, but more important than any of them, the consumer.  I feel sure that the two sections which have not been sufficiently <Col N="136" /> regarded in the past will receive attention in the future.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the debate this evening, I am not quite sure whether the Opposition are grumbling because things are done or because things have not been done.  I understand we can afford to take this 5d. off the lb. of butter and it will be of great benefit to do so.  With regard to the points raised by various speakers in relation to the purchase of an embassy in Paris by the last Government and the purchase of an embassy in London by the inter-Party Government, and so on, none of us would object very much to these things provided there was an even policy: the objection arises when these things are done at a time when those who are so badly off are denied all relief.  It is that that causes irritation amongst the people generally and it is that that has put the previous Government on the Opposition Benches to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not expect this Financial Resolution to be moved to-day. During the debate on the Budget in April last there was very strenuous opposition from both Fine Gael and Labour.  It was pointed out by the Opposition then that at the first available opportunity they would alter in the main the financial provisions of the Budget.  It is rather extraordinary that the very first Resolution moved here to-day is one accepting <i>in toto</i> the financial provisions of the Budget. One would have thought the Minister for Finance would have come in here to-day with a new Budget and a new alignment of policy adumbrating reduced taxation.  After all, they asked the people to vote for reduced taxation within the last few weeks and from that point of view I think the first act of the most important Minister in the Government, after the Taoiseach, can be regarded as a dishonest act, because he is now asking the House to accept taxation to the tune of £104,000,000 or £105,000,000. He has not sought to alter the Budget of his predecessor in any particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He did state that he proposes to subsidise the consumption of butter.  I assume the Minister proposes to pay a <Col N="137" /> subsidy of 5d. per lb. on butter available for export in addition to that consumed at home.  It is estimated that on present production figures that will cost, roughly, £2,600,000 a year.  That will be additional taxation over and above the £105,000,000 for which provision was made in the Budget last April.  I think that is an honest way to interpret the Minister's proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is June; we will wait until next April and time will prove whether my figures or some other figures are substantially correct. We will know then whether or not it will cost £1,000,000 to subsidise at the rate of 2½d. or 1d. per gallon.  The Minister says he does not propose to pay any of this subsidy on the production of farmers' butter.  I am sure the Government has carefully considered that and I am sure it is appreciated that there is a considerable amount of farmers' butter on the market at this time of the year.  The present proposal will mean an immediate reduction of 5d. per lb. on an already lowpriced agricultural product.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Government will provide a pool as was done by the Fianna Fáil Government when a subsidy was paid on that butter in 1951. I think a subsidy was paid by the Coalition Government for a short time, too, on the export of farmers' butter.  I am sure the Minister and the Government would not wish to do anything that might seriously affect the interests of a fairly substantial section of the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister and his colleagues to turn up the speeches they made a few weeks ago on the Budget introduced here by Deputy MacEntee, then Minister for Finance. I would like them to refresh their minds on the statements they made during the recent election and the promise they gave that, if they were returned as a Government with the aid of the Labour Party, they would substantially reduce taxation.  This is the Minister's first opportunity but he should, after a fortnight in office, have been able to reconstruct the Budget. <Col N="138" /> There was nothing to prevent him doing that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must think I am a great man if he thinks I would be able to do that in a fortnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There was nothing to prevent the Minister doing that.  We read in the daily papers during the last fortnight that the Minister was sitting during the night with wet towels wrapped round his head probing into finance and seeking, I suppose, where he might find money being misspent.  He and some of his colleagues said there was plenty of fat in the recent Budget.  I wonder did he find any of that fat.  It would appear he did not.  Had he done so he would have given the taxpayers immediate relief as he and his colleagues promised.</P>
      <P>It is all-important from every point of view that the Government should from the beginning set out on a path of honesty.  The Government should try to be honest with the people.  If words mean anything, or statements, or promises, it would look as if the Minister and the Government are breaking faith with the people at the very first opportunity by accepting the Fianna Fáil Budget and the taxation imposed thereunder.  We remember the circulars sent round pointing out that in 1951 income-tax was only 6/6 in the £; it is now 7/6.  I am sure Deputy J. Larkin would be delighted to help his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to bring back income-tax to 6/6.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin campaigned for that.  I have no doubt he will use his influence to table a motion here reducing income-tax to 6/6 in the £.  Deputy Larkin and the Labour Party were very interested in the excess profits tax.  It was never high enough for them.  Now, they appear to have accepted the policy of reducing it.  Certainly they are accepting the present rate of excess profits tax.  It is true the Government intends to reduce the price of butter by 5d. per lb.  Does the Minister propose to finance our friends across the water to the extent of 5d. per lb. on the export market to <Col N="139" /> help them to consume our butter?  That may be good policy, especially when you are likely to have a considerable surplus of butter as we are this year. Our people are said to be, after New Zealand, the second highest consumers of butter in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>They can afford to buy it now and to use more of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so.  I suppose that the average family buys between three and four pounds of butter in the week. If they are able to buy more of it all the better.  I am afraid, however, that the extra consumption of butter which Deputy Morrissey expects as a result of reducing the price is bound to be small in view of the fact that already our people are said to be the second highest consumers of butter in the world.  I hope that our people will be able to buy all the butter we can produce. The extra production of butter that we have is due to the sound policy that was pursued by the Minister for Agriculture in the Fianna Fáil Government. Production went up considerably as a result of his policy.  We hope that is not going to prove an embarrassment to this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not yet heard from the Minister for Finance, or from his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, whether or not the Government have received the report of the body that was appointed to investigate production costs.  We should like to know if it has reported and, if so, what are its findings.  Now that we have opened up again on the subsidisation of an agricultural product, we should like to hear what the future liability will be on the Exchequer, in the matter of subsidy, if production is to continue at the present rate or if there is an increase in the coming year.  Will it be possible, in that event, for this Government to grant other reductions in the cost of living?  Will it be possible, for example, to reduce the price of tea, sugar and other commodities? I hope that the Minister for Finance will be able, out of the fat that is in this Fianna Fáil Budget, to reduce not only the price of butter but of tea, bread, and sugar, and other <Col N="140" /> important items such as beer and tobacco which were very popular during the recent election.  There are a great number of people who would like to see the price of beer going down.  We would all like to see it going down because, I suppose, it would be cheaper and the people who drink it would enjoy it the more.  If, out of the fat of this Fianna Fáil Budget, the price of beer and tobacco can come down then the more popular this Government will become.  It is our desire on this side of the House to see this Government as popular as possible.  The way that they can become popular is by carrying out in full, and at the earliest possible opportunity the promises they made during the recent election.  We all remember the circulars that were printed in blue, indicating the various commodities that would be brought down in price.</P>

    <P>We shall also await with interest to see what the Government will do in regard to the sum of £250,000 that was paid for Tulyar.  During the election the Labour Party campaigned to have the horse sold at once.  I do not know if the Government have decided on that yet.  If it has been decided to sell the horse, that will be bringing <Col N="141" /> some more money into the Government coffers.  While that was the Labour Party policy, I doubt very much if it is the policy of the Minister for Finance because I think he approved of the purchase of that horse and so did his constituents.  So did the constituents of the Tánaiste. Whatever about the Tánaiste himself, his colleagues, the back benchers and some of the front benchers in the Labour Party, did not approve of the purchase.  I definitely heard more than one Labour speaker during the recent election campaign very heavily about the price of Tulyar.  It was said that one of the first actions of the new Government, if it got in with the support of the people, would be to sell Tulyar and give the money to the poor.</P>

      <Col N="142" /> I am sure that the Minister for Finance is getting fond of this Fianna Fáil Budget.  He must be, because he is asking the House to honour it to-day. He will have no trouble about that because there is complete unanimity in all parts of the House that it was a sound Budget, even though it was said that it was an austere Budget.  Whatever may have been said about its austerity, we now find that there is complete unanimity in the House upon this fact, that it was a good, sound Budget.  This good, sound Budget of Fianna Fáil is now accepted <i>in toto</i> by this new Coalition Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few things I would like to say before the Minister replies.  I take it the Minister's statement was to the effect that the Government is going to operate the Budget as it was brought in by our Minister for Finance, that there is to be no Supplementary Budget and that the finances of the State are, therefore, to be based on that Budget and that when, at the end of the year, we come to examine the position we will find ourselves either with a surplus or a deficit according as the Estimates in that Budget have been proved correct or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget, when it was brought in, was criticised on certain grounds.  One of the grounds on which it was criticised was that we were expecting too much&mdash;in order to get a balance we were expecting too much&mdash;in the way of savings, that we had expected savings of a lesser amount in a previous year and that these were eaten up by Supplementary Estimates.  This year we made provision, according to my recollection, for about £750,000 for Supplementary Estimates, and if there was any truth in the contention that we were allowing too much for savings the moment that the Minister for Finance brings in a Supplementary Estimate for the butter subsidy he will immediately have exceeded the amount provided for Supplementary Estimates in the Budget.  That amount was £750,000, and I think he wants for this subsidy £1,250,000.  It is obvious, therefore, that we have exceeded the <Col N="143" /> amount provided in the Budget for Supplementary Estimates.</P>
    <P>We are naturally anxious to find out where the money is to come from. Where are the extra savings?  I think it is the Minister's duty to indicate where these savings are likely to arise. This, after all, is a Budget discussion and we would like to be told where the Minister expects to find these savings which will enable him to increase the provision that has been made for Supplementary Estimates.  He has not done that.  When he was talking of the relative values of butter from the point of view of health as against certain health benefits I was inclined to agree to a large extent with him. I think that the foundation of health is good food.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all disposed to say that butter is not one of these good foods.  I would like to know from the Minister does he propose therefore to make the savings on the health services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>We were waiting for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>And why should we not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite worthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite worthy. This is a financial discussion and we are entitled to know&mdash;it is our duty as an Opposition to see to it that we do know&mdash;how the finances of the country are to be run in the coming year.  The Minister has indicated that he has put in comparison the health services and butter and I am inclined to agree that if I had to choose in certain circumstances I might choose butter but I could not have both, under the Budget as we have it, and I want to know&mdash; and I think we are entitled to know from the Minister&mdash;is it from that source he intends to get the necessary money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems we are dealing with here in this country are not dissimilar to problems that had to be faced in other countries and if there was an <Col N="144" /> easy solution to these problems it would have been found long before this.  The Taoiseach, during the recent elections, on one occasion gave expression to quite a number of very good fundamental principles.  One of the principles he mentioned was that it was useful to educate the public to a recognition of the fact that the benefits they were supposed to get were simply promises by politicians to take their money from them and spend it for them.</P>
    <P>I hope he had that very important consideration in mind when he was giving his assent to this reduction in the price of butter by way of subsidy. The money has to come from somewhere. Is it to be got by borrowing? If not, it has to come, we take it, within the four corners of the Budget that has been presented to the House. We are entitled to ask where within the four corners of that Budget you are to get the extra amount required. That amount will not merely exhaust the amount provided for supplementaries but it will go considerably&mdash; £500,000&mdash;beyond it.  Where is this £500,000 to come from?  I hope, when the Minister is replying, he will give some indication of where this £500,000 is to be got.</P>
    <P>The next thing that is of importance applies to the future.  Is the Government embarking on a general policy of subsidisation of food?  Undoubtedly by subsidising food you can reduce the cost to the individual householder of the food, but it was pointed out to us when we brought in, in 1947, an Estimate providing for subsidies, that when the family balance sheet was made out and when the extra taxes were put up against the advantages that were derived by the family from the subsidies these subsidies had to be bought dearly.  We tried to point out at that time that it was better to subsidise an essential article such as bread at the expense of the pint but we were met&mdash;by the Labour Party particularly&mdash;in all parts of the country with the complaint that we were increasing the price of the pint.  If it were possible to do these two contradictory things at once&mdash;increasing subsidies <Col N="145" /> and lowering taxation&mdash;a solution would have been found in other countries.  We cannot do it and you cannot.  You will not be able to meet the expenditure provided for this coming year&mdash;you will not be able to meet that on existing rates of taxation, according to the Estimates, anyhow. Were the Estimates wrong? Has the Minister, during his period in office found, or have any of his advisers told him that the Estimates were wrong; that we were overestimating revenue?  That was not the position as it was explained to us.  We were as anxious, as every political Party is, to give all the reliefs that it was possible to give and at the same time do the nation's business properly.</P>
    <P>My fear in this matter is that, as always happens, we rush at once to provide benefits and never think of how the money is to be got and whether the community is better off when we, the politicians&mdash;to use the Taoiseach's phrase&mdash;are allowed to spend the people's money or when the people are allowed to spend it themselves. That is a fundamental question which has to be faced in every Parliament where there is a question of subsidy.</P>
    <P>We will have another occasion on which we can talk on this question of subsidies and especially on the subsidising of butter.  My only point at this stage is to know, seeing that it is to be Government policy that money is to be given for subsidies&mdash;where is the money to come from?  That is my question.</P>
    <P>I would like to say this, too.  As far as our attitude in this House is concerned&mdash;we are here to do the nation's work just as much as the people on the opposite benches and it is from that point of view we are approaching our work here.  We are here to examine every proposition.  The examination of the proposition is not obstruction.  When you examine a proposition home and when you demand from those who are the executives information as to the basis on which they take certain actions, you can, of course, be represented by them as obstructing.  That is not the spirit <Col N="146" /> in which we are approaching our work here.</P>
    <P>There is another thing I would like to say, and I will finish with it.  We have learned about a false oath, that those who take it sinned in taking it but that they also sinned in keeping it.  The Government Parties having made, as we believe, false promises to the electorate, we are not going to force them to a still bigger crime against the country, that is, the keeping of the false promises.  The position as far as we are concerned is a simple one&mdash;that we can do our duty to the country on this side of the House just as well as on the other.  We have not the power that we would have on the other side of the House.  The only power we have is to examine critically and to do our best to get the Government to follow right methods and when they are following wrong methods to expose them.</P>
    <P>I should like to say also that democracy has its faults, but it is for us the best form of Government we yet know of.  My own belief is that there is only one safeguard for democracy, and that is an intelligent electorate.  Until we have an intelligent electorate which will criticise carefully promises made to them at election times mistakes will be made and undesirable results follow.  It is useless to complain.  We must only try and hope to educate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to watch the behaviour of Fianna Fáil in this House when they are in Government and in Opposition.  When they are in Government it is remarkable how tight a uniformity they can maintain between members of the front benches and the other benches, and it is very seldom that you find contradiction between statements made by their several members.  But as soon as they go on the Opposition Benches they seem to go riot.  Many will recall that after the change of Government in 1948 we had the same phenomenon that we have had here to-night. I recall on that occasion Deputy Lemass and Deputy Childers, taking two completely opposite contradictory lines as to whether we had inflation or deflation.  That, of course, <Col N="147" /> may appear as being the result of the sudden change in their position&mdash;a certain, if you like, lack of balance because of the disturbance that has taken place.  It might also be regarded as a very clever manoeuvre, adjusting itself to all the winds of chance and to the varying opinions of the country.  We have exactly the same thing here to-night.</P>
      <P>We have listened to one of the semihumorous speeches of Deputy Allen in which his heart overflowed with concern for the ordinary electorate and his desire to ensure that all the promises which he stated were made by members of these benches will be fulfilled.  One by one he has gone through the list, right down to his beloved racehorse, Tulyar, for which he had such a great regard when he was sitting on these benches, and he insists not merely on a reduction in the price of butter but a reduction in the prices of bread, sugar, tea, beer, cigarettes, and, in fact, all the commodities that he can happen to think of.  Possibly one thing he forgot was the Paris Embassy.  He wants all the promises fulfilled and he wants to lay the ground now for taking political advantage of what he sees as a situation that can react to the advantage of his Party.  So he plays the ordinary cross-roads politician's rôle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then up gets Deputy de Valera.  He is the leader of a serious, responsible Opposition.  The Opposition is not merely the opposing Party, it is part of the structure of this House.  This House cannot function without a responsible Opposition, and it is the conviction of Deputy de Valera that his Party, not merely by weight of numbers but by its status in the country and, above all, by its experience, is going to provide that responsible Opposition.  So in his speech&mdash;again a very clever speech&mdash;he takes the line that if the Parties in the Government at the present moment have made the mistake of committing themselves to promises which cannot be kept, or, as he says, taking a false oath, God forbid that Fianna Fáil will press them to try to keep those promises.  Who are we to follow?  Deputy Allen or <Col N="148" /> Deputy de Valera?  Deputy Allen wants the Government to keep their promises, and he is not very much concerned as to whether they were well-founded or a practical proposition or where the finances necessary to meet them can be provided. Deputy de Valera, on the other hand, is most anxious particularly that the Minister for Finance will not make the mistake of trying to give effect to promises which, in the opinion of Fianna Fáil, have got no substance, no foundation, and cannot be carried out. So that, as far as Fianna Fáil is concerned, they will cater for what they feel is the opinion among a certain section of the people who will want the fulfilment immediately and without any qualification or equivocation, of promises which Fianna Fáil allege were given during the course of the election campaign.  On the other hand, the responsible section of Fianna Fáil, represented by Deputy de Valera, says: &ldquo;God forbid that we should ask the Government to get into difficulties by trying to carry out promises which quite clearly are not possible, and we would prefer that they would act in a responsible manner, listen to our criticism and take our advice.&rdquo;  That is typical of all the contradictory statements we are now going to get from Fianna Fáil in opposition, from this day on.  It will be interesting to those of us who have had the same experience during the years 1948 to 1951, when it was quite clear that, so far as policy was concerned, Fianna Fáil had completely run riot and had lost any sense of stability or uniformity, particularly when you had such leading exponents on economic policy in Fianna Fáil as Deputy Lemass and Deputy Childers openly contradicting each other here in the House on fundamental issues at that time.</P>
    <P>Whether they have reconciled their views or not I do not know.  Whether Deputy Childers has now been replaced by Deputy MacEntee as being the opposing pole is something that many of us have been interested in for the last two or three years.</P>
    <P>Another interesting point in Deputy de Valera's remarks is that in speaking of the reduction in the price of butter and the need for additional <Col N="149" /> subsidy he quite properly puts the query as to where the additional money will be found.  He points out that there has been provision in the Budget for savings to the extent of £750,000 and that in addition £500,000 will be saved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>When he asked the question where the money will be got he seemed to be somewhat hurt when that question has not been given an answer.  May we point out that on this very Budget which is the basis of this discussion, when those Parties on this side of the House were then sitting on the other, we asked the straight, simple question, where the savings of £4,000,000 in the Budget were being found, but we got no details, nor did we even get details of the alleged saving of £3,000,000 in last year's Budget.  Granted that an Opposition is entitled to ask questions, that every member of the House, whether he is on the Opposition or the Government side, is so entitled, there is a limit to the type of question to be asked; and if information is sought by members of the Opposition a few months ago in respect of savings in this year's Budget, that is airily waved aside and we are asked merely to accept the statement of the then Minister for Finance.  It seems to be peculiar for the members of that same Party now to come along and want exact details of a matter of £500,000. All these matters show the approach we are going to get now from Fianna Fáil. Everything they did is perfect.  Everything they want to have acceptance of in principle has to be accepted without question, but when the circle turns they want a different attitude adopted and what they have denied to other people, now they want conceded to them as a right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other specific point that I want to touch upon.  Deputy de Valera says that if there was an easy way of solving this problem of providing additional benefits, social benefits, subsidies, and so on, to the masses of the people without having to impose additional taxation&mdash;if there was <Col N="150" /> an easy course, quite clearly Governments in many other countries would have followed that particular course, and that this problem can be resolved into the simple question as to whether it is more beneficial for the members of the community to spend their own money or to have it collected from them and spent on their behalf by the State.  He puts the question in that form.  Might I suggest that it should be put in another form, and that is whether it is right and proper that the section of the community who have got no income or little income to spend of their own, who have insufficient income to meet the necessities of life, should not be assisted by the State by means of drawing off excessive surplus income from the other sections of the community who have got too much to spend?</P>
    <P>I recall, on occasions, members of the Fianna Fáil Party, when they were the Government, expressing the view that both social services and subsidies had got a social purpose, that was, to try to secure a more equal distribution of the available national income related to the real needs of the people.  If that is the case, it does mean something more than whether the community spends its own money or whether it is spent for it by the State.  In this case it was a question of the State performing and carrying out a social duty.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in so far as the basic foods are concerned, which are the staple diet of the majority of working-class families, in cities, towns and the countryside, the problem for them is a question to-day of securing sufficient income to provide themselves with adequate quantities of these basic foods.  If it is wrong for this or any other Government to take measures to enable these poorer sections of the community to buy a greater quantity of these foods, then we have got a peculiar sense of our social obligations.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party, when they were the Government, pursued a certain course in regard to social services; they pursued a certain course in regard to subsidies.  The only difference I see to-day is that at a certain point they changed that course. <Col N="151" /> We, now, are of opinion that that change was ill-advised, was unnecessary and brought hardship on the people and that we should try to get back as far as we can on to that regular course.  To do that, it is not a question, as I say, of the whole of the community spending its money rather than the State spending its money; it is a question of what are the relative amounts the different sections in the community have got to spend on their essential needs.  The opinion on these benches is that, so far as basic foods are concerned, there is not sufficient money, not sufficient income, in the pockets of the poorer sections of the community to meet their needs in essential foods to-day and that it is, not merely a social duty, but good national policy to try to adjust again the course of Government policy to meet the needs of this great section of the community as a whole. That is something which I think will meet with general acclaim outside.</P>
    <P>So far as Deputy Allen's view and comments are concerned with regard to the other foodstuffs&mdash;we know it is desirable, from his point of view, that the price of butter should be reduced &mdash;I do not think they matter very much.  I do not think his opinions will count very much one way or the other. As far as the mass of the people outside are concerned, the projected reduction in the price of butter will be regarded as it is intended to be, as an indication of good faith and of earnestness on the part of the present Government to try to the limit of its power to again bring back and place within the reach of the mass of people these essential foods that were increased so radically through the policy of Fianna Fáil in 1951-52.</P>
    <P>That, I think, will be welcomed. The people will appreciate that it is something which is being done with expedition and despatch.  They will understand that it is the first step and that other steps will follow and they will, no doubt, be much more clear than Fianna Fáil is to-day as to why the present Government has not taken steps to make changes in regard to the Budget they have inherited.  The average man in the street will say: <Col N="152" />&ldquo;If they have taken over a pretty bad mess, naturally, they must have time to have a look at it and I am quite prepared to have patience and grant them that time, and can expect, in due course, that the things they told us during the election campaign will come to pass, that they will on their own behalf and on behalf of the Parties forming the present Government, give effect, not to the promises that were given&mdash;because promises were not given&mdash;but to the commitments that were entered into to try to adjust the policy of the Government as a whole in a different direction from that which was pursued by Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to comment on that policy as a whole, but I do want to say that when Deputy de Valera says that the change that took place in the attitude of Fianna Fáil towards the question of subsidies was one that was necessitated by the situation in this country, I have never been convinced of that, I am not convinced of that to-day, but I am convinced that that change was the outcome of a view in regard to the general economic and social course being pursued in the country at that time and a feeling which was very sharply expressed in publications outside this House and even in the course of contributions to debate in this House, that there had to be a drastic change in the whole financial policy of the Government, whether it be Fianna Fáil or any other Government, and that those in this country, who, as we quite well know, call the tune in so far as financial policy is concerned, decided that there had to be a change and a change took place and, as we have had indicated in debates over the last two years, we are now facing the problem, as it presents itself to this Government or to the Fianna Fáil Government or any other Government, that is, that we have reached the point in development of this country, both economic, industrial and social, where this House and the Seanad, being the nationally elected assemblies of the Irish people, have got to decide, either now or in the immediate future, whether this elected assembly is going to determine the financial and, thereby, the social <Col N="153" /> and economic policy of this country or whether it is going to be imposed upon us from outside this House by elements that have not got any national responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Would Deputy Larkin tell us how this question of subsidies fits in with the question of reduced taxation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful indeed to the Fianna Fáil Party for the very many tributes they have paid to this Government.  They seem to think that in a fortnight we can dispose, according to Deputy Bartley, of the difficulties that were embarrassing the last Government or taking a considerable time for the last Government in regard to the solution of the Marshall Aid Grant Counterpart Fund.  According to Deputy Allen, we are able within the same fortnight to solve the difficulties and to ensure that the Milk Production Costings Committee produce their report and, according to many Deputies on the other side, within a fortnight, the Government and I would be able to produce an entirely new Budget.  If they were sincere or truthful in any of these things, they were certainly paying us a great tribute because we must indeed be wondermen if we could do all of these things within the period of a fortnight.</P>
      <P>The fact, of course, is that if there is not a new Financial Statement in its entirety presented to this House to-day, it is because of one thing alone, because Deputy de Valera, when Taoiseach, would not go to the country in March, when he was asked to do so by the present Taoiseach.  If he had done that, there would have been ample time for whatever Government that came in to bring in financial proposals at the proper time of the year and in sufficient time to have those proposals operative during this financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position so far as this Government is concerned is that it will have been in power exactly one fortnight to-morrow.  During that time we have been engaged in examing various <Col N="154" /> matters.  I am not proposing to-night to go into detail on them at all, but I will say that, so far as we are concerned, we are quite satisfied that we will be able to produce savings that the previous Government would not have produced to meet the concession that has been given to-day in respect of the price of butter.  If there is instability otherwise, it is because of the Budget which was introduced by my predecessor and which, as I say, we could not, in a fortnight, possibly examine to ascertain its fullest commitments. We must at this stage take many of the statements made in respect of it at their face value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated, and I repeat, that we are satisfied that we can make savings that the previous Minister was not going to make and that when the out-run comes at the end of the year, it will be quite clear that we shall be able to make those savings.  The position also, as regards the last question which Deputy de Valera asked of Deputy Larkin, is that he apparently does not appreciate the difference between what we have stated and the interpretation he wants to put on it.  We never said that we were going to reduce taxation, but we said that we were going to reduce taxes, and there is a very big difference &mdash;a difference which, incidentally, I made it my business to make quite clear at almost every meeting at which I spoke during the election campaign, as members of the Opposition could ascertain, if they wished to do so, by asking their colleague from County Kildare, just as during the election campaign, not once, but many times, I made quite clear my view that I considered the primary commodity in regard to the cost of living was the commodity with which we have dealt to-day&mdash;butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I shall go in any detail into the matters raised by the various Deputies but inasmuch as Deputy Bartley mentioned my name specifically in regard to the Paris Embassy, let me just say a short word about it. Deputy Bartley said that I made a comment on it during the general <Col N="155" /> election campaign.  I did not.  I made the comment on it after the results all over the country, other than those from County Wicklow, had made it clear that the previous Government was going out of office.  My comment particularly was that the previous Government had endeavoured to hide it.  What are the facts?  The facts are simple. The contract was entered into in the first case on the 30th March last, that is to say, approximately some seven weeks before the general election, that on the 14th May, four days before the general election, the contract was finally concluded and the result was that until after the general election, after the people had registered their verdict there was no notification of its acquisition in the public Press.  My complaint then against Fianna Fáil and my complaint against them to-day is that they deliberately hid it from the people because of the effect that they believed it might have on the general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Aiken, when he was speaking, started off on the line as if the Fianna Fáil Party had never heard of any debt in the years in which they were in office.  What are the facts?  The facts are that if we make a comparison between the years 1953-54 and 1950-51 the amount that was required last year&mdash;not the amount required this year, which is more&mdash;for the service of the public debt was £12,696,835, while in the year 1950-51 the amount required for the same purpose was £7,223,690.  In other words, the amount required for the service of public debt for the last of the three years for which the Fianna Fáil Government was in office was £5.4 millions greater than it had been in the year ending 5th April prior to the time at which they acceded to office in 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is <Col N="156" /> exposing the insincerity of the principal speaker put up in this regard by the Opposition Benches.  There is no use in Deputy Aiken making that type of speech to-day when the facts are as I have stated.  I am not going to argue at this stage whether it is wise or unwise to enter into capital commitments. When this Government announce their capital commitments, the Opposition will have an opportunity of criticising them and we shall welcome constructive criticism.  I am saying, and I repeat, that the type of hypocritical approach made by Deputy Aiken will not do any benefit to the nation or to the finances of the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>We were told that it was peculiar that the revenue was down in the first two months of this year.  It was precisely because of that fact that I mentioned in the earlier part of my statement, one of the reasons for it&mdash; the uncertainty and the instability that invariably accompany a general election.  That uncertainty and instability are now over.  We have a Government now in office that have not only got an overwhelming vote from the people but that, in addition, have got a more substantial majority in the House than there has been for any Government in this House for some years.  I believe that that political stability will in turn engender confidence in the community and that that confidence will mean that we can look forward to a better opportunity for all in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are criticised because we did not do at once all the things we might like to do.  One Deputy in the Opposition said that we promised everything. Another Deputy said we had not.  What are the facts?  The facts are that we made it perfectly clear that we were going into Government, if we were elected by the people, for the purpose of clearing up the difficulties that had been created by the previous Government, difficulties that I suppose are going to take some substantial period of time to wipe out.  We believe, and we are confident, that when our policies get an opportunity of showing their effect&mdash;and as I already stated that inevitably is not going to be to-day or to-morrow but in time&mdash;the <Col N="157" /> Deputies who support the Government on this side will realise that the Government they are supporting has put into operation a policy that is suited to the needs of our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,124,260 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission (etc.).</P>
      <P>The net Estimate of £1,956,700 for Lands for the current year shows a very slight decrease (£4,250) over the total amount voted last year&mdash;including the sum transferred to the Lands Vote from the Vote for Increases in Remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-head A, for salaries, wages and allowances, there is an apparent increase of £39,368, but when account is taken of the additional amount provided last year to meet increases under the Civil Service Arbitration <Col N="160" /> Award, the net result is a saving of £2,652.  The progress achieved in the vesting of holdings and allotments&mdash;to which I shall refer later&mdash;has made possible a reduction of 44 in the indoor staffing, which more than offsets the cost of incremental increases in salaries.</P>
    <P>A considerable proportion of the net Estimate is allocated to sub-heads H (1), H (2) and H (3) for making good certain deficiencies in the Land Bond Fund arising from the statutory halving of annuities&mdash;which alone accounts for £675,000&mdash;and other aids to land purchase.  As the land settlement programme proceeds, new annuities are set up which call for additional provision under sub-heads H (1) for costs fund and H (3) for halving of annuities.  This year, it is expected that the halving of annuities will result in an increase of £7,600 under sub-head H (3), which, together with an estimated increase of £200 under sub-head H (1), gives a total increase of £7,800 under this group of sub-heads.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head I, funds are provided for the improvement of estates including the erection and repair of buildings, the construction of roads, fences, and drains and other works.  The expenditure under this sub-head last year amounted to £551,170 and was about 10 per cent. short of the original estimate of £615,000.  In the early part of the year 1953/54 the acquisition of land was held up awaiting legislation enabling the issue of a new series of land bonds at a higher rate of interest &mdash;rendered necessary by the general advance in interest rates.  This legislation was eventually enacted in July, 1953, but the hold-up prior to that operated to delay the possession of land and the commencement of new improvement works, with a consequent falling off in expenditure.  With the difficulty in regard to land bonds removed, a full programme of work is planned for the current year.  In addition, the scale of housing assistance for tenants of rearranged holdings has had to be revised in order to facilitate schemes for the improvement and rearrangement of non-vested estates; it is therefore expected that expenditure <Col N="161" /> on this branch of the housing programme will reach a higher figure than last year.  For this reason, and because of some wage increases, the Estimate has been raised by £10,105.</P>
    <P>Where the Land Commission find it necessary to set up special funds under the control of trustees to provide incomes from which major works such as embankments, watercourses and pipelines may be suitably maintained, the capital is supplied by way of advances under sub-head N.  In the past year, such trusts were set up in relation to a watercourse in County Tipperary and an embankment protecting a number of allotments adjoining the Fergus estuary.  These cases being disposed of, there is no immediate prospect of large issues of this nature and it has been found possible to make a saving of £5,640 under this sub-head.</P>
    <P>As regards sub-head R, which relates to the purchase of land for cash, the sum expended last year was £1,325 towards the purchase of five holdings. During that year, one holding was purchased at a public auction and four by private treaty.  Altogether, since June 1950, when such purchases were first authorised, 19 holdings have been purchased by private treaty and three at auctions.  The sum of £20,000 included in this year's Estimates for sub-head R is the same amount as was voted last year.</P>
    <P>Appropriations-in-Aid have shown an upward trend in recent years, which was to be expected, having regard to general variations in money value.  An increase of £15,020 is estimated for Appropriations-in-Aid for 1954-55 as compared with last year.  This increase is accounted for mainly by increased revenue from annuities in repayment of improvement advances and the lettings of land and bog.</P>
    <P>I do not think that detailed comments on the other sub-heads of the Vote are necessary at this stage, as they show little variations from previous Estimates.</P>
    <P>As regards the general work of the Land Commission, it is gratifying to note that the drive which I intensified in 1948 for the completion of tenanted <Col N="162" /> land purchase has met with great success. Of approximately 111,000 tenanted holdings which vested in the Land Commission under the Land Acts, 1923-31, there are now only 19,000 holdings outstanding for revesting in tenants.  The fact that so many holdings have been finally resold is obviously of benefit to the tenants concerned, but it is also an advantage to the Land Commission since it relieves them of much routine work and responsibility which was unavoidable while the holdings remained unvested but which, at the same time, was of little positive value towards the solution of our major problems.  The stage has now been reached at which we can say that in many counties the task of revesting tenanted land is drawing to a close.  In fact in one County&mdash; Longford&mdash;all tenanted land has been revested.</P>
    <P>But I do not want to mislead the House because the great bulk of the 19,000 outstanding holdings to which I just referred together with 7,500 unvested holdings on the estates of the former Congested Districts Board, lie in the western counties and constitute the really hard core of congestion which must still be relieved before we can be satisfied.  In spite of all that has been done to date&mdash;and a great deal has been done&mdash;there still remain considerable areas in which very bad conditions obtain and in which a great deal of enlargement, rearrangement and rehousing must be effected as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>I think it is generally agreed that the Land Commission can relieve conditions in the badly congested areas only by effecting migration on a substantial scale.  Unfortunately, this process, from beginning to end, takes several years to complete.  It involves the gradual acquisition of an adequate area of untenanted land; the erection of new homesteads; the selection and movement of suitable migrants from the most congested estates and, finally, the hammering out of a scheme of rearrangement and enlargement in which all the remaining tenants will co-operate. It is no easy matter to organise such work on a large scale but I have been pleased to find that as a result of the Land Act 1950 the Land <Col N="163" /> Commission has succeeded in making great progress recently at migrations and rearrangements.  Almost all of the migrants in recent years came from severely congested areas.</P>
    <P>Largely as a result of these migrations it was found possible to rearrange and improve 544 holdings in the congested areas from which the migrants came.  This is the most important and difficult work now confronting the Land Commission; it is a challenge to us to remove the bad legacy of former days and it is a challenge that I, as Minister, am determined to answer.  It will be my future policy to press on as fast as possible and expand this programme of migration coupled with the rearrangement and enlargement of congested and intermixed holdings.  I would appeal to Deputies to do nothing to impede the progress of this important national work&mdash;which depends so much on good will&mdash;and to encourage the tenants to join in rearrangement schemes which can be of such lasting benefit to themselves and their neighbours. The Land Commission inspectors can be relied on to do their part in preparing and implementing such schemes with the utmost fairness to all concerned.</P>
    <P>While great emphasis is placed on the needs of the most congested western areas, it must not be thought that other districts are neglected.  It is the policy of the Land Commission to relieve congestion wherever it exists, and the isolated groups of uneconomic holdings which still remain in other counties will continue to be dealt with when suitable lands become available in their vicinity.  Provisional totals for the Twenty-Six Counties under the main headings of the land purchase and resettlement programme show that last year 32,524 acres were divided among 2,111 allottees; 26,457 acres were acquired, resumed or taken over in exchange and 12,356 holdings, parcels and rights of turbary were revested in tenants or allottees.</P>
    <P>The immediate prospects for the acquisition and division of further areas are not without difficulty.  The procedure for dealing with objections <Col N="164" /> to acquisition and resumption has, I gather, been questioned and a court decision is awaited.  As land settlement progresses it naturally becomes less easy to procure further land for division but we cannot, and shall not, relax our efforts until at least some measure of relief has been brought throughout the entire congested areas.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am pleased to be able to report that the collection of annuities is proceeding most satisfactorily. The amount outstanding at the 31st March, 1954, was £140,000&mdash;or £12,000 less than at the same time last year&mdash;and it represented only 0.3 per cent. of the total amount collectable since 1933.</P>

      <P>As these Estimates were prepared by the former Administration&mdash;I, as Minister at the time, having had a considerable share of responsibility for the present Estimate&mdash;I suppose it would be rather inappropriate if I were at this stage to find fault with them. Moreover, the Minister has not indicated any change in policy or indicated that there is any special new departure in contemplation which might seem to deserve consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of what has been referred to by the Minister in his statement is well known to me and, in that respect, I am probably in an advantageous position as compared with other Deputies.  Although the work of the Land Commission receives a good deal of attention in Dáil Éireann by way of parliamentary question, I think it is not generally known in the country, apart from the specially intensive work which the staff of the commission are carrying out in the congested areas.  As has been pointed out, there are still some 19,000 holdings unvested, of which 7,500 are on the estates of the former Congested Districts Board.  These, of course, are very small holdings which <Col N="165" /> would require rearrangement and, if possible, enlargement.</P>
    <P>I should think that the total number of such holdings in the western counties is greater than 7,500, which refers to those on the estates of the former Congested Districts Board.  I should expect that the total number of small holdings in the West of Ireland would run closer to a figure of 12,000 holdings.</P>
    <P>The position, as has been indicated in the Minister's statement, is that to secure substantial relief for these holdings it is necessary that tenants should be migrated to other counties &mdash;generally to the Midlands or eastern counties.  As the statement points out, the acquisition of land, the determination of price and the hearing of appeals follow a well-recognised procedure.  When the legal proceedings are completed, arrangements have to be made for the scheming of the lands, the division of the acquired lands into holdings, the building of houses, the provision of outhouses, the provision of roads and the settlement of fences and access.  It is obvious, as the statement points out, that it takes a considerable period, probably running into some years, between the time when it is decided that a particular area in the West of Ireland shall have small holders migrated from it and the time when, finally, they are put into occupation&mdash;the small percentage of them, having regard to their total numbers, that can be migrated to eastern areas.  A very considerable time elapses and, perhaps, due allowance is not made for that by those who contend that the proceedings of the Land Commission in regard to the acquisition of land and the migration of such tenants are unduly laborious and tedious.  Certain procedures have been followed in the past and if they are departed from the law is violated and I think, even if short cuts can be shown, that the results from such short cuts would not be very happy.</P>
    <P>When Land Commission schemes are carried into operation, apart from the disappointment of those applicants who are not successful in securing allotments, we know that, generally <Col N="166" /> speaking, as far as the schemes are concerned they are fairly permanent and entirely satisfactory from the point of view that when the inspectors and the commissioners have completed schemes and put them into operation we know that everything is going to be in fairly good order. Those who have received allotments or enlargements or new holdings are not going to have any trouble afterwards. Everything is settled for them when they are put into occupation of the land.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission also give a good deal of employment.  I should say that up to 1,500 men are employed in a particular year on Land Commission work and this work is entirely in connection with the rearrangement of small holdings in counties like Mayo and with the migration of congests to the eastern or midland counties, so that they benefit to a considerable extent from the expenditure on improvements.</P>
    <P>In the Land Commission Estimate the only sub-head which the Minister can effectively alter is the sub-head dealing with expenditure on improvements. The other sub-heads deal with salaries, wages and allowances to the staff of the Land Commission or with statutory payments such as the remission of 50 per cent. of the land annuities to the annuitants, and the effective expenditure, therefore, is the amount spent every year on what is called the improvement of estates, which means in fact doing the work to which I have referred in connection with resettlement in non-congested areas and the rearrangement of schemes within them.</P>
    <P>So long as the aim of the policy continues, as in the past, to be to relieve congestion in those areas where it exists and where it is a very serious problem, socially and economically, any steps the Minister takes towards improving the position in those areas or speeding up migration or the acquisition of land for that purpose will have our support and co-operation from this side of the House.  It is a problem which has to be alleviated.  It is not possible of a completely satisfactory solution as long as we are not <Col N="167" /> in a position to provide all these congests with proper holdings, judging them by the standards as they obtain in other parts of the country.  But we know that in the past the aim of the old Congested Districts Board was to try to achieve the more moderate purpose and goal of bringing tenants west of the Shannon up to a valuation of, say, £10 and if that can be done in those very bad areas of congestion which still exist there is no doubt but that it would mean a very substantial improvement in conditions.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is doubtful, as I have implied in my statement from my experience and my knowledge, that we can relieve as we would like to relieve, by giving them new holdings, more than a percentage of all those thousands in the remoter areas of the congested districts.  But we must continue and, as I have said, there is an obligation upon the State and upon a native Irish Government to endeavour to provide those people with better conditions, to try and enlarge their holdings, to provide them with better housing conditions and better amenities generally.</P>
    <P>That is what the Land Commission are doing and their work it not very often appreciated or understood because it is not brought before the public.  It is regarded as routine when hundreds of acres of land are taken over and distributed among a number of smallholders ranging from six to 20 in a number of townlands and when the whole economy and future of these people who have benefited has been enormously improved.  It is a rather routine kind of uninteresting work for those who have no knowledge of the conditions in those areas; but those who have appreciate the great work that has been done by the Land Commission over so many years.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Land Commission in 1952, I remember being told that over 1,000,000 acres had been allotted and I should say that since that time there has probably been in one way or another the greater part of another 100,000 acres allotted.  So that we can say that since the beginning when the Irish Government took over probably <Col N="168" /> 1,100,000 acres at least have been allotted by the Land Commission and it has been estimated that over 15,000 new farms have been established.  It is only when one goes into those areas and if one has had knowledge of and acquaintance with the conditions as they obtained in those areas 20 or 30 years ago that one realises, as those who come back to these districts from foreign parts see and admire, the enormous improvements which have been made.</P>
    <P>The expenditure on the Land Commission is heavy because the cost of acquiring land is very substantial, very heavy.  It is the greatest national asset and the most valuable property that one can have, and when the Land Commission take over land they have to pay a fair market price, although the tenant does not repay in full through his annuity the cost of the land.  The State has shouldered the obligation and will, I presume, for some years to come shoulder the obligation of bearing the heavier portion of the cost.  In fact, the greater portion of the cost of an estate, the cost of the purchase of land and the cost of the provision of buildings and the amenities to which I have referred has increased enormously. Besides, as the pool of land for acquisition becomes smaller, although the personnel of the inspectorate is sufficient to carry out the work efficiently and adequately, the position becomes more difficult, as, for example, in the case of the unvested holdings to which the Minister referred.  The cases that are left over are the most difficult and intractable, and the ones in respect of which the Land Commission over the years have very often found it impossible to do very much to relieve the situation of the tenants.</P>
    <P>Expenditure, as I say, has been fairly heavy during the past three years.  It has reached a figure of about £1,500,000 on improvements and on land upon which the Land Commission are erecting buildings or providing roads or other facilities for tenants, it has reached over the £500,000 figure, apart from the other expenditure of a statutory nature to which I have referred. The best course in connection with Land Commission activities in general <Col N="169" /> and one to which I think we can all subscribe is to wish and hope that the work will go ahead even more successfully, if that be possible, than in the past.  We are fortunate in having a staff of experienced officers, both indoor and outdoor, who are thoroughly acquainted in their respective spheres with all the difficulties and awkwardnesses of the problem of land resettlement. Large numbers of younger men have come into the inspectorate, and I have no doubt whatever that their quality is such that, after gaining experience of this problem of rearrangement in the western areas, the very big and formidable problem to which their efforts must be mainly directed, these younger inspectors will do as well as, and perhaps it is not too much to expect that they may do better than, their predecessors, some of whom have done very excellent work indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear the Minister's statement on the work of the Land Commission and the prospects of improvement in the future.  The Minister gave figures of the area of the land dealt with and I feel that this could be very much greater.  Quite a lot of the acreage he mentioned must have included areas of bogland, waste land and mountain which are not suitable for cultivation as agricultural land and are only of mediocre importance for grazing purposes. Therefore the Minister's statement in general could be, and in fact is, very misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the division of land of practical value for those engaged in the agricultural industry is concerned, I assume that it applies mainly to the poorer counties in the West of Ireland and possibly elsewhere.  It is difficult for the Land Commission to make out of bad and inferior land&mdash;and even middling quality land&mdash;land which will be useful for agricultural purposes, and the only solution for these areas is, as the Minister indicated, a system of planned migration; but it is enough to wear out the patience of any person who is really interested in this problem to hear Minister after Minister in one Government after another speaking of a plan for migration to deal with congestion.  I should like the <Col N="170" /> Minister to go over the work of the Land Commission during the past five years and see if he can justify the amount of effort and the number of migrants moved from different counties in the western area.  Is he satisfied that any serious effort has at any period been made to deal with the situation?</P>
    <P>I know that quite a lot of criticism was directed&mdash;whether justly or unjustly, I will not say, because I do not know&mdash;against the present Minister when he was previously in office, on the ground that more migrants came from County Mayo during his period than from any other two or three counties in the West.</P>
    <P>I hope that is not so, because, if it were, it would have a very serious effect, and I mention it in order to enable the Minister to give us figures in this connection when he is replying. Migration in County Leitrim had some force 12 or 14 years ago when Deputy Derrig, who was then Minister, told me, in the course of a conversation, that he had determined to devote all the land which came into the hands of the Land Commission for some years entirely to the relief of congests in the West.  Changes came along, and, although I am sure the Minister meant what he said, it did not occur, and any alteration made in the form of migration since immediately before the war has been so negligible as to compel us to regard the whole problem as being closed and finished with.  As a result, we find the people there despairing of any improvement in conditions and without hope of ever having a decent home or holding on which to rear families and turning their backs on the Land Commission and Governments in this country and removing themselves from the necessity of having to make any demand for land or anything else.</P>
    <P>I think that Governments here are culpable in a serious way and have earned the greatest condemnation from the people in the West who are now scattered in every town and city in England&mdash;some of them unemployed &mdash;and in other countries.  These people should seriously set about finding some way of expressing their indignation with the neglect of these Governments who did not handle the problem as it <Col N="171" /> should have been handled years ago. Words fail me, knowing the circumstances as I know them, in condemning strongly enough the failure of native Governments to undo the work of the conquest, the &ldquo;to Hell or Connacht&rdquo; scheme.  They have left the hell there and many people have now left that area believing that there is no longer any hope of getting relief from any Government.</P>
    <P>The congests who remain in the West of Ireland are more demoralised, more hopeless and more helpless than the people in the slums of Dublin were 20 years ago.  Millions were spent in improving housing conditions there and in relieving the tenement conditions, but how much has been spent and how little has been done to remedy the situation in connection with a far more important line?  These men in the West of Ireland have to try to live by wringing a living from an infertile, sour soil.</P>
    <P>Their forefathers were forced at the point of the bayonet to bring that land into cultivation and rear family after family in semi-decency through nothing but hard labour and ingenuity. After all that, should that race of people be destroyed and should a Government watch the decay of that noble, strenuous and energetic race of people who have struggled against impossible hardships and suffer them leave the country?  Should a Government think only in terms of money and what is economic for the State to do?  If you reduce that community, you will lose the best people that Ireland ever possessed and you will lose an asset which you cannot replace at a later stage by all the millions of money you may think fit to spend.</P>
    <P>Nothing has been done to save them except in a very mediocre way and, having regard to all that is happening now, a national emergency should be declared to see what effort is needed &mdash;not what it would cost&mdash;to keep those people interested in the land. They are interested.  Give them a chance.  Some migration did take place from my county and, as I stated already, it was planned to take place on a fairly large scale prior to the <Col N="172" /> last war.  These people proved to the satisfaction of the Land Commission that they were the best farmers that were ever brought to the Midlands.</P>
    <P>When you are dividing land at least this standard should be reached that the land will only be given to the people most capable of using it and not because they belong to a political Party or have any political pull.  Will even a small businessman in a town seek to employ somebody to run his grocery, bar or shop who has not some previous experience or some reference as to his capacity in that field?  Yet, in the division of land and without regard for the capacity of the person farms have been divided up and the result is shown and known.  Many have been failures.  In many cases farms which were divided and handed over by the Land Commission have had to be resumed.  I do not say that it is the Land Commission or the officials of the Land Commission who are entirely responsible.</P>
    <P>Gross mishandling has taken place. It seems to be an opportunity for all chancers who see the possibility of acquiring land without paying anything for it at the expense of the State and then offering it for sale, perhaps after receiving some money as compensation or even letting it out for grass to someone who finds a use for it.  That is a public scandal.  I would ask the Minister, when he is replying, to state the number of such cases that have arisen in the last five or ten years and what steps he proposes to take in future.  Will they be more selective in appointing new tenants than they have been in the past?  There is a wide field of investigation open there, and at some stage I propose to examine it, but in the meantime it is only fair that the present Minister should have the chance of making new regulations to ensure that abuses so serious and grave in the past should be checked and will not occur again.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I might refer to in that respect.  In the division of land by the Land Commission for some years back a stereotyped form of fence was built by taking up the first sod or two from the grass surrounding each side of the fence and building it <Col N="173" /> up sod by sod.  That is entirely wrong. Week by week as I travel to the West I see many of these fences crumbling away.  There is no plantation there. Cattle move down and after a short period of five or ten years there is no longer any fence.  In the first instance by removing these sods you are removing the most valuable and fertile soil. In the sour soil in the wet land the same thing prevails only with worse conditions because you have a wider field.  The ordinary ditch not only makes a permanent fence but it also drains the soil.  Why this stereotyped, stupid, out of date and wasteful process is allowed to continue beats me. I hope those few remarks of mine may draw the attention of the Land Commission in the future to adopt fencing methods suitable to the soil and the land.</P>
    <P>Another thing, I feel that there should be facilities made available from the Land Commission, particularly where lands are registered, to enable farmers to borrow money for the improvement of their properties, the buying of extra cattle and the building of houses.  I know the Land Commission have done something in that respect over a number of years but not nearly sufficient.  As everybody knows, farms in this country are becoming more and more valuable every year.  As the land annuities are paid there is a greater personal interest created on the part of owners of farms.  To encourage a man to remain on his land, and improve it, larger grants should be made available. The local inspector could visit the farm and make the necessary adjustments. The Land Commission could be of great assistance by assisting farmers financially to improve their places.  I look forward to seeing something serious done by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig has already paid a tribute to the Land Commission and I also can do that.  The Land Commission has a trained staff and men of wide experience.  But what is the use of a trained staff and wide experience unless they are given the material upon which to work?  They should not be hindered.  As things are going, the <Col N="174" /> day is not far off when you will have land with nobody to occupy it.  When that occurs, we will have to send abroad for people to occupy it because land without workers is not valuable no matter how good it is.</P>
    <P>A shilling spent to-day may be the saving of £1 in another few years.  We have excellent land, the best land, I am told, in the world.  It is lying practically waste, or at least with very few people per acre living on it, while you have, at the same time, people down in the congested areas needy, hungry, under-nourished and with disappointment in their eyes. They are fleeing from the country so that the countryside is fast becoming a wilderness.  This is a national problem.  If the land were used to the best advantage we would be in a position not only to supply our own needs but also to develop an export market, and thus have the means of purchasing in outside markets essential commodities which we cannot produce at home.  There is no point in our trying to become highly industrialised and hoping that somewhere from the skies will fall the mineral deposits necessary for such a purpose.  But we have at our hands the greatest asset in the world, the most valuable of all the assets, land, which is being allowed to go to waste while those who are capable of working it are flying from the country.  It is ridiculous for the Government to sit back quoting statistics without producing any effective remedy for the situation.  If proper steps were taken the land in the West could, within a reasonable period of time, be as densely populated as the land in the Midlands.</P>
    <P>I will watch with anxiety to see how far the present Minister will succeed in solving this problem.  If serious measures are not taken in the near future in regard to the West of Ireland, there will be no problem at all in relation to these people in about another 15 years because they will all have vanished from that part of the country. Many of them have gone already with disappointment in their hearts because they were unable to obtain a living in their own country.  Let us hope those who have had to take to the emigrant <Col N="175" /> ship will not harbour bitter memories because of the circumstances which forced them to leave their native land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an Estimate which comes in for a fair amount of criticism every year, and rightly so.  I hope that he will reverse many of the decisions that the Land Commission and himself made from 1948 onwards, because when he was in office before he set a headline which eastern Deputies will long remember.  The problems which concern this Department relate to different areas.  Western Deputies and eastern Deputies have different problems.  We Deputies in the eastern areas have our problems also.  We must look after the interests of the people who live there and I feel their rights are being taken away and justice has not been done over the past seven or eight years either by the present Minister, when he was in office before, or by the last Minister.</P>
      <P>Land division is a very complex problem and it should be dealt with on a national basis.  A complete review is immediately necessary instead of carrying on with the present haphazard method of dividing land which has been adopted over the last 100 years.  If we continue in this fashion we will need the Land Commission for ever.  I saw ranches divided under the British régime 30 and 35 years ago, and I see some of the landholders from whom this land had been taken buying back land around those estates.  Unless something is done about that we will see after the next five or six years, these big estates as they were 30 or 35 years ago, and the people who got these small holdings will be selling out and leaving the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not one of those who will pull back my punches where my punches are needed.  I am not against migration from the West or the North if it is reasonable, but I do not want a flood of migrants to the eastern counties to destroy the economy of the whole country.  There is, I admit, a vast amount of land in Westmeath, Meath and Dublin that could be divided in the national interest, but this must be done prudently and on a national scale.  We have in the eastern area, <Col N="176" /> which was the area of the planters long ago&mdash;and certainly they were very securely planted there&mdash;very large holdings up to 2,000 and 3,000 acres, and the owners are lords of all they survey. There is no effort being made to whittle down some of these vast estates.  I cannot see what legal terms should prevent us from doing our duty towards the people.  These owners should be quite satisfied to be left with 300 acres of this land and to allow 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 acres to be divided amongst the people.  Instead of concentrating on these huge estates we find the touts of the Land Commission day in, day out, interfering with the middling farmers who are hard-working people owning a mere 40, 50 or 60-acre farm.  That is victimisation of a bitter type, and I hope it will stop. There are scores of big farms worthy of the attention of the Land Commission. I want to know why, after all the Acts we passed five or six years ago, they will not take over these ranches and divide them, instead of having hugger-mugger and back-hand methods and people buying many of these large estates by telephone and working them as cattle ranches.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission are not doing their duty.  Any holding of 300, 400 or 500 acres of land that comes on the market should be taken over by the Irish Government in the interests of the nation and divided amongst the people.  I am asking the present Minister to be realistic and to face up to the problems as a responsible Minister. He can do an immense amount of good to the Irish economy or an immense amount of harm according to the policy he adopts.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who are too well satisfied with this removal <i>en masse</i> of congests from the West of Ireland.  Hundreds and hundreds of those people are coming up, particularly from Mayo, and no blame to them.</P>
    <P>More power to them for coming up! But what good is it from the point of view of the national economy? What problem are you solving by bringing up tens of thousands and planting them in the eastern counties?  These men are being planted on small holdings <Col N="177" /> of 22 to 28 acres, holdings upon which they cannot make a living.  What is the result?  They are not a fortnight in the eastern counties before 80 per cent.  of the family emigrates to England or Scotland, or elsewhere; it is they who send the money home to keep the home going.  No one is left except the parents and possibly one son to work the holding.</P>
    <P>We are tired of appealing to successive Governments and Ministers to remedy that situation.  An area of 22 or 28 statute acres is no use in the eastern counties.  In the West of Ireland 25 acres would rank as a ranch. But in the West of Ireland one does not live on the land.  One lives by fishing and making poteen and on the money that is sent home from relatives in Great Britain and America.  The land there is only barren rock.</P>
    <P>If something is not done to rectify the position in the eastern counties we will find ourselves one day with as acute a congestion problem as exists in the West.  Many of these holdings are being offered for sale and the strongest man in the area is buying them up.  If that continues there will be a reversion to the ranching system in the Midlands.  We will have travelled the vicious circle and the Land Commission will be back where it started.</P>
    <P>It is time we woke up to the fact that a man must have an economic holding on which to live and rear his family.  Nothing less than 35 or 40 Irish acres constitutes an economic holding in the Midlands or eastern counties.  These holdings should be capable of giving employment to at least one man.  The situation to-day is that the owners of these uneconomic holdings are seeking work on the roads, in the pits and on afforestation, thereby depriving others of employment. Thirty years ago emigration was unheard of in the eastern counties. Now emigration is as rife there as it is in the West.</P>
    <P>Lands offered for sale should be taken by the Minister and divided amongst applicants who will work them and make a living on them Deputy Flynn has said that many of <Col N="178" /> these men who got land in the past did not work the land.  I know men who have sold land over the last eight years; these were men handpicked by Fianna Fáil through the medium of their cumanns.  Some of them had never looked for land.  In my own area I saw a man taken up by an inspector, a bogus I.R.A. captain, and brought around in a Land Commission car. Every Fianna Fáil supporter got land although some of them had not tuppence to their name.  Many of them were living on home assistance.  Many of them would not work in a fit.  More shame to Fianna Fáil for destroying our Irish economy!  These are the men who are selling out.  These men were never land-minded.  All they wanted was money and a good time.  They are having a good time on the £1,600 or the £1,800 they got for their farms. They are having a royal time in the public-houses, on the racecourse and on the dog tracks.  That will continue as long as the money lasts and, when it is gone, they will go back to the labour exchange.  I must condemn Fianna Fáil for what they did in that respect. We are paying for it to-day.</P>
    <P>Many have sold out and many have succeeded.  Those who have succeeded are a credit to the country.  The claim of the Meath men to land in their own county is the paramount claim. There are very fine men living on the edges of estates in County Meath. They are not asked if they want land when land is being divided.  An Order has been made excluding the cottage tenants.  Whether a cottage is vested or not, the owner is excluded; I say he is deliberately excluded by the Land Commission.  I know that those cottage tenants would be satisfied with five or six acres.  I know that the uneconomic holder would be satisfied with ten or 12 acres.  Inspectors come down at colossal expense to the taxpayers and take statements.  The applicants are told to sit tight and they need not worry.  They sit tight too long, the land is divided and they are passed over.  All they see is two or three buses arriving from the West of Ireland with migrants, while they cannot get as much as an acre of land. I have no quarrel with the migrants. They are living all round me.  They <Col N="179" /> are decent men who work hard but they cannot live on their present uneconomic holdings.  Their children have to emigrate so that they can find the money to pay the rates and taxes. Valuations in Meath are not like valuations in the rest of Ireland.  There is no free commonage and no free grazing. The rates must be paid on the 22 statute acres; if they are not paid, they must get out.  I appeal to the Minister to think twice before he insults the people amongst whom he sends these migrants.</P>
    <P>We want justice and fair play and nothing more.  If the Fianna Fáil Minister made an Order excluding cottiers from getting plots to provide grazing for their cows, then I would ask the present Minister to revoke that Order and see that justice is done.  If he does not he is going to create a problem for himself.  He is going to do something that will leave a sour and bitter taste among many of us for long years to come.  If there was reason and common sense used in connection with the work of land division, then I suggest the eastern and western Deputies could work hand in hand. They could see that good work was done in the national interest.  All we are asking for is fair play and justice.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to see that, before any more migrants are brought up to the Midlands, justice is done to the few dozen men in the area who are looking for land.  At the present moment there are men who have been herds on estates for 20 and 25 years. The employment they had was their sole means of gaining a livelihood. What is the Land Commission doing for any of them?  Are they being given a holding on these estates, a thing to which they are perfectly entitled?  They are not.  They are being offered £150 to get out lock, stock and barrel, to fend for themselves on that small sum after giving 20 or more years' service on these estates.  Are these men supposed to go with their tails between their legs to bow and scrape and to feel lucky that they have not been thrown into jail by the Land Commission? I will not stand for that.</P>
    <P>I say that these men, after their <Col N="180" /> long years of service, are fully entitled to a holding.  I do not care whether they are married or single.  At present they are being shoved out on the roadside. In my opinion, they are fully entitled to a holding.  If they do not make good, the holdings can be taken off them after a few years.  I say, give them a trial.  The present position is that they are turfed out and others are turfed in and planted where these local men should be given an opportunity of making a living for themselves.  What use is £150 to any man?  But that is all we get in the County Meath, and we are supposed to be contented with it. We are not contented with it.</P>
    <P>Another grievance that we have in my county is that the Land Commission spend too much time in the taking over of a holding.  There is a holding at Moneymore, Longwood.  The land is not good.  We have there eight uneconomic holders and two or three cottiers.  The man from whom that land is being taken has taken crops of wheat off it three years in succession, so that when it is finally taken over it is going to be nothing more than a dust bowl. How can anyone expect the poor impoverished men who will get ten or 12 acres of it to make good in view of the fact that it is nothing more than, as I have said, a dust bowl?  Crops of wheat have been taken off it three years in succession.  The guts have been pulled out of that particular farm.</P>
    <P>These are things which the Land Commission should be thinking about. In my county it has land set for the last four, five or six years.  It has been getting £32 an acre for it for tillage. I say that is a public disgrace.  The wheat racketeers from England have been brought in there by the Land Commission.  They bring in their tractors, tear up the land, get big crops of wheat from it and then they are off.  The result is that the land is left in a condition in which it will produce nothing but scutch, dirt and thistles.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission then steps in and divides it amongst the poor fools from Clare and Mayo and expect them to make good on it.  Why should the Land Commission try to make money in that way?  Their job should be to provide economic holdings for our own <Col N="181" /> people and so enable them to make a living on the land.  But no, the Land Commission will not do that.  They must do the racketeer with this 11 months' system by setting the land for as long as they can get anyone to take it.  I hope that will be stopped immediately.  It is not good enough to allow it to happen.  I hope the present Minister will take his courage in his hands&mdash;that he will be the boss and not the Land Commission.  I am satisfied that the Land Commission have been in full control of the Minister.  In my opinion he should not be a tool in the hands of these people.</P>
    <P>In my county we have many headaches as far as land division is concerned. I am asking the Minister to be a realist this time.  I am demanding now that those men who are being denied five or seven acre plots should be provided with a cow plot of 40 or 50 acres in the vicinity of where they live on which they can graze their cows.  I say it is nothing short of a public scandal that these men do not get land.  At least, in the interests of fair play, they should be given a cow plot. They are fully entitled to that.  These cow plots should be provided since the land is there.  That should be done before other people are brought in from outside the county.  If the answer is given to me that the maps have already been fixed up, then I say let the maps be changed so that those men are given their rights.</P>
    <P>Ten or 15 years ago, under the Fianna Fáil régime, there was the case of a man who got a holding.  He turned out to be of the type I spoke about earlier.  He set the land for years.  He got £180 for the building of a house but never built it.  The land was set. It was a public disgrace and eventually he was evicted, and I must say rightly so.  He made no effort whatever to work the land.  The result was that a new man was brought up from the West of Ireland.  The land had been on the hands of the Land Commission for three years, but when this man came up a new house was built for him.  He came up, let the land and locked the house, and we have never heard of him since.  The house is there locked up.  Right beside that holding <Col N="182" /> there is another one.  The house on it has never been opened during the last 30 years.  The rats are running in the front door and out the back door. There are 40 or 50 acres of land going with that house.  That is the way the Irish taxpayer's money is being spent.</P>
    <P>While that is the case, I can see in my own locality how a poor unfortunate widow, with a small holding of about 22 acres, is being treated by the Land Commission.  I see inspector after inspector coming there peeping in through the windows to see if there is a bed in the house.  This poor woman is in very bad health herself.  She spent 20 years nursing her husband who for years had suffered from paralysis.  The inspectors come there to see if they can find any loophole in order to take the land off that poor widow.  It is time that that should be stopped.  If it is not stopped, I shall keep on exposing it here.  I would ask the Minister to face up to these things.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the people in East Meath are getting a very raw deal indeed.  They are getting nothing at all.  Everything is given there to the stranger.  In that area they go in extensively for the growing of fruit. They are a good thrifty people and try to make a living from fruit growing. I would ask the Minister, as I asked the last Minister, to make a concession to them by giving them five or ten acres to enable them to enlarge their small holdings.  Nothing has been done for them.  I would ask the present Minister to reverse the decisions that were taken in these cases by previous Ministers.  Fruit growing fits into the Irish economy and those men who are engaged in it should be helped.  They grow fruit for the Dublin market.  I would ask the Minister to see that they get five or ten acres of land to enable them to put up new plants for the production of fruit.  In many cases, the old plants are worn out.  The Government should see that justice is done &mdash;fair, simple justice.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister&mdash;as I asked before&mdash;to realise that North Westmeath from Castletown up to the border of Cavan across to Kells and down almost to Athboy is a terribly congested area.  It is just as much <Col N="183" /> congested as Mayo, Sligo or Leitrim. I challenge contradiction on that and the people there are living on bare, barren rocks.  The Land Commission say they have combed it out and they cannot do any more although there are many men there in the area who have offered to give up holdings of 20 and 30 acres and get out and go elsewhere and allow their land to be divided.  But the Land Commission says, &ldquo;No, our books are closed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is a terrible scandal.  In the Castletown area, near Navan, in County Meath, where a holding was divided there were so many uneconomic holdings in the vicinity that it would all be eaten up.  What was the result?  They got two or three, whom they brought in from outside, and planted them there and we public men were ignored.  How can we stand over the like of that?  We are supposed to be loyal to the country, to the Government, to the people and to the Dáil, but we must voice our grievances, and we have grievances, scores of them.  I believe myself that land division should be taken completely out of the hands of the Land Commission.  They do not know what they are about.  I believe the committee of agriculture and the Minister for Agriculture should have some control over land division.  The Land Commission is too complex and too big and too unwieldy, and is not facing up to its tasks as it should.  I am not saying that everything done by the Land Commission was wrong.  There was plenty of good work done by them, but there is too much wrong being done.</P>
    <P>It is the same with vesting.  We are told that some counties are completely vested.  As far as my County of Meath is concerned there are people who have had holdings for 15 or 20 years and they are not vested yet, and they are expected to stock these holdings with the best of stock and market their produce. But how are they to do it?  They cannot go into the banks for £100 unless they have three or four of their strongest neighbours with them, and even then they may be kicked out.  They are expected to make good on 20 or 22 acres of land, and it was these people who got the dirty end of it.  They got the scutch and the sedge and the <Col N="184" /> rushes, but the high and dry banks were given to the big lordly men from the West.  The big men got the big, broad acres surrounding the big house, and they were very glad to be able to go in there and make good, and so they did.</P>
    <P>I would ask that the land, when it is divided, be vested after seven years, or even before seven years, to give the owner a chance of proving his title. What is the use of giving a man 22 acres of land and a house and no money and expecting him to make good?  Those men are just as poor as anyone in the West of Ireland, and no honest farmer there wants to go to his neighbours to ask them to bail him for £100 or £200, because it is a risk that the neighbours do not like to take, as the man does not own his land.  The banks are tough people, and they want to get a hold on any title deeds you have or any insurance policies, and they will make sure that they are well covered.</P>
    <P>The poor little devils of farmers as result will not face the door of the bank at all.  They know the insult they would get.  Then if they set their land in order to make a few pounds for 11 months the inspectors and the touts are down after them asking: &ldquo;Have you your land set?&rdquo; What else can the man do but set it when he has no money?  I would ask the Minister to see that vesting is carried on as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I am living on a Land Commission holding myself and when was it vested?  Twenty-one years after I got it, and had it not been that I had a little money of my own I might have had to emigrate to England myself to earn a living.  The Minister should realise that these people need a little money to work their holdings.  Five hundred pounds or £1,000 is nothing to-day when you come to stock a little holding.  It is the same as a couple of £5 notes two years ago.  You may have to pay £70 for a cow and £80 for a bullock.  Are they expected to go to the West of Ireland and buy sheep for £6 or £7 each?  They cannot do it.</P>
    <P>Before the Land Commission concludes I would ask them to recognise that the Counties of Meath, Westmeath and Dublin are the gateways of the <Col N="185" /> markets for the Irish people and there are no other gateways.  It is through these gateways that the cattle and the beef have been going for the past 20 years.  The farmers were able to go to the West, to Ballinasloe, to Roscommon, to Longford, to Waterford and all over the country and buy suckling calves and store cattle and feed them and rear them in Meath, export them and bring back money to this country.  But if you keep on making 22 or 30-acre scraggy farms you will have County Meath in the same position as the West, and no longer will the Meath farmers be able to go to the West to buy as they did in the past. The farms in Meath should be 70, 60, 50, 40 and 30 acres and nothing under that except for cottage plots.  We want to see an improvement in the lives of these people so that the thrifty farmer in the West will again open his eyes as he sees the train puff in when he knows and sees the Meath men are there, because he knows the Westmeath and the Meath men and the Dublin men of old, and he knows that they will sweep out the fairs and get C.I.E. lorries to bring the store cattle, the sheep and the sucking calves and pump them into County Meath and Westmeath to carry on the Irish economy, to sell the beef off the land and bring back the money that is keeping this country going.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that what I say is a fact, and I hope he will not lose sight of this and that when land division is embarked on scores and scores of men will not be brought up and planted down on 22 or 20 acres of land.  Those men have the tradition of going across to England to earn their living and sending the money home, but that does not lead to national economy.  There is no progress being made and no national outlook. We want to stop that and to stop emigration, and we want to see that when a man is given a holding that he lives on it, works it and rears his family and, if possible, gives employment to at least one man as well, because no man with a holding of 30 acres is doing well unless he has an agricultural worker with him.</P>
    <P>These are problems which many other people like me know of, and as <Col N="186" /> the Minister is now taking over for a fairly long term&mdash;I believe a ten-year term&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not want to make them any sadder but I believe there can be a ten-year term in front of this Government, and if the Minister does his job as we would like him to do it I think we will have a national economy here of which we can be very proud, with thrifty, manly men living full lives on their farms and giving employment around them.  I would ask, when the big estates go on the public market, that the Land Commission should take over these estates in the interests of the people and have them divided and not have the Aga Khan and the Indian princes coming in and buying them up for stud farms.  These are stud farms to-day and whitehead bullock ranches to-morrow.  Then we are told that they pay 25 per cent. extra if they are coming in, across the water.  Very few of them are without associates here. They are as slick a lot of bucks as ever you came across.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming as I do from County Meath, I am afraid that I cannot agree with a lot of the things that were said by the first three speakers.  Deputy Giles has covered a lot of the points that I will be touching on.  When Deputy Maguire was speaking he referred to what are known as migrants and said that they come principally from County Mayo. I do not know whether they come from Mayo or not, but I know where they come to.  They come to Meath, both under Deputy Blowick the last time he was Minister, under the Fianna Fáil Minister the previous time, and since. Apparently a lot of people have got the impression that Meath is made up of a number of very big ranches which must be divided between the migrants from the West and that if that is done everybody will be happy.  I would like to point out to those who do not seem to realise it that Meath has quite a number of people who are depending for their living on ordinary labouring work with the county council or <Col N="187" /> neighbouring farmers.  Some of them also work their small farms and try to eke out an existence on them.  When an estate is divided it was the usual practice until some years ago that one or two of the neighbouring farmers would be given holdings on that estate, and the result would be that an economic holding would be established, and after a while a family could be reared there and in turn they would be able to make a living out of it.  The position now is that when an estate is divided one qualification a man must have apparently for the Land Commission if he wants to qualify for a farm in County Meath&mdash;that he must not be a Meath man.</P>
      <P>We have no objection whatever to the migrants who have come to County Meath.  The people who have come there have been welcomed and at the present time perhaps they are as much Meath as we are.  We treat them as neighbours and find that they are very fine people, but we believe that the position has been abused and that the Land Commission are abusing their authority and their powers.  They are dividing farms at the present time and they will give no land at all to local applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Giles referred to the question of people who were living on farms or working on farms for years but were ruled out for one reason or another when it came to a question of dividing farms.  As recently as last week I heard an instance of where a man had been working on a farm for 13½ years but the other day, before the change of Government took place, the farm was given by the Land Commission to a man from County Galway.  This estate of approximately 120 acres was given to one man.  I agree that 20 and 30 acre farms are not economic even in County Meath where a lot of the land is good, but at the same time I do not think it is correct or fair for the Land Commission to give over 100 acres to one man, whether he comes from Galway or Mayo or Meath.  If the farm were divided into 40 or 30-acre farms they would be economic holdings, and if the Land Commission set that as their standard they would be doing very well.  I know quite well that we <Col N="188" /> may be told that the Land Commission inspectors who go there have a very difficult job to do and that it is impossible to please everybody, but I am sure I am not asking too much in asking them to please a few.  We ask them to take into consideration the rights&mdash;and they are rights&mdash;of the local applicants, who are as much entitled and as well able to work the farms as the people who come from other counties.</P>
    <P>We have another position arising there which was touched on by Deputy Giles, and that is the question of emigration.  I know a number of farms in County Meath where there are three or four sons as well as the father in the family.  You would imagine that, if an estate was being divided beside them, they would be entitled to share in the division so that they would not have to go and emigrate by being refused a farm beside them given, in preference, to a migrant.  Years ago it was a case of fleeing to hell or to Connacht.  These people have to flee to England.  There is no other place for them, and it surely is galling to them to see a farm right at their doorstep given to people from outside counties and they themselves completely passed over for no other reason than that they happen by accident of birth to be born beside the farm.  I do not think that it is fair that that should be continued by the Minister.  The system is wrong and it should be changed.</P>
    <P>We have another problem, that of employment at home.  We find that when migrants come in, rightly so, they come with big families.  Those families cannot all find a living on the small farm that they get, and before long they compete with the local labourers for employment.  The result is that there is unemployment.  Many of them perhaps will get jobs which normally were held by local people, and the result is that unemployment in Meath has grown very much in the last few years.  We can blame the Government or anybody you like for it, but it is the policy of the Land Commission which is primarily to blame.  If they were more considerate and looked into the interests of the <Col N="189" /> local applicants this position would be avoided.</P>
    <P>We have also the question of people who for years have had a cow or two grazing on a local ranch, as we call it. When that ranch is divided it is surely not too much to expect that they would be given a few acres on which to graze their cows, but even very recently we have had instances of those cows being put out on the road by the sheriff's men and the land divided among migrants.  I do not think that is Christian or morally right, and this House should not stand for it.</P>
    <P>We have another problem, and that is that when the Land Commission takes over a farm they usually divide farms between a number of people, but in one or two instances because the local people have tried to pursue their right they will leave one farm which they will not allocate to anybody.  To my own knowledge farms like that have been left for years, and in one or two cases the houses built on those farms will need considerable amounts of repair before they could be made habitable for anybody.  Meantime the Land Commission set that particular farm in meadows and we are told that the Land Commission are able to recoup some of the money they pay for the farm by doing that.  I do not think that practice should be continued.</P>
    <P>There is one question which was mentioned by one or two speakers today&mdash;that the pool of land available for unemployment has got smaller.  As long as people can come in from other parts on to the big ranches the land available for unemployment is not small.  I would have no hesitation whatever in saying in public that, if necessary, the State should take over those farms rather than let them lie idle.  There was no justification or excuse for that situation.  If that was done not alone would the needs of Meath men be satisfied but the needs of many people in the congested areas of the West and South and North of Ireland could also be satisfied.</P>
    <P>I have one other complaint.  That is that the Land Commission are too <Col N="190" /> slow when they take over farms.  We are told that great bodies move slowly, but I do not think that the Land Commission are such a great body that they should move at this very slow speed they move at.  It is a well-known fact that sometimes the Land Commission will wear out the patience of everybody who is an applicant for a farm before they decide to give it. Perhaps it is a good thing at times to go slow but the people should not be kept waiting so long, though many of them have become more or less used to it.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of farms in Meath divided over a number of years and the Meath men who have got them have made very good farmers.  The suggestion that they do not make good farmers is entirely wrong.  There are men in Meath&mdash;and I would not entirely agree with Deputy Captain Giles that they are practically all Fianna Fáil supporters&mdash;who have got farms and made a bad job of them. Being human that is bound to happen, but the bulk of them are not like that.</P>
    <P>I feel that the last right to select applicants for farms should not be given entirely to the Land Commission inspector.  There should be some kind of court of appeal from his decision, because no matter how decent, honest or capable the Land Commission inspector may be, the fact that he has given a farm to somebody means that somebody else is disappointed and leaves him open to criticism.  Something should be done to avoid that.</P>
    <P>We have also, of course, in East Meath, the area where I myself live at the moment, a very fine fruit-growing industry.  It is capable of expansion, but I believe that the main reason why it cannot be expanded is that the people interested have not got enough land.  We have a lot of land divided where no Meath men got anything at all.  I think that the Land Commission were very unwise in doing that. When there was a definite claim a holding of land should have been given, no matter how small, to some of those people who are engaged in the fruit industry.  Everybody who finds a living on a farm is somebody taken off the ordinary market, and if <Col N="191" /> they find employment, they do not have to compete with other people also looking for employment.  In North Meath particularly a great number of people are living in congested areas. It is not so much that there are so many people living on the land as that the land is bad.  In many cases it is worse than any land in the West of Ireland and people cannot make a living on it.  It is amazing how they do eke out an existence.  If the Land Commission were to investigate the matter they would be satisfied that these people are far more entitled to farms that are within nine or ten miles of them than people who are taken out of their environment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles referred to the question of wheat ranchers.  Where it is supposed that farms are listed by the Land Commission, wise guys go to the owner and take over the land for two or three years, at a very big rent, for the growing of wheat.  Anyone who knows anything about farming knows that it is utterly impossible to make a living out of land which has been under wheat without being manured for three or four years.  It is no wonder that many of these people have to give up the idea of making a living on such land.</P>
    <P>The question of employment by the Land Commission and by the Forestry Division arises on this Estimate.  The people I represent, the Federation of Rural Workers, have quite a number of people employed by these Departments. While wages are more or less standardised at county council rates for the area in which they work, we do not agree that it is the correct rate although it is better than the wage they received previously.  We do not think that the conditions under which they work are all that might be desired.  The officials in charge of the Department should have a different approach to this matter.  Five months ago we had occassion to list a number of complaints for consideration by the previous Minister for Lands.  It is a very long list.  The Minister said that he would go into them very fully.  He did so and after a few months gave a reply but the reply he gave had no <Col N="192" /> relation to the questions.  That is not the way to handle complaints made by working men.  Some machinery should be set up to deal with the question of wages and conditions of employment in the Land Commission and the Forestry Division.</P>

      <P>We have a new Government and a Minister for Lands who held office previously.  I would like him to tell the House what the Government policy is in regard to the acquisition and distribution of land.  It is a question that has agitated the minds of many Deputies and people outside the House for a long number of years.  When Deputy Blowick was Minister for Lands in a previous Government he stated that he intended to speed up as far as he possibly could the policy of migration from the nine congested counties and to pursue as far as he possibly could the acquisition of land in the other counties where land was available in order to secure that end.  That is what he stated was the policy of his Government.  I presume that that is the policy of the present Government.  I have looked over the Minister's statement in introducing this Estimate and, as he has not referred to that matter, I would be glad if, when concluding the debate, he would state as clearly as possible the <Col N="193" /> policy of his Government in this regard.  It follows that all the Deputies of his Party and the Parties that support the Government support the policy of the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>As far as the Land Commission and their inspectors are concerned, they are the people who carry out Government policy as they find it.  Government policy is expressed in the Acts that are passed in this House and in whatever directions the Government give under those Acts to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>It is all right to make a plea in this House for local landless men and to suggest that the cottage tenant should be allotted five acres of whatever land is available.  So far as this Party were concerned, when they were in office, between 1933 and 1939, they gave land to landless men and they gave five acre plots to cottiers wherever possible and during those years Deputies of the Fine Gael Party attacked that policy viciously and pointed out in this House the use, or misuse, that these people were making of that land.  Statements made in this House by responsible Deputies must be noted by the Department concerned, whenever serious criticism of policy is offered.  This Party, when they were in office, passed an Act to deprive ill-users of land of land allotted to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Internal migration was a policy that was initiated and pursued by the Fianna Fáil Government.  The Land Commission, as a result of Government policy, transferred a substantial number of tenants or landowners from the congested districts of North Meath to other areas in County Meath.  I know that the reports on those people in the files of the Land Commission show them to be the best possible farmers who occupy Land Commission holdings.  I understand that a scheme was in course of preparation to migrate a certain number of people from the Barley Hill district of County Meath to other parts of County Meath to enable the local uneconomic holders in that particular area to benefit from the distribution of the land that would come into the hands of the Land Commission as a result.  I hope I will get <Col N="194" /> an assurance from the Minister that whatever the Land Commission is doing in that regard will be continued until the congestion that exists in County Meath is wiped out.  I understand that it is a fact that the previous Coalition Government closed down entirely on internal migration, by Government Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there were six tenants being transferred to other holdings in the County Meath and that a scheme was being prepared by the local Land Commission officials in that regard during the term of the previous Coalition Government and that it was found that the scheme could not be put through because, it was alleged, the previous Coalition Government had closed down on internal migration.  I should like to be assured whether or not it is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact, of course, that the people recommended for the transfers did not get the transfers anyway, except in two or three cases.  In so far as the displacement of employees from estates acquired by the Land Commission is concerned, and where, under the terms of the Act passed in 1949 or 1950 by the previous Coalition Government, power was taken to pay compensation to such displaced employees, I want to tell the Minister that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction in regard to the administration of that Act and in regard to the amount payable in compensation to displaced herds and others who are offered compensation instead of farms. It is a fact, of course, that the Land Commission are operating under the terms of that Act.  The Act gives, as I know, power to the Land Commission to determine the amount of the compensation that shall be payable, but there is no method by which under the Act the amount of compensation is measured.  During the course of the passage of the Act through the House, I questioned the Minister on that point and I pointed out that there was no basis or method by which compensation <Col N="195" /> could be measured.  I want to tell the Minister and the House now that there is in County Meath a good deal of dissatisfaction in the administration of that particular section of the Act. Many men who could work farms and who are in a position to work them, were offered compensation in lieu thereof.  It is a fact, however, that in some cases farms were given to herds or workmen on some estates, and I do not think that any fault could be found with the persons to whom land was given in these cases.</P>
      <P>I want to say, in passing, that wherever there is a local uneconomic holder within the statutory distance from an estate about to be divided, the Land Commission always gives him an addition on that estate.  That happened during the previous period of office of the present Minister and it happened in the period of office of the Fianna Fáil Administration.  To my knowledge, there was not any case of an uneconomic holder genuinely working his holding and living within the statutory distance who was refused an addition on an estate that was being divided.  I want to put it to the Minister also that I believe that, before uneconomic holders from the nine congested counties or from other areas are accommodated in County Meath or in the Midlands with new farms in furtherance of the policy of bringing their holdings up to an economic standard or as near as possible to it, I think it would be a good thing from every point of view to see that uneconomic holders in areas like County Meath or Westmeath would be accommodated in the same way, whether or not their holdings are within the statutory distance of the estates that are about to be divided. The numbers who live on uneconomic holdings in these areas would be small, but I think that they should be accommodated either by transfer or by additions to their holdings, even though the additions might be over the statutory distance from where they live.  I know, of course, that it is hard to work a holding when the distance between two portions of it is too great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that in this debate I could <Col N="196" /> deal with the question of Land Commission roads, Land Commission houses and other incidental matters, but I think it is not the fault of the Land Commission themselves or of their engineers that these jobs were not done in these cases as they might have been.  I know that in some cases contractors who built houses may not have done the job as well as it should have been done, and that the Land Commission take the necessary steps to see that the contractors are compelled to carry out the alterations or extra work necessary.  Recently I was in a house myself built by the Land Commission for a migrant and I must say that the work was deplorable.  I brought the matter to the notice of the Minister and I know that the matter will be investigated.  I have done a certain amount of it myself and I know that the contractor has not got his full payment.  I quite believe that proper action will be taken, but I feel that when it comes to the building of a house by the Land Commission, or by any other authority for that matter, that the defects should be detected before the building is completed and that proper action should be taken then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of speech which we have heard from two Deputies from County Meath, Deputy Giles and Deputy Tully, must make the Land Commission feel very satisfied with themselves, because here we have a clash of Deputies representing congested areas in the West and Deputies in the Midlands who wish to obstruct the migration scheme of the Land Commission, for the very natural reason that they wish to see, first of all, local people in their own constituencies satisfied with regard to land division.  Whenever the Land Commission find that there is a dispute in any locality, the first thing they do is to sit down and wait until that dispute is forgotten or dies out.  When they see a conflict in this House between members in the House with regard to the policy of the Land Commission, is it not easy to understand the reason why for the past 30 years so little has been done to solve the main problem for the solution of which the Land <Col N="197" /> Commission was set up, namely, the ending of congestion and the creation of as many economic holdings as possible in this country?</P>
      <P>The first few words I have to say on this Estimate deal in a general way on a national basis with the problem which confronts us.  I am not concerned particularly with regard to the local needs of the Meath man who lives on ten or 20 acres, or the congest in the West of Ireland.  I want to say that I believe that until we get an agreed policy on this whole question Ministers may come and Ministers may go, but the policy that is there will go on for ever.  The present Minister had experience for three years of the Department of Lands.  I look on that three years' period as his apprenticeship period.  He is now fully fledged and he knows what he wants to do.  He has had, as I say, three years' experience and he has the Ministry back again.  I wish him luck, and I hope that he will prove successful.</P>
      <P>He is a man who comes from an area where people find it very hard to exist on the holdings they have.  He is a man who understands rural Ireland and I hope he will have the courage and the strength to take these very necessary steps with the Land Commission that will enable the major problems to be solved within a period of, say, ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ben Maguire pointed out that the Land Commission gave figures and statistics and that people were bewildered by them and thought that a lot had been accomplished.  Naturally in this House we have to listen to statistics and figures and the Land Commission are anxious to prove that they have done trojan work over the years in the solving of congestion.  I believe there is only one way to show up the Land Commission and to prove that the figures they have given do not give us the real over-all picture.  I think it will be agreed by the Minister and by Deputies that an economic holding must be at least £12 valuation, that that is the very minimum.  Now, let us bear that in mind and listen to these figures.  On the 5th February, 1953, <Col N="198" /> I asked a question in this House in connection with the number of holdings in the country and I asked for a breakdown of those holdings.  The figures given to me in 1953 were the figures that were available&mdash;the last date was June, 1951.  At that date there were 379,123 holdings in the country.  Of that number, 163,169 were in the five counties of Connacht and in Kerry, Clare and Donegal.  That is nearly half the total number of holdings, situated in eight counties.  In the same eight counties, that is, in congested areas, we had on that date 55,200 holdings under £4 valuation; we had 51,800 more over £5 and under £10. That is to say, we had a grand total of 107,000 under £10 valuation in Connacht and in Kerry, Clare and Donegal.</P>
    <P>We go a little further, taking the rest of the country into consideration. The total number of holdings in the whole country, under £4 valuation, reached 124,500.  We had another 85,300 over £4 and under £10.  To clear away all the figures again, the total number of holdings on that date was 379,123 and of that total 209,800 were under £10 valuation.  It is admitted that no holding can be considered to be economic, to my knowledge, with the Land Commission unless it is at least £12 valuation and maybe good deal more.  That is to say, we have two-thirds of the holdings in the country to-day under £10 valuation. We have had 30 years of native Government, we have had different Governments and different Ministers and each Minister comes in here in turn to tell us on his annual Estimate the great work that has been accomplished in the previous 12 months.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ben Maguire spoke very clearly about the conditions that exist in the West of Ireland and I have no intention of following in his footsteps or repeating the arguments put up by him.  I am five years in this House now and every year when this Estimate comes up I am sick and tired impressing on whatever Minister is in office the need to get after the Land Commission and try to solve these problems. We hear talk from Ministers and ex-Ministers that the pool of land <Col N="199" /> available for the relief of congestion is becoming exhausted.  I heard the ex-Taoiseach on that here, when he rambled for hours on the land problem. If the Minister puts this knowledge into his mind, that wherever there is one acre of land available for purchase by an alien there is one acre available for the relief of congestion and if he takes that as his starting off point, he can remedy congestion and bring most of the holdings up to an economic level. We must have a complete close down on the purchase of land by aliens. What I say here are facts.  There are men to-day retired from the service of the Land Commission who have publicly declared, men whose word can be trusted, that in a few years over 100,000 acres of the finest land in the Midlands had passed into the hands of aliens and no Government did anything about it.  We have had Ministers for Finance of different Governments coming into the House and, mar dheadh, putting a purchase tax on land to prevent aliens coming in.</P>
    <P>How many would that prevent?  How many different combines came in in the last ten years and purchased big farms?  On how many occasions have I and other Deputies tried to extract from the Minister the exact figures as to the amount of land that has passed into the hands of aliens&mdash;and we cannot get the figures?  The reason I am saying this is that I want the Minister to be successful in his office and what I am saying here now is for the purpose of strengthening the Minister's hand.  If the Minister in the future shows promise and takes the right steps, he need not worry as far as I am concerned, as he will have my support and the criticism that I will levy will be as constructive as I can possibly make it.</P>
    <P>In the course of Deputy Tully's remarks he mentioned that a migrant from Galway or elsewhere was given 120 or 130 acres of land in County Meath.  The position there is quite clear, that that man gave up land to a similar valuation probably in the county from which he came, and the land in County Galway was used then to relieve congestion in that locality. It is an admitted fact that if you can <Col N="200" /> rearrange holdings in the area where the tenants live, leave them in their own surroundings, leave them amongst the people they know and live with, they will be better off and they will work better and make a success of the holdings they have.  But it is a much more economic proposition, when the question of moving people is brought in, if you can move one man and fix up seven in that area.  It is more economic to move him to Kildare than move seven families.  I see nothing wrong with moving a man from Galway to Meath if by removing him from his former locality we are able to fix up six or seven with economic holdings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig spoke in glowing terms of the work achieved by the Land Commission and he said&mdash;I am subject to correction in this&mdash;that over £1,500,000 had been spent on improvements in the last three years; that £1,500,000, in terms of money at the present time, was a tremendous sum. I think that we must take into consideration a Government&mdash;I am not criticising any Government in particular&mdash;prepared with a stroke of the pen to spend £600,000 on an air strip in Baldonnel, or £4,000,000 or whatever it is over a period of years on Dublin Castle; and other sums on the Bray road and on bus stations.  I am not criticising that expenditure, but then we have people coming along and criticising the expenditure of £1,500,000 on land improvements and suggesting: &ldquo;Now, you should be quite happy in the West and in the congested areas; there is £1,500,000 for you to spend on housing and roads and land improvements and that is enough for you.&rdquo;  That will not satisfy the people in the West.  They are only asking for their rights.  The day of raising the hat has, I hope, disappeared in this country, as also the day of bending the knee.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy Blowick means well.  However, when we talk about our key industry &mdash; agriculture &mdash; we should always bear in mind that the key to successful agriculture lies, to a great extent, in the hands of the Minister for Lands.  There is no point in talking in the West about the expansion of agriculture if the holdings <Col N="201" /> of the people are uneconomic. There is no use in talking to the man with a valuation of £6 and telling him that, by using more fertilisers, he will be able to keep another bullock along with the one which he has already. That will not give the man a living. An extra bullock will not provide such an increase in his income as will enable him to rear a family.  While the land settlement problem continues, alternative methods must be made use of by the Minister and his Department to provide these uneconomic holders with a living.  In that regard, I will reserve what I have to say until the next Estimate which, I assume, will be in relation to the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his Department.  I hope that, when he has had time to make a thorough reexamination of the affairs of his Department&mdash;after his three years' former experience as a Minister and after the rest which he has had between then and his resuming office now&mdash;he will embark with renewed vigour on a policy that will give the people living in these congested areas the confidence that, at long last, there is hope around the corner for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the existence of a natural economy for many centuries in this country, there is no more pressing need than the division of land in rural Ireland.  As the efforts of the Minister will be to give Irishmen and Irishwomen their proper place in an Irish economy, I would ask that he should also consider the proper place of our farm to be divided, or being considered for division, in an Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every factory must have a finishing shop, and, in these first remarks of mine, I want to direct attention to a certain type of farm which is mainly to be found in County Meath and County Kildare.  On the 1st July next, we are changing over in our cattle trade to the production of fat cattle, as distinct from the production of store cattle, for export to Britain.  During the war, the British farmer got a subsidy if he kept the cattle for three months.  From the 1st July next, that position will no longer exist and, as a result, we may <Col N="202" /> look forward to the resurgence of the fat cattle trade and a certain decline in the store cattle trade.</P>
    <P>There are farms in County Meath and County Kildare that are finishing shops.  I would ask the Minister to consider, when these farms are being considered for division, whether their place in the economy of Ireland is to feed for three months a bullock that has been fed, by Irish hands, on Irish cereals and Irish roots for the preceding two and a half years or whether that farm should be in the shape of ten smaller farms.  In my view, there are certain farms which should be kept in their entirety for this purpose and I think that that need will be emphasised within the next few months by the trend of the cattle trade.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter deeply.</P>
    <P>With regard to the compulsory acquisition of land, I believe that if a plebiscite were taken of the people who received holdings on any single large estate, and if they could say whether they would prefer to do without the land or to take it when it had been compulsorily acquired from an Irish national, they would indicate that they would prefer to do without it.  I hold and believe that the freedom of Ireland is bound up not only in the men and women of Ireland but also in the land of Ireland, as is proved by the fact that every man who fought for Ireland fought for the land.  Therefore, I would say that if the Minister would consider very deeply whether or not he should compulsorily acquire land he would be doing the right thing because the compulsory acquisition of land is a very powerful weapon or instrument in the hands of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Giles, I know of a certain widow of very small means and holding whose land was examined with a view to division because she was not working it.  That lady could not work her land.  If the Land Commission acquires it, she will receive only a few hundred pounds&mdash;certainly not more than £1,500.  However, if her land is left to her, she will derive from it a small pittance which, together with the results of her own industry in the way of poultry production and so forth. will enable her to live the rest of her <Col N="203" /> life in peace and comfort on her holding. Therefore, I would suggest that the compulsory acquisition of land should be embarked upon only in the last resort and that the Minister should consider looking for land where land is offered rather than where it is not wished by the owner that his land should be divided.</P>
    <P>I believe that land division is necessary but, like Deputy Giles and other Meath Deputies, I would ask that the claims of the local people be considered sympathetically when land is being divided in Leinster.  These local people have just as strong a claim as the people in the West.  They also are land hungry and have uneconomic holdings and, even if there is not quite as much congestion, I think an uneconomic holding in Leinster is exactly the same as an uneconomic holding in the West, even if the man in Leinster has not five or six neighbours in a similar uneconomic condition.  For these reasons, I would ask the Minister to consider these farms which are finishing shops and also to consider the need of the people in Leinster who are land hungry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will understand that I had nothing to do with the framing of this Estimate: it was framed long before the general election. Nevertheless, I think it is only fair to reply to some of the points that have been made during the course of this debate.  It seems to me that there is a good deal of misunderstanding regarding the work of the Land Commission despite explanations that have been given by myself from 1948 to 1951, and by my successor in the last Government.  If I repeat some of these explanations now, I hope that they will stay longer in the minds of some of the Deputies than would seem to have been the case in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the Meath Deputies seem to think that there is a constant stream of people from County Mayo up to County Meath.  Mayo has got only its normal quota, when we consider the number of holdings in it, of migrants' holdings all down through the years. For the past three years Deputy Derrig <Col N="204" /> was Minister for Lands, and for the preceding three and a half years I was the Minister for Lands.  Going backwards, from 1948 to 1944 Deputy Moylan was the Minister for Lands, and before that again we had Deputy Derrig, Deputy Boland, Deputy Aiken, Deputy Ruttledge&mdash;and I do not know how many more.  It is true that County Mayo seems to figure high, no matter where the Minister comes from, in the number of migrants' holdings.  The reason is quite plain.  Mayo was one of the most congested counties even if we go back to the Congested Districts Board days.  The second reason is that it is a very big county.  If not the third, it is the fourth largest county.  Even yet I am sorry to say that we still have in Mayo the highest percentage of holdings under £10 valuation in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I want to tell Deputies that, regardless of where the Minister for Lands comes from, if the Land Commission are to give a fair quota of their attention in the relieving of congestion to every county, the stream of migrants from Mayo for some years to come will still be larger than from any other county.  That is partly due to the fact that there is a high number of congested townlands in the county.  It is also due greatly to the fact that there are no big farms in Mayo to relieve congestion internally.  The few that were there were taken up by the Congested Districts Board long before this State was established.  The result is that in relieving congestion in Mayo the Land Commission must take into consideration moving migrants out of it.  That does not apply so much to Galway, Roscommon, Kerry, Clare, Donegal or any other of the congested counties.  They have a number of large farms which may be acquired by the Land Commission and a great deal of congestion can be relieved internally, so to speak.</P>
    <P>I hope that explanation will satisfy Deputies.  These are the facts, anyhow. If Deputies think that is not the case, I will be only too glad, if they table parliamentary questions to elicit that or any other information, to give the figures, or the Minister for Agriculture may also have certain figures at <Col N="205" /> his disposal that may perhaps settle the minds of Deputies.  It would appear, from what both Deputy Giles and Deputy Maguire stated, that Mayo is getting more than its fair share of migrants' holdings outside the County of Mayo.  That is a charge that I resent very much.  As a matter of fact, Deputy Moran, my colleague from South Mayo, during the three and a half years I was Minister before, always accused me of the very opposite&mdash;that I was attending to every other county more than I should and that I was neglecting my own County of Mayo.  However, facts speak for themselves, and I hope the facts I have given will help to ease the minds of Deputies who think that there is something unfair going on behind the scenes.</P>
    <P>County Meath Deputies seem to think that the Land Commission are determined to give no land to Meath people.  If I give them some figures I hope it will help to disabuse their minds of that.  Seventy-five per cent. of the total land that has been acquired for the relief of congestion in County Meath since the passing of the 1923 Act has been given to Meath allottees.</P>
    <P>I hope that will not come as too great a shock to Deputy Giles.  It may surprise some Deputies also to know that all down through the years, during the Cumann na nGaedheal time, the Fianna Fáil time, the inter-Party time, and the Fianna Fáil time again, 90 migrants from congested areas in North Meath were given holdings in South and East Meath.  I hope these figures will put an end to the talk that I have heard here and that was levelled against me when I was Minister before in the previous inter-Party Government along the lines that people from Meath do not get any land.  As I say, 75 per cent. of the total land acquired by the Land Commission was given to Meath people and only 25 per cent. to migrants from outside.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have been scrupulously careful, not alone in Meath but in every other county, as far as I can learn, always to consider the needs of local congests when a farm was about to be divided.  That is <Col N="206" /> as true of Donegal and Kerry as it is of Mayo and Meath.</P>
    <P>I think it is only fair to the commissioners and to the Minister to say that I absolutely disclaim any responsibility for what the commissioners do as these things were taken out of the hands of the Minister for Lands by an Act of this House and given exclusively to the commissioners to do.  It is laid down very clearly in the 1933 Act and again in the 1950 Act that certain things were taken from the Minister and given exclusively to the commissioners. We must remember that the Land Commissioners in carrying out certain duties are a court and they should be free from political influence or influence of any kind.  They are free from it.  But I refuse to accept responsibility for anything that the commissioners do.  That is not saying by any means that the commissioners are doing reckless or irresponsible things.  It is altogether wrong for Deputies to come here and charge the Minister with having done something wrong when in reality the commissioners have taken a decision after very careful consideration of all the facts.  We do not hear during the debate on the Department of Finance that the Civil Service Commissioners have done something wrong in the particular selections they make for filling Civil Service posts.  There may be 60 applicants and only six vacancies.  We do not hear the charge that the Civil Service Commissioners act unfairly or that they do something either reckless or irresponsible when they pick six particular applicants and the other 54 applicants have to go.  We do not hear any dissatisfaction being expressed.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, I cannot accept responsibility for these matters that have been handed over by this House, and rightly so, to the commissioners. If Deputies understood the work of the Land Commission a little bit more they might not be so quick in saying that the commissioners have acted wrongly in their decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> It may seem to us sometimes that their decisions are a little bit strange. Nevertheless, in all the long history of the different commissioners who are coming and going, not once has there been a charge of unfair treatment of a particular applicant or a charge of discrimination brought against the commissioners.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hilliard mentioned that some six migrants were stopped by an Order of the previous inter-Party Government.  There was never any such Order made by the inter-Party Government or the Fianna Fáil Government or the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  I do not know where the Deputy got that from because there was never such an Order.  I am sure Deputy Hilliard is aware that the selection of allottees is entirely a matter for the commissioners, through their inspectors on the spot, and, if some six proposed migrants were to be changed, the Minister has no power good, bad or indifferent to stop it.  I do not think even if the Minister made such an Order as the Deputy says he did, it would bind the commissioners. I think such an Order would be completely an overriding of Section 12 of the 1950 Act, and would not be legal. I do not believe they could act on such an Order, but the Deputy can take my assurance that neither by me nor any other Minister has any such Order been made.</P>
    <P>How would it work if made?  No Minister could make an Order like that which would apply to County Meath and not to other counties.  A great deal of the migration in many counties in the West is within the counties themselves, and if such an Order were made for Meath, it would have to apply to the whole country, and all internal movement so far as the Land Commission is concerned would have to come to a full stop in every county there and then.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of new Deputies, the selection of allottees, the particular lands to be acquired and the determination of the price of land are all matters deliberately taken away by statute from the Minister and given exclusively as functions to the commissioners <Col N="208" /> and to the commissioners only.  With that I fully agree and during the passage of the 1950 Act I gave my views on that subject, views which, I think, were fairly strong.  I have no doubt whatever about the situation that would arise if these things were taken back again and given into the Minister's hands.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig seemed to think that the 7,500 Congested Districts Board holdings not yet vested are mostly in the West.  I think I am safe in saying that most of the 19,000 unvested holding&mdash;a great proportion of them&mdash;are still in the western counties because that technical term within the Department, Congested Districts Board holdings, refers to the holdings that stood on estates which were purchased by the Congested Districts Board prior to the 1923 Act, but a vast number of estates in these western counties were purchased under the 1923 Act and a large proportion of the 19,000 unvested 1923 Act holdings must lie there.  I have not got the exact figures, but a large proportion must be there because a great portion of the area was still unpurchased at the time of the passing of the 1923 Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Maguire says that a lot of the acquired land is poor or waste land.  A certain proportion of practically every farm in the country is waste of a kind, and when the Land Commission takes over a farm they have no option but to take the bad with the good.  Surely it is not proposed that, when the Land Commission take over land or propose to acquire a farm compulsorily, they should take the good land and leave the bad.  They must take the whole lot and the result is that when it comes to giving out that land, it is not so easy to dispose of the bad as it is the good land, which often means that a certain sizeable acreage of poor land is left on the hands of the Land Commiss because the allottees are not too anxious to take it.  No one can blame them for that; it is one of the things that happen in the work of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Maguire also mentioned fences.  Personally, I am completely <Col N="209" /> opposed to the old sod fence, and Deputy Maguire is right when he says that it is not a fence.  It is not, because, from the day it is finished, it is crumbling and spreading and is an invitation to cattle, and particularly horned cattle, to poke at it in dry weather and pull it down.  Apart from that, it makes a perfect home for rabbits, rats and other pests.  I would much rather see a wire and paling fence take its place, even for external boundaries.  When I was Minister previously, I definitely discouraged the use of sod banks, as we call them, as much as possible.  If I mistake not, the Department of Agriculture, in relation to the land rehabilitation project, give grants for the knocking down, by bulldozing, of these fences and their replacement by wire and paling fences.  That is all to the good. While there is a certain amount of argument in favour of the sod bank for shelter purposes and for the sowing of quickset hedges under them, it has definite disadvantages, one of which is that in the making of it a great deal of useful land is stripped and rendered useless.  The width of these banks is six feet, so that they take up six feet of useful ground.  They do not make a good fence and they provide a shelter for pests and I am totally opposed to them.  I will see what can be done about the matter later.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked what is the policy of the Department.  The policy of this Government, as regards relieving congestion, is unchanged.  It can be stated very briefly&mdash;to push on as hard as possible with the relieving of congestion. That about sums it up.  The vesting of holdings is taking place, and, as I said in my opening speech, the number is down to a hard core of about 19,000 holdings, most of which must be improved in one way or another before they can be finally vested.  The huge lump of unvested holdings which came on hands as a result of the passage of the 1923 Act has been gradually thinned down over the past six or seven years to a surprisingly small number, so much so that some counties are now completely vested and only where congestion still arises and holdings are small, scattered, rundale or intermixed, there <Col N="210" /> exist these 19,000 unvested 1923 Act holdings and approximately 7,500 Congested Districts Board holdings.  Until these have been improved, we cannot say that the work is finished, and the policy can be described as pushing on with the relief of congestion as hard as possible.</P>
    <P>There is one last thing I want to say, and I have said it on previous occasions.  Some Deputies appear to be dissatisfied with the slowness of Land Commission work.  We must remember that the rights of private ownership cut across the work of the Land Commission very much.  When I say they cut across the work of the Land Commission, I do not mean to suggest that I object to it, because I am proud to see the farmers of this country standing up for their right which Michael Davitt and his colleagues of long ago fought for and got for them&mdash;the right to own the land of this country.  When the Land Commission moves in to tear a man by his roots out of his farm or holding, every single one of them contests it to the last ditch with the Land Commission. At present, and for some months past, the Land Commission are being brought up in the High Court or the Supreme Court in this connection, and we are awaiting a decision on a certain case there.</P>
    <P>All that means slow going for the Land Commission, that is, unless we adopt something which could be described as a Communist tendency, and proceed to grab farms, right, left and centre from everybody.  We have either to respect the rights of private ownership and allow the Land Commission, even though it is a State body, to dispossess a man of his property according to law, or to disregard all law and grab, left right and centre, as a certain country in Eastern Europe has done.  I do not advocate the latter course, because I am one of those who have very great respect for the rights of private ownership, and it sometimes puzzles me how responsible Deputies can go so very close to the border-line of danger in advocating speed.  I want to see as much speed as anybody, and sometimes the slowness entailed by the processes of law irritates me somewhat, but nevertheless, I would not by any <Col N="211" /> means advocate speeding up the work of the Land Commission at the expense of a lessening of the rights of private ownership of a single individual in the country.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £881,850 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946), including a Grant-in-Aid for acquisition of Land.</P>
      <P>The nett Forestry Estimate for 1954/55 at £1,272,850 shows an increase of £41,690 over the Estimate for 1953/54.  Of this nett increase £7,050 is due to reduced allowance for Appropriations-in-Aid and the balance £34,640 is the increase in the gross Estimate.  There are increases on all the significant expenditure sub-heads other than sub-head C (1) the Grant-in-Aid of the acquisition of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head A shows an increase of £32,560 for salaries, wages and allowances. This figure is misleading in so far as it takes no note of the sum of £10,360 transferred from the Vote for Increases in Remuneration in 1953/54; <Col N="212" /> almost all of the transferred sum would relate to salaries payable from sub-head A and the nett increase in sub-head A in 1954/55 is, therefore, only about £23,000.  Some of this increase in the provision follows from incremental rises in the salaries of individual officers but the majority is due to a provision of additional staff for the Secretariat and Accounts Branch, extra mapping staff and additional foresters necessary in connection with the regular growth of the State Forest service.  Some additional inspectorate staff has also to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Sub-head B&mdash;Travelling Expenses&mdash; shows an increase of £4,500.  The increase follows from the expansion in the number and size of forest units coupled with allowance for increased field staff.</P>
    <P>An increase of £7,190 on sub-head E (1), Forestry Education, is occasioned almost entirely by a bulk sum provision of £7,000 to meet charges which will fall upon this sub-head in consequence of new arrangements for the training of future forester staff which will come into operation this year.  The arrangements envisage the opening of a new practical training centre for forestry trainees at Kinnitty Castle.  The trainees will spend a year at this new practical training centre, and will spend the remaining two years of their course of training at the new school of forestry at Shelton Abbey, which will replace Avondale School.  Difficulties in placement of a contract by the Office of Public Works caused delay in the adaptation of Kinnitty Castle for its new use, but the work is now in hands and it should be possible to open the practical training centre there inside the next couple of months.  Structural work on Shelton Abbey is progressing satisfactorily, and it is hoped that the school of forestry will be transferred there early in 1955.  These new arrangements will enable the Department to discontinue the system under which forestry trainees were required to find their own board.  Trainees will in future receive full board and accommodation, with a personal allowance to meet incidental expenditure, whereas hitherto they were paid the local wage rates of forestry labourers, accommodation <Col N="213" /> alone being provided.  The provision of £7,000 provides for the extra cost to be incurred in the management of Shelton Abbey and Kinnitty Castle, the cost of board for the trainees and the payment to them of allowances; the figure does not, of course, cover a full year's expenditure. There is an offsetting saving on sub-head C (2) against which the wages of forestry trainees were hitherto charged.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head C (1), £163,000 was provided in the Vote for 1953-54 by way of Grant-in-Aid for the acquisition of land in addition to a balance of £9,393 carried forward from the previous year. The total available for 1953-54 was, therefore, £172,393.  Expenditure during that year amounted to £112,546 compared with £120,875 in 1952-53; the balance remaining in the fund on the 31st March, 1954, was £59,847.  The additional £135,000 now being sought will thus make available for this year a total of almost £195,000 which should be adequate to meet any expenditure foreseeable during the year.</P>
    <P>The total area acquired in 1953/54 was 20,443 acres compared with a total of 19,418 acres in 1952/53.  The final figure of plantable area acquired in 1953/54 has not yet been determined but it is expected to be a little greater than the 1952/53 figure of 16,784 acres.</P>
    <P>New forests were established during the year at Strokestown, County Roscommon; Tourmakeady, County Mayo; Ben Bulben, County Sligo, and Cuileagh, County Cavan.</P>
    <P>At the 1st April, 1954, title was being or had been established to 21,230 acres which the Department had agreed to buy compared with 23,260 acres at the commencement of 1953/54.  Negotiations were in hands for the purchase of a further 24,010 acres compared with 31,577 acres in 1953/54.  These figures exclude areas likely to be transferred from the Land Commission amounting at 1st April, 1954, to 498 acres apart from a further 3,398 acres awaiting inspection.</P>
    <P>The plantable reserve at the 1st April, 1953, was 37,925 acres.  The area of plantable land acquired last year exceeded the area planted during the year by about 5,000 acres and the plantable reserve at the 1st April, <Col N="214" /> 1954, was, therefore, approximately 43,000 acres.  I told the Dáil clearly when I was in office before that we must have a plantable reserve of more than three times the annual planting rate if we are to run forestry properly. Last year my predecessor went into great detail to explain to the Dáil the reasons for this plantable reserve and he stressed the importance of increasing it if new forestry development is to be put on a properly organised basis of nursery production governed by plant requirements known at the time of ordering and sowing the seed. I need hardly go further into this matter at the moment but the House must bear in mind that, while seeking to lay down new plantations at the maximum practicable rate consistent with this country's timber requirements, we must try to push ahead even more rapidly with the acquisition of land in order to bring the plantable reserve into more balanced relationship with the planting rate.</P>
    <P>Turning to sub-head C (2)&mdash;Forest Development and Maintenance, and sub-head C (3) (1)&mdash;Timber Conversion in State Forests, which between them bear the field costs in forest development and management, Deputies will find that the aggregate provision of £1,066,270 shows an increase of £31,750.  This increase, slightly over 3 per cent., is small having regard to the inevitable annual expansion of the volume of work in existing State plantations coupled with fresh planting. I am told that the volume of work to be undertaken during 1954-55 has proved greater than the provisions under these sub-heads will cover.  The whole matter was the subject of intensive examination in the Department before the new Government took office and the position is not yet fully clear. All I can tell the House at the moment with certainty is that current expectations in regard to work in the State forests this year indicate that the provisions in these sub-heads in the Estimate now before the House were undercast.  It seems that the difficulty is in part due to a greater incidence of wage increases in various counties than was anticipated when the Estimate was framed.  A contributory factor was that disappointing progress <Col N="215" /> with some aspects of work in the early part of last year suggested caution in estimation of the amount of work that it might be possible to overtake during 1954-55; that caution has since proved unwarranted.  Ample labour was available in the latter part of 1953-54 and the fall-off in progress in the early part of that year had been remedied before the close of the year. In the process the aggregate forest labour staff, which had approximated 3,700 men in the early part of 1953-54, was increased to the abnormally high level of 5,250 men at the annual peak period in mid-March, 1954.  During the past three months when some seasonal reduction in labour staffs would in any event have taken place, there has been a progressive reduction of staff to a current figure of a little over 4,300 men.  Even that reduced figure is in excess of the average for the year allowable within the framework of the Estimate now before the House.  The Estimate as drafted allowed for an average employment during the year of a little over 4,200 men as compared with the average of 4,175 men which the 1953-54 Estimate has been designed to cover.  Even the present reduced employment level is, therefore, higher than the average contemplated by the Estimate, whereas at this time of the year employment should be below average to allow for some increase during the busy winter period. I am assured that the present labour staffs are required for work which is essential to proper forest development and management.  The whole matter will have to be the subject of further close examination to see what savings elsewhere on the Vote can be made available to offset the excess charge on labour heads and, in the meantime, I can only put the Estimate before the House in its present form.</P>
    <P>Of the aggregate increase of £31,750 on sub-head C (2) and sub-head C (3) (1)&mdash;£29,000 relates to the provisions for labour and only £2,750 constitutes the nett addition to non-labour items.  Most of the non-labour items require no comment.  There is a reduction of £5,250 in the provision for cartage and freight under the head <Col N="216" /> of Capital Expenditure; this reduction is rendered possible by a saving secured by increased use of wheeled tractors and trailers for the cartage of road materials.  There is an increase of £5,000 in the provision for materials under the head of Constructional Expenditure; the additional amount is required for the purchase of artificial manures to assist new plantations on poor soils.  This particular head also bears the cost of fencing materials; an appreciable reserve stock of fencing materials was built up some years ago and it is intended this year to repeat last year's procedure of drawing heavily from this reserve stock, purchasing only materials of which there are inadequate stocks.  There is an increase of £5,500 in the provision for protection under the head of Maintenance but the increase is in the main due to a change in accounting procedure under which expenditure previously charged to the Maintenance Labour head will in future be charged as protection costs.</P>
    <P>Analysing the increase of £29,000 under Labour heads, it will be found that an additional £20,000 is provided for Capital Expenditure and £10,000 for Constructional Expenditure in sub-head C (2) while an extra £9,500 is provided in sub-head C (3) (1) for Timber Conversion in State Forests. These increases are offset in part by a reduction of £10,500 in the provision for the State Forest Nurseries.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the Labour provision for nurseries does not portend any contraction in nursery operations, the reduced figure is made possible by an alteration in practice in regard to the allocation between the various Labour heads of certain overhead expenditure related to holidays, payment for time lost due to inclement weather and so forth.  Charging procedure hitherto threw an excessive proportion of these overheads against nursery cost and that situation has now been remedied.  Nursery production is being continued this year on the same scale as in recent years, i.e., adequate to meet any increase in the planting rate to about 15,000 acres.  New seed beds laid down this spring were on that scale but there was a shortage of Pinus Contorta seed due to inadequate <Col N="217" /> supplies on world markets.  At this stage, it is impossible to say with certainty whether the shortage of supply of this species which figures largely in planting in recent years will create any difficulty in the maintenance of planting programmes in a couple of years' time.  There is a reasonable hope that the carry forward of stocks from the previous year's sowing may reduce the deficiency sufficiently to obviate any interference with planting progress.</P>
    <P>Part of the provision under the head of Capital Expenditure relates to the construction of new forest roads.  This work has had to receive much greater attention in recent years to facilitate the extraction of thinnings.  In 1952-53 about 50 miles of new roads were laid down compared with a much smaller mileage in any previous year.  Last year the construction of about 70 miles of new roads was contemplated.  Progress on this work in particular was very slow in the early part of the year but a total of about 66 miles of new roads was achieved by the close of the year. In view of the slow progress in the earlier part of last year, it was deemed inadvisable when preparing the 1954-55 Estimate to allow for any increase in work under this head over the level contemplated by the 1953-54 Estimate and provision was ultimately made on a slightly smaller scale than last year. It is now clear that provision for a further increase in the volume of this work in 1954-55 would have been desirable.</P>
    <P>Apart from a small sum for building construction the remainder of the labour provision under the head of Capital Expenditure is concerned with the preparation and drainage of ground for planting and the increased provision under the head save in so far as it allows for higher wage rates is related to this aspect of the work.  This increase and the additional provision for labour under the head of constructional expenditure is intended to meet a projected increase in the planting rate.  As I have already stated, the plantable reserve at 1st April, 1954, amounted to approximately 43,000 acres compared with 38,000 acres 12 months previously.  This improved <Col N="218" /> reserve will enable the planting rate to be increased this year above the 12,500 acre limit applied in the last two planting seasons.  It will be possible in the coming season to plant 13,500 acres. As to the future, every effort will be made to build up the plantable reserve upon which planting over the next three, four, or even five years depends with a view to attaining the maximum possible planting rate.</P>
    <P>The provision for labour under the head of maintenance is the same as in 1953/54.  In that year the provision had been increased appreciably to ensure against a repetition of the underestimation of requirements under this head which had been experienced over a number of previous years.  In the outturn it transpired that the increased provision last year was somewhat greater than was needed and it was considered possible to limit the provision in 1954-55 to the same level as in 1953/54, notwithstanding the progressive increase in the volume of maintenance work with the growth in the area of plantations.  Work contemplated for the year includes the weeding and pruning of about 12,400 acres of plantations approaching the thinning stage compared with 11,150 acres in 1953-54.  The area of young plantation requiring cleaning should prove slightly greater than in 1953/54 when 56,500 acres were handled.  Replacement of failures in young plantations over an area of 10,350 acres is contemplated; 12,370 acres were dealt with in 1953-54 and this work is now fairly well up to date.</P>
    <P>Of the provision of £122,500 for labour under the head of timber conversion in State forests, approximately £95,000 relates to thinning operations and the increase in the provision is concerned with this aspect of the work.  In 1953-54 slightly under 8,000 acres of plantations were thinned compared with 7,750 acres in the previous year.  It is hoped to thin up to 9,000 acres in 1954-55.</P>
    <P>Turning now to sub-head C (3) (2) under which provision is made for the operation of fixed sawmills, I am glad to be able to report to the House that the new sawmill at Cong, County Mayo, commenced work last month <Col N="219" /> The total provision under the head of Sawmilling is £5,000 lower than in 1953-54.  The decrease in expenditure follows from the completion of construction work at Cong.  Apart from a small sum to cover some outstanding expenditure at Cong mill, the provision for 1954-55 is limited to the ordinary running costs of that mill and the sawmill at Dundrum, County Tipperary.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on sub-head D in respect of Grants for Afforestation purposes amounted to £3,022 in 1953-54 compared with £2,550 in the previous year.  First instalments of grants in respect of 55 new plantations totalling 360 acres were paid.  These figures seem to afford some evidence of increasing public interest in the Scheme of Grants and allowance has been made for a further increase in expenditure to £3,500 in 1954-55.  Sub-head E (2)&mdash;Exhibits at Shows&mdash;and sub-head F&mdash;Agency Advisory and Special Services&mdash;require no comments. The provisions under both sub-heads are the same as in 1953-54.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head G is higher by £1,100 than in 1953-54. When the 1953-54 Estimate was before the Dáil, it was explained that the provision under this sub-head for that year was likely to prove inadequate, an additional amount having to be provided in a Supplementary Estimate in the previous year.  The actual total of expenditure in 1953/54 exceeded £2,400 and the provision for 1954-55 is therefore if anything still on the low side.  Expenditure on advertising is the heaviest item of charge under this sub-head and the cost of advertising has been swollen in recent years by the need for increased publicity in regard to the danger of forest fires.</P>
    <P>The allowance made for Appropriations-in-Aid in sub-head H is £7,000 lower than in 1953-54.  Total receipts in that year amounted to £166,340, falling almost £4,000 short of expectations. With some uncertainty in the timber market it was considered advisable to allow in 1954-55 for a reduction of £10,000 in the possible receipts <Col N="220" /> from sales of timber, but this reduction is offset in part by anticipation of an increase in sawmill receipts.  The allowance for sawmill receipts in the 1953-54 Estimate assumed that the new sawmill at Cong would be in operation for portion of the year.  This year it is possible to allow for almost a full year's operation at that mill, but the mill will naturally not reach full production in its early stages.  It is customary before concluding introduction of a Forestry Estimate to refer to the Department's control of tree felling on private lands under the provisions of the Forestry Act, 1946.  The only matter of note in this regard in relation to the past year was the pleasing fact of a significant reduction in the number of cases of felling in contravention of the provisions of the Act reported to the Department.  Only 51 such cases were brought to the attention of the Department, compared with 124 in the previous year.  In 34 cases it was considered necessary to prosecute and in all but two of these cases convictions were obtained.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £142,900 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Gaeltacht Services, including Housing Grants.</P>
      <P>The current year's Estimate shows an increase of £93,400 over that of last year and it will be observed that this increase is mainly due to an increase in the amount necessary for the purchase of manufacturing materials for the rural industries.</P>
      <P>The activities of the Gaeltacht Services Division to which I shall refer in this statement are the rural industries, the marine products industries and the administration of the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-heads D (1) to D (8) show an increase of more than £100,000 in the provision for the rural industries as <Col N="221" /> against the amount provided last year but account must be taken of the fact that at the beginning of last year the division had on hands a reserve of manufacturing and other materials, valued at approximately £86,000. These materials were used during the year and there was no corresponding reserve on hands at the beginning of the current year.  Therefore the true increase in provision for the rural industries is approximately £14,600.</P>
    <P>Provision for the purchase of machinery for the various rural industries is made under sub-head D (1). Approximately a quarter of this provision is for the maintenance of the machinery at present in use in the various centres but about £24,000 is being provided for new machinery and of this amount some £13,000 is intended for machinery for the spinning mill at Kilcar and for the manufacture of weaving looms to be installed in the mart which is at present being built in Glencolumkille.  It may be mentioned here that the position of the handwoven tweed industry continues to improve as foreign markets are being developed and that the total sales of these tweeds by Gaeltarra Éireann increased from about £110,000 in 1952-53 to more than £170,000 in 1953-54.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D (2) which provides for the purchase of manufacturing materials, shows an increase of more than £97,000 but when one takes into account the fact that more than £84,000 worth of reserve stock was available at the beginning of last year it will be seen that the true increase in provision is about £13,000.</P>
    <P>Of this increase about £12,000 is due to increased provision of manufacturing materials for the handwoven tweed industry.</P>
    <P>The provision for fuel for the tweed industry, which is being made under sub-head D (4), shows a decrease of some £1,400.  This saving has been made possible by the provision of E.S.B. current to the Kilcar Spinning Mill which has reduced fuel costs considerably.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the provision for freight which is being made for the tweed industry is more than double <Col N="222" /> that which had been made last year. It was found during the last 12 months that the provision of £3,000 was quite inadequate for the despatch of the large quantities of tweeds which were being exported to America and the Continent of Europe.</P>
    <P>While the provision for advertising and publicity shows a reduction as against last year's Estimate, the amount actually spent last year was just under £7,000 and consequently this year's provision of £8,000 is considered to be adequate.</P>
    <P>Provision for payment of wages of workers in the rural industries is made under sub-head H since these workers are paid out of receipts.  Payment is mostly by piece rate and consequently it depends on the output of the workers themselves.  The total estimated payment for the current year is £112,000 which is the largest sum that has ever been provided for wages of workers in the rural industries and exceeds last year's provision by nearly £20,000.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E makes provision for the marine industries which comprise mainly the purchase of sea-roads and other seaweeds from gatherers around the western coast, and the development of the carrageen industry.</P>
    <P>The sea-rods and certain other types of seaweed are sold to the firm of Alginate Industries (Ireland) Limited.  The State has a controlling interest in this company, holding more than half the shares, and the accounts of the company for the year ended on the 30th September, 1953, were laid on the Table of the House in February last.</P>
    <P>The sum provided for the purchase of sea-rods and seaweeds this year is £16,175, as against £19,800 provided for this purpose last year.  The reduction is due to the fact that purchases of sea-rods must be adjusted according to the requirements of Messrs.  Alginate Industries, Limited.  There is no alternative market for these products. The sum provided for the purchase of carrageen, namely £2,750, is the same as that provided for this purpose last year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F shows an increase of £8,500 in the provision for grants to <Col N="223" /> be paid under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.  There has been an increase in housing activities as compared with the position a year ago, and more houses are now in course of erection and more are being improved.  In addition, the Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Act, 1953, provided for grants for special extensions to dwelling-houses and for the provision of water and sewerage, and these grants are now being availed of.</P>
    <P>Receipts are dealt with under sub-head H, and it is expected that a total sum of £425,000 will be received this year from the sales of products of the rural industries.  This sum exceeds the total which was expected according to last year's Estimate by more than £55,000.  The expected fall of some £6,000 in the receipts from the sale of seaweeds and sea-rods follows the decrease in the expenditure which is expected in the case of these products.</P>
    <P>In this statement I have referred especially to the progress which has been made in the development of the markets for handwoven tweeds but I would like to mention also that a general improvement is evident in the case of all the rural industries.  In 1952 the knitwear industry went through a very difficult period and the workers had to be employed on a half-time basis during most of the year but subsequently there was a great improvement in conditions and that improvement has been maintained.</P>
    <P>The toy industry is also showing satisfactory progress and sales of toys increased by more than £10,000 last year as against the sales made in the preceding year.  Last year's sales figure of £74,967 is the highest on record.  It is hoped that these favourable conditions will continue during the present year.</P>

      <P>Ní dóigh liom gur gá dhom mórán a rá ach ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don mhéadú atá tagtha ar an margadh do bhréidíní. Tá súil agam go leanfaidh sé ar aghaidh ós rud é go gcuireann sé daoine ag obair, go mór mhór i gContae Dhún na nGall.  Ní rabhas sa Tigh nuair do <Col N="224" /> thosnaigh an tAire ar a ráiteas, ach is dóigh liom gur dhein sé tagairt do chúrsaí tithíochta is feamna.  Tá dul chun cinn déanta sna rudaí sin leis agus tá súil agam go leanfaidh sé.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to speak at any length on this Estimate.  The most noteworthy factor in last year's activities in relation to the Gaeltacht Services Division was the welcome increase that has taken place in regard to the sale of tweeds.</P>
      <P>I think that is a trend that will continue for many years to come.  As well as I recollect, the Minister, in the course of his statement, said that the sales of tweeds during the past year have been the highest ever in the history of the division.  It would be rather presumptuous of me if I tried to claim any credit for that during my administration of this particular office. I realise quite well that world trends and world fashions had much to say in that respect because our increased sales have been due to the fact that the tweeds manufactured in the Gaeltacht, particularly by the factories and by the outdoor workers in the Gaeltacht Services Division, have now established for themselves a very high place in the fashion markets of the world.  That is a trend which, I hope, will continue.  It is one that will call for the very highest standards of workmanship in order to meet the demand in sufficient quantities.  The market is largely found in America and also in some European countries. There is a saying&mdash;I do not know who was the originator of it&mdash;that, to meet and maintain the American &ldquo;one has to deliver yesterday for orders placed to-day.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, unfortunately, is one of the main difficulties in the Gaeltacht Services Division.  As the Minister knows, the principal factory is the one in Kilcar, and it has been adapted and expanded to meet the demands made on it.  Shortly before this Government left office proposals were in hand for the improvement of many of the Gaeltacht Services factories.  I hope that nothing will prevent these improvements being carried out because, as the Minister knows, without <Col N="225" /> giving the workers the very best facilities with which to work it will be very difficult for them to meet the demand.</P>
    <P>With regard to the seaweed industry, it is unfortunate that there has been a falling off in the demand for sea-rods.  That, too, has been dictated by world demands.  The Minister may remember that, in the course of the first debate that I handled on that side of the House, I mentioned the possible development and use of ascophyllum.  He probably has already discovered that a start was made last summer in that direction, and that the result of the manufacture and marketing of seaweed meal has been very encouraging in the past year.  Hence, as long as the sea-rod industry is rather in the doldrums there is there at least a very good alternative.  In fact, it might well be that it is a better alternative, or, perhaps, I should say a better avenue in regard to production than the sea-rods, which was the original industry in that line when that work started in the Gaeltacht Services Division.</P>
    <P>With regard to Gaeltacht housing, I think that the progress made has been fairly satisfactory.  The new departure made under the last Gaeltacht Housing Act in regard to providing grants for additional accommodation to houses in the Gaeltacht, as well as for the installation of sewerage and water services, has met with a very good initial response from Gaeltacht householders, so far as these particular services are concerned.  As the Minister knows, the primary object of that Act was to create better and more facilities for the people going to the Gaeltacht areas, particularly for those going there to learn the language.  In the past, one of the big problems in regard to organising these summer courses in Irish was related to the inadequacy of facilities for lodging the young students who went to those areas to learn the language.  A start has now been made in the hope that householders in the Gaeltacht will be enabled to provide more adequate accommodation for these young students.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more that I could usefully say at this <Col N="226" /> stage in addition to what the Minister has already said, except to express the hope that the boom in the tweed industry to which he has referred will continue, and that the improved facilities which had been planned for the Gaeltacht Services factories will be allowed to continue.  I hope that the Minister will, if possible, ensure that the greatest expedition will take place in the execution of that work.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the output of Gaeltacht tweeds and said that the market is largely found for them in America, Austria and Germany.  I think that this nation should not be dependent alone on these markets for the Gaeltacht tweeds made by the residents of the Gaeltacht.  In view of the fact that the people working in the Gaeltacht factories have now achieved a world-wide reputation for these products, our people at home should make greater use of them.  We should make sure, if we are serious at all in trying to rehabilitate the Gaeltacht and in providing work for the people there, that our people at home will do their part by demanding as many of these Gaeltacht-made articles as they can possibly use.  It is very important, and will be more important in the event of any falling-off in world demands, that the home market should be extended to the utmost extent. There is need in that respect for goodwill and co-operation between those in the western districts and the people in our towns and cities.  I should say that without that co-operation it will not be possible to ensure that the degree of employment given in the industry will be maintained over a long period. I will conclude by expressing the sincere hope that the Minister will do his best to expand the foreign markets and, in particular, the home market for Gaeltacht tweeds.</P>

An mírcheann deireannach seo (D.D.), is é atá ann, ná an tríú tráthchuid, is é sin, an tráth-chuid deiridh, den íocaíocht <i>ex gratia</i> a deineadh, i bhfoirm cnap-shuime leis na hoidí seo ar phinsean a bhí éirithe as an tseirbhís sul ar ceadaíodh an chnap-shuim ón lú lá d'Eanáir, 1950, d'oidí a bhí le héirí as seirbhís i ndiaidh an dáta sin.  An méid breise i gcóir tuarastal oidí agus deontaisí do scoileanna caipitíochta, is é is cúis leis sin ná an méadú ar líon na ndaltaí scoile le roint bhlian anuas. Le tamall de bhlianta roimh 1947 bhí uimhir na ndaltaí ar rollaí scoileanna náisiúnta ag laghdú in aghaidh na bliana.  Ar an 30ú lá de Mheitheamh sa mbliain sin, 1947, 453,428 an uimhir iomlán a bhí ar rollaí na scoileanna náisiúnta.  Ó shin i leith, ámh, tá an uimhir ag méadú do réir a chéile.  Ar an 30ú lá de Mheitheamh, 1953, 484,364 an uimhir a bhí ar na Rollaí, sin méadú de os cionn 30,000 ó 1947.  Meastar go leanfar den mhéadú ar líon na ndaltaí scoile go ceann tamaill eile; ach do réir an laghdú atá le tabhairt fá ndeara le déanaí ó thaobh an líon leanaí atá á saolú is dealraitheach go sroisfidh an líon daltaí ar rollaí na scol an barr-phointe laistigh de chupla blian.  An meán-tinnreamh laethúil i rith na scoilbhliana darbh críoch an 30ú lá de Mheitheamh, 1953 b'ionann é agus percentáiste 85.6 den mheán <Col N="229" /> ar na rollaí.  B'shin an percentáiste is airde a sroiseadh fós.</P>
    <P>Tá fadhbh ann i dtaobh dóthain oidí a chur ar fáil; ach ní miste tagairt i dtús báire do mhí-thuigsint atá ann, do réir dealraimh, mar gheall air sin.  Ní easpa iarrthóirí cáilithe i gcóir na gColáistí Oiliúna fá ndear an ganntanas oidí: is amhlaidh nach bhfuil dóthain cóiríochta ins na Coláistí Oiliúna féin chun freastal ar riachtanaisí na scol.  Is aoibhinn liom a rá, ámh, gur tharla trí chineáltas agus comhoibriú a Ghrásta, Ardeaspóg Áth Cliath, agus Údaráis Coláiste Oiliúna Baintiarna na Trócaire, An Charraig Dhubh, gurb féidir socrú a dhéanamh roinnt mí ó shoin chun an Coláiste a mhéadú agus cóiríocht a sholáthar ann do ó chéad go chéad is fiche d'abhair múinteóirí sa mbreis, i dtreo is go mbeidh méadú de chaoga nó seasca in aghaidh na bliana ar uimhir na mban-oidí oilte feasta.  Tá an obair togála sa Choláiste go maith chun cinn cheana féin, agus meastar go nglacfar an chéad dream de na micléinn bhreise isteach sa Choláiste i Mí Meán-Fomhair seo chugainn.  Tá slite eile á scrúdú leis d'fhonn breis oidí a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Chuaigh an chéad scéim Idir-réitigh agus Eadrána d'Oidí Náisiúnta as feidhm i ndeireadh Mí Feabhra, 1952, agus níl aon scéim i bhfeidhm ó shoin i leith.  Chuireas in iúl an lá cheana do Chumann na n-Oidí gur mian liom, chomh luath agus bheidh téarmaí scéime nua socair, an scéim sin a chur i bhfeidhm láithreach.</P>
    <P>Ag trácht dom ar an Vóta d'Oifig an Aire, dheineas tagairt do leathnú na scéime chun Scoileanna Náisiúnta a thógaint.  Íoctar costas na seirbhíse sin as an Vóta i gcóir Oibreacha agus Foirgintí Poiblí, ach is ag an Roinn seo agamsa a déantar cuid mhór den réamh-obair a bhaineas leis an ngnó seo.  Obair phráinneach a bhfuil tábhacht leis don náisiún is ea scoileanna nua a thógaint in ionad seanscoileanna mí-oiriúnacha.  Ní mheasaim go mbeidh éinne i gcoinnibh pé socraithe a bheidh riachtanach chun foirgintí nua taithneamhacha a chur ar fáil.  An méid atá déanta chuige sin im Roinnse agus in Oifig na <Col N="230" /> n-Oibreacha Poiblí beidh, tá súil agam, toradh fónta air fiú amháin i mbhana féin.</P>
    <P>Bhóta 41.&mdash;Meán-Oideachas.</P>
    <P>Sé tá sa mheastachán le haghaidh an Vóta seo ná iomlán £1,689,870 glan.  Tá san £312,470 sa bhreis ar a raibh chuige anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Is iad seo a leanas na cúiseanna atá leis an ardú:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  an t-ardú i rátaí an Deontais Chaipitíochta atá iníoctha leis na scoileanna;</P>
    <P>(2)  an méadú gan staonadh ar líon na ndaltaí ins na Meán-Scoileanna agus méadú dá bharr san ar mhéid na ndeontaisí is iníoctha leis na scoileanna;</P>
    <P>(3)  an bhreis atá tagaithe ar lion na n-iarrthóirí atá ag dul fé na Scrúdúcháin Teistiméireachta agus an méadú, dá thoradh sin, ar líon na nIonad Scrúdúcháin, ar líon na bhFeitheoirí agus na bhFo-Scrúdaitheoirí a theastaíonn chun na hoibre;</P>
    <P>(4)  an bhreis san iomlán de ranga go bhfuil deontaisí speisialta iníoctha astu de bharr Eolaíocht, Eolaíocht Talmhaíochta, Eolaíocht Tís agus Adhmadóireacht a theagasc iontu;</P>
    <P>(5)  an méadú ar a bhfuil de mhúinteoirí fostuithe ins na scoileanna agus breisthuarastal á fháil acu agus an riachtanas atá le soláthar a dhéanamh le haghaidh incrimintí breise a chur ar fáil, laistigh de réim na scálaí, do na múinteoirí atá sa tseirbhís cheana féin.  I láthair na huaire, as a bhfuil de mhúinteoirí ann agus breisthuarastal acu, níl ach an tríú cuid díobh go bhfuil an pointe is airde sroiste acu ina gcuid scálaí ar seach.</P>
    <P>Tá ag leanúint ar mhéadú do dhul ar líon na ndaltaí atá ag freastal ar na Meán-Scoileanna.  Tá méadaithe ar an líon san ón 30,966 a bhí iontu sa bhliain 1932-33 go dtí 54,040 sa bhliain 1953-54.  Tá an líon deireannach féin sin 1,951 níos aírde ná líon na bliana 1952-53.</P>
    <P>Progress reported.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, June 16th, 1954.</P>
